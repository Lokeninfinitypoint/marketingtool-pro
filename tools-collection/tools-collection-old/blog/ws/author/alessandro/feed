										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you finding it challenging to manage every detail of your Google Ads campaigns manually? Bidding on individual keywords and constantly adjusting them based on performance used to be the norm in digital advertising. But in today’s fast-paced landscape, this manual approach has become outdated. With so many variables—such as competition fluctuations and user behavior shifts—staying on top of everything can feel overwhelming.</p>
<p>That’s where Google’s Smart Bidding comes in. By leveraging machine learning, Smart Bidding optimizes bids in real time, and this data-driven approach helps you achieve your goals without the hassle of manual bid adjustments, ensuring you get the best possible results for your budget.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll explore different Google Ads Smart Bidding strategies, provide examples, and explain when to use and avoid each based on your campaign goals.</p>

<h2>What is Smart Bidding?</h2>
<p>Smart bidding is a form of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-automated-bidding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automated bidding</a>. It leverages machine learning to automatically select bids on keywords or placements for you in the Google Ads or Microsoft Ads auctions based on a specific conversion goal. Smart Bidding is constantly optimizing your bids, automatically adjusting them based on factors like competition, device, time of day, and user intent.</p>
<h3>How is Smart Bidding different from regular automated bidding?</h3>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-automated-bidding">other automated bidding strategies</a> outside of the four Smart Bidding strategies we’ll cover, like Maximize Clicks or Viewable CPM. These aren’t considered Smart Bidding because they’re focused on campaign metrics rather than campaign outcomes.</p>
<p>The reason why Smart Bidding strategies are “special” is that they focus on your conversion events or conversion value tracking.</p>

<h3>How is Smart Bidding different from manual bidding?</h3>
<p>With manual bidding, you have to individually select a max CPC bid for each keyword or placement you’re bidding on. With automated bid strategies, including Smart Bidding, this work is done for you automatically.</p>

<div id="what-is-smart-bidding-exploration"></div>
<h2>What is Smart Bidding Exploration?</h2>
<p>At <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-marketing-live-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Marketing Live 2025</a>, Google announced the rollout of an extension of Smart Bidding called Smart Bidding Exploration. You can apply Smart Bidding Exploration to any of the strategies we covered above. If you have a Smart Bidding strategy selected, you can toggle Smart Bidding Exploration on or off in its designated dropdown. This allows Smart Bidding to predict how likely you are to convert in each ad auction, even if you haven&#8217;t entered these auctions previously, and it may automatically lower or exceed your ROAS targets accordingly.</p>

<div id="why-use-smart-bidding"></div>
<h2>Why use Smart Bidding?</h2>
<p>Regardless of your account structure or business size, you’re eligible to use Smart Bidding. Let’s look at some of the benefits:</p>
<p><b>Smart Bidding&#8230;</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Helps you save time.</b> As your account scales and evolves, manually managing your bidding can take up a ton of time.</li>
<li><b>Can save you money.</b> Smart Bidding takes the guesswork out of assigning your max CPC bids, so you know you’re getting the most optimized cost per click or conversion possible every time.</li>
<li><b>Is likely used by your competitors.</b> Smart Bidding has grown in popularity over the last few years, and now <b>more than <a href="https://business.google.com/us/ad-tools/bidding/">80%</a> of Google Ads accounts</b> have some form of Smart Bidding activated.</li>
<li><b>Might be the only bid option you have.</b> Some campaign types, like Performance Max campaigns, are only compatible with Smart Bidding.</li>
<li><b>Helps you reach your goals.</b> Smart Bidding strategies are focused on your business’s bottom line by aligning with your conversion event and conversion value tracking.</li>
</ul>

<div id="smart-bidding-strategies"></div>
<h2>4 Google Ads Smart Bidding strategies (+when and how to use them)</h2>
<p>Here are the four Smart Bidding strategies to help you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/losing-money-in-google-ads">get more out of your budget</a> and what you need to know about each. Let’s dive in!</p>
<ul></ul>
<div id="target-roas"></div>
<h3>1. Target ROAS (return on ad spend)</h3>
<p>Target ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) aims to generate the highest possible return on your ad spend by automatically adjusting bids based on the predicted value of each conversion.</p>
<p>This strategy optimizes bids to focus on conversions that drive the most revenue rather than just increasing the number of conversions. It’s ideal for businesses looking to prioritize revenue generation over conversion volume.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/smart-bidding-target-roas-e1755285793751.webp" alt="target roas smart bidding strategy" width="798" height="424" class="aligncenter wp-image-87792 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/smart-bidding-target-roas-e1755285793751.webp 798w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/smart-bidding-target-roas-e1755285793751-480x270.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 798px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>Important note:</strong> You can’t simply set a high ROAS target and expect to hit it if you haven’t achieved similar performance in the past. Google Ads will suggest a ROAS target based on your historical data. When setting your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/02/target-roas">target ROAS</a>, it’s crucial to choose a realistic goal that aligns with your past performance.</p>
<p>For example, if <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-chrome-sale">Google</a> suggests a ROAS target of 300% based on your past results, this means for every $1 you spend, the goal is to generate $3 in revenue. By setting this realistic target, Google Ads will adjust bids to maximize the likelihood of hitting or exceeding that target consistently.</p>
<p><strong>When to use it:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ecommerce Sales:</strong> If your goal is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/promotion-ideas">maximize sales value</a> while maintaining a profitable return on investment.</li>
<li><strong>Profit-driven campaigns:</strong> When your primary goal is revenue generation and you can attribute a value to each conversion.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When to avoid it:</strong> If you&#8217;re unsure about the value of each conversion or have a low volume of conversions, it may not perform as expected.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Worried you&#8217;re wasting spend in Google Ads?</strong> Find out with a free, instant audit using our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Google Ads Performance Grader</a>.</p>
<div id="target-cpa"></div>
<h3>2. Target CPA</h3>
<p>Target CPA (Cost Per Acquisition) sets bids to help get as many conversions as possible at or below your specified target cost per acquisition.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/smart-bidding-target-cpa-e1755285757813.webp" alt="smart bidding target cpa strategy" width="781" height="314" class="aligncenter wp-image-87793 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/smart-bidding-target-cpa-e1755285757813.webp 781w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/smart-bidding-target-cpa-e1755285757813-480x270.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 781px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>Important note:</strong> Similar to ROAS, you can’t simply set an arbitrary CPA target if you haven’t achieved that cost before. Google Ads uses your historical performance to suggest a realistic CPA.</p>
<p><strong>When to use it:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lead generation:</strong> If your goal is to acquire new leads at a specific cost.</li>
<li><strong>Tight budget control:</strong> When you have a clear understanding of how much a lead is worth to your business and need consistent costs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When to avoid it:</strong> If your conversion volume is too low, target CPA might struggle to find enough data to optimize effectively.</p>
<div id="maximize-conversions"></div>
<h3>3. Maximize conversions</h3>
<p>Maximize conversions is an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/19/google-ads-automated-bidding">automated strategy</a> that sets bids to get the most conversions possible within your daily budget.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/smart-bidding-maximize-conversions-e1755285735556.webp" alt="google ads maximize conversions smart bidding strategy" width="761" height="302" class="aligncenter wp-image-87794 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/smart-bidding-maximize-conversions-e1755285735556.webp 761w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/smart-bidding-maximize-conversions-e1755285735556-480x270.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 761px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>When to use it:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited budget:</strong> When you want to spend your entire budget to get as many conversions as possible.</li>
<li><strong>High-volume goals:</strong> When the goal is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-generation-ideas">increase the volume of leads</a>, sales, or sign-ups.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When to avoid it:</strong> If your goal is profitability or you have strict CPA or ROAS targets.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/26a1.png" alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Is your Google Ads account set up for success?</strong> Download now &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLAccountStructure.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_LastAccountStructureGuide_Download">The Last Guide to Google Ads Account Structure You&#8217;ll Ever Need</a></p>
<div id="maximize-conversion-value"></div>
<h3>4. Maximize conversion value</h3>
<p>This strategy sets bids to maximize the total value of conversions (e.g., sales revenue).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/smart-bidding-maximize-conversion-value.webp" alt="google ads maximize conversion value smart bidding strategy" width="846" height="374" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87795" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/smart-bidding-maximize-conversion-value.webp 846w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/smart-bidding-maximize-conversion-value-480x212.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 846px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>When to use it:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sales value focused:</strong> If you&#8217;re running ecommerce campaigns and want to prioritize high-value conversions.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic products/services:</strong> When conversion values vary significantly between products or services.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When to avoid it:</strong> If you do not track or assign values to your conversions.</p>
<div id="how-to-get-started"></div>
<h2>How to get started with Smart Bidding</h2>
<p>You can start using Smart Bidding by navigating to your <b>campaign settings</b> and selecting one of the Smart Bidding options under the <b>bidding</b> section.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/smart-bidding-selection.png" alt="smart bidding - selecting a smart bidding strategy" width="798" height="361" class="aligncenter wp-image-93572 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/smart-bidding-selection.png 798w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/smart-bidding-selection-480x217.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 798px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Note that depending on your campaign type, you may or may not see all four Smart Bidding options here.</i></p>
<h3>1. Solidify your conversion and value tracking</h3>
<p>Your conversion tracking, as well as your conversion value tracking, can be critical to your Smart Bidding success.</p>
<h3>2. Consider all your Smart Bidding strategy options</h3>
<p>Choosing the right Smart Bidding strategy is crucial for achieving your goals. You may need to test a few strategies across campaigns.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use target CPA when you want to control your cost per acquisition.</li>
<li>Choose target ROAS to maximize the value of each conversion.</li>
<li>Implement maximize conversions if volume is your top priority.</li>
<li>Opt for maximize conversion value if revenue is more important than the number of conversions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Track and measure success</h3>
<p>Although Smart Bidding is automated, don’t just set it and forget it. Use Google Ads and Microsoft Ads reporting tools to track performance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/google-ads-smart-bidding-insights.jpg" alt="smart bidding - insights screenshot" width="924" height="462" class="aligncenter wp-image-93571 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/google-ads-smart-bidding-insights.jpg 924w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/google-ads-smart-bidding-insights-480x240.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 924px, 100vw" /></p>

<div id="target-holiday-search-themes"></div>
<h3>1. Target holiday-specific search themes</h3>
<p><span><span>Focus on capturing holiday-related search intent by identifying<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/11/search-themes-for-performance-max-campaigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Performance Max search themes</a> that spike during the festive season. Use Performance Max’s insights (and the new <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-max-for-search">AI Max for Search</a>) to discover trending themes like “best holiday gifts,” “seasonal offers,” or industry-specific phrases. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For businesses that provide services rather than products, try incorporating themes such as “holiday booking,” “year-end consultation,” or “seasonal discounts.” In your new seasonal asset group, be sure to adjust the visuals, headlines, descriptions, and videos, as well as the search themes. That way, you can precisely target holiday-focused customers and capitalize on seasonal interest.</span></span></p>

<h3>2. Capture the spirit of the season with festive visuals</h3>
<p>Create a holiday atmosphere in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-marketing-campaigns-of-2024">campaigns</a> by using festive images, seasonal color palettes, and engaging video content that captures the spirit of the season. Holiday-themed visuals grab attention and evoke emotions that can drive conversions, making them essential for your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/17/holiday-marketing-ideas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holiday marketing strategy</a>. This applies to industries beyond ecommerce as well, such as showcasing winter-themed projects, highlighting special holiday events, or featuring limited-time offers that are visually compelling.</p>
<p><span>It’s crucial to update your ad visuals and fine-tune your asset group’s targeting to focus on holiday-specific interests. Consider modifying the listing group within your holiday-themed asset group to include only the products or services you want to emphasize during the holiday season. This approach ensures that you’re showcasing the most relevant offerings that align with seasonal demand, increasing the likelihood of conversions.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/google-ads-holiday-tips-product-studio-image.webp" alt="google ads holiday strategies - product studio holiday template" width="501" height="501" class="aligncenter wp-image-86910 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/google-ads-holiday-tips-product-studio-image.webp 501w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/google-ads-holiday-tips-product-studio-image-480x480.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 501px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="google-ads-performance-max-holiday-promotions"></div>
<h3>3. Highlight special offers with promotion assets</h3>
<p><span>The holiday season is all about deals. Emphasize your special offers—such as percentage discounts, free shipping, or limited-time services—across multiple <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/performance-max">ad formats in Performance Max</a>. Promotions can significantly enhance ad visibility and attract clicks, making them essential to any holiday strategy. For service-based businesses, highlight discounted services, free consultations, or holiday bundles that make your offerings stand out from the competition.</span></p>
<p><span>Adding a promotion asset to your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-copy">Google Ads</a> Performance Max campaign is straightforward and can be shown across <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/05/types-of-google-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all ad types</a>, including search, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-audit-pmax-display-video">display</a>, and YouTube ads. Key elements to consider when setting up a promotion include selecting the right occasion—like Black Friday, Christmas, or a seasonal event—and specifying the promotion type, whether it&#8217;s a monetary discount or a percentage off. Consider using promo codes or setting minimum order values to encourage larger purchases.</span></p>
<p><span>Scheduling your asset is a crucial element because it allows you to set the promotion ahead of time, ensuring you don’t forget to turn it on or off. This helps align the promotion perfectly with your holiday timeline. Also, adding tracking parameters like UTM tags allows you to easily monitor performance, providing valuable insights into what drives the best results. This enables more data-driven adjustments, keeping your ads relevant and effective throughout the holiday season. This comprehensive strategy maximizes both visibility and conversions. </span></p>

<div id="performance-max-holiday-retargeting"></div>
<h3>4. Personalize retargeting with Google’s customer match</h3>
<p><span>Google’s customer match audience targeting option allows you to retarget existing customers based on their past interactions, making it a powerful tool for holiday marketing. With <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/16/black-fiveday" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Friday and Cyber Monday</a> quickly approaching, this strategy is crucial for connecting with relevant audiences and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/18/boost-holiday-sales-and-revenue" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> driving holiday sales</a>. Customer match enables you to create personalized ads that remind customers of items they viewed or services they showed interest in. Plus, for businesses focusing on leads rather than sales, it’s an effective way to re-engage clients who booked services in the past, encouraging them to return during the holiday season.</span></p>
<p><span>As competition increases around the holidays—and cost per thousand impressions often spikes—reaching the right audience is critical. In recent years, Black Friday US retail sales saw a <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/press/2023/november/mastercard-spendingpulse-u-s-black-friday-retail-sales-up-year-over-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7.5%</a> increase in online sales, reaching $9.8 billion, while in-store sales grew by 2.5% year-over-year. This indicates the importance of effectively utilizing both online and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/offline-marketing-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offline marketing strategies</a> to engage holiday shoppers.</span></p>
<p><span>Using customer match, you can strategically target individuals who have already engaged with your business, whether they signed up for a newsletter, made a previous purchase, or joined a loyalty program. Customer match provides a seamless way to combine your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/12/first-party-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> first-party data</a> with Google&#8217;s consumer behavior insights, ensuring highly relevant ads. </span></p>
<p><span>This approach allows you to retarget customers across all of Google’s networks—search, YouTube, display, shopping, and Gmail—tailoring offers to those most likely to convert. Between automated audience targeting and integration with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/06/broad-match-smart-bidding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smart bidding</a>, customer match leverages <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/04/google-ads-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google AI</a> to enhance campaign performance and optimize your reach during key holiday periods, maximizing your potential impact.</span></p>
<div id="test-different-asset-groups"></div>
<h3>5. Test different asset groups for varied audiences</h3>
<p>The holiday season brings in diverse audiences. Create multiple asset groups within Performance Max, tailored to<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/target-market-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> different segments of your audience</a>—such as gift-givers, deal-hunters, or last-minute shoppers. Service-based businesses can use this tactic by creating ads that target different client types, like families, professionals, or retirees, with messaging that resonates with their needs during the holiday period.</p>
<p>Remember to treat your asset groups like traditional ad groups—they should be viewed as business themes, each relating to a distinct target audience and effectively representing a different customer persona. For example, a &#8220;last-minute shopper&#8221; persona might prioritize convenience, quick shipping, and ready-to-gift options, while a &#8220;budget-conscious parent&#8221; persona could be focused on finding the best deals for family gifts. Consider each persona&#8217;s needs, interests, pain points, and what they are searching for. This approach ensures that your messaging is highly relevant, leading to better engagement and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/11/increase-conversion-rates">conversion rates</a>.</p>

<div id="highlight-local-inventory-and-services"></div>
<h3>6. Highlight local inventory and services</h3>
<p><strong><span></span></strong>For brick-and-mortar businesses, highlighting your local presence is key to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/increase-foot-traffic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attracting foot traffic</a> during the holiday season. Use Performance Max’s local campaign features to show ads to potential customers nearby. This approach is effective for service industries too—such as showcasing local services, in-store consultations, or holiday events that draw in local clients.</p>
<p><span>Ensuring that your<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/optimize-google-my-business-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Google Business Profile</a> is correctly linked to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2024-google-ads-news">Google Ads</a> is crucial for this strategy. When properly set up, you can display location assets in your ads, making it easier for potential customers to find your physical store. This integration allows your ads to appear in Google Maps searches, increasing visibility among people actively looking for services or products near them. </span></p>
<p><span>Showing your location directly in ads enhances credibility, encourages in-store visits, and can lead to higher conversion rates, as customers are more likely to trust and choose a business they know is conveniently located. </span></p>

<div id="performance-max-holiday-time-sensitive-messaging"></div>
<h3>7. Create urgency with time-sensitive messaging</h3>
<p><span>Time-sensitive messaging can drive action. Utilize Performance Max to highlight deadlines, such as “ends soon!” or “limited-time offer.” Service-based businesses can incorporate urgency with bits of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-copy">copy</a> like “only a few spots left” for consultations, or “book by December 20th for a New Year’s discount.”</span></p>
<p><span>Note that another effective way to create urgency is with the countdown feature in Google Ads. While this feature isn’t available in Performance Max, it can be a powerful tool in your Google search ads. The countdown dynamically adjusts to show the exact time remaining for an offer, adding a real-time urgency that can encourage clicks and conversions.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/google-ads-performance-max-holiday-messaging.webp" alt="google ads holiday performance max - pmax urgent holiday copy example" width="611" height="402" class="aligncenter wp-image-87553 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/google-ads-performance-max-holiday-messaging.webp 611w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/google-ads-performance-max-holiday-messaging-480x316.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 611px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="holiday-video-ads-with-performance-max"></div>
<h3>8. Produce engaging holiday video ads with Performance Max</h3>
<p><span>Use Performance Max to run video ads that appeal to holiday emotions and needs. Create engaging stories that align with your brand’s holiday offerings. Non-ecommerce examples include showcasing customer testimonials, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/28/christmas-holiday-greetings-wishes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holiday greeting messages</a>, or educational videos highlighting seasonal tips or year-end advice.</span></p>
<p><span>Remember, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/20/performance-max-pros-cons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Performance Max is heavily driven by AI</a>, and the quality of data you feed into it greatly influences its performance. Google leverages a combination of images, videos, audience interests, and targeting criteria, along with headlines and descriptions, to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-performance-max-pre-launch-optimizations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimize your Performance Max campaigns</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>When it comes to videos, you don&#8217;t need to have pre-existing video assets to get started. The Performance Max asset editor includes a video template builder, allowing you to easily create videos with relevant holiday messaging. This feature is designed to quickly capture viewer attention and encourage clicks, making it ideal for the holiday season. When I discovered this capability, I found it incredibly convenient—it simplifies the process of creating effective video content tailored for conversions.</span></p>
<p><span>While the template builder is a great starting point, pairing it with your actual branded video assets, if available, can further enhance your campaign’s impact. But if you don’t have video assets on hand, the builder allows you to create impactful content effortlessly, ensuring your holiday messaging resonates with your audience.</span></p>
<div id="holiday-value-based-bidding"></div>
<h3>9. Optimize high-value conversions with value-based bidding</h3>
<p><span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/19/google-ads-automated-bidding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Value-based bidding (VBB)</a> allows you to maximize the effectiveness of your campaigns by prioritizing high-value conversions. This strategy involves assigning specific monetary values to different types of conversions based on their importance to your business, ensuring that Google’s algorithm focuses on what matters most to your bottom line.</span></p>
<h4>Value-based bidding examples for holiday PMax campaigns</h4>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><strong><span>Product purchases</span></strong><span><span>: In an ecommerce scenario, you can assign the actual product value to each purchase conversion. A premium product might be valued at $50, while a standard product could be valued at $20. This signals the algorithm to focus on users more likely to buy higher-value items, leading to better profitability.</span></span></li>
<li><span> </span><strong><span>Form submissions vs. phone calls</span></strong><span><span>: If phone calls tend to convert at a higher rate, you could assign a $10 value to a phone call conversion and a $3 value to a form submission, guiding the algorithm to prioritize calls.</span></span></li>
<li><span> </span><strong><span>Consultations vs. downloads</span></strong><span>: Assigning $20 to a scheduled consultation and $5 to a content download helps ensure the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-smart-bidding">bidding strategy</a> targets those likely to book a consultation, which is often a stronger lead.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4>Additional holiday bidding strategies</h4>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><strong><span>Pass actual product value</span></strong><span><span>: For ecommerce, consider passing the exact value of each product as a conversion parameter. This approach gives Google&#8217;s algorithm precise information on what purchases drive the highest revenue.</span></span></li>
<li><span> </span><strong><span>Early data collection with &#8220;add to cart&#8221; conversions</span></strong><span>: Initially, you can set the &#8220;add to cart&#8221; action as a primary conversion event with a lower value (e.g., $5) to help the algorithm gather data on customer intent. Once sufficient data is collected, you can transition to more refined conversion goals, like completed purchases, to better optimize the campaign.</span></li>
</ul>
<div id="performance-max-holiday-asset-groups"></div>
<h3>10. Monitor asset group performance for real-time optimization</h3>
<p><span>During the holiday season, trends can change rapidly. It&#8217;s essential to stay agile and monitor asset group performance closely to ensure your campaigns remain effective. Utilize Performance Max&#8217;s insights dashboard to get a clear view of which asset groups are driving the best results. This real-time data allows you to identify which search themes, headlines, and creatives resonate best with your audience, enabling you to make quick adjustments that optimize your strategy.</span></p>
<p><span>Even for non-ecommerce businesses, monitoring asset group performance can reveal which services or offers are capturing attention, allowing you to focus on what’s working and refine what isn’t. By actively using these insights, you can pivot your approach to maximize effectiveness throughout the holiday season. Here&#8217;s the video I have on how to look at individual asset group performance.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqVAQ2mb-xQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As explained by YouTube</a>: <em>&#8220;Creators have used promotions to grow views and subscribers faster, get more views on content where they showcase a product or service, with a goal of increasing sales, or to reach a specific audience, such as a new country. Promotions are in addition to your channel’s organic reach and discovery on YouTube, and as such, any subscriber or watch time gains from ads won’t count towards your YouTube Partner program eligibility.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Using YouTube Studio&#8217;s promotion area allows you to highlight specific videos, attract more viewers, and boost engagement on your channel.</p>

<h3>4. Track ad performance and audience engagement</h3>
<p>Engaging with your audience is crucial. You&#8217;ve worked hard to cultivate a community, so when someone asks you a question, it&#8217;s not only nice to answer it, but it also shows others that you&#8217;re there to help. When my channel got its first comment, I was excited. Now that my channel has over 16,000 subscribers, I still (try to) answer every question or comment I get. I want to be helpful and let others know I&#8217;m here to help. After all, I did this to educate and inspire, and a little engagement helps with brand awareness and recognition.</p>
<p>Regularly analyzing your channel&#8217;s performance is essential for continuous improvement. Here’s how to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>YouTube Analytics</strong>: Use YouTube Analytics to track key metrics such as watch time, audience retention, and subscriber growth.</li>
<li><strong>Google Ads reports</strong>: If you’re <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/youtube-advertising-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running YouTube ads</a>, utilize Google Ads reports to measure ad performance and ROI.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback loop</strong>: Collect feedback from your audience through comments and surveys to understand their preferences.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, you should analyze where viewers stop watching and understand why. Identify which videos are gaining you subscribers; YouTube Studio&#8217;s Analytics and Advanced Mode can show you this quite clearly. See the image below for an example.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/track-youtube-audience-engagement.webp" alt="youtube analytics example" width="850" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86914" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/track-youtube-audience-engagement.webp 850w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/track-youtube-audience-engagement-480x237.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 850px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Try to create more content similar to what has been working well and use the data from viewing behavior to improve your videos. This approach also serves as a very effective <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/outdated-seo-tactics">SEO strategy</a>, as making videos that answer someone&#8217;s search query can drive more views.</p>

<h3>5. Optimize your organic video content</h3>
<p>This tip isn’t necessarily going to boost your YouTube ads performance, but <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/youtube-seo">optimizing your organic video content</a> is key to attracting and retaining viewers you get from YouTube ads.</p>
<p>Here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create compelling thumbnails: </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/07/youtube-thumbnail">Create attention-grabbing YouTube thumbnails</a> that reflect the content of your video. I like to use <a href="https://www.fotor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fotor</a>, as it&#8217;s great for those who don&#8217;t have Photoshop skills or those who have Photoshop skills but are not efficient with it and like an easier way (like me). With Fotor, you can easily remove backgrounds from images, make visually appealing text overlays, and even figure out your channel&#8217;s style. Their vast library of thumbnail templates is proven to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/14/improve-google-ads-click-through-rate">increase click-through rates</a> (CTR), making it an invaluable resource for optimizing your content.</li>
<li><strong>Write SEO-friendly descriptions and titles: </strong>Write detailed descriptions with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/07/ppc-keyword-challenges">relevant keywords</a> to improve searchability. For titles, providing an answer to someone&#8217;s question (you anticipate they&#8217;ll ask) is a great idea.</li>
<li><strong>Use engaging introductions:</strong> Start your videos with engaging introductions to hook viewers from the beginning.
<ul>
<li>Something like: &#8220;Hey everyone! Welcome back to our channel. Today, we&#8217;re diving into the top five strategies to skyrocket your YouTube growth. If you&#8217;re ready to boost your channel and reach new heights, you&#8217;re in the right place. Let&#8217;s get started!&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Summarize your video: </strong>Summing up a video is important for reinforcing the main points and providing closure, which can be challenging. Ending a video effectively can keep viewers engaged and more likely to return for future content.</li>
<li><strong>Include clear calls to action:</strong> Include <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">clear calls to action</a>, such as asking viewers to like, comment, and subscribe. This helps increase engagement and grow your audience.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4da.png" alt="📚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide download</strong> &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download">The 42 Best Call to Action Phrases Ever (&amp; Why They Work)</a></p>
<p>Optimizing your video content helps <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-youtube-channel">improve your channel’s visibility</a> and encourages viewer interaction.</p>
<p>Additionally, you should check out the inspiration tab in YouTube Studio. Go to Analytics and then to Inspiration. Here, you can see what people are searching for on YouTube who watch your videos. This is a good way to cater to your existing viewers.</p>
<p>When I was early on in my YouTube channel, I didn&#8217;t have many ideas other than creating videos about conversion tracking and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/14/how-to-use-google-tag-manager">Google Tag Manager</a>. I needed more video ideas and had to keep up my goal of putting out at least one video a week. So, I checked out this inspiration area, and it showed me that people were searching for &#8220;how to create a Gmail account.&#8221; I thought, &#8220;easy enough,&#8221; and created a video (a screen share) showing people how to create a Gmail account.</p>
<p>I titled it &#8220;<strong>How to Create a Gmail Account &#8211; Step-by-Step Tutorial for Beginners </strong><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4e5.png" alt="📥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> #gmail #google #digital.</strong>&#8221; This title, along with the appropriate icon and tags, was not just fluff. It actually became my best-performing video for a long period, racking up over 30,000 views organically in a short time. You can see the uptick in views in YouTube Studio when it was indexed by Google.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/youtube-analytics-example.webp" alt="example of youtube boosted performance after indexing on google" width="872" height="504" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86915" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/youtube-analytics-example.webp 872w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/youtube-analytics-example-480x277.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 872px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>Make your YouTube ads view-worthy</h2>
<p>To sum up, growing and optimizing your YouTube channel requires a strategic approach that leverages both content creation and promotional tools. By linking your YouTube account to Google Ads, creating targeted campaigns, utilizing YouTube Studio&#8217;s promotion area, and optimizing your video content, you can significantly enhance your channel&#8217;s visibility and engagement through YouTube ads. Regular analysis and adjustments based on performance metrics and audience feedback ensure continuous improvement and sustained growth.</p>

<p>To make the most out of the Google Ad Grants program, it&#8217;s crucial to first grasp the eligibility criteria. These standards ensure that the grants benefit legitimate nonprofit entities committed to making a positive impact.</p>
<p>Key eligibility requirements include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nonprofit status:</strong> Your organization must hold valid nonprofit status. In the U.S., this typically means being recognized as a 501(c)(3) entity. Requirements may vary by country, so it&#8217;s important to consult Google&#8217;s guidelines for your specific region. You can check your eligibility <a href="https://www.google.com/nonprofits/eligibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Google for Nonprofits Membership:</strong> Eligibility extends to members of the Google for Nonprofits program. If you&#8217;re not already a member, you&#8217;ll need to apply, which is a separate process from the Ad Grant application.</li>
<li><strong>Website quality:</strong> Google requires your nonprofit to have a high-quality, active website. This includes having clear, detailed information about your mission, your activities, and how you utilize donations, as well as being secure (HTTPS).</li>
<li><strong>Ad Grant&#8217;s policy compliance: </strong>Your organization must agree to adhere to the Google Ad Grants activation process and ongoing program policies, which include maintaining the account&#8217;s active management. See <a href="https://support.google.com/grants/answer/9042207" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> for more information.</li>

<h2>How to make the most of your Google Ad Grant</h2>
<p>Once approved, the journey to making the most of your $10,000/month in ad credits begins.</p>
<p>Here are strategies to ensure your Google Search Ads campaigns are effective and impactful.</p>
<h3>Set clear objectives</h3>
<p>Define <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-plan-goals-objectives-for-small-businesses/goals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specific, measurable goals</a> for your campaigns, such as increasing donations, recruiting volunteers, or boosting event attendance.</p>
<h3>Develop a keyword strategy</h3>
<p>Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/ppc-keyword">relevant keywords</a> related to your nonprofit&#8217;s activities and audience. Google&#8217;s Keyword Planner can help identify effective keywords and their search volumes.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f50e.png" alt="🔎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Need help finding the right keywords?</strong> Try our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">Free Keyword Tool</a>!</p>
<h3>Monitor search terms</h3>
<p>Regularly <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-query-matching-updates">review the search terms</a> that trigger your ads. Add irrelevant or unproductive terms as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/06/negative-keyword-guide">negative keywords</a> to refine your audience targeting and improve campaign efficiency.</p>
<h3>Optimize location targeting and budget</h3>

<p>Wider targeting increases visibility but costs more and might attract less relevant traffic. Narrower targeting focuses your budget on more interested users, improving campaign relevance and efficiency.</p>
<p>Balance targeting and budget for optimal campaign impact.</p>

<h2>How to use Performance Max for your nonprofit’s Google Ads</h2>
<p>Incorporating <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-performance-max-pre-launch-optimizations">Performance Max (PMax)</a> campaigns into your nonprofit&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-query-matching-updates">Google Ads strategy</a> can significantly elevate your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/search-visibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online visibility</a> and engagement.</p>
<p>Performance Max campaigns are especially beneficial for nonprofits because they require much <strong>less hands-on management compared to traditional Search campaigns</strong>. This means they also require less fine-tuning. Essentially, you set a goal and provide PMax with the data it needs to be successful in achieving that goal. Think of it as a comprehensive basket of ads, all within one campaign.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of Performance Max campaigns increases with the number of assets you provide. This includes image assets and videos—both short 30-second vertical videos (ideal for <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-make-youtube-shorts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube Shorts</a>) and regular-sized videos.</p>
<p>What makes PMax campaigns stand out is their ability to automatically place your ads across Google&#8217;s entire suite of advertising channels, including search, display, Maps, YouTube Ads, Gmail ads, and more.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to harness the power of PMax effectively.</p>
<h3>Take a goal-oriented approach</h3>
<p>Start by defining a clear, measurable goal for your campaign. Whether it&#8217;s to increase donations, recruit more volunteers, or spread awareness about a specific cause, having a specific target guides the optimization and success of your campaign.</p>
<h3>Include relevant campaign information</h3>
<p>Input detailed, relevant information about your nonprofit and the objectives of your campaign. This data is crucial for informing Google&#8217;s AI-driven optimization, ensuring your ads reach the most relevant audiences across Google&#8217;s properties.</p>
<h3>Create quality headlines and descriptions</h3>
<p>Your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/03/ad-copy-examples">headlines and ad descriptions</a> must be compelling and closely aligned with your chosen keywords. They should clearly convey your mission, what action you want the viewer to take, and why it matters, effectively communicating your call to action.</p>
<h3>Use visual content</h3>
<p>Visual content can dramatically increase engagement and conversion rates. Utilize high-quality images and videos in your campaigns. For video content, make use of the YouTube video template builder available within your PMax campaign settings.

<h3>Leverage a diverse set of assets</h3>
<p>To maximize the potential of your Performance Max campaigns, it&#8217;s crucial to leverage a diverse set of assets.

<p>Performance Max campaigns offer a comprehensive way to reach potential supporters across Google&#8217;s entire advertising ecosystem, from Search to YouTube, Display, and beyond. By following these guidelines, your nonprofit can create more impactful campaigns that resonate with your target audience and advance your mission.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Running successful Google Ads campaigns requires more than just setting up ads and hoping for the best. To truly optimize your efforts and maximize your return on investment (ROI), you need to leverage the powerful reporting tools that Google Ads offers. These reports provide invaluable insights into various aspects of your campaigns, helping you make data-driven decisions to refine your strategies.</p>
<p>In this guide, we&#8217;ll explore some of the most essential Google Ads reports that can significantly impact your campaign success.</p>

<div id="search-terms-report"></div>
<h2>Search terms report</h2>
<p>The search terms report in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-query-matching-updates">Google Ads</a> is essential for keyword optimization. This report goes beyond the keywords you initially selected, revealing the actual search queries that trigger your ads. You can use this to refine and optimize your keywords in a couple of different ways.</p>
<h3>Refine your keywords</h3>
<p>By analyzing the data in the search terms report, you can discover valuable insights, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High-performing keywords you might have missed:</strong> Unearth keywords that are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/21/google-ads-not-converting">driving conversions</a> but weren&#8217;t explicitly included in your initial list.</li>
<li><strong>New keyword ideas:</strong> Gain inspiration for expanding your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/13/ppc-keyword-maintenance-tasks">keyword strategy</a> to reach a wider relevant audience.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these insights, you can refine your keyword list to ensure your ads are shown to a more relevant audience, maximizing the effectiveness of your campaigns.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Want a true picture of Google Ads performance?</strong> Find out with a free, instant audit &gt;&gt; <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Google Ads Performance Grader</a></p>
<h3>Find and exclude negative keywords</h3>
<p>Equally important is the ability to identify <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/06/negative-keyword-guide">negative keywords</a>. These are terms that you <strong>do not</strong> want your ads to trigger for, preventing <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-ads-spend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasted ad spend</a> on irrelevant traffic. The search terms report allows you to easily find these irrelevant search terms.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it benefits your campaigns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved ad relevance and ROI:</strong> By adding negative keywords, you filter out unqualified traffic that is unlikely to convert. This focuses your budget on more relevant searches, increasing the return on your ad investment.</li>
<li><strong>Boosted click-through rate (CTR) and Quality Score:</strong> Negative keywords ensure your ads are shown to a more targeted audience, leading to a higher click-through rate (CTR) and a better <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/19/does-quality-score-still-matter">Quality Score</a>. This ultimately translates to:
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher conversion rates:</strong> A more targeted audience means more qualified leads, increasing the likelihood of conversions.</li>
<li><strong>Improved ROI:</strong> By focusing on relevant searches and conversions, you achieve a better return on your overall ad spend.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<div id="call-reporting"></div>
<h2>Call reporting</h2>
<p>For businesses that rely on phone calls, call reporting in Google Ads is an essential tool. This report goes beyond impressions and clicks, providing valuable insights into the performance of your call extensions. With call reporting, you can track key metrics like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Call length:</strong> See how long callers are typically engaged on the phone with your business.</li>
<li><strong>Call time:</strong> Understand when calls are most frequent, allowing you to optimize campaign scheduling.</li>
<li><strong>Call outcomes:</strong> Identify whether calls are connected, missed, or automatically directed to voicemail.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/google-ads-call-details-report.webp" alt="google ads call details report example" width="844" height="382" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85400" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/google-ads-call-details-report.webp 844w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/google-ads-call-details-report-480x217.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 844px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>By analyzing this data, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimize your call extensions:</strong> Refine your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/10/06/google-adwords-call-extensions">call extensions</a> to ensure clarity and encourage more qualified calls.</li>
<li><strong>Adjust your bidding strategy:</strong> Focus your budget on times and keywords that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/25/google-ads-call-conversions">generate the most valuable calls</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Drive valuable phone leads:</strong> Identify what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not to ensure you&#8217;re attracting high-quality leads through phone inquiries.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is particularly useful for service-based businesses where phone interactions are a crucial part of the sales process. Analyzing call data allows you to streamline the phone experience for both you and your potential customers.</p>
<p>Plus, for added convenience, call reporting can be exported to various formats like CSV or Excel. This allows you to easily share the data with colleagues or integrate it with other reporting tools. Additionally, reports can be saved within Google Ads for easy access by other authorized users within your account.</p>
<p>And for even deeper analysis, you can even add relevant keywords to your call reporting. By including keywords that triggered your ads, you can see which terms are driving the most calls and optimize your campaigns accordingly. This additional layer of insight can help you identify high-performing keywords that generate valuable phone leads.</p>
<div id="ad-performance-report"></div>
<h2>Ad Performance Report</h2>
<p>The Ad Performance Report is a powerful tool in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ad-grants">Google Ads</a> that helps you understand how your campaigns are performing. It goes beyond basic metrics like clicks and impressions, providing in-depth insights into key areas such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conversions:</strong> Track how many valuable actions users take after clicking your ad, such as making a purchase, signing up for a newsletter, or downloading an app.</li>
<li><strong>Cost per conversion (CPA):</strong> Analyze the cost associated with each conversion, allowing you to optimize your bids and budget for better efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Return on ad spend (ROAS):</strong> Measure the revenue generated by your ad spend, providing a clear picture of your campaign&#8217;s profitability.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Optimize campaigns:</strong> Identify which campaigns are driving the most conversions and adjust your budget accordingly. This ensures you&#8217;re maximizing your return on investment.</li>
<li><strong>Improve bidding strategy:</strong> Analyze <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/21/how-much-does-adwords-cost">cost-per-conversion data</a> to refine your bidding strategy, focusing your budget on keywords and demographics that generate the most valuable conversions.</li>
<li><strong>Identify winning ads:</strong> See which ad variations resonate best with your audience, allowing you to further develop <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/24/google-ads-examples">high-performing ad copy</a> and creatives.</li>
</ul>

<div id="distance-report"></div>
<h2>Distance report</h2>
<p>For local service businesses (those with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/27/google-my-business">Google Business Profiles</a> linked to Google Ads), the distance report provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/17/google-ads-location-targeting">location targeting</a>. This report goes beyond basic metrics, offering a deep dive into how user proximity to targeted locations influences ad engagement and conversions.</p>
<p>Key areas the distance report include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impressions by distance:</strong> See how often your ads were shown to users at various distances from your targeted locations, such as within 5 miles, 10 miles, or 25 miles. This data helps pinpoint the optimal radius for your location targeting.</li>
<li><strong>Clicks by distance:</strong> Track how many users clicked on your ads at different distances from your targeted locations. This reveals which distances are driving the most engagement and can inform adjustments to your targeting strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Conversions by distance:</strong> Analyze the number of valuable actions, like purchases or sign-ups, that occurred at various distances from your targeted locations. This helps you refine your focus to areas that generate the most valuable outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/google-ads-distance-report.webp" alt="google ads distance report example" width="857" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85402" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/google-ads-distance-report.webp 857w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/google-ads-distance-report-480x335.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 857px, 100vw" /></p>

<div id="audience-performance-report"></div>

This report offers valuable insights into how your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/21/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheat-sheet">audience targeting</a> impacts your campaigns. It transcends basic performance metrics, providing a deeper understanding of how different audiences interact with your ads and convert them into valuable actions.</p>
<p>Key aspects the Audience Performance report sheds light on include:</p>
<ul>

<h2>What is Google Ads for startups?</h2>
<p>Google Ads is an advertising platform that enables businesses to promote their products or services on Google&#8217;s search engine results pages (SERPs), YouTube, and other Google-owned websites.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/startup-google-ads-examples.webp" alt="examples of google ads for startups ads" width="833" height="589" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85380" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/startup-google-ads-examples.webp 833w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/startup-google-ads-examples-480x339.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 833px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Google Ads operates on a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/learn/ppc-management">pay-per-click (PPC)</a> model, meaning advertisers only pay when a user clicks on their ad. This cost-effective approach and Google Ads&#8217; powerful targeting options, which allow businesses to reach specific demographics, locations, and interests, make it a popular choice for online advertising.</p>
<p>Starting your Google Ads journey is simple–all you need is a Google account, which will give you access to create a Google Ads account through their website or app.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Want to learn more about search engine marketing on Google?</strong> Get the free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLPPC101.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_PPC101_Download">PPC 101: Complete Guide to Google Ads</a></p>
<div id="benefits-of-google-ads-for-startups"></div>
<h2>Benefits of Google Ads for startups</h2>
<p>Why consider Google Ads for your startup? Here are some of the biggest benefits.</p>
<h3>Cost-effective targeting</h3>
<p>One of the key benefits of Google Ads for startups is that you aren&#8217;t paying for wasted views. When you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/21/how-to-run-google-ads">set up Google Ads campaigns</a>, you&#8217;re defining who will see your ads based on what they search, where they are located, and even their interests. This minimizes spending on advertising to people unlikely to be interested in your product or service.</p>
<h3>Relevance</h3>
<p>Google Ads offers granular control over matching your ads to search queries and interests. For example, if your startup sells eco-friendly sneakers, you can ensure your advertisements appear when people search for &#8220;sustainable shoes&#8221; or &#8220;recycled footwear.&#8221; This tailored approach improves ad performance and ultimately your return on investment.</p>
<h3><span>Diverse platforms</span></h3>
<p>The Google Ads network has a massive reach. Your ads can appear in traditional search results and on various platforms. However, based on my experience with search campaigns, the best conversions come from using just Google Search rather than search partners and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/23/google-display-ads">display networks</a>. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google partner websites with relevant content.</li>
<li>Gmail and other Google-owned properties.</li>
<li>YouTube, both in videos and as display ads.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Customization</h3>
<p>Successful advertising speaks to an audience&#8217;s needs and desires. Google Ads lets you refine your messaging by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crafting multiple ad variations.</li>
<li>Employing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ab-testing-examples">A/B testing</a> to fine-tune what works best.</li>
<li>Taking advantage of dynamic ad options that automatically adjust for different viewers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Performance tracking</h3>
<p>With <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-reports">Google data</a> at your fingertips, you can continually understand how your ads are performing. The dashboard shows you clicks, impressions, costs, and helps determine what&#8217;s working and what isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/google-ads-for-startups-performance-tracking.webp" alt="google ads dashboard performance tracking" width="850" height="389" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85377" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/google-ads-for-startups-performance-tracking.webp 850w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/google-ads-for-startups-performance-tracking-480x220.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 850px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>Flexibility</h3>
<p>Google Ads makes campaign management accessible and adaptable.  Here&#8217;s why that&#8217;s critical for startups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scaling is simple:</strong> As your budget grows, your ad campaigns can easily expand with you.</li>
<li><strong>Pause and pivot:</strong> Although frequently stopping and starting your ads is not recommended, you do have the option to do so. It’s important to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/14/google-ads-budgeting-strategies">set a monthly budget</a> that suits your comfort level and adhere to it. However, the Google Ads dashboard offers flexibility, allowing you to pause ads or adjust your targeting strategy in response to market changes at any time.</li>
</ul>
<div id="google-ads-for-startups-budget"></div>
<h2>What’s a good Google Ads budget for startups?</h2>
<p>I often receive questions about budgeting, with people asking what their daily/monthly budget should be.</p>
<h3>Google Ads budgeting factors</h3>
<p>There are a number of factors to consider when answering this question.</p>
<h4>Industry and competition</h4>
<p>Some industries have significantly higher average <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/17/lower-cost-per-click">costs per click</a> (CPC) than others. More competitive keywords within your industry will increase bidding costs. Thorough keyword research is key to understanding costs.</p>

<h4>Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)</h4>
<p>Knowing the average lifetime value of a customer helps you decide how much you&#8217;re willing to spend to acquire them. If your CLV is high, you can afford to be more aggressive with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/adwords-bid-management">bidding</a> and your budget.</p>
<h4>Business goals</h4>
<p>Are you primarily focused on brand awareness, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website traffic</a>, or immediate conversions? Your goals will inform the aggressiveness of your budget.</p>
<h4>Testing period</h4>
<p>Starting with a smaller budget allows you to test, analyze data, and refine your strategy before scaling up.</p>
<h3>Starting point budgeting guidelines</h3>
<p>Since you&#8217;re new, err on the conservative side while experimenting.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimum starting budget:</strong> Consider $20-$50 per day as a baseline. This gives you enough for a few clicks and initial data.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended average range:</strong> Most small businesses should allocate between $1,000-10,000 per month for Google Ads.</li>
<li><strong>Adjusting budget:</strong> Continually monitor your campaign performance and adjust the budget based on results. It&#8217;s okay to start small and gradually increase once you have more data.</li>

<h2>Tips for effective Google Ads for startups</h2>
<p>Ready to get started? Follow these best practices for effective Google Ads for startups.</p>
<h3>Find the right keywords</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/big-easy-guide-to-kw-research?cid=Web_Any_Homepage_PPC_BigEasyKeyword_Download">Choosing the right keywords</a> is the heart of effective search advertising. With Google Ads, you carefully select the words and phrases that will trigger your ads to appear.</p>
<p>For example, if you sell running gear, you&#8217;d want keywords like &#8220;running shoes&#8221; or &#8220;marathon training gear.&#8221; This ensures your ads are seen by people actively searching for your products, and not someone looking for information about &#8220;running for office.&#8221;  Optimizing your keywords means getting your products in front of the people most likely to buy them.</p>
<h3>Target the right location</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/17/google-ads-location-targeting">Location-based targeting</a> is great for both broad and local startups. For a global startup, you can segment campaigns according to regions where your product is a fit. For a local startup, it&#8217;s about getting those ads in front of your nearest potential customers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/google-ads-for-startups-location-targeting.webp" alt="google ads location targeting" width="857" height="415" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85378" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/google-ads-for-startups-location-targeting.webp 857w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/google-ads-for-startups-location-targeting-480x232.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 857px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Find the right geographic targeting strategy for your specific startup to make sure your ads are showing to those most likely to become your customers.</p>
<h3>Write attention-grabbing headlines and detailed ad descriptions</h3>
<p>Google&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/19/does-quality-score-still-matter">Quality Score</a> evaluates the overall quality of your ads, and a major factor in that score is ad relevance. Clear headlines and descriptions that match the user’s search intent can improve your click-through rate, which impacts Quality Score and ad relevance.</p>
<h4>Tips for strong headlines</h4>
<p>Your headline is the first thing potential customers see. Make it count! It needs to be clear, concise, and captivating. Here&#8217;s how:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incorporate keywords:</strong> This boosts relevance and visibility for the right searches.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on benefits:</strong> What problem does your product/service solve? Highlight that!</li>
<li><strong>Use action words:</strong> Use powerful verbs like &#8220;Discover,&#8221; &#8220;Try,&#8221; &#8220;Save,&#8221; to inspire clicks.</li>
<li><strong>Incorporate numbers and stats:</strong> Concrete figures create urgency (e.g., &#8220;Limited Time: 50% Off&#8221;).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Tips for clear ad descriptions</h4>
<p>This is your space to provide additional context and benefits. Maximize the descriptive text to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expand on your offer:</strong> Elaborate on what the headline promises.</li>
<li><strong>Include your unique selling position:</strong> What makes you different from competitors? Showcase that here.</li>
<li><strong>Add strong calls to action:</strong> Use clear statements like &#8220;Shop Now,&#8221; &#8220;Learn More,&#8221; or &#8220;Sign Up Today.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h4>Maximizing headlines and descriptions</h4>
<p>Here are some tips for both headlines and ad descriptions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pay attention to maximum length:</strong> Use all available character limits. Google Ads has specific limits for headlines and descriptions–take full advantage of those to provide more information.</li>
<li><strong>Integrate keywords:</strong> Carefully and naturally work your target keywords into your headlines and descriptions. This signals to Google that your ad is highly relevant to those search terms.</li>
<li><strong>Try variations:</strong> Try different headlines and descriptions for the same ad group to see which ones resonate most with your target audience.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/google-ads-for-startups-headline-variations.webp" alt="headline variations in google ads" width="875" height="521" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85379" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/google-ads-for-startups-headline-variations.webp 875w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/google-ads-for-startups-headline-variations-480x286.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 875px, 100vw" /></li>
</ul>
<h2>Get started with Google Ads for startups</h2>
<p>The digital era has undoubtedly transformed advertising. Gone are the simple days of dominating the phone book; a successful internet presence is today&#8217;s equivalent. At its core, the goal of advertising hasn&#8217;t changed–it&#8217;s about getting seen by the right people at the right time to grow your business. Google Ads provides a powerful and flexible platform for startups to achieve that goal. And don&#8217;t forget, you can <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/replicate-google-ads-on-bing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replicate your Google Ads</a> on Bing for more reach.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re a complete newbie to paid advertising or transitioning from more traditional strategies, remember these essentials:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thorough research:</strong> Understanding your target audience, industry competition, and the mechanics of Google Ads is vital before taking the first step.</li>
<li><strong>Testing and experimentation:</strong> There&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all answer to budget or perfect ad copy. A/B testing is your friend &#8211; it allows you to gather data and find what works best for you.</li>
<li><strong>Embrace agility:</strong> Successful Google Ads campaigns aren&#8217;t about &#8220;set-it-and-forget-it.&#8221; Regular optimization and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-audit">auditing</a>, including keyword, bid, and landing page adjustments, ensures you&#8217;re getting the most out of your budget.</li>
</ul>
<p>While launching yourself into a new space is daunting, taking this leap will likely prove far more fruitful than those old full-page phone book ads. Think of Google Ads as the modern toolbox to boost visibility, build a reputation, and ultimately attract new customers who understand the value you provide. It truly is a tool for democratizing your reach and growing your business in a way that couldn&#8217;t exist pre-internet.</p>

<h2>Google Merchant Center: What to know before you start</h2>
<p>Before we delve into the specifics of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/25/google-shopping-ads-priority-bidding-structure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimizing your Google Merchant Center feed</a>, it&#8217;s important to understand at a high level the benefits of feed optimization. By improving your feed, you can enhance query matching, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/14/improve-google-ads-click-through-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase click-through rate (CTR)</a>, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/03/improve-conversion-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drive more conversions</a>.</p>
<p>Getting your products live is the first step in feed optimization. It means ensuring that your product feed meets all the requirements set by Google and that all your products are approved and visible in your Merchant Center account. To ensure your products go live <em>and stay live</em>, it&#8217;s crucial to follow <a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6149970?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Shopping guidelines</a>. This will prevent your products from being disapproved and, even worse, your account from being suspended.</p>
<p>The next step after ensuring that you follow Google’s policies is to ensure that your products are shown on the right queries. This involves optimizing your product titles, descriptions, and other attributes to ensure that they contain the right keywords and are relevant to the search queries that users are entering.</p>
<p>The final step for feed optimization involves maximizing the performance of your products. This means ensuring that your product images are high-quality and that your prices are competitive. You should also regularly review and update your product information to ensure that it remains accurate and up-to-date.</p>

<h2>10 Google Merchant Center mistakes to avoid</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s dive deeper into the details of Merchant Center health and feed optimization, taking a more granular approach.</p>
<h3>1. Using irrelevant or inaccurate product categories</h3>
<p>Product categories are critical for organizing your products and matching them to user queries. However, many merchants make the mistake of selecting inappropriate or inaccurate categories, which can confuse customers and hurt their visibility.</p>
<p>For example, if you sell a shirt, you should select &#8220;Apparel &amp; Accessories &gt; Clothing &gt; Shirts &amp; Tops&#8221; instead of &#8220;Home &amp; Garden &gt; Furniture &gt; Chairs.&#8221; You should also avoid using custom categories or creating duplicate categories, as they can create inconsistencies and confusion.</p>
<h3>2. De-optimized product titles</h3>
<p>Crafting titles with relevant keywords and essential information can significantly improve your product&#8217;s visibility and click-through rate. Titles play a critical role in matching search queries with relevant products. To optimize your titles, consider including details such as brand, gender, product type, and attributes (such as color and size) that align with your business goals, such as customer acquisition or brand awareness. By optimizing your titles, you can improve impressions and ranking, leading to better performance. It&#8217;s recommended to experiment with different strategies and choose the most rewarding one for your business.</p>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/search-visibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Improving the visibility of your brand</a> in your titles is very important to highlight in this section. If you notice a high search volume for your brand, consider adding it to the beginning of your title. On the other hand, if the search volume for your brand is low, you may want to remove it or add it to the end of the title. Experiment with different approaches and see what works best for your business.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-basic-naming-structure.webp" alt="google merchant center - product naming chart" width="719" height="355" class="aligncenter wp-image-83841 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-basic-naming-structure.webp 719w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-basic-naming-structure-480x237.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 719px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3><strong>3. Forgetting about your descriptions</strong></h3>
<p>To optimize the quality, triggering, ranking, and visibility of Shopping Ads, it&#8217;s important to provide adequate product information through rich descriptions. When your descriptions are both keyword-rich and meaningful to users, they are more likely to be displayed in search results during relevant queries.</p>
<p>To achieve this, I suggest submitting descriptions that are between 500 and 5000 characters in length. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that currently, the majority of items within the typical advertiser&#8217;s Google Merchant Center have descriptions that are less than 500 characters.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Using low-quality or mismatched images </strong></h3>
<p>Product images are essential for showcasing your products and attracting customers&#8217; attention. However, using low-quality or mismatched images can hurt your credibility, click-through rates, and conversions. To avoid this mistake, you should use<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-media-image-sizes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> high-resolution images</a> that accurately represent your products and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/14/website-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">match your website&#8217;s style</a> and branding. You should also use consistent image sizes and aspect ratios, and avoid adding watermarks, promotional text, or other distractions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-product-image-example.webp" alt="google merchant center - example product image" width="249" height="224" class="size-full wp-image-83843 aligncenter" /><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-product-image.webp" alt="google merchant center - example quality merchant center photo" width="257" height="225" class="size-full wp-image-83842 aligncenter" /></p>
<h3><strong>5. Neglecting mobile optimization</strong></h3>
<p>With the increasing <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/mobile-marketing-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use of mobile devices for online shopping</a>, it&#8217;s crucial to optimize your product data and website for mobile users. However, many merchants neglect this aspect and miss out on valuable traffic and conversions.</p>
<p>To avoid this mistake, you should ensure that your product data is mobile-friendly and displays correctly on smaller screens. You should also optimize your website for mobile speed and usability, such as using responsive design, optimizing images, and reducing page load time.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Overusing promotional text and special characters<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>While it&#8217;s important to highlight your products&#8217; unique features and benefits, overusing promotional text and special characters can be counterproductive. Google may consider them spammy or misleading, and customers may find them annoying or confusing.</p>
<p>To avoid this mistake, you should use promotional text and special characters sparingly and strategically, such as in your product titles or descriptions. You should also follow Google&#8217;s guidelines and avoid using all caps, exclamation points, emojis, or other symbols excessively.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-example-product-name.webp" alt="google merchant center - promotional product name example" width="403" height="154" class="aligncenter wp-image-83844 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-example-product-name.webp 403w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-example-product-name-300x115.webp 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-example-product-name-400x154.webp 400w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" /></p>
<h3><strong>7. Ignoring feed errors and warnings<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>One of the most common mistakes that merchants make with Merchant Center is ignoring feed errors and warnings. Merchant Center uses a feed to retrieve and update your product data, and any errors or warnings in your feed can prevent your products from showing or cause inaccuracies or disapprovals. However, many merchants don&#8217;t monitor or fix their feed errors and warnings regularly or thoroughly, which can hurt their performance and customer experience.</p>
<p>To avoid this mistake, you should check your feed regularly for any errors or warnings, and use the diagnostic and feed rules features in Merchant Center to identify and fix any issues. You should also ensure that your feed complies with Google&#8217;s requirements and policies, such as data quality, product identifiers, and country-specific regulations.</p>
<p>Finally, you should monitor your feed health and performance regularly and set up alerts or notifications for any critical issues. By taking care of your feed errors and warnings, you can ensure that your products are visible, accurate, and compliant, and you&#8217;re avoiding any unnecessary delays or penalties.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-feed-error-report.webp" alt="google merchant center - feed error report" width="1000" height="406" class="aligncenter wp-image-83848 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-feed-error-report.webp 1000w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-feed-error-report-980x398.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-feed-error-report-480x195.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1000px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3><strong>8. Not using custom labels<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Custom labels are a powerful feature in Google Merchant Center that allows you to group your products based on specific criteria such as margin, seasonality, popularity, or product type. This can help you optimize your bidding, reporting, and segmentation strategies, and tailor your promotions and ad copy to different audiences. However, many merchants overlook this feature or use it inconsistently, which can limit their flexibility and insights.</p>
<p>To avoid this mistake, you should identify the most relevant and useful custom labels for your business and use them consistently and strategically. In the example below, the merchant is leveraging custom labels to differentiate between various sizes of items for distinct ad group segmentation. Additionally, they have implemented the &#8216;shipping-label&#8217; to signify varying shipping charges that are applied to each group of item sizes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-attributes.webp" alt="google merchant center - example custom label attributes in product feed" width="766" height="461" class="aligncenter wp-image-83840 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-attributes.webp 766w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-attributes-480x289.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 766px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3><strong>9. Using vague or generic product identifiers<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>To begin with, let&#8217;s understand the significance of GTIN. A Global Trade Item Number, commonly known as GTIN, is a 14-digit unique code assigned to products (alternatively, EAN or ISBN are also valid options). It is mandatory for all products with an assigned GTIN. Failing to provide accurate GTIN information can cause frequent issues in feeds, but fortunately, they are relatively simple to resolve. By ensuring that GTINs are updated and correct, working with feeds becomes more streamlined and hassle-free.</p>
<p>Product identifiers such as GTINs, MPNs, and brand names are critical for matching your products to user queries and ensuring accuracy and relevance. However, many merchants use vague or generic identifiers that can lead to confusion or mismatching, especially for variations or bundles.</p>
<p>To avoid this mistake, you should use unique and accurate product identifiers that follow Google&#8217;s guidelines and match your website&#8217;s product pages. You should also ensure that your product data includes all the necessary identifiers and variants, and fix any mismatches or missing data.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-gtin-value.webp" alt="google merchant center - gtin product value limitation" width="559" height="103" class="aligncenter wp-image-83839 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-gtin-value.webp 559w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-gtin-value-480x88.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 559px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3><strong>10. Forgetting about sale price annotations<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Differentiating your ads with a &#8220;SALE PRICE&#8221; attribute in your feed can help attract customers and<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-increase-sales-for-your-business-on-a-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> increase sales</a>. However, it is important to meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The base price must have been charged for a period of at least 30 consecutive days in the past 180 days. </strong>This means that the original price of the product should have been valid for a significant amount of time before you can offer a sale price. This ensures that the sale price is not misleading and that customers are actually getting a good deal.</li>
<li><strong>The base price must be valid.</strong> The original price of the product should be accurate and reflect the actual price that the product was sold for in the past. Providing a false base price can be misleading and can lead to customer distrust.</li>
<li><strong>The sale price must be lower than the base price.</strong> This is the most obvious requirement for a sale. The sale price should be lower than the original price, and the discount offered should be significant enough to attract customers.</li>
<li><strong>The discount of the sale must be greater than 5% and less than 90%.</strong> This requirement ensures that the sale is not a minor price adjustment or an attempt to get rid of unwanted inventory. At the same time, the discount offered should not be too high, as this can make customers question the quality of the product or the legitimacy of the sale.</li>
</ul>
<p>By meeting these requirements, you can differentiate your ads and create a sense of urgency and excitement among customers. This can lead to increased clicks, conversions, and ultimately, sales.</p>

<div id="google-merchant-center-example"></div>
<h2>Real-world Google Merchant Center optimization example</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s put what we&#8217;ve learned about Google Merchant Center so far into practice with a real-world example I&#8217;ve seen. The client, an online retailer specializing in outdoor and leisure products such as tents, backpacks, and hammocks, had been using Google Shopping for some time but had not seen much success in terms of clicks and conversions. The client&#8217;s product titles and descriptions were generic and lacked the specific keywords and details that users were searching for. For example, the product title for a four-person tent was simply &#8220;Camping Tent,&#8221; without any information about the size, capacity, or features.</p>
<p>To improve their Google Shopping performance, the client decided to revamp their product titles and descriptions and align them more closely with user search queries. They also added brand names and GTINs to their products to enhance their visibility and credibility. After making these changes, the client saw a significant improvement in their click-through rate and conversion rate (CVR).</p>
<p>Specifically, they saw a 200% increase in their CTR and a 50% increase in their CVR within the first month of implementing these changes. Their new product titles and descriptions were more informative, descriptive, and relevant, and included keywords and phrases that users were searching for. For example, the new product title for the four-person tent was &#8220;Coleman Family Camping Tent for 4 People &#8211; Waterproof, Easy Setup, and Durable,&#8221; which highlighted the key features and benefits of the product and matched user intent.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-shopping-ad-example.jpg" alt="google merchant center - example shopping ad" width="814" height="375" class="aligncenter wp-image-83849 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-shopping-ad-example.jpg 814w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-merchant-center-shopping-ad-example-480x221.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 814px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>By adding brand names and GTINs to their products, the client also improved their online sales, as users tend to trust and click on products that have identifiable and verifiable information. In fact, a <a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6352134" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study by Google</a> found that products with GTINs had a 20% higher conversion rate than those without.</p>
<p>The key takeaway from this example is that optimizing your product titles, descriptions, and data can have a significant impact on your Google Shopping performance and ROAS. By aligning your product data with user intent, adding brand names and GTINs, and using relevant and high-quality images and videos, you can attract and engage more customers and differentiate yourself from competitors.</p>
<h2>Start improving your Google Merchant Center feed today</h2>
<p>Optimizing your Google Merchant Center feed can greatly benefit your business by enhancing query matching, increasing click-through rates, and driving more conversions. To achieve these benefits, it&#8217;s important to follow Google Shopping guidelines, ensure that your products go live and stay live, optimize your product titles and descriptions, and maximize the performance of your products through high-quality images and competitive pricing. By regularly reviewing and updating your product information, you can ensure that your feed remains accurate and up-to-date, providing a positive user experience and ultimately helping to grow your business.</p>

<h2>Biggest trends in PPC for retail</h2>
<p>Let’s dive into the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/ppc-management">PPC</a> scene for retail in 2024. Things are getting exciting with Google&#8217;s ad platform evolving rapidly, especially with its use of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-marketing-trends-2024">AI and machine learning</a>.</p>
<h3>Increased use of AI and machine learning</h3>
<p>Often, we talk about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-for-social-media">AI</a> as if it&#8217;s one big thing, but it&#8217;s more nuanced. AI is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we&#8217;d consider “smart.” Within this, machine learning is a specific subset of AI that trains a machine how to learn. In the PPC world, this distinction is key.</p>
<p>This year, AI will be transitioning away from merely a novelty. It is becoming smarter, a trend we can refer to as Smart AI. This new phase of AI is more targeted and informed, indicating a significant evolution in how AI systems are developed and applied.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f916.png" alt="🤖" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Want to use AI the right way? <strong>Free download &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteAIinMarketingGuide.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_AIMarketing_Download">Emergency Guide to AI in Marketing</a></p>
<h3>AI in ad targeting</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/30/ai-impact-on-ppc">AI’s role in PPC</a> is about understanding and predicting. It sifts through tons of data to figure out what consumers are looking for, then predicts their buying patterns. This means your retail PPC ads are more likely to show up for people who are genuinely interested in what you&#8217;re selling.</p>
<h3>Machine learning in real-time optimization</h3>
<p>Machine learning steps in to continuously improve how your retail ads perform. It adjusts bids, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/17/google-ads-bid-management">manages budgets</a>, and identifies trends that you might not notice. It’s like having an assistant who’s always optimizing your campaigns, ensuring they reach the right audience effectively.</p>
<p>Mastering these technologies is crucial for digital marketers in retail. It’s not just about using these tools; it’s about understanding them deeply and leveraging their strengths to boost your PPC campaigns.</p>
<div id="ppc-strategies-for-retail"></div>
<h2>Top PPC strategies for retail in 2024</h2>
<p>Here are four essential <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/02/ppc-strategies">PPC strategies</a> for retail digital marketers:</p>
<h3>1. Try Demand Gen campaigns</h3>
<p>Recently, Discovery Ads campaigns were automatically upgraded to the Demand Gen campaign type in Google Ads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/demand-gen-campaigns-google-ads.webp" alt="google ads demand gen campaigns" width="936" height="559" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82215" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/demand-gen-campaigns-google-ads.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/demand-gen-campaigns-google-ads-480x287.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/13859703?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Demand Gen is more than just an upgrade–it&#8217;s a game-changer in winning social budgets for Google. Early testers have shown that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/22/demand-gen-campaigns">Demand Gen campaigns</a> deliver better performance when compared to Discovery Ads. That means more qualified traffic, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/11/increase-conversion-rates">more conversions</a>, and more growth for your business or clients.</p>
<h3>2. Embrace automation and smart bidding with Performance Max</h3>
<p>In the realm of PPC, automation is crucial. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-performance-max-pre-launch-optimizations">Performance Max</a>, a feature of Google&#8217;s automated bidding system, helps optimize ad placements across various channels. At the same time, new Demand Gen formats on Google platforms are changing the game. By using these engaging and visually appealing ads, you can attract potential customers right at the onset of their search journey.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/google-ads-performance-max-campaign-ad-creation.jpg" alt="google ads performance max campaigns - screenshot of performance max ad editor" width="511" height="591" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-80375" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/google-ads-performance-max-campaign-ad-creation.jpg 511w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/google-ads-performance-max-campaign-ad-creation-480x555.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 511px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Combining Performance Max with innovative ad formats ensures your ads are not only seen but also resonate with your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a>.</p>
<h3><span>3. Experiment with AI</span></h3>
<p>AI, specifically through tools like <a href="https://searchengineland.com/optimize-product-feeds-chatgpt-feedgen-434020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FeedGen</a>, is revolutionizing how product feeds are optimized. By employing Google Cloud&#8217;s Large Language Models, like Bard, FeedGen enhances product titles, descriptions, and attributes, offering a unique way to experiment with AI in your marketing strategy. For integration instructions, visit <a href="https://github.com/google-marketing-solutions/feedgen#get-started">here</a>.</p>
<h3>4. Explore ecommerce on diverse platforms with cross-channel and omnichannel strategies</h3>
<p>Expand your PPC horizons beyond Google Shopping. Embrace the dynamic advertising opportunities on platforms like TikTok, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/21/how-to-compete-in-facebook-ads">Facebook</a>, and Instagram. Each of these platforms caters to different audience segments and offers unique ways to engage with potential customers.</p>
<p>Integrating these platforms into your advertising mix, alongside traditional channels, creates a holistic and impactful PPC strategy for retail that aligns with the multifaceted nature of today’s consumer behavior.</p>
<p>Implementing these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ppc-for-saas">strategies</a> in your PPC campaigns can lead to more effective and engaging marketing efforts, keeping you ahead in the competitive retail sector of 2024.</p>

<h2>Common challenges and solutions in PPC for retail</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at the common <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/02/ppc-strategies">PPC challenges</a> (and the solutions to these challenges) that retail advertisers run into.</p>
<h3>Challenge 1: Ad saturation and viewer fatigue</h3>
<p>The digital world is awash with ads, making it a challenge for retailers to stand out and capture attention, often leading to viewer fatigue.</p>
<h4>Solutions</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create unique, engaging content:</strong> Develop content that answers potential customer queries, positioning your brand as a solution at the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/01/content-marketing-funnel">top of the funnel</a>. Focus on being helpful and informative.</li>
<li><strong>Try dynamic ad formats and personalization:</strong> Use diverse ad formats and tailor your messaging to connect more effectively with your audience. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/22/how-to-personalize-ecommerce-customer-journey">Personalization</a> can help break through the clutter.</li>
<li><strong>Experiment and test: </strong>Try different creative approaches to discover what resonates best with your audience. Keep your content fresh and engaging.</li>
<li><strong>Apply the 80/20 rule: </strong>Dedicate most of your content to educate and engage (80%) rather than direct selling (20%). This approach can build trust and provide value to your audience.</li>
<li><strong>Be consistent with content creation: </strong>Regular updates and new content can keep your audience engaged and interested.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor and adapt based on metrics: </strong>Regularly check your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/09/20/ppc-metrics-ultimate-guide">campaign metrics</a> to understand what&#8217;s working. Analyze data like click-through rates, conversion rates, and engagement levels. Double down on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seasonal-ppc">creative strategies</a> and content types that show success. Being data-driven in your approach allows you to refine your tactics continuously and do more of what works best.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/google-ads-cost-search-benchmarks.webp" alt="google ads benchmarks" width="611" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-80516" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/google-ads-cost-search-benchmarks.webp 611w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/google-ads-cost-search-benchmarks-480x471.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 611px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Take a look at our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/15/google-ads-benchmarks">search advertising benchmarks</a> to see how your metrics compare.</em></p>
<p>By combining these strategies, retailers can better navigate the challenges of ad saturation and viewer fatigue, making their PPC campaigns more effective, engaging, and relevant to their target audience.</p>
<h3>Challenge 2: Balancing automation and human insight</h3>
<p>While automation in PPC is powerful, an over-reliance on it, such as solely depending on Google Ads&#8217; auto-apply settings, can lead to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/23/optimize-performance-max-campaigns">missed opportunities for optimization</a>. Automation can sometimes miss the subtleties that a professional digital marketer can catch.</p>
<h4>Solutions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Think of AI and automation as assistants, not replacements. As a professional digital marketer, your experience and insights are invaluable. Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency">automation tools</a> for efficiency but maintain control and oversight for strategic decisions.</li>
<li>Regularly review the performance of your campaigns with a critical eye. Remember, the auto-apply settings in Google Ads might not always align with your unique goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your role is to guide these tools, making manual adjustments and infusing your campaigns with the strategic depth that only human experience can provide.</p>
<h3>Challenge 3: Measuring and attributing ROI accurately</h3>
<p>Accurately tracking the return on investment (ROI) from PPC campaigns can be complex, especially when dealing with multiple channels and customer touchpoints.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Invest in advanced analytics tools like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/17/ga4-features-for-advertisers">Google Analytics 4 (GA4)</a>, which is designed with privacy in mind. GA4 offers features such as default IP anonymization, region-specific controls for features like Google Signals, and the ability to mark events as non-personalized ads. Additionally, you can set shorter data retention periods and have more accurate data deletion options, including deleting data for individual users upon request.</p>
<p>These features not only enhance privacy compliance but also provide a clearer understanding of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-analytics-ai">attribution models</a>. This approach allows for more effective tracking of the customer journey and helps in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/08/google-ads-conversion-tracking-mistakes">attributing conversions accurately</a> to the right campaigns, all while maintaining user privacy.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/predictive-audience-based-on-predictive-metrics.webp" alt="predictive audience based on predictive metric church" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-80056" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/predictive-audience-based-on-predictive-metrics.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/predictive-audience-based-on-predictive-metrics-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Challenge 4: Keeping up with rapid technological changes</h3>
<p>The pace of change in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ppc-tools">PPC tools</a> and algorithms can be overwhelming, especially for smaller retailers with limited resources.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Stay informed about industry trends and updates. Consider joining online communities, attending webinars, or collaborating with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/marketing-services?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Demo_Blog_Demo">digital marketing experts</a> to keep your strategies current.</p>
<h3>Challenge 5: Navigating privacy regulations and data restrictions</h3>
<p>Retailers are increasingly challenged by the need to balance <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/preparing-for-ppc-success-in-cookieless-world">effective ad targeting with strict privacy regulations</a> like GDPR and CCPA. Plus, there&#8217;s the eventual <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/preparing-for-ppc-success-in-cookieless-world">depreciation of third-party cookies</a>, which requires a whole other adjustment (read how Google is now <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-privacy-sandbox-update">going back on deprecating cookies</a>).</p>
