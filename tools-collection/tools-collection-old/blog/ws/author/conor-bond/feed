										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<section class="section">
<div class="section__inner section__inner--column_seperator">
<div class="column">
<p>Back in November 2020, Instagram made a pretty significant update to its search functionality. Instead of only being able to search profiles, hashtags, and locations, <strong>you can now search general keywords</strong> and it will show all posts that include those exit words.</p>
<p>This means two things: the first is that the Instagram algorithm has changed. The second is that Instagram SEO needs to be a part of your marketing strategy.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re all familiar SEO for Google, but we must remember that social media platforms have widely used search functions, too! And with this expanded search function on Instagram, optimizing your profile and posts for Insta search is a great way to grow your reach get a leg up on your competition.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-seo-search-results_0-1.png" alt="instagram seo search results" width="350" height="714" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>You&#8217;ll now notice the &#8220;Top&#8221; tab for results, in addition to tags, accounts, and people.</em></p>
<p>In this guide, we&#8217;re going to cover exactly what Instagram SEO is, why it&#8217;s important, and then provide five steps to optimize your account for search. They include:understand:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify your keywords</li>
<li>Identify your KPIs</li>
<li>Optimize your bio</li>
<li>Optimize your post descriptions (captions, hashtags)</li>
<li>Add alt text</li>
</ol>
<h2>What is Instagram SEO?</h2>
<p>Instagram SEO is the process of optimizing your content in order to rank <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/05/promote-instagram-account-free">your profile</a> higher in the Instagram search results. And though it may not have the same appeal as <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/30/instagram-live">live streams</a> or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/23/instagram-carousel-ads">carousel ads</a>, it’s as worthy of your time as anything else. By following Instagram SEO best practices — which we’ll discuss shortly — <strong>you improve your chances of being discovered by users who are searching keywords related to your business</strong>. That means more views, more likes, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/10/19/get-more-instagram-followers">more followers</a>!</p>
<p>Let’s use gardening content as an example. Type “gardening” into the Instagram search bar and you’ll see this:</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-seo-gardening_1-1.png" alt="instagram seo—see more option in instagram search" width="400" height="711" /></div>
<p>Go ahead and click “see more,” and the list of suggested search queries will expand:</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-seo-gardening-see-more-1.png" alt="instagram seo—results for a search for the keyword &quot;gardening&quot;" width="400" height="710" /></div>
<p>Selecting “gardening ideas” brings you to this page:</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-seo-gardening-ideas-1.png" alt="instagram seo—search results for &quot;gardening ideas&quot;" width="400" height="710" /></div>
<p>And if you were to click on the top result — the image in the top left corner, directly below the word “vegetable” — you’d be brought to this post:</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-seo-gardening-ideas-post-1.png" alt="instagram seo—screenshot of the post that was the first result for &quot;gardening ideas&quot; search " width="400" height="709" /></div>
<p>Nice picture, right? Well, if you were to navigate to the page that posted it, you’d see that it belongs to a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/05/instagram-ecommerce">small business</a> — check out the link in the bio!</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-seo-garden-mylove-1.png" alt="instagram seo—small business bio" width="400" height="710" /></div>
<p>Rather than buying an ad, this business made us aware of their merchandise simply by optimizing their content for a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide">relevant keyword</a>: “gardening ideas.” They did this, of course, because they know that users who search for this keyword are likely to be interested in their gardening-related products.</p>
<p>That’s Instagram SEO in action!</p>
<p>Now, before we go further, we should emphasize that <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/08/instagram-ads-cost">buying ads on Instagram</a> is an incredibly effective tactic for many businesses. As such, Instagram SEO should be used as a <em>complement </em>to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/20/instagram-advertising">Instagram advertising</a> — not as a replacement for it.</p>
<p>We should also note that Instagram SEO is not exclusively about individual posts ranking for <a href="/blog/ws/2012/11/07/how-to-find-long-tail-keywords">long-tail keywords</a> (e.g., gardening ideas). Let’s take a second look at the suggestions we get when we simply type “gardening” into the search bar:</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-seo-gardening-knowhow-1.png" alt="instagram seo—suggestions in search bar" width="400" height="712" /></div>
<p>As a user, rather than expanding the list of suggested searches, you could simply go straight to one of these gardening-related profiles. And it’s no accident that these specific profiles are at the top of the list of suggestions. Once again, this is Instagram SEO in action!</p>
<h2>Why is Instagram SEO important?</h2>
<p>Instagram SEO is important because it enables you to connect with people who are actively searching for <a href="/blog/ws/2017/03/15/quality-content-defined">content related to your business—</a>not just anywhere, but on one of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">most popular social media platforms in the world.</a></p>
<p>Think of it this way: Each time a user types in a keyword that’s related to your business, you have an opportunity to make a positive impression and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/10/19/get-more-instagram-followers">drive high-quality traffic to your profile</a> (and your website). Instagram SEO is the key to capitalizing on these opportunities — the key to engaging prospective customers who are more likely than others to convert.</p>
<p>That’s all well and good, but there’s a crucial question we need to address: Do people actually use Instagram to interact with businesses in this fashion? Is it really worthwhile to <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/19/get-on-first-page-google">optimize your content in order to rank higher in the search results</a>?</p>
<p>Yes and yes. According to <a href="https://adespresso.com/blog/instagram-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdEspresso</a>, more than 200 million Instagram users visit a business profile on a daily basis. 66% of those visits come from users who do not yet follow the profiles they’re visiting. Plus, 60% of all Instagram users say they’ve learned about <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">new products</a> through the platform.</p>
<p>Evidently, many people — your prospects included — see Instagram as a way to discover new businesses, new brands, and new products.</p>
<p>To be fair, searching for specific keywords is only one of several ways that users discover new businesses. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/05/22/best-instagram-ads">Instagram ads</a> drive discovery, and the Explore tab does, too. Instagram SEO, in other words, is not the be-all and end-all.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-seo-moment-1.png" alt="instagram seo—example instagram story with &quot;swipe up&quot; " width="400" height="710" /></div>
<p>It is, however, the only way to organically connect with prospects who show an active interest in your content/business. Ads are not organic, and they do not connect you with proactive prospects. Discovery via the Explore tab is organic, but, again, there is no element of proactivity.</p>
<p>Now that we understand the value that Instagram SEO presents to marketers, here are four tips to help you successfully execute it at your company.</p>
<h2>4 tips to help you succeed with Instagram SEO</h2>
<p>As we walk through these tips, keep in mind the ultimate goal: Getting your profile and individual posts to rank as high as possible for the keywords you care about.</p>
<h3>1. Identify and prioritize your keywords</h3>
<p>Which keywords do you want to rank for? An answer to this question is absolutely necessary before you make a single change to your Instagram profile/content.</p>
<p><strong>Use keyword research tools</strong></p>
<p>You can use regular keyword research tools to come up with Instagram keywords, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>WordStream&#8217;s <a href="/keywords">Free keyword tool</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.semrush.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEMRush</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ahrefs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ahrefs</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Just keep in mind that what your followers search for on Instagram may not be the same as what they search for on Google. </strong></p>
<p>In that regard, it may be best to use hashtag research tools, like</p>
<ul>
<li>Keyword.io&#8217;s <a href="https://keywordtool.io/instagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram hashtag tool</a></li>
<li>Ingramer&#8217;s <a href="https://ingramer.com/tools/instagram-hashtag-generator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hashtag Generator Tool</a></li>
</ul>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-seo-hashtag-search-tool-1.png" alt="hashtag generator tool for instagram seo" width="800" height="464" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://ingramer.com/tools/instagram-hashtag-generator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Distinguish between broad and specific keywords</strong></p>
<p>As you’re brainstorming, make sure to distinguish between relatively broad keywords — a.k.a. head terms — and relatively specific keywords — a.k.a. long-tail keywords.</p>
<ul>
<li>Head terms (e.g., gardening) are searched frequently, and they typically indicate low commercial intent in the mind of the user.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2012/11/07/how-to-find-long-tail-keywords">Long-tail keywords</a> (e.g., gardening ideas) are searched infrequently, and they typically indicate high commercial intent in the mind of the user.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which is more important to you: increasing traffic to your profile, or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/15/selling-on-instagram">driving more conversions</a>? If it’s the former, you’re probably going to prioritize head terms over long-tail keywords. If it’s the latter, you’ll likely do the reverse.</p>
<p>You could argue that these two objectives go hand-in-hand— i.e., you want to increase traffic to your profile in order to drive more conversions. It’s a fair point, and most of you will end up optimizing your profile/content for both head terms and long-tail keywords. As we’ll discuss shortly, however, not all optimizations carry the same weight — and that’s why it’s important to establish your priorities from the jump.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you’re having trouble brainstorming keywords, simply open up the Instagram search bar and start typing words related to your business.</p></blockquote>
<h3>2. Establish KPIs to measure impact</h3>
<p>There’s one more question you need to answer before you start optimizing: How are you going to measure the impact of your Instagram SEO efforts? Measuring impact is an essential part of the process, as it enables you to determine which optimizations are (un)successful.</p>
<p>To set yourself up for success, make sure to establish a few key performance indicators (<a href="/blog/ws/2020/12/17/content-marketing-kpis">KPIs</a>). With Instagram Insights — the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/01/instagram-analytics">native analytics tool</a> that comes with your business profile — you can track KPIs such as these (both at the profile level and the individual post level):</p>
<ul>
<li>Impressions</li>
<li>Reach</li>
<li>Profile visits</li>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2016/10/19/get-more-instagram-followers">Followers</a></li>
<li>Website clicks</li>
</ul>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-seo-metrics-1.png" alt="instagram seo—reporting through instagram insights" width="400" height="713" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Via </em><a href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/4-ways-to-use-instagram-insights-to-improve-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Social Media Examiner</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Once you know which KPIs you’re going to track, you’ll be able to measure the impact yielded by your optimizations.</p>
<h3>3. Optimize your profile (username &amp; bio)</h3>
<p>Now that you know (1) which keywords you’re going to target and (2) how you’re going to track your ROI, it’s time to optimize both your profile as a whole and your individual posts.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with your profile as a whole — we’re going to optimize your username and your bio. (Remember when we said not all optimizations carry the same weight? Well, your username and your bio are the heavy hitters; optimizing these two assets can make a huge impact). Your username is straightforward: You need to incorporate the keyword you consider most valuable. Clearly, the person who owns this profile wants to rank for “gardening ideas.”</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-seo-gardening-ideas-tips-1.png" alt="instagram seo—keyword in username" width="400" height="710" /></div>
<p>For some of you, this may cause concern: What if you already have a well-established business name — one that doesn’t include your primary target keyword? Fortunately, Instagram allows you to differentiate between your business name and your username:</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-seo-homegardeninginstyle-1.png" alt="instagram seo—screenshot of profile with username and business name" width="400" height="713" /></div>
<p>If possible, try to incorporate both your brand name and your primary target keyword into your username. For example, if you were the owner of an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/05/ecommerce-digital-marketing">ecommerce business</a> called Nellie’s and you were trying to rank for “winter hats,” your Instagram username could be “winterhatsbynellie” or “nellieswinterhats.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/09/instagram-bios">Optimizing your Instagram bio</a> is equally straightforward: This is your opportunity to target any high-value keywords that didn’t quite make the cut for your username. The owner of this profile, for example, wants to rank for “gardening tips.”</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-seo-gardeningknowhow-gardening-tips-1.png" alt="instagram seo—keyword in bio description" width="400" height="710" /></div>
<p>With your username and bio optimized, your Instagram profile as a whole should be in good shape. Now, let’s wrap up by discussing the optimization of your individual posts.</p>
<h3>4. Optimize your individual posts (captions, hashtags)</h3>
<p>Is optimizing each individual post as important as optimizing your username and bio? No, probably not. But let’s recall the original example we used to illustrate Instagram SEO in action.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-seo-gardening-ideas-mylove.ins_-1.png" alt="instagram seo-keyword in caption" width="400" height="712" /></div>
<p>Had the person who posted this picture not used the caption to target “gardening ideas,” we may have never come across their profile, their website, or their products. That’s a big deal! And considering the minuscule effort required to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/23/instagram-captions">optimize your captions</a>, there’s no reason not to do it.</p>
<p>As you can see, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">hashtagging</a> played a role in getting this post to rank for “gardening ideas.” However, this clearly wasn’t the only keyword being targeted by the person behind the post.</p>
<p>In general, when you’re optimizing an individual post, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the main body of the caption to target a specific high-value keyword</li>
<li>Use hashtags to reinforce that keyword <strong>and </strong>target ancillary keywords</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, if you wanted to further optimize the post that ranks for “gardening ideas,” you could add a second sentence to the main body of the caption: “Gorgeous rooftop garden in New York. Check out our profile for more #gardeningideas!”</p>
<p>The more descriptive you are in your caption, the better optimized your post is for Instagram SEO. While the algorithm really only supports general terms right now, there&#8217;s no doubt in our minds that it will become more and more advanced over time.</p>
<p>And speaking of time, you may want to consider <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/01/best-time-to-post-on-instagram">posting at the right time</a> to gain favor with the Instagram algorithm.</p>
<h3>5. Add alt text to images</h3>
<p>You know about alt text for website and blog<a href="/blog/ws/2019/05/08/image-seo"> image optimization</a>, but you may not know that you can add it for your Insta images too. Once you&#8217;ve added an image and are brought to the caption screen, head to the bottom and select &#8220;Advanced Settings&#8221;.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-seo-alt-text-1.png" alt="how to add alt text to images for instagram seo" width="400" height="568" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://later.com/blog/instagram-seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>Scroll down to the &#8220;Accessibility&#8221; section and add your alt text from there.</p>
<p>Not only does this make your posts <a href="/blog/ws/2021/04/30/email-accessibility">accessible</a>, but it also enhances your Instagram SEO.</p>
<h2>Don’t neglect Instagram SEO!</h2>
<p>Instagram SEO is a no-cost, high-impact tactic for anyone who wants to grow their reach, increase traffic to their profile/website, and drive more conversions. It may not yield the same volume of results as paid advertising, but the potential ROI is staggering. If you’re committed to using social media as an engine of growth for your business, Instagram SEO is a no-brainer.</p>

<p>Your business is shaped, in part, by the competitive landscape in which it operates.</p>
<p>Here’s a fun way to think about it: Your business is a band, and your competitive landscape is its historical context. Joy Division—one of the most celebrated post-punk bands to come out of the UK—was shaped, in part, by trailblazers like The Stooges. In turn, when you listen to the early work of The Cure, Joy Division’s influence is clear.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em>A simple snapshot of a hypothetical competitive landscape.</em></p>
<p>If you want to understand a legendary musical act, you have to take a long, hard look at the other artists around them. And if you want to understand your business—your strengths, your weaknesses, your opportunities for differentiation and growth—you have to pay close attention to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/18/ppc-competitor-analysis">your competitors</a>. Failure to engage in what’s known as <strong>competitive analysis</strong> may result in poor decision-making, missed opportunities for revenue, and reduced market share.</p>
<p>This is an introductory guide to conducting competitive analysis across search and social. Once we’ve defined competitive analysis, we’ll discuss the basics of evaluating your competitors through the lenses of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/learn">PPC</a>, SEO, and social media marketing.</p>
<h2>What is a marketing competitive analysis?</h2>
<p>A marketing competitive analysis is the ongoing process of scrutinizing your competitors in relation to your own business. It’s the act of examining each company in your market and determining how you stack up in terms of product, marketing, sales, copy, and more.</p>
<p>The goal is to draw conclusions that simplify the decision-making process. If your analysis of Competitor A leads you to the conclusion that you have a clear advantage in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">organic search</a>, you may decide — for the time being — to focus on making improvements to your paid media strategy. Had you not taken the time to draw this conclusion, you may have invested limited marketing resources in suboptimal fashion.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em>The <a href="/blog/ws/2017/12/20/swot-analysis">SWOT</a> format is one way to organize insights gleaned from a competitive analysis.</em></p>
<p>Competitive analysis can (and should) be applied to every facet of your business, but for now, we’re going to focus exclusively on digital marketing. Hopefully, if you’re able to take the ideas shared below and formalize them with processes and templates, folks from other parts of your organization will have a head start.</p>
<h2>Marketing competitive analysis: search engine marketing</h2>
<p>PPC and SEO each have their own benefits and drawbacks; generally speaking, it behooves you to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/11/seo-and-ppc">strike a balance between the two</a>. Plus, I’m willing to bet that each of your competitors is, to some extent, investing in one of these channels—if not both.</p>
<h3>Competitive analysis for PPC</h3>
<p>Our PPC competitive analysis consists of three key focus areas: keywords, positioning, and offers.</p>
<h4>Keywords</h4>
<p>Your closest competitor is your closest competitor because they sell a product or service that’s similar to yours. It follows, then, that they’re probably bidding on many of the same <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/articles/ultimate-guide-to-keyword-competition">keywords</a> that you’re bidding on. (And if you’re in a particularly competitive market, they may even be <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/26/competitive-ads">bidding on your brand name</a>.)</p>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Always good to be on the lookout for stuff like this.</em></p>
<p>To get your competitive analysis started, there are a few questions to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Which keywords are you winning?</strong> As you review the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/09/competitor-keywords">keywords you have in common with your competitor</a>, take note of your strongest performers. Which metric(s) you use to identify your strongest performers is entirely up to you. By no means should you get complacent about these keywords — on any given day, your competitor might be brainstorming various ways to overtake you on the SERP — but it doesn’t make much sense to spend your time trying to fix something that isn’t broken.</li>
<li><strong>Which keywords are you losing? </strong>Using the same metric(s) you used to identify your strongest performers, take note of your not-so-strong performers. Keep in mind that your top keywords are evidence of your ability to beat your competitor in the paid search results. So, what’s going wrong here? Whether you need to tighten up your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/ad-groups">ad groups</a> or refresh your landing page copy, make sure to identify at least one concrete way to get more value out of these under-performing keywords.</li>
<li><strong>Which keywords are up for grabs? </strong>Because your prospects are typing never-before-seen queries into the Google search bar every single day, you should always be on the lookout for new keywords that neither you nor your competitor are taking advantage of. Picture yourself claiming the top spot for a keyword that’s not yet even on your competitor’s radar. What’s better than that?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Positioning</h4>
<p>Beating your closest competitor in the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/04/18/underused-ppc-strategies">paid search </a>results for all the best keywords is pointless if you’re unable to position your<a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product"> product or service </a>effectively. Plus, if your lackluster messaging translates into poor click-through rates, it won’t be long before your top impression share begins to decline.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="de944464-5a15-463e-b519-0c82c5d75e79" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/competitive-analysis-positioning-1.png" alt="competitive analysis positioning" width="800" height="594" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Top impression share = Top impressions / Opportunities for top impressions</em></p>
<p>Here are some questions to consider during the positioning portion of your competitive analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What does your competitor tend to emphasize in their ad copy? </strong>Whether their messaging tends to focus on features or outcomes, understanding how they position themselves enables you to differentiate your product or service. If, for example, your competitor emphasizes the comprehensiveness of their solution, you might consider emphasizing the <em>intuitiveness </em>of your solution. What’s important is that you’re using competitive analysis to ensure your messaging isn’t run-of-the-mill.</li>
<li><strong>Has your competitor’s emphasis recently changed? </strong>Here’s where the <em>ongoing </em>part of competitive analysis really comes into play. Staying on top of your competitor’s positioning in the paid search results enables you to pick up on any changes they make—changes that may indicate a new direction and/or revenue stream. As some of you may know from experience, getting blind-sided is the last thing any of us wants.</li>
<li><strong>Where are your competitor’s gaps? </strong>As you get better and better with competitive analysis, you may start to notice gaps in your competitor’s positioning — specific pain points or outcomes or features that they fail to address with their PPC ad copy. Take a look at the search queries that are triggering both your ads and your competitor’s ads. Are your prospects searching for something that’s nowhere to be found in your competitor’s ad copy? Something that you can speak to and use to drive traffic?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Offers</h4>
<p>Positioning, though important, isn’t the only factor your prospects consider when evaluating the paid search results. If you want to turn those impressions into clicks—and direct clicks <em>away </em>from your competitor—you need to create valuable and differentiated offers.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="dae198bb-5fb9-4629-b1f3-3970720cc504" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/competitive-analysis-offers-1.png" alt="competitive analysis offers" width="758" height="506" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Which offers do you and your competitor have in common? </strong>Two businesses bidding on the same keywords as one another are likely to rely on similar offers: free shipping (ecommerce websites), free trials (D2C brands), demos (B2B companies), etc. Because certain types of offers work well for certain types of businesses, it’s inevitable that you’ll have some degree of overlap. Making note of which offers both you and your competitor are using enables you to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/13/adwords-ad-variations">experiment with your PPC ads</a>. And if you’re wondering what I mean by that …</li>
<li><strong>Do you see opportunities to experiment with your <a href="/blog/ws/2017/01/12/how-to-write-great-advertising-copy">ad copy</a>? </strong>Today’s PPC ads would look pretty foreign to someone who hasn’t used the internet since 2012. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/02/ppc-ad-headlines">Headlines</a> are longer, descriptions are richer, and extensions are more diverse. As search ads expand, marketers have more and more opportunities to try new placements of their offers—and, in the process, differentiate themselves from their competitors. If your competitor is constantly placing their offers at the end of their headlines, do something different! Not all experiments will be successful, but failing to stand out is a much worse fate.</li>
<li><strong>Are your competitor’s offers aligned with keyword intent? </strong>The effectiveness of an offer is determined, in part, by how well (or poorly) it aligns with the intent of the prospect. If you’re marketing car insurance, it doesn’t make much sense to offer a free quote to someone searching “how does car insurance work.” Take note of any instances where your competitor’s offer is out of sync with keyword intent — these are opportunities to put appropriate, differentiated offers front-and-center in your PPC ads.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Marketing competitive analysis for SEO</h3>
<p>Our SEO competitive analysis also consists of three key focus areas: keywords, backlinks, and SERP features.</p>
<h4>Keywords</h4>
<p>Although, mechanically speaking, PPC and SEO are different, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords">keywords</a> essentially play the same role across these two disciplines: we target them in hopes of <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">driving traffic to our sites</a>.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="348db01f-d0c9-4bee-a501-422e943dffb8" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/competitive-analysis-organic-paid-1.png" alt="competitive analysis organic paid" width="800" height="321" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>As such, our three basic questions for getting your competitive wheels spinning are the same:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Which keywords are you winning? </strong>In terms of metrics, this question is more straightforward than its PPC equivalent: For which (non-branded) keywords are you outranking your competitor? Again, the purpose of identifying these keywords is not to justify complacency, but rather to simplify the task of setting priorities. You probably don’t have time to optimize your website content for every single keyword.</li>
<li><strong>Which keywords are you losing? </strong>Unless you’re HubSpot or Wikipedia, you’re probably getting outranked by your competitor for certain high-value keywords. Again, you’ve proven that you can win the SERPs in your niche. So, take a look at the under-performing content and come up with some ways to improve your rankings: write additional copy, compress images to improve page speed, increase keyword density, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Which keywords are up for grabs? </strong>Same story here: Every day brings new, unique <a href="/blog/ws/2011/05/25/keywords-vs-search-queries">search queries</a> that no one has ever searched before. It’s not enough to merely play catch-up on the keywords you’re already losing; you’ve got to stay on top of emerging keywords that neither you nor your competitor are targeting. SEO software is useful towards this end, but don’t forget about Google Search Console. If you dive into the queries that are <a href="/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">driving traffic to your site,</a> you’ll probably find valuable keywords that you’ve yet to directly target with a focused piece of content.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Backlinks</h4>
<p>There’s more to SEO than keyword targeting. If you want to be the leader in your market in the organic search results, you need a strong profile of links pointing to your site from high-quality sources (i.e., trusted websites in related or adjacent markets).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="891db31f-8a89-4973-8e24-6299064e07a3" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/competitive-analysis-backlinks-1.png" alt="competitive analysis backlinks" width="800" height="361" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>An overview of Wikipedia’s backlink profile, according to SEMrush.</em></p>
<p>That’s why <a href="/blog/ws/2020/12/10/link-building-secrets">backlinks</a> are the second focus area in our SEO competitive analysis. Keeping in mind that you’ll need a third-party SEO tool to answer the following questions, ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How does your volume of backlinks compare with that of your competitor? </strong>Though quality trumps quantity when we’re talking about backlinks, it’s worthwhile to do a quick volume comparison between you and your competitor. Why? Say, for example, that your competitor tends to outrank you for high-value keywords, but you discover that you’ve accumulated nearly twice as many backlinks as they have. This is useful information, as it may indicate that, on average, your competitor attracts higher-quality links than you do.</li>
<li><strong>Who links to your competitor, and why? </strong>Regardless of any differences in volume, you should know, in a broad sense, which domains link to your competitor—as well as <em>why </em>those domains link to your competitor. At a glance, it should be fairly easy to determine why a certain domain has chosen to give your competitor a backlink. If it’s a publisher that covers stories and topics related to your market, they’ve probably deemed your competitor to be a worthwhile resource for their readers. If it’s an odd-looking domain that has nothing whatsoever to do with your market, it’s probably a useless, spammy link that’s unworthy of your time.</li>
<li><strong>Can you identify any untapped opportunities? </strong>In keeping with an emerging theme of this blog post, you must always keep your eyes peeled for untapped opportunities—i.e., worthwhile domains that link to neither you nor your competitor. Say you sell homemade coffee mugs through your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/08/how-to-build-an-ecommerce-website">ecommerce site </a>and you come across a popular publisher with an article titled “The 24 Best Coffee Mugs We Can Find on the Internet.” If neither you nor your competitor is mentioned in the article, that may be a good opportunity to contact the publisher and ask if they’d consider reviewing your mugs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>SERP features</h4>
<p>As satisfying as it is to outrank your competitor on high-value keywords, winning special features on the SERP—most notably the featured snippet, among others—is another way to gain a competitive advantage in your market (and an increasingly prevalent one, I might add).</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0145af44-9b55-4160-b949-957129dbfea0" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/competitive-analysis-serp-features-1.png" alt="Competitive analysis SERP features" width="800" height="441" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>To wrap up the SEO section of our competitive analysis, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do you own a SERP feature for any keywords? </strong>Whether it’s a featured snippet, an answer to a related question, or a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/05/14/how-to-get-more-views-on-youtube">YouTube video</a> that surfaces in the search results, you may own a SERP feature for a high-value keyword without even realizing it. If that’s the case, it’s worth taking the time to formulate an educated guess as to <em>why </em>you own that feature — so you can try to replicate whatever it is you did correctly!</li>
<li><strong>Does your competitor own a SERP feature for any keywords? </strong>Another good use of your time is finding the keywords for which your <em>competitor </em>owns a SERP feature. Say there’s a particularly valuable keyword that both you and your competitor are targeting and they’re the ones who own the featured snippet. Ugh. But, wait a minute — in addition to a featured snippet, the SERP for that keyword also includes YouTube videos, and neither you nor your competitor has created a targeted video. If YouTube is part of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/12/01/b2b-content-marketing">content marketing strategy,</a> perhaps it should be a priority to make that video ASAP.</li>
<li><strong>Can you edit your content to win any untapped opportunities for SERP features? </strong>Last but not least, do some digging and see if there are any keywords that (1) both you and your competitor are targeting and (2) do not trigger certain SERP features you’ve deemed desirable and/or attainable. Can you restructure a piece of content to make it a better candidate for a featured snippet? Can you update a piece of content with ancillary keywords to make a run for the related questions feature? Can you rename one of your YouTube videos to give it a better chance of surfacing on the SERP for a certain keyword? Be competitive and strategic with your optimizations!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Marketing competitive analysis: social media</h2>
<p>Congratulations! Thanks to the power of competitive analysis, you are now better positioned to go head-to-head with your rival in the search results—both paid and organic.</p>
<p>Search engine marketing is powerful because it enables you to provide value to your prospects when they’re using the internet with intent (whether it’s educational intent, commercial intent, or something in between). But, what about those times when your <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/26/prospecting-strategies-ppc-agencies">prospects</a> are using the internet <em>without </em>any kind of intent?</p>

<p>That’s where <a href="/blog/ws/2016/01/11/social-media-marketing-tips">social media marketing </a>comes into play. The value of social media marketing is a subject worthy of its own blog post—perhaps its own blog—but for now we’ll focus on one central concern:</p>
<p>Because you have limited time to optimize your <a href="/blog/ws/2019/04/05/social-media-marketing-strategy">social media marketing strategy</a>, you need to understand what your competitor is and is not doing — as well as what these insights reveal in terms of opportunities for differentiation and growth.</p>
<p>Your guide to conducting a basic social media marketing competitive analysis is broken, unsurprisingly, into three key focus areas: channels, paid content, and organic content.</p>
<h3>Channels</h3>
<p>Throughout the PPC and SEO sections of our competitive analysis guide, it was safe to assume we were talking about Google and Bing; the vast majority of internet search activity is, after all, handled by these two companies.</p>
<p>Social media is a different story. Yes, Instagram&#8217;s parent company Facebook is a tech giant on par with the likes of Google and Microsoft (which owns Bing). Nevertheless, the range of social media channels available to digital marketers is far greater than the range of (worthwhile) search engines available to digital marketers.</p>

</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Via <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/5194/active-users-of-social-networks-and-messaging-services/">Statista</a>.</em></p>
<p>So, even if you’re a B2B marketer who could not care less about Snapchat or <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/11/advertising-on-tiktok">TikTok</a>, let’s begin our competitive analysis with a few considerations related to channels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Where are you and your competitor active? </strong>Obviously, the answer to this question is going to depend, in large part, on the kind of business you’re marketing. Whereas someone marketing a D2C brand may focus primarily on Instagram and TikTok, a marketer at a B2B consulting company may care exclusively about LinkedIn and Twitter. No matter what, it’s useful at the outset of your analysis to get a general sense of which <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business">channel(s)</a> you and your competitor have taken most seriously up until this point. If you’re both publishing amazing content on LinkedIn, but neither of you is doing anything interesting on Twitter, think about how you can start providing more value to your followers on the latter platform.</li>
<li><strong>Which channel promises the greatest opportunity for growth? </strong>If you’re in a situation where both you and your competitor are crushing it on one channel and coming up short on another, then this is an easy question to answer: the latter channel is likely the one that promises the greatest opportunity for growth. But things are seldom so black and white—and if you’re in a competitive <a href="/blog/ws/2014/10/28/niche-marketing">niche</a>, you’re probably going up against people who know what they’re doing. So, to dig a bit deeper, ask yourself: Recently, across the channels where you’re active, which has been delivering the best results, and which has been the most stagnant? Have you noticed a steady increase in Instagram video views as your Facebook engagement has leveled off? Whatever it is, trust your data and your gut to tell you which channel to prioritize.</li>
<li><strong>Are there any emerging channels you should be using? </strong>Though this final question isn’t of equal importance to every marketer, the explosive growth of TikTok in the final moments of the 2010s illustrates just how rapidly a new social media channel can rise to prominence (or even dominance). Given your niche and the level of competition you’re up against, your competitive success in the coming years may depend, in part, on your ability to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-build-web-presence-captures-customers-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">establish a presence</a> on the emerging channel that’s generating buzz. Though you shouldn’t throw money at something purely because it’s shiny and new, you know what they say about early adopters.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Paid content</h3>
<p>There’s more than one way to get value out of a social media channel—quite a few, actually. But, in the most general sense, marketers have two (non-mutually exclusive) options: paid content and organic content.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="8e5885f6-e29e-4a06-9e1b-d8411462b5a0" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Paid content on LinkedIn.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the former, here are three questions to mull over:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why is your competitor running social ads? </strong>Without espionage (which is never justifiable), you can’t answer this question definitively—and that’s fine. Pay close attention to the types of ads they’re running, the tone of their <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/16/copywriting-formulas">copy</a>, the CTAs they’re using, and so on. Based on these observations, would you say they’re focused primarily on <a href="/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">brand awareness</a>?<a href="/blog/ws/2019/10/17/b2b-lead-generation"> Lead generation</a>? In-store conversions? The answer will almost certainly change over time—perhaps seasonally, depending on what kind of market you’re in—and that’s the beauty of regularly conducting competitive analysis. Picking up on these changes and trends gives you an incredible degree of insight into your competitor’s strategy.</li>
<li><strong>How does your competitor position themselves in their social ads? </strong>Recall the positioning section of our PPC competitive analysis. As part of your <a href="/blog/ws/2019/09/03/copywriting-examples">copywriting</a> process, take the time to understand how your competitor is positioning themselves in their social ads. What<a href="/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points"> pain points</a> do they tend to address? What features or outcomes do they tend to emphasize? Are there any gaps in their messaging that you can fill in? Because paid search and paid social are so fundamentally different, the copy your competitor writes for Google might be worlds apart from the copy they write for Facebook. And remember: the purpose of this exercise is not to imitate, but rather to ensure that your copy isn’t stale.</li>
<li><strong>What kinds of offers is your competitor making to prospects? </strong>When we discussed offers during our PPC competitive analysis, our focus was on matching keyword intent. Keyword intent, of course, doesn’t really exist on social. So, when you analyze the offers your competitor is making to their social prospects, use that intel to make an educated guess as to <em>what kinds of prospects </em>they’re going after. Is your competitor in the legal services market using their social ads to offer an ungated educational video? They’re probably targeting cold audiences with the intent of spreading awareness. Is your competitor in the hospitality market using their social ads to offer discounted rates? They’re probably targeting warm audiences with the intent of driving conversions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Organic content</h3>
<p>As effective as social ads can be, you’re doing yourself a disservice if you’re overlooking organic content entirely. You can only throw around a certain amount of money per month, and non-paid content typically gives businesses greater flexibility to engage their audiences in unique and creative ways.</p>

<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/competitive-analysis-organic-content-1.png" alt="Competitive analysis organic content" width="600" height="493" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Organic content on Twitter.</em></p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s wrap up our competitive analysis with three final questions to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is your competitor doing with their organic content? </strong>Organic social content comes in many shapes and sizes. Some marketers use it to start conversations with their customers and prospects. Others use it to publish <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/15/quality-content-defined">original content</a> that can’t be found anywhere else—almost like a second blog or YouTube channel. Marketers who are particularly crunched for time use organic social primarily to post links. Once you’ve determined what your competitor is doing with their organic content, you’ll have the intel you need to do something better. Are they primarily posting links? Great—start posting thought-provoking content. Are they neglecting to interact with users? Awesome—go fill that gap while you still have the chance.</li>
<li><strong>How much engagement does your competitor get from users? </strong>As you’re evaluating your competitor’s organic social feeds to determine what kind of content they’re publishing, you should also take note of the engagement they’re getting. If it seems that they’re making an honest effort to share original, valuable content, but their engagement numbers are unimpressive, that may indicate something significant about your shared audience. Is your competitor speaking to a pain point that users don’t actually care about? Are they packaging their content in a format that users find unappealing? You can learn a lot from the performance of your competitor’s organic content.</li>
<li><strong>Where are your competitor’s content gaps? </strong>This is essentially the same question we asked at the end of the positioning section of our PPC competitive analysis. Based on what you know about your audience—pain points that keep them up at night, features they want, outcomes they’re working towards—can you identify anything that your competitor is failing to address with their organic social content? To put it in more general terms, how can you use your organic content to provide value that your audience isn’t getting from your competitor?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Make it a habit to conduct your marketing competitive analysis!</h2>
<p>At the risk of beating a dead horse, I’ll say it one more time: Competitive analysis, whether you’re focused on PPC, SEO, social media marketing, or some combination thereof, is an ongoing process. Can one-off insights here and there be helpful? Of course. But when you make it a habit to regularly conduct competitive analysis over time, you begin to pick up on patterns, trends, strategic shifts—the kinds of insights that can truly make an impact.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN">In a world that’s <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/digital-marketing-platforms/video-marketing/video-marketing-statistics-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly dominated by video</a>, getting more views on YouTube should be near (if not at) the top of every content marketer’s to-do list. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Before you say it, allow me to address the elephant in the room: YouTube views don’t keep the lights on. If you’re hesitant to dedicate time and resources to a channel that doesn’t drive direct ROI, you’re not alone. Plenty of marketers—under pressure to meet short-term targets—prefer to forgo YouTube and invest everything they have in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/22/combine-ppc-with-social-media">paid search and paid social</a>.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">I empathize with these folks—I really do. But we need to acknowledge a hard truth: Without a healthy volume of top-of-funnel prospects, you won’t be able to consistently meet your targets over the long term. <strong>You need to create content that spreads awareness of your company and builds affinity for your brand.</strong></span></p>

</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">Like so.</span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">YouTube is the perfect place to publish that content. And with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/02/marketing-during-covid-19">the COVID-19 crisis</a> making it unusually difficult to sell, now is a good time to focus on that top-of-funnel prospect pool.</span></p>

<h2><span lang="EN">1. Make good content (that nobody else is making)</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Yup. This is it. This is my number one tip for getting more views on YouTube.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Make good content. Make content that nobody else is making.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">I’ve made this my number one tip as a matter of principle. If you look hard enough—and you really don’t need to look that hard—you can find all kinds of nefarious and dishonest ways to increase your YouTube views. I know you fine folks wouldn’t think of stooping so low, but it’s important to me that we’re on the same page from the jump.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">The best way to succeed on YouTube is to create videos that people want to watch—and watch all the way through, I might add. In a word, it’s all about <strong>value</strong>. If you’re unwilling to provide value to your viewers, you’re unfit for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/12/28/content-marketing-advice">content marketing</a>. It’s that simple.</span></p>

<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em><span lang="EN">There’s a reason Moz has found success on YouTube.</span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">YouTube, much like parent company Google, is a search engine at its core. And what, my friends, is a search engine designed to do? <strong>Direct users to the best, most relevant content possible</strong>. That’s why Google is constantly <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/08/core-updates.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advising SEOs</a> to focus on creating value for their site visitors. In this respect, YouTube is no different.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Talk to your prospects. Find out what keeps them up at night. Use that (as well as these <a href="/blog/ws/2020/12/03/underrated-youtube-metrics">underrated YouTube metrics</a>) to inform your videos. Let everyone else depend on tricks and hacks.</span></p>
<p>Speaking of metrics, check out these four <span lang="EN"><a href="/blog/ws/2021/05/20/youtube-studio-reports">YouTube studio reports you won&#8217;t find in Google Ads.</a></span></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f3a5.png" alt="🎥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Get video marketing ideas for every month of the year &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/marketing-calendar?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2025MarketingCalendar_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links">The Mega Must-Have Marketing Calendar</a></p>
<div id="think-about-youtube-series"></div>
<h2><span lang="EN">2. Think in terms of series, not individual videos</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">A lot of YouTube creators organize their videos into playlists. Why is that?</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">The explanation is simple: If you click on a video that’s embedded in a playlist, the next video in that playlist will automatically start as soon as the current video ends. As a result, a viewer can watch several related videos without lifting a finger. This, of course, makes YouTube happy, as it translates into greater ad revenue. But it should also make <em>you </em>happy, as it translates into greater engagement and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/30/facebook-video-views">more video views</a>.</span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20series.png" alt="how to get more views on youtube series" width="400" height="478" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p><span lang="EN">It goes without saying that compiling a bunch of unrelated videos into a giant playlist makes for a bad user experience. Instead, I recommend brainstorming your YouTube content not in terms of individual videos, but rather in terms of <strong>series</strong>. That way, as time goes on and you create more content, it’s easy to organize your videos into logical playlists. Your viewers will benefit from a seamless, enjoyable experience, and <em>you</em> will benefit from an uptick in views. Win-win!</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Here’s an example. If I were marketing, say, a baseball academy, I would focus on creating a handful of video series: one about pitching, one about batting, one about playing in the outfield, and so on. Brainstorming with this framework from the outset is a great way to set yourself up for YouTube success.</span></p>
<div id="learn-youtube-seo"></div>
<h2><span lang="EN">3. Get familiar with YouTube SEO</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Like I said: YouTube is a search engine. And just like any other search engine, YouTube uses a handful of ranking signals to organize its search results. Understanding <a href="/blog/ws/2021/06/10/youtube-seo-tips">YouTube SEO</a>, the major ranking signals—and how to appeal to them—is a crucial part of getting more views on YouTube.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">First things first: You need <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/14/youtube-keyword-research">keywords</a>. Without target keywords, there’s nothing to optimize for. Once you’ve made a list of the topics you want to address (thinking in terms of series!), go ahead and type them—one by one—into the YouTube search bar. As you’ve probably seen before, YouTube will generate a list of suggested search queries. Each of these suggestions is something that’s been searched over and over again by real YouTube users. Each of them, in other words, is a great candidate for a target keyword!<br />
</span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20seo.png" alt="how to get more views on youtube seo" width="400" height="351" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p><span lang="EN">It’s important to note that some keywords are more competitive—i.e., harder to rank for—than others. With WordStream’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords">Free Keyword Tool</a>, you can get a sense of how competitive each of your keywords is. Although the tool pulls data from Google and Bing—not YouTube—it’s nonetheless an effective way to gauge the level of difficulty you’re dealing with.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Once you’ve got your keywords in order, it’s time to optimize. Let’s briefly walk through the major YouTube ranking signals you need to be cognizant of.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/first-page-of-google?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_10WaysFirstPageGoogle_Download">10 Tangible &amp; Free Ways to Get on the First Page of Google</a></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">SEO for YouTube video titles</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">When deciding where to place your video in the search results for a particular query, YouTube looks at a number of attributes—the most important one being your <strong>video title</strong>. Plain and simple, if you want your video to rank for a given keyword, that keyword needs to appear in the title—ideally at the <em>beginning </em>of the title, as there’s <a href="https://backlinko.com/how-to-rank-youtube-videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anecdotal evidence</a> to suggest that starting your title with your target keyword can drive a small bump in rankings.</span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20title20seo_0.png" alt="how to get more views on youtube title seo" width="800" height="238" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p><span lang="EN">Note that there should be more to your title than <em>just </em>the target keyword. Ranking is important, but it doesn’t guarantee clicks. We’ll talk more about enticing users with your video titles later on in this guide.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">SEO for YouTube video descriptions</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">The second attribute you need to optimize is your <strong>video description</strong>. Though not as essential as your title, your description is taken into consideration when the search results are being organized. Make sure to include your target keyword at least once!</span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20description.png" alt="how to get more views on youtube description" width="800" height="211" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p><span lang="EN">There’s a difference between keyword <em>targeting </em>and keyword <em>stuffing</em>. It’s important to mention your keyword and demonstrate relevance to YouTube, but you shouldn’t harp on it to the point of writing bad copy.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">SEO for YouTube video tags</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">The final attributes I want to mention before moving on to our fourth tip are your <strong>video tags</strong>. Unlike your title and your description, your tags are invisible to YouTube users (except for those who use a special Chrome extension, such as <a href="https://vidiq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vidIQ</a>). You’re not required to tag your videos, but you absolutely should—it’s an easy, harmless way to further demonstrate your relevance to YouTube’s algorithms.<br />
</span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20video20tags.png" alt="how to get more views on youtube video tags" width="800" height="338" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p><span lang="EN">As you can see here, it’s advisable that you use your video tags to target your primary keyword as well as close variations of it. This will help you rank for search queries that don’t literally contain your target keyword, yet signify the same basic intent.</span></p>
<p>Note: YouTube Video tags are different from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/20/youtube-hashtags">YouTube hashtags</a>—which are also important in your video strategy!</p>
<div id="connect-with-youtube-creators"></div>
<h2><span lang="EN">4. Link up with other content creators</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Just because you and another content creator are going after the same audience, doesn’t mean your relationship needs to be adversarial. In fact, I’d encourage you to forge a <strong>symbiotic </strong>relationship—i.e., a relationship that benefits both of you. Keep in mind that the ultimate goal of YouTube content marketing is to create value for viewers and expand your pool of top-of-funnel prospects. If you ask me, your capacity to accomplish that goal is in no way diminished by the presence of a competitor.</span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20content20creators.png" alt="how to get more views on youtube content creators" width="800" height="523" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em><span lang="EN">Throwback to a great collaboration between </span></em><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM5hIhxyOUo"><em>WordStream and Hanapin</em></a><em>!</em></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">So, how do you get more YouTube views while establishing symbiosis with another content creator who’s targeting the same audience? Simple: You create a piece of content <strong>together</strong>. If, for example, you were to appear as a guest star in one of your competitor’s videos, you would benefit from the exposure to a group of users who may not have previously encountered your brand. At the same time, your <em>competitor </em>would benefit from the additional traffic driven by your promotion of the video. All the while, YouTube users benefit from a stellar piece of content. In this scenario, everybody wins!</span></p>
<div id="use-youtube-cards"></div>
<h2><span lang="EN">5. Use cards and end screens</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Watch time is a fantastic indicator of viewer engagement. In general, the further someone gets into your YouTube video, the more interested they are in whatever it is you’re saying. And if someone is highly engaged with your content, it follows that they’re open to watching more of your videos. That’s why our fifth tactic for getting more YouTube views is taking advantage of cards and end screens. Let’s take a quick look at each feature.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Cards</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">A YouTube card is a banner-esque notification that appears in the top right corner of your video and alerts your viewers to a related piece of content. It’s an easy, effective way to capitalize on high user engagement and promote another video without diminishing the quality of the viewer experience.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Think of each card as the YouTube equivalent of an internal link within one of your blog posts. Although, yes, you’re being self-promotional, you’re also directing your viewers to a piece of content that they can benefit from. Once again, we have a win-win scenario.</span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20cards.png" alt="how to get more views on youtube cards" width="800" height="539" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<h3><span lang="EN">End screens</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">An end screen, much like a card, is meant to direct your most engaged viewers to a related piece of content. As the name suggests, an end screen appears as your video is winding down.</span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20end20screen.png" alt="how to get more views on youtube end screen" width="800" height="528" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p><span lang="EN">In addition to promoting a video or two, I suggest using an end screen to encourage your viewers to subscribe. The more subscribers you accumulate, the more people YouTube will notify when you upload a new video.</span></p>
<div id="write-accompanying-blog-post"></div>
<h2><span lang="EN">6. Write a blog post to accompany each video</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">If <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/24/blogging-tips">blogging</a> is already part of your content marketing strategy—and it should be—why not write a blog post to accompany each of your YouTube videos? Yes, this <em>does </em>require an additional time investment, but the benefits far outweigh the costs. It’s an easy way to introduce your website visitors to your YouTube channel and drive an increase in viewership. Plus, for all those prospects who would rather watch than read, the inclusion of a video is a surefire way to improve the quality of the user experience. And since you’re already sitting down to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/12/video-scripts">write a script</a>, the additional effort required to create a corresponding blog post is extremely low.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Here&#8217;s an example of this from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/03/31/negative-match-types">one of our own blog posts:</a></span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/get20more20youtube20views20use20with20blog.png" alt="get more youtube views use with blog" width="800" height="541" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em><span lang="EN">Accompanying each YouTube video with a blog post is a super easy win.</span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">On top of all that, let’s not forget the potential SEO benefits. As Search Engine Land columnist Wesley Young <a href="https://searchengineland.com/rise-video-8-tips-boost-sites-seo-227498" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed out</a> all the way back in 2015, “video is evidence of quality content, and as part of a media mix on a site, it helps send signals to search engines that your page or site contains rich media relevant to search requests.” In other words, embedding a YouTube video at the end of a blog post is an effective way to tell Google and Bing that you’re going the extra mile to provide value to users. In return, you could be rewarded with an improvement in ranking!</span></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Looking for more ways to promote your business?</strong> Download now &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite30BestWaysToPromote.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Marketing_The30BestWaysToPromoteYourBusiness_Download">30+ Ways to Promote Your Business (On Any Budget!)</a></p>
<div id="add-timestamp-in-youtube-descriptions"></div>
<h2><span lang="EN">7. Add timestamps to your video descriptions</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">The YouTube search bar isn’t the only channel for users hoping to discover relevant content. Indeed, it’s quite common for people to stumble upon YouTube videos by way of Google. This shouldn’t be too surprising, as many queries yield videos in the search results.</span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20timestamp_0.png" alt="how to get more views on youtube timestamp" width="800" height="672" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p><span lang="EN">To help search users more easily find the information they’re looking for, Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/key-moments-video-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in September 2019 that they’ll link to key moments in YouTube videos directly on the SERP. If you include timestamp information in your video description, Google will use that to highlight important moments and direct viewers where they want to go. Here’s how it looks in action</span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20timestamp2_1.png" alt="how to get more views on youtube timestamp2" width="275" height="552" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p><span lang="EN">Assuming you don’t want to lose potential viewers who are particularly crunched for time, including timestamp information in your YouTube video descriptions is a no-brainer. There’s nothing quite as powerful as a stellar user experience, and this feature is a relatively easy way to delight prospective customers. Take advantage of it ASAP!</span></p>
<div id="promote-videos-on-social-media"></div>
<h2><span lang="EN">8. Get the word out on social media</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Nothing groundbreaking here, folks—sometimes the basic stuff yields the best results. A key step towards getting more views on YouTube is using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">social media</a> to promote new content.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Here’s the problem: This is the one item on our list that <em>everyone </em>does. Not everyone knows about YouTube SEO. Not everyone is willing to link up with a competitor. Not everyone cares about producing legitimately valuable content.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Juuuust about everyone uses social media to promote their YouTube videos. And that’s why it’s so important to get creative with your tactics. Let’s talk about three steps you can take to ensure that you stand out on social.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Give your followers a substantial preview</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">For reasons I’ll never understand, some marketers believe that the key to success—whether in the form of views, clicks, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/11/get-more-conversions">conversions</a>, or whatever—is to give away as little as possible. These folks will encourage you to give your social media followers the scarcest preview imaginable, so as to not … dilute the actual product, I guess? Like I said, I’ve never understood the rationale.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Regardless, I think this philosophy is utter nonsense. You can’t succeed with content marketing if you’re unwilling to be generous with your insights—not only because you’ll miss out on opportunities to build brand affinity, but also because you’ll fail to actually promote your content. Why should someone leave Twitter and head to YouTube if they’re unsure that your video will actually help them? If you want to stop people in their tracks and get them to watch the entirety of your YouTube video, you need to give them a substantial preview on social.</span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20preview.png" alt="how to get more views on youtube preview" width="500" height="487" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em><span lang="EN">Promote your YouTube videos in the way Brian Dean promotes his blog posts.</span></em></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Join the conversation</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Another great way to promote a YouTube video via social media is to find people who are already talking about whatever it is your video addresses. These folks wouldn’t be talking to one another if they didn’t care about the matter at hand, so it stands to reason that they’d be open to checking out your content.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Let’s say you own an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/08/how-to-build-an-ecommerce-website">ecommerce website</a> that sells plants and garden-related products. You recently published a YouTube video that shows viewers how to properly grow tomatoes. Now, take a look at this:</span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20twitter.png" alt="how to get more views on youtube twitter" width="500" height="194" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p><span lang="EN">I found this tweet by searching “grow tomatoes” on Twitter. If you were trying to get more views for your how-to video, why not reply to this user with a link? It’s targeting marketing—for free!</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Reach out to industry influencers</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">One last tip for social media promotion: If there are individuals in your industry with large, dedicated followings, try to get in touch with them! Getting an endorsement from a relevant influencer—even something as simple as a retweet—can do wonders for your brand authority. And when you’re trying to grow a business through content marketing, authority is everything.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Believe it or not, there are influencers everywhere—not exclusively in the worlds of fashion and fitness. Let’s stick with the example of a garden-related ecommerce website. Google “gardening blog” and you’ll likely stumble upon a website called <a href="http://yougrowgirl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You Grow Girl</a>—a blog about plants, food, and artwork. The woman behind the site, <a href="https://twitter.com/yougrowgirl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gayla Trail</a>, has nearly 17,000 followers on Twitter. An endorsement from her would be huge for our imaginary brand!</span></p>

<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em><span lang="EN">Influencers. Are. Everywhere.</span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">I say all that to say this: If you doubt the efficacy of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/19/influencer-marketing-content-promotion">influencer marketing</a> in your specific industry, do a little digging. It took me less than three minutes to find Ms. Trail. What’s the harm in trying?</span></p>
<div id="make-creative-youtube-thumbnails"></div>
<h2><span lang="EN">9. Don’t skimp on your thumbnails</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Some people will deliberately search for your content. Others will stumble upon it via your social channels or your website. A few folks may even find your videos by way of friends sending links.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Inevitably, however, many people will encounter your YouTube videos simply by browsing the platform in search of something to watch. Without compelling, unique thumbnails that pique your prospects’ interest, you won’t get as many views as you’d like. With that in mind, let’s briefly talk about what it takes to create an effective <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/youtube-thumbnail-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube thumbnail</a>.</span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20knit20a20blanket.png" alt="how to get more views on youtube thumbnail" width="800" height="237" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p><span lang="EN">Before you shoot your next video, do a YouTube search for your target keyword and see what other creators have used for their thumbnails. You want to stand out from the pack, so it’s wise to find out what you’re going up against before hitting record. That being said, the number one rule of YouTube thumbnails is that <strong>you must faithfully represent the content of your video</strong>. Using your thumbnail to deceive users into clicking is a big no-no—one that will cost you in the long run, as tanking watch times translate into lower rankings.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Perhaps the best way to communicate the DNA of a strong YouTube thumbnail is to analyze an example. Take a look at this one from Vox:</span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20thumbnail.png" alt="how to get more views on youtube thumbnail" width="800" height="155" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p><span lang="EN">Let’s start by addressing the all-important question: <em>Does this thumbnail faithfully represent the content of the video? </em>I suppose you’d have to watch the video to know for yourself, but you’ll have to trust me for now. <em>Yes</em>, this thumbnail is completely appropriate. The video addresses a widespread misconception about the power of Vitamin C to cure the common cold. By centering the thumbnail around five everyday items that people typically use to combat the sniffles, Vox gives us an accurate preview of what will be discussed.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">What this thumbnail <em>doesn’t </em>do is use controversial imagery or language to elicit an extreme emotional response from YouTube users. There’s no implication that Airborne is a completely fraudulent product. There’s no unpleasant image of an extremely sick person. It’s a simple, colorful thumbnail that grabs your attention and sets appropriate expectations for the corresponding video.</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">Word to the wise: </span></strong><span lang="EN">The specs for YouTube thumbnails are 1280 x 720 pixels (16:9 ratio). You’ll need a .jpg, .png, .bmp, or .gif file.</span></p>
<div id="write-good-youtube-titles"></div>
<h2><span lang="EN">10. Think hard about your titles</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">The title of your YouTube video, much like the thumbnail, requires a substantial degree of forethought. Although it’s unethical (and ultimately counterproductive) to use your video title to trick users into clicking, you <em>do </em>need to write something enticing. All those discovery-minded users? The folks who are browsing YouTube in search of something to watch? They’ll scroll right past you if your title fails to capture their attention and spur them into action.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">The goal, in other words, is to find a healthy middle ground between dry and dishonest. We’ve got some ideas as to how you can make that happen.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Focus on the outcome</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">What will viewers walk away with after watching your video? What <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">value or benefit</a> do they stand to capture? How will your insights change their everyday lives? Ask yourself these questions while you brainstorm titles and you’ll eventually arrive at a winner.</span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20focus20on20the20outcome.png" alt="how to get more views on youtube focus on the outcome" width="800" height="144" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p><span lang="EN">This video title promises a simple yet powerful outcome: <em>Watch this video and you’ll walk away with the knowledge you need to <strong>get more leads </strong>for your business. </em>The creators could’ve gone with “Lead Generation for Beginners,” but that wouldn’t have made the benefits of watching the video quite so obvious.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Use specific, impressive numbers</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">People like numbers. Numbers are familiar. Tangible. Easy to understand. And when used correctly, numbers can be extraordinarily enticing. Case in point:</span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20use20numbers.png" alt="how to get more views on youtube use numbers" width="800" height="144" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p><span lang="EN">Maybe it’s just the content marketer in me, but if you wouldn’t click on this video, I think you’re out of your mind. Here we have a textbook example of using a specific number to make a video title exponentially more interesting. 850% is not only a <em>large </em>number—it’s also a fairly <em>uncommon </em>number. How often do you come across an instance of 850% in your everyday life? I’m willing to bet that it’s rare, and the marketing team at SEMrush is undoubtedly aware of this.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">P.S. This is another example of emphasizing outcome in a video title. <em>Watch this video and you’ll walk away with the knowledge you need to <strong>increase organic traffic </strong>by 850%.</em></span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Appeal to user curiosity</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">People like numbers, but perhaps not as much as they like knowledge. We’re curious beings. We want to be in the know. I’m sure there’s an evolutionary explanation for this characteristic of ours, something about hunter-gatherers needing to gossip in order to survive. Regardless, the final insight of the day is this: Using your video title to <strong>appeal to user curiosity</strong> is a time-tested way to get more views on YouTube. You shouldn’t write clickbait, of course, for the reasons I’ve discussed ad nauseam. As long as your title reflects the content of your video, you’re golden.</span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20get20more20views20on20youtube20title20optimization.png" alt="how to get more views on youtube title optimization" width="800" height="141" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p><span lang="EN">Of all the examples I’ve shared throughout today’s guide, this one might take the cake. The first half of the title targets a keyword, and the second half creates one heck of a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/10/curiosity-gap">curiosity gap</a>. If you want to earn high rankings <em>and </em>entice relevant users, this right here is a winning formula.</span></p>

<h2>Now you know how to get more views on YouTube</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">I don’t expect anyone to implement each and every tip we’ve laid out here today. What works for one YouTube creator won’t necessarily work for another. Whereas influencer marketing may do wonders for my YouTube views, you might find it best to focus on optimizing your thumbnails and partnering with other channels. It depends entirely on your unique circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">The one insight I hope <em>everyone </em>takes to heart is that <strong>creating value for viewers </strong>always takes precedence over everything else. Does producing unique, high-quality content guarantee thousands of views every month? No, it doesn’t—there are additional steps you need to take in order to succeed. But without that foundation of truly valuable content, nothing else we’ve talked about today will matter.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">On that note, go make a video!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even before the spread of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/10/covid-19-resources">the novel coronavirus</a>, live streaming had become a popular form of online content. Between celebrities going live on Instagram to answer questions from fans and media personalities using Twitch to stream themselves playing video games, it’s been clear for some time now that live content is the real deal.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="80ef3b5e-3f79-4e59-93e6-adbf64a05436" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>And then, of course, everything changed. Due to the necessity of social distancing, musicians are unable to tour, comedians are unable to perform, and athletes are unable to play. Suddenly, live streaming has gone from a fun format to play with to a necessary means of connection.</p>
<p>As a marketer, you’re well aware that connection is everything. And if you’re a marketer who specializes in conferences and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/04/25/event-marketing">events</a>, now is a particularly challenging time.</p>
<p>So, let’s take this opportunity to learn more about <strong>YouTube live streaming</strong>. Whether you’re an events marketer looking to replicate the experience of an in-person gathering or a content specialist trying to expand your toolbox, YouTube Live is something everyone can benefit from.</p>
<h2>An introduction to YouTube Live</h2>
<p>YouTube live streaming—otherwise known simply as YouTube Live—is a method of reaching your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/15/audience-targeting">target audience</a> in real time. When you go live, your stream is housed in the Live section, found on the left-hand side of the YouTube homepage.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="8ee2aec9-bd09-4252-9728-0541901a3ad5" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Users interested in live content can navigate to the Live section and find your stream. Of course, you don’t need to rely <em>entirely </em>on users taking this initiative; anyone who’s recently watched <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/03/video-marketing-ideas">your videos</a>, watched videos similar to yours, or subscribed to your channel will likely see your live stream on their personalized homepage. (We’ll talk about promotion later on in this post.)</p>
<h2>How to go live on YouTube</h2>
<p>To go live on YouTube, head to your YouTube homescreen and find, in the top right, the video camera icon with a white plus sign:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="56a37aab-add8-4bfd-a8c9-d118f850b5b8" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Then you&#8217;ll see two options: Upload video or Go live.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>Select Go live.</p>
<p>Note that you must have a YouTube channel in order to create live videos.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em>No thanks =&gt; No live stream.</em></p>
<h3>Why should I go live on YouTube?</h3>
<p>If you’ve ever watched a YouTube live stream, you already know what makes it such a special form of online content: <strong>It makes you feel as if you’re part of an event</strong>. Because each viewer is consuming the exact same content at the exact same time—and because viewers are encouraged to use the chat function to share their thoughts and questions—a YouTube live stream is an extraordinarily engaging experience. It’s all the excitement of a live sporting event mixed with the intimacy of a small concert.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="633634b9-ef27-459c-a67c-e8ade67ffde9" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>The Kansas City Chiefs use watch parties to engage their fans during the offseason.</em></p>
<p>So why go live on YouTube? Because live streaming allows you to connect with your target audience in a way that can’t be replicated with a blog post, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/goal-talk">podcast episode</a>, or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/12/video-scripts">standard video</a>. Even if you’re skeptical of its efficacy, there’s no denying that live streaming is a fundamentally unique style of content. And if you’re committed to differentiating yourself from your competitors, doing something unique is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re a marketer at a supply chain management firm and you want to repurpose some of your educational blog content. Why not turn those posts into brief presentations and deliver them via live streams? That way, you can directly interact with your prospects in real time and showcase your brand personality in a new way. Plus, being able to immediately answer your prospects’ questions as they come to mind is incredibly powerful.</p>
<h3>Types of YouTube live streaming</h3>
<p>Not all YouTube live streams are alike. According to Google, there are two major types of live streams: <strong>simple </strong>and <strong>customized</strong>.</p>
<p>Typically, a simple live stream is conducted via webcam. As long as you have an internet connection and a laptop, you can use your webcam to go live on YouTube. And if your channel has more than 1,000 subscribers, you also have the option to go live through a smartphone. If you’re short on resources and you want to use YouTube Live to conduct Q&amp;As or deliver very simple presentations, using your webcam or smartphone is a good option.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="92a3fe59-badd-4e19-924d-30b57968c2c0" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>A customized live stream, on the other hand, is a more complex production. The defining characteristic of a customized live stream is the use of an <strong>encoder</strong>—a piece of software that allows you to share your screen and use multiple cameras and microphones. So, if you want to go live on YouTube and stream the recording of your podcast or deliver a visually aided presentation, you’re going to need an encoder. Google has compiled a list of YouTube Live verified encoders <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2907883?hl=en">here</a>.</p>

<h3>YouTube Live statistics</h3>
<p>Before we move on to the next section, I want to quickly share a few statistics from <a href="https://livestream.com/blog/live-video-statistics-livestream">an insightful study</a> conducted by Livestream and New York Magazine. After surveying 1,000 adults to learn more about their content consumption habits, the researchers found that:</p>
<ul>
<li>81% would rather watch a live video than read a blog post.</li>
<li>82% prefer live video over social media posts.</li>
<li>70% cite YouTube as their favorite platform for live content.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, yeah. When I say live streaming on YouTube is a good idea, I mean it’s a <em>good idea</em>.</p>
<p>Speaking of numbers, check <a href="/blog/ws/2020/12/03/underrated-youtube-metrics">Four Underrated YouTube Metrics to Quantify Your Video Marketing Success</a>.</p>
<h2>How to promote your YouTube live stream</h2>
<p>Time to state the obvious: There’s no point in going live on YouTube if nobody watches it. Yes, doing a simple stream through your webcam or phone is practically free. Nonetheless, time spent live streaming is time <em>not </em>spent <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/01/lead-generation-ideas">generating leads</a> and closing sales. Plus, if you want to invest in a customized stream, we’re talking about several pieces of expensive equipment.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>One camera alone is going to cost you a decent amount of money.</em></p>
<p>I say all that to say this: You need to put some serious thought into the promotion of your live stream. Let’s walk through some tactics you can use.</p>
<h3>Get the word out on social media</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most obvious way to promote your YouTube live stream is to get the word out to your social media followers. Tweets, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/07/instagram-story-ads">Instagram stories</a>, Facebook posts—the whole nine yards. <strong>I strongly discourage simply copying and pasting across platforms</strong>. People use different social platforms for different reasons, and they expect to see different types of brand content depending on the feed they’re scrolling through. Whereas your Facebook fans may expect you to use a more serious, professional tone, your Twitter followers may be more open to humor and levity. The more thoughtful you are about the promotional messaging you post across platforms, the better results you can expect to see.</p>
<p>Beyond organic social marketing, I encourage you to experiment with miniature <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/31/low-budget-facebook-ad-campaigns">Facebook advertising campaigns</a>. One of the beautiful things about Facebook is that you’re not required to spend a certain amount of money <em>or </em>run ads for a certain amount of time; you can spend as little as you want, and you can advertise for whatever stretch of time you deem necessary.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="b09e17de-fdec-498d-8433-3b9c5aaba3c6" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Here’s an idea: A few days before your live stream, throw a couple bucks behind a Facebook ad targeted at users who follow your chief competitor’s page. You can link to your YouTube channel and say something along the lines of, “We’re going live on YouTube at 6 p.m. on Thursday! We’ll be sharing insights you can’t afford to miss. Subscribe now to make sure you’re notified as soon as the stream starts!”</p>
<h3>Tap into your email contacts</h3>
<p>Let’s be honest with each other: Email marketing isn’t sexy. It’s not hot in the streets. It’s the digital marketing equivalent of Tupperware.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: It works—<a href="https://optinmonster.com/is-email-marketing-dead-heres-what-the-statistics-show/">it really, really works</a>. And that’s why you should use it to promote your upcoming YouTube live stream.</p>

<p>Although <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/03/cold-email">cold email</a> most certainly has its place, I don’t recommend promoting your live stream to complete strangers. (No, I don’t consider the followers of your competitor’s Facebook page <em>complete </em>strangers; at the very least, they’ve demonstrated interest in what you’re selling.) Instead, reach out to the folks who’ve voluntarily given you their email address—newsletter subscribers, whitepaper downloaders, prospects who reached out for a quote or consultation, etc. Specifics aside, the idea is that you want to target people who have, in one way or another, shown their interest in your business.</p>
<p>Make sure your email copy emphasizes the <strong>value</strong> your live stream will provide. What topics are you going to address? Which pain points are you going to alleviate? What, specifically, will your viewers get out of it?</p>
<h3>Grow your audience on YouTube itself!</h3>
<p>Per YouTube’s algorithms, some of the users who watch your content (and content that’s closely related to yours) will find out about your live streams via their personalized homepages. Therefore, in order to attract bigger and bigger live stream audiences over the long term, you should try to grow your YouTube following in general. The more users watching your standard videos on a regular basis, the more users YouTube will notify about your live streams.</p>
<p>There’s no shortage of small steps you can take to increase viewership and win more subscribers. Use your video titles to create a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/10/curiosity-gap">curiosity gap</a>. Add cards to the end of your videos to promote related pieces of content. Link up with other content creators whose audiences might be interested in what you have to say. Follow <a href="/blog/ws/2021/06/10/youtube-seo-tips">YouTube SEO</a>.</p>

<h2>6 tips to succeed with YouTube Live</h2>
<p>Alright, folks. Now that we’ve established the basics of YouTube live streaming and the steps you can take to get the word out, let’s wrap up by walking through six tips to make your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/30/instagram-live">live streams</a> successful.</p>
<h3>1. Provide value to your viewers (duh)</h3>
<p>It’s time, once again, to state the obvious: No one is going to watch a live stream unless they’re confident they can get something out of it. Therefore, if you want to consistently attract a substantial audience, you need to do your homework.</p>
<p>What are the most common frustrations in your customers’ day-to-day lives? What keeps them up at night? What are their goals, and what might stop them from <em>achieving </em>those goals? What are some insights that <em>you </em>can provide in order to make their lives easier?</p>
<p>These are kinds of questions you should be asking yourself when <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/03/brainstorming-techniques">brainstorming</a> the content of your next live stream. You’re not going to succeed with YouTube live streaming—or content marketing in general, for that matter—if you’re not arming your prospects with information they can translate into revenue.</p>
<h3>2. Encourage real-time participation</h3>
<p>An easy and effective way to keep your viewers engaged throughout the duration of your live stream is to encourage participation via the real-time chat function. Keep in mind that much of the appeal of a live stream comes from the feeling that you’re taking part in something special. Getting your viewers to chime in with their thoughts and questions is a terrific way to augment that feeling.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>Let’s return to the example of a marketer at a supply chain management firm. Say you’re hosting a live stream to educate your prospects on the importance of sustainability. Why not get people talking by asking them to share the ways in which they make their production processes more sustainable? Not only does this create a form of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/28/user-generated-content">user-generated content</a>, but it allows you to bounce off their ideas and make the experience more interactive.</p>
<h3>3. Incorporate visual aids</h3>
<p>If you plan on using YouTube Live primarily for Q&amp;As, you’re probably OK to simply sit in front of a laptop webcam. If, however, you want to do some full-blown presentations—<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/03/marketing-webinars">live webinars</a>, virtual speaking engagements, etc.—I highly recommend the use of visual aids. Without notes, charts, graphics, or some other form of complementary content to support the words you’re saying, your viewers are going to get bored. Plus, they probably won’t retain much of the information, thus rendering the whole exercise a waste of valuable time.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="ea3a3f46-5e8e-4cc4-b4a8-d75eab27397b" data-langcode="en">

</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTG_RR1hqQM" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Check out the full video here.</em></a></p>
<p>Here’s what I suggest: Open up a Word doc and type out everything you want to say. (No, you shouldn’t read a script during your live stream.) Then, read through it and note the places where visual aids would be most valuable. It’s perfectly fine to have stretches of time where you’re simply a talking head, but you’ll need to break up the monotony fairly often. If it were my live stream, I wouldn’t go more than 30 seconds without some kind of graphic or image.</p>
<h3>4. Find ways to make the experience fun</h3>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, providing value to your viewers doesn’t mean you can’t make your live stream fun. Although informing your prospects should absolutely be the priority, I think it’s important to make the experience, y’know, <em>enjoyable</em>. After all, if you bore people to the point of zoning out, it’s unlikely that they’ll retain much of anything.</p>
<p>One way to infuse some fun into your live stream is to make it a happy hour. Just because you’re breaking down the ins and outs of cloud computing, doesn’t mean you can’t have yourself a refreshing pilsner. Schedule your live stream for 5pm on a Thursday or Friday, invite your viewers to BYOB, and blow their minds with 30 minutes of insights—but, like, casually.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can invite a customer to join you on the stream. This takes away the pressure of being the only speaker, and it gives your prospects an opportunity to hear an organic <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/05/customer-testimonials">testimonial</a>. There should be some structure to the conversation, but it doesn’t need to be a formal interview. Simply talking about your customer’s experience in a natural manner should translate into valuable, memorable content.</p>
<h3>5. Consistently ask for feedback</h3>
<p>No live stream is without its flaws. No matter how much you prepare, no matter how thoughtful you are about your viewers’ interests and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points">pain points</a>, there are going to be bumps in the road. Naturally, different marketers are going to struggle with different issues. Whereas one person’s stream may suffer from technical problems, another may miss the mark with their messaging. Irrespective of specifics, the important point here is that <strong>you must always ask your viewers for constructive feedback</strong>. Not only will this translate into better and better live streams over time, but it will also make your audience feel valued and heard.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="8d3dc635-3703-457e-b82e-780b0ee4d840" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/youtube-live-comments.jpg" alt="YouTube Live comments" width="717" height="301" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>A little goes a long way.</em></p>
<p>Here’s an idea: At the beginning of your next live stream, ask your audience members to reach out via social or email with any feedback they have. Viewers tend to drop off when it becomes clear that the stream is ending, so I think it’s best to encourage feedback right off the bat.</p>
<p>Please, please, please respond to each and every message you get! Even if you don’t agree with a particular viewer’s ideas, it’s important that you acknowledge their efforts. And on those occasions when you <em>do </em>agree with someone’s ideas, consider giving them a shout-out during your next live stream. This will go a long way towards showing your viewers that their feedback is truly encouraged and appreciated.</p>
<h3>6. Never stop experimenting</h3>
<p>YouTube live streaming may be a fundamentally unique form of content, but it shares one thing in common with every other facet of your marketing strategy: <strong>It won’t work unless you’re diligent about </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/09/25/a-b-testing"><strong>A/B testing</strong></a>. If you want to improve the quality of your content—and the size of your audience—it’s imperative that you never stop experimenting.</p>
<p>The day of the week that you go live. The time of day that you go live. The ways in which you encourage your viewers to participate. The types of live streams you produce. The topics you address. The length of your live streams. The channels you use to promote your live streams.</p>
<p>This is just a small sample of the many variables you can test in order to make your YouTube live streams as successful as possible. Experimentation is an essential part of any type of marketing, but this is an area in which you should be particularly open-minded. Live streaming is a terrific way to engage your audience and build brand affinity, but it’s not <em>directly </em>tied to your revenue. I say this not to diminish the value of live streaming, but instead to illustrate the degree of freedom you have to try new things.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to go live on YouTube, it&#8217;s time to get out of your comfort zone. Run with unusual ideas. Try something that nobody else is doing.</p>
<p>The results may surprise you.</p>

As social distancing measures become more restrictive in order to slow the spread of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/13/covid-19-response">the coronavirus (COVID-19)</a>, brick-and-mortar retailers are suffering from reduced demand or forced to close entirely.

<p><span lang="EN">You may be a small business owner that relied on foot traffic and store sales only, and now you&#8217;ve got to figure out how to get your products into customers&#8217; hands when they can&#8217;t come into your physical storefront. That means you need a functional ecommerce site, and fast! </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Given the circumstances, now is a great time to talk about the process of building an ecommerce website.<span lang="EN"> First, we’ll talk about building an ecommerce website from scratch. Then, for those of you who already have a website, we’ll share some tips for adding basic ecommerce functionality to your existing site.</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Let’s begin, so you can start selling again!</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">Building an ecommerce website from scratch</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Right off the bat, I’m going to make two assumptions: (1) You know what you want to sell and (2) You know what you want your ecommerce business to be called. If that’s not the case, check out <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/28/niche-marketing">our guide to defining and targeting a niche</a> and <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/4660242-what-should-i-name-my-online-store" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shopify’s guide to naming your online store</a>.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Step #1: Make sure your domain is available </span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Now, what you need to do is verify that your desired domain name is available. With a tool like <a href="https://instantdomainsearch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instant Domain Search</a>, this step takes literally seconds. If the domain you want is available, that’s great! If not, browse the recommendations and select whichever one fits best. Of course, your selection shouldn’t be <em>too </em>similar to an existing domain, as this would likely lead to lost traffic (and revenue) down the line.</span></p>

</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">If you’re looking to sell cat toys, this one’s all yours.</span></em></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">Important note: </span></strong><span lang="EN">When you settle on an available domain, hold off on buying it! If you plan to build your ecommerce website with a solution like <a href="https://litextension.com/blog/shopify-vs-squarespace/">Shopify, Squarespace</a>, or WordPress, you’ll be able to buy your domain through the platform. Trust me—life is easier this way.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Why is checking domain availability the very first step? Because it will save you an enormous amount of time and frustration. Imagine if you began naming your products, drafting your web copy, and building your store <em>only to realize </em>that you’ve been optimizing for a name that isn’t available for purchase. Hard pass.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Step #2: Check out the search volume for products you want to sell</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">You should invest neither money nor time until you’re confident that there’s enough demand for your products in order for your ecommerce business to be profitable. I don’t care how good your products are or how persuasive your marketing is—if very few people are going online and looking for whatever it is you want to sell, you’re unlikely to find success. That’s why the second step to building an ecommerce website is using WordStream’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords">Free Keyword Tool</a> to see how often consumers are using Google and Bing to search for your products.</span></p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">WordStream’s </span></em><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords"><em>Free Keyword Tool</em></a><em> in action.</em></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">This raises a crucial question: What does sufficient search volume (i.e., demand) look like? To answer that, we’ve got to do some math.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Let’s say you want to sell hand-crafted baseball gloves. You estimate that you can generate $20 of profit for every unit you sell. If you need to generate $10,000 of first-year profit to keep the dream alive, then you need to sell 500 gloves. At the outset, your goal is to drive half of those sales (250 units) through organic search marketing.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Now, assuming you can get yourself to page one of the search results (a difficult task—more on this later), you can expect a click-through rate of <a href="https://backlinko.com/google-ctr-stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least 3%</a>. For the sake of the easy math, we’ll say you can expect to convert 5% of organic impressions into clicks. Of those clicks, you estimate that you can convert 2% into purchases. In order to sell 250 gloves, you’d need to drive 12,500 clicks per year (1,042 clicks per month). In order to drive 12,500 clicks per year, you’d need to generate 250,000 impressions per year (20,834 impressions per month).</span></p>
<p>So, in order to justify building an ecommerce website, you’d need to see enough search volume—across Google and Bing—to generate roughly 21,000 organic impressions per month.</p>

</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">On Google alone, these five keywords generate over 40,000 monthly searches in the US.</span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">If that number intimidates you, I’ve got good news: Organic search is just <strong>one way </strong>to get consumers on your ecommerce website. Even if this channel only nets $3,000 of profit, you can still meet (or even exceed) your $10,000 goal by using paid search and paid social.</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">Important note: </span></strong><span lang="EN">Even if you don’t plan to rely on organic search, it’s still imperative that your products drive sufficient search volume. For one thing, succeeding with <em>paid </em>search also requires solid search volume. Secondly, even if you plan to generate the majority of your sales through social media, search volume is a strong indicator of demand in general.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Which leads me to step three … </span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Step #3: Figure out how you’re going to grow</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Available domain? Check. Sufficient search volume? Check. Now, we have one final step before actually <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-website-builders/">building your ecommerce website</a>: putting together an online marketing strategy. Before you start taking product photos and drafting an “About Us” page, you need to determine how you’re going to grow your online store.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">So, let’s talk about the levers you can pull.</span></p>
<h4><span lang="EN">Organic search marketing (a.k.a. search engine optimization)</span></h4>
<p><span lang="EN">The goal of organic search marketing—also known as search engine optimization, or SEO—is fairly straightforward: When shoppers use Google or Bing to search for a product you sell, you want your website to appear in the first page of results. As you probably know from your own shopping experiences, websites that are buried past the first page are rarely visited.</span></p>

As with SEO, you’ll need to identify high-volume, low-competition keywords related to your business. But, instead of targeting those keywords in your web copy in hopes of ranking highly in the <em>organic </em>search results, you’re going to target them in your ad copy (and associated landing pages) in hopes of ranking highly in the <em>paid </em>search results—which are found both above and below the organic ones.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">For further reading, I suggest <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/ppc">our article on the basics of the PPC</a> as well as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/11/ecommerce-ppc">the definitive guide to ecommerce PPC</a>. In the meantime, here are some of the advantages associated with PPC:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">It drives results quickly. </span></strong><span lang="EN">Once you’ve created your Google Ads and Microsoft Advertising accounts and your ads have been approved, you can start driving traffic to your ecommerce website—and making money—immediately.</span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">It attracts high-quality prospects. </span></strong><span lang="EN">Like SEO, PPC falls under the inbound marketing umbrella. The most motivated shoppers will come to you.</span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">It scales very easily. </span></strong><span lang="EN">Once you’ve collected some preliminary data and determined which keywords are most profitable, you can instantly increase and/or reallocate your budget and improve your results even further.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><span lang="EN">Paid social advertising</span></h4>
<p><span lang="EN">There’s one primary disadvantage across both organic and paid search: Search volume can dry up. This is the other side of the inbound marketing coin; as powerful as it is to capitalize on purchase intent, there’s no guarantee that demand will remain sufficiently high. As a result, it’s wise to give yourself some insurance. And that’s where paid social advertising comes in.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Paid social is the practice of buying ads on social media sites, such as Facebook and Instagram. Because these platforms have access to an enormous amount of user data, they enable their advertisers to target prospects with incredible precision. Depending on your marketing goals, you can pay per impression, per click, or even per video view. And as an ecommerce advertiser, you can engage in what’s known as social shopping—i.e., allowing social media users to browse and purchase your products without ever leaving the native platform. If you’re focused on maximizing conversion rates, it’s a dream come true!</span></p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">A shoppable Facebook post. (I added the red squares.)</span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Make sure to check out the WordStream guides to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/05/31/how-to-advertise-on-facebook">advertising on Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/20/instagram-advertising">advertising on Instagram</a>, and getting started with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/25/social-shopping">social shopping</a>. But before you do that, here are three big advantages associated with paid social:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">It allows you to expand your prospect pool. </span></strong><span lang="EN">Like I said: Inbound marketing, as terrific as it is, can leave you in a vulnerable position. To avoid getting blindsided by a drop in demand, use paid social to bring more prospects to the top of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/01/ecommerce-sales-funnel">ecommerce funnel</a>.</span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">It doesn’t cost much. </span></strong><span lang="EN">Plain and simple: Clicks and conversions are cheaper on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/12/facebook-ad-benchmarks">social</a> than they are on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/29/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks">search</a>.</span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">It enables you to target people precisely. </span></strong><span lang="EN">To be fair, Google Ads and Microsoft Advertising have dramatically improved their audience targeting capabilities over the past few years. Nonetheless, when it comes to getting the perfect ad in front of the perfect person, Facebook and Instagram remain on top.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span lang="EN">Step #4: Build your ecommerce website</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">You’ve got the perfect domain picked out. Search volume is looking strong. You’re confident in the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/10/15/multi-channel-marketing">cross-platform marketing strategy</a> you’ve drawn up. At last, the final step towards building your very own ecommerce website is … </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">… building your ecommerce website.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">I know, I know—not terribly helpful. But, believe it or not, you’ve already conquered the most difficult steps. Combing through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/popular-keywords/ecommerce-keywords">keywords</a>, figuring out the nuances of different marketing channels—<em>that </em>is the hard stuff. In fact, if you ask me, you’re just now getting to the <em>fun </em>part. With the grunt work out of the way, actually putting together your ecommerce website is a blast.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">So, let’s talk about what you need to do.</span></p>
<h4><span lang="EN">Pick an ecommerce solution</span></h4>
<p><span lang="EN">Search “ecommerce website builder” on Google and you’ll see a slew of ads and organic results from software companies and marketing agencies. Among the former are a handful of names you likely recognize: Shopify, BigCommerce, Squarespace, Wix, and WordPress.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Now, if we were talking about a website designed strictly for traffic and/or lead generation, I’d recommend WordPress—they’re the industry standard for a reason. But that’s not, in fact, what we’re here to talk about. You want to build an ecommerce website. Therefore, you should go with the solution that’s best for online retailers. And that, my friends, is Shopify.</span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">You can find plenty of in-depth testimonials that extol the wonders of Shopify; I’m not going to go into much detail today. I’ll simply leave you with this: If you’re looking for an intuitive, affordable, and reliable solution that enables you to sell not only through your own website, but through platforms like Facebook and Pinterest as well, <a href="https://www.shopify.com/website">go with Shopify</a>.</span></p>
<h4><span lang="EN">Buy your domain</span></h4>
<p><span lang="EN">That domain you picked out earlier? Buy it. Whether you go with Shopify, WordPress, Squarespace, or some other solution, you’ll have the option to buy your domain through them. You can expect to pay somewhere around $20 or $30 per year.</span></p>
<h4><span lang="EN">Choose your theme</span></h4>
<p><span lang="EN">Once you’ve chosen your solution and purchased your domain, you’ll be tasked with selecting a <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/best-ecommerce-themes/">theme for your ecommerce website</a>. What’s most important is that your theme selection aligns with your industry and your desired brand image. If you’re in the world of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/03/fashion-marketing">fashion</a> and you want to brand yourself as modern and cutting-edge, something sleek is probably most appropriate. Alternatively, if you’re in the home and garden industry and you want your website to feel as welcoming as possible, consider a theme based on bright, warm colors.</span></p>
<h4><span lang="EN">Assemble your product photos and descriptions</span></h4>
<p><span lang="EN">Product photos can be immensely powerful assets.When a prospective customer browses your website and sifts through your product photos, they’re able to envision themselves as your customer. If you sell women’s apparel, they can picture themselves wearing a certain dress. If you sell home goods, they can picture your vase sitting on their mantle. Moments like these, trivial as they may seem, can go a long way when it comes to winning over a new customer. Check out these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/26/product-photography">14 product photography tips</a> that’ll make you look like a pro! </span></p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">Gorgeous.</span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/06/26/product-descriptions">Product descriptions</a> are also extremely important. Not only do they help you give prospects a clearer understanding of the value your products can deliver; they <em>also </em>help you improve your SEO. A product description is a golden opportunity to target the second- and third-tier keywords you couldn’t quite fit into your product title. For example, let’s say you’re building an ecommerce website to sell organic laundry detergent. One of your product titles may be something like this: “Bill’s Organic Laundry Detergent, Lavender, 64 OZ.” You’ve got your brand name, scent, and bottle size in there, but think of all the related keywords you can still target: all-natural, chemical-free, eco-friendly, and so on. Use your product description to their full potential!</span></p>

</article>
</div>
<h4><span lang="EN">Set up the Facebook Pixel</span></h4>
<p><span lang="EN">Before you sell a single product, I strongly encourage you to install the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-pixel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Pixel</a>—a small snippet of code that will allow you to track the actions your prospects take across your website. With the data your Pixel collects, you’ll be able to take your Facebook (and Instagram) ad campaigns to the next level.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Let’s return to the example of the baseball equipment website. Say you ran a successful Facebook campaign to promote a specific bat. Thanks to the Facebook Pixel, you can group together all the (anonymized) users who clicked on your ad and bought a bat. Now, you can retarget that audience of past buyers with an ad for a glove!</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Bottom line: <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/10/11/facebook-conversion-tracking">The Facebook Pixel</a> will empower you with immensely valuable insights and allow you to get more revenue out of paid social.</span></p>
<h4><span lang="EN">Make sure payment processing is in place</span></h4>
<p><span lang="EN">With your perfect theme in place, your product photos and descriptions ready to knock prospects’ socks off, and the Facebook Pixel installed, there’s just one last step to getting your ecommerce website off the ground: verifying that you’re ready to process payments.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">If you’ve created a Shopify website, all you need to do is turn on <a href="https://www.shopify.com/payments">Shopify Payments</a>; there’s no need for a third-party widget. With a solution like Squarespace or WordPress, you’ll have to connect your website to PayPal, Stripe, or both.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Now that you’re ready to sell, push your brand new ecommerce website live!</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">Adding ecommerce to an existing website</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">For those of you who already have a website, some would tell you to use a solution like Shopify or WordPress to quickly build a separate website that’s designed exclusively for ecommerce.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Not a good idea.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">First of all, that means paying for two websites at the same time. I know that’s not a massive expense, but it’s an expense nonetheless. Secondly, as intuitive as some of these website solutions are, building a new website <em>does </em>take some time. Why waste a couple days doing something you don’t have to do?</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Thirdly, and most importantly, redirecting customers from your main website to your ecommerce website makes for a bad user experience. Maybe your most dedicated customers are willing to tolerate something like that, but a lot of online shoppers are <strong>not</strong>. So, by building a separate site exclusively for ecommerce, you’re not only wasting time and effort, but you’re also throwing revenue directly out the window.</span></p>

</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">The easier it is to buy, the better.</span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">What you need to do is add basic ecommerce functionality to your existing website. Let’s talk about the different ways you can do that.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">See what your solution provider has to offer</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">If your existing website is managed through a platform like Squarespace, WordPress, or Wix, you’ve got some room to work. <a href="https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206779077-Understanding-Squarespace-Commerce">Squarespace Commerce</a>, for example, is a suite of features that enable you to sell products, manage orders, and process credit card payments. Creating product pages is easy, and you’ve got some flexibility when it comes to shipping arrangements. Plus, you can easily boost sales by using some of Squarespace’s native marketing features, such as discount announcement bars and abandoned checkout recovery.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">If your website runs on WordPress, I’ve got good news: <a href="https://woocommerce.com/">WooCommerce</a>, one of the most popular WordPress plugins, makes it easy to implement ecommerce functionality. Simply select “Plugins” from the left-side menu of your WordPress dashboard and then click “Add New.” Search for WooCommerce, install it, and allow Onboarding Wizard to show you how it’s done. Once you’re onboarded, you can start playing around with specific functionalities.</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="633e93a9-d271-437a-9d5b-40ba8dcbe074" data-langcode="en">

</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">Via </span></em><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/how-to-add-ecommerce-to-wordpress/"><em>GoDaddy</em></a><em>.</em></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">One final website solution I want to mention is Wix. Much like Squarespace, <a href="https://support.wix.com/en/article/adding-wix-stores" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wix</a> makes it easy for their subscribers to upgrade to ecommerce-friendly plans. If you’re not already on a Business Premium subscription, you’ll have to make the switch (which comes with an increase in the price). Once that’s taken care of, simply select “Add” from your left-side menu and click “Store.” A new button labeled “My Stores” will now appear in your left-side menu. From there, you can start <a href="https://support.wix.com/en/article/creating-an-online-store-using-wix-stores" target="_blank" rel="noopener">building and managing your Wix store</a>!</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Use a third-party ecommerce tool</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">If you don’t want to alter your website subscription—or if your website is constructed in a way that doesn’t allow you to make big, fundamental changes—you can use a third-party tool to add basic ecommerce functionality. Let’s look at a few of your options.</span></p>
<h4><span lang="EN">Shopify buy button</span></h4>
<p><span lang="EN">Designed with bloggers, artists, and side-hustlers in mind, the <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/60670213-5-ways-you-can-use-shopify-buy-buttons-to-sell-on-your-website-or-blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shopify buy button</a> allows you to sell products through your website without fully transitioning to an ecommerce model. No matter what kind of website you have, you can easily embed buy buttons within your homepage, your sidebar, or even throughout your content. If you’re looking for a fast, secure way to sell products while maintaining a high-quality user experience, this is a great option.</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e847e5bc-fcda-4633-8fa2-a3aa13dae57d" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<h4><span lang="EN">Shoprocket</span></h4>
<p><span lang="EN">For as little as $7/mo., <a href="https://www.shoprocket.co/retailers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shoprocket</a> allows you to sell across your website and Facebook page. Integrating seamlessly into your existing website, Shoprocket gives you a centralized platform for creating offers, managing orders, specifying shipping details, and more. Best of all, you can upgrade as you grow—giving you access to advanced features, such as Google Analytics tracking and live chat support.</span></p>
<h4><span lang="EN">Snipcart</span></h4>
<p><span lang="EN"><a href="https://snipcart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snipcart</a>—which enables you to start selling products, downloads, and subscriptions with just two lines of code—is another way to add ecommerce to your website. In exchange for 2% of each sale, you get access to an intuitive platform that allows you to manage orders, track abandoned shopping carts, integrate with email marketing solutions, and more. If you’re looking for something that’s easy to implement and flexible enough to adapt to your changing demands, give Snipcart a look.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">Start building your ecommerce website today!</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Whether you’re a fledgling entrepreneur starting from scratch or an established retailer trying to improve your online presence, there’s no better time to start building your ecommerce website than today. No matter which ecommerce solution you want to use, no matter which <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/06/18/marketing-channels">marketing channels</a> you want to explore, there are plenty of effective ways to reach your target audience. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">But with the number of online retailers growing every day, the competition for that audience will only intensify going forward. That’s why it’s so important to get the ball rolling—whatever that means for you—as soon as you possibly can.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Happy selling!</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes we all need some creative inspiration. That's why we've gathered 24 stellar banner ads examples and broken down exactly why they work so well to help you get your own ideas off the ground.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/02/banner-ads-examples">24 Clickable Banner Ads Examples (And Why They Work!)</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all need some creative inspiration now and then—and it’s nothing to be ashamed of. When Julian Casablancas, legendary frontman of the Strokes, was asked about the similarities between the band’s hit single “Last Nite” and Tom Petty’s “American Girl,” he issued a terse response: “Yeah, we ripped it off. Where have you been?”</p>
<p>Although this laissez-faire attitude towards plagiarism is baked into the foundation of rock ‘n’ roll, we’ve gotta play by the rules here in the digital marketing world. So, as you peruse this collection of outstanding banner ad examples, please refrain from taking the Casablancas approach. Finding inspiration is one thing; stealing is another.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-intro.jpg" alt="banner ad example" width="487" height="301" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Yikes. Even if plagiarism </em>were<em> acceptable, this isn’t a banner ad you’d want to mimic.</em></p>
<p>Accompanying each banner ad example is a quick breakdown of what (in my opinion) makes it work. You’ll notice some themes: the versatility and effectiveness of side-by-side comparisons, the emotional power of visual imagery, the need to undermine skepticism, and so on.</p>
<p>Let’s get to it!</p>
<h2>24 banner ads examples that we can all learn from</h2>
<h3>1. Bridgewater State University</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-intro-bridgewater-state.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Bridgewater State" width="624" height="168" /></div>
<p>Let’s be honest: This ad’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/click-through-rate">click-through rate</a> is probably very low. Nobody stops reading a blog post to enroll in college classes. But that’s okay—the marketers at BSU aren’t going for clicks. Instead, they’re going for (meaningful, lasting) impressions.</p>
<p>This is a great example of <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/banner-ad-examples/">banner ad</a> copy that gets prospects thinking. Maybe it’s just me, but when I look at this ad, I can’t help but think: <em>What would it look like for me to go beyond? </em>All of a sudden, I’m picturing myself in a classroom. Although I wouldn’t click on this ad, there’s no denying its memorability. Sometimes, that’s all that matters.</p>
<h3>2. Liberty University</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-intro-liberty-university.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Liberty University" width="624" height="90" /></div>
<p>Here we have another example from a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/08/04/higher-education-marketing">higher education advertiser</a>—one that’s effective for completely different reasons. First, I love the image on the left side of the ad; I think it evokes a feeling of community, of being part of something bigger than yourself. Never underestimate the power of a simple visual.</p>
<p>Secondly, the copy addresses a common complaint about online college: that it fails to deliver the benefits of a traditional university. By reassuring prospective students they’ll enjoy the flexibility of online classes and the advantages of a physical campus, the marketers at Liberty effectively erase some of the skepticism surrounding their offer.</p>
<h3>3. AutoZone</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-intro-auto-zone.jpg" alt="banner ad example from AutoZone" width="383" height="321" /></div>
<p>Shifting gears (zing) to an entirely different industry, here we have a banner ad example from AutoZone. Referring to a specific <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points">pain point</a> that your product or service alleviates is a fantastic copywriting tactic; in this case, it’s the all-too-relatable scenario of seeing your check engine light rear its ugly head. Mimicking this approach is a great way to grab your prospects’ attention.</p>
<p>Bonus points to AutoZone for their geotargeting efforts. By providing the address and business hours of a nearby store, they make the likelihood of conversion considerably higher.</p>
<h3>4. Capital One</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-intro-capital-one.jpg" alt="Capital One" width="397" height="328" /></div>
<p>You don’t need a degree in graphic design to see why this Capital One ad works so well: It’s designed to make <strong>5X </strong>leap off the screen. Like the team at Bridgewater State, the folks who put this winner together understand that clicks aren’t everything. Even if you don’t click that “Learn More” button—credit to them for using a low-pressure <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/20/call-to-action-examples">CTA</a>, as opposed to something aggressive like “Sign Up Today”—you’ll remember that Capital One offers a savings rate 5X higher than the national average.</p>
<p>Bonus points to Capital One for associating their copy and imagery with basketball season.</p>
<h3>5. Big Brothers Big Sisters</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-big-brothers-big-sisters.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Big Brothers Big Sisters" width="238" height="466" /></div>
<p>This banner ad example from Big Brothers Big Sisters demonstrates perfectly how the use of images can greatly enhance the emotional impact of your marketing materials. It sounds obvious, but this ad works largely because the images allow prospects to envision themselves working as big brothers and big sisters.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I think their choice of CTA—“Start Something”—is brilliant. It gives the prospect a real sense of autonomy, no? With just two words, the advertiser sends a wonderful message: You have the power to effect change in this world.</p>
<h3>6. nCino</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-ncino.jpg" alt="banner ad example from nCino" width="563" height="155" /></div>
<p>Those of you who operate in competitive spaces understand the importance of establishing your authority as a brand. That’s exactly what the nCino marketing team does here with the headline copy: “The worldwide leader in cloud banking software.” That’s a bold statement—one that makes the nCino brand name stick around in your mind.</p>
<p>Additionally, I think the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/20/call-to-action-buttons'">CTA button</a> is perfectly placed; it attracts the eye as soon as you’re done scanning the headline copy. Plus, the marketers at nCino understand that they’re working with a long sales cycle—hence the use of a low-pressure CTA. They probably could have created a <em>bit </em>more contrast between the button color and the background color, but we’ll give ’em a pass.</p>
<h3>7. Disney+</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-disney2B.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Disney+" width="624" height="170" /></div>
<p>The effectiveness of this Disney+ banner ad can be summed up with a single word: <strong>exclusivity</strong>. More than anything, this ad serves as a reminder that <em>Disney+ has content you can’t (legally) get anywhere else.</em> No matter what you’re advertising, exclusivity is a heck of a sales pitch. If you have something that none of your competitors can replicate, make it known to the world.</p>
<p>Bonus points to Disney+ for nailing it with their CTA. Even if you don’t click that blue button, you’ll remember that Disney+ is offering a free trial. Next time you’re itching for an <em>Iron Man </em>marathon, you’ll know where to go.</p>
<h3>8. Amazon Web Services (AWS)</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-aws.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Amazon Web Services" width="593" height="163" /></div>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with using a statement to establish your brand authority. If, for example, the AWS marketing team simply wrote, “AWS is more reliable than the next major cloud provider,” I wouldn’t take issue with it. That being said, taking the <strong>cold, hard stats approach</strong> is infinitely more effective. Rather than asking us to simply take their word for it, the AWS team anchors their industry-leading status to a specific number—i.e., that they boasted 7X fewer downtime hours in 2018 than their closest competitor.</p>
<p>That, my friends, is good <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/14/ppc-ad-copywriting">copywriting</a>.</p>
<h3>9. DocuSign</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-docusign.jpg" alt="banner ad example from DocuSign" width="624" height="172" /></div>
<p>Here, thanks to DocuSign, we have our first banner ad example that illustrates the power of creating a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/10/curiosity-gap">curiosity gap</a>—that is, using your copy to inspire intrigue in your prospects’ minds. Once you’ve read that headline, you can’t help but wonder: What are the six overlooked strategies that deliver rapid growth? The only way to find out, of course, is to read the ebook.</p>
<p>The marketers at DocuSign clearly have a strong understanding of how display advertising fits into the marketing funnel. Since it’s unlikely that you’ll get someone to buy your product or service with a simple banner ad, it’s wise to offer something small (e.g., a free ebook).</p>
<h3>10. Ridge</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-ridge.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Ridge" width="624" height="171" /></div>
<p>Some things truly never go out of style. Exhibit A: the side-by-side comparison tactic. There’s a reason marketers have been employing it for decades: It’s a simple, direct, and <em>painfully clear </em>way to communicate the value of your product or service. It takes a fraction of a fraction of a second to understand what our friends at Ridge are trying to tell us. Awkward, clunky wallets are a thing of the past; if you want to keep up with the times, you have no choice but to upgrade to a slimmer, sleeker model.</p>
<p>Ask yourself: Could I substitute this copy for a side-by-side comparison image? If the answer is yes, the latter is often the right decision.</p>
<h3>11. USA Today</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-usa-today.jpg" alt="banner ad example from USA Today" width="624" height="44" /></div>
<p>The one and only <em>native </em>banner ad example included in this collection comes to us courtesy of the good people at USA Today. The best part of this ad, of course, is the way it inspires <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/05/how-to-increase-urgency">urgency</a>. It’s never a bad idea to let your prospects know that they only have X hours left to take advantage of whatever promotion you’re running at the moment.</p>
<p>As the icing on the cake, “Go Ad-Free” is a fantastic CTA. Why? Because it tells USA Today’s readers <em>what they’ll actually get </em>if they opt into this limited-time deal. Would the ad be worthless if the CTA were “Sign Me Up” rather than “Go Ad-Free”? No way. But if you want to write banner ad copy that’s truly effective, focusing on outcomes is a great approach.</p>
<h3>12. Allbirds</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-allbirds.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Allbirds" width="317" height="271" /></div>
<p>Say it with me, folks: You don’t have to choose between writing copy that’s catchy and writing copy that’s effective. In other words, it’s possible to write copy that both sticks in your prospects’ minds <em>and </em>communicates the value of your product or service.</p>
<p>Take this Allbirds ad, for instance. While there’s no denying that “Slip ‘em on, move along” is a catchy, memorable tagline, this copy is much cleverer than it initially seems. Why? Because it tells you (in a rather subtle way, admittedly) what it is, exactly, that makes Allbirds shoes such a wise decision: They’re easy and comfortable to wear. Whereas some footwear is a hassle to deal with, Allbirds’ selection is all about convenience.</p>
<h3>13. Staples</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-staples.jpg" alt="banner ad example Staples" width="345" height="290" /></div>
<p>Sometimes, it’s best to take the dead-simple route. Although newer businesses may want to adopt the Allbirds approach and shoot for memorability, established brands shouldn’t be afraid to be direct. Is this example from Staples the sexiest <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/09/ad-design">banner ad</a> I’ve ever seen? Nope—not by a long shot. But then again, who cares?</p>
<p>This ad was created for one reason and one reason only: to remind shoppers that Staples is the best place to go when you’re trying to save money. I’d argue that it’s accomplished that goal with flying colors. Plus, the design of the ad is flawless. Notice how your eyes are naturally drawn to the “Shop Now” CTA button? Most certainly <em>not </em>an accident.</p>
<h3>14. Apple</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-apple.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Apple" width="624" height="88" /></div>
<p>Much like our friends at Ridge, Apple goes with the trusty side-by-side approach and communicates a clear, powerful message: Our credit card comes with no fees. Every other credit card comes with a lot of fees. This is a particularly strong ad because, as we saw with the Liberty University example, it makes a point to address a common pain point for those in the market for a credit card (i.e., having to deal with inexplicable fees).</p>
<p>Elsewhere, “Apply in minutes” is an excellent CTA. Not only does it call prospects to action, but it also communicates a secondary <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">value proposition</a>: <em>Applying for our credit card is quick and easy. </em>Don’t be afraid to kill two birds with one CTA.</p>
<h3>15. Microsoft</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-microsoft.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Microsoft" width="624" height="93" /></div>
<p>There’s a lesson to be learned from this Microsoft banner ad: You can write copy with the intention of making your prospects feel as if they’re in the driver’s seat. Allow me to explain.</p>
<p>Nobody would bat an eye if the copy for this ad said, “Build and develop apps with Azure. Start your free trial today.” Bad copy? Not necessarily. <em>Generic </em>copy? Emphatically so. And if your banner ad copy fails to engage prospects in a meaningful way, then what’s the point?</p>
<p>This ad is brilliant because it reworks the “Start your free trial today” cliché in a way that makes prospects feel autonomous. Typically, a free trial is restricted to a set amount of time determined by the advertiser. Here, Microsoft flips that expectation on its head; all of a sudden, the <em>consumer </em>gets to decide when the free trial stops and the pay period begins.</p>
<p>It’s a simple switch, but it makes a massive impact.</p>
<h3>16. Amazon</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-amazon.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Amazon" width="624" height="91" /></div>
<p>People don’t make purchase decisions based <em>solely </em>on price; often, a consumer will opt for a particular product or service because it somehow aligns with their personal values.</p>
<p>Clearly, the marketers at Amazon have an appreciation for this tendency. In a country where half the working population is employed by a small business, it’s no surprise that so many people are passionate about supporting the little guy. Here in the US, it’s not uncommon to hear someone say that they went with Product X or Service Y specifically because it was sold by a small business.</p>
<p>Advertising the fact that small businesses <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/23/selling-on-amazon">sell on Amazon</a> is a savvy move—one that everyone can learn from. If you can align your brand with a principle or movement that prospects hold dear, you’ll drive some serious results.</p>
<h3>17. Wikibuy</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-wikibuy.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Wikibuy" width="624" height="89" /></div>
<p>And speaking of Amazon, our next banner ad example comes from a company that helps make online shopping more affordable: Wikibuy. As you tell from this side-by-side banner, Wikibuy offers a price comparison browser extension that scans stores in search of the best deals.</p>
<p>To me, what’s unique about <em>this </em>side-by-side comparison is that it communicates Wikibuy’s value proposition through a specific, tangible product—an Xbox controller. If Wikibuy ran a banner ad that simply said, “We make online shopping cheaper,” it wouldn’t resonate nearly as much. By anchoring their value prop to something concrete that many consumers will recognize, Wikibuy significantly enhances the impact of their ad.</p>
<h3>18. UMass Dartmouth</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-umass-dartmouth.jpg" alt="banner ad example from UMass Dartmouth" width="327" height="276" /></div>
<p>Wikibuy uses a specific product to make their banner ad resonate more deeply with their prospects; UMass Dartmouth, in a similar vein, uses a specific <em>person</em>. This, in my opinion, is a textbook example of how you can take the satisfaction of your <em>current </em>customers (or students) and use it to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/07/12/get-more-customers">win </a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/07/12/get-more-customers"><em>new </em></a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/07/12/get-more-customers">customers</a> (or students).</p>
<p>Here’s why the inclusion of Jill makes this banner ad so effective: She invites UMass Dartmouth’s prospects to envision themselves as MBA students. Remember when I said Bridgewater State’s ad made me think about what it would mean for me to “go beyond”? This is practically the same idea. If you can get your prospects to think about what it would be like to be your customer, you’re making strides.</p>
<h3>19. Hulu</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-hulu.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Hulu" width="327" height="276" /></div>
<p>Nothing too philosophical to discuss here, my friends; the Hulu marketing team is trying to inspire that sense of urgency I’ve mentioned a few times. Though they’re far from reinventing the wheel, I want to give credit where credit is due. I like what they’ve done with the heading and the subhead; emphasizing “Limited-Time Offer” and driving it home with the crossed-out price tactic is a strong approach.</p>
<p>Bonus points to Hulu for perfect placement of the CTA button. No matter what you’re advertising, design your banner ads in such a way that prospects’ eyes are naturally drawn to your CTA buttons. Here, Hulu uses the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/31/f-z-patterns-landing-page-design">F-pattern design</a>. It’s fool-proof!</p>
<h3>20. Invisalign</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-invisalign.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Invisalign" width="370" height="314" /></div>
<p>Here, thanks to Invisalign, we have another example of the curiosity gap. I have no idea what a smile assessment entails, but you better believe I want to find out. As Buzzfeed has proven time and again over the years, people go <em>bananas </em>for free online quizzes. If you can think of a way to create a free online quiz that pertains to your product or service, go for it!</p>
<p>Here’s why a banner ad is the perfect way to advertise such a quiz: The people you’re reaching with banner ads are typically at the top of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/07/marketing-funnel">marketing funnel</a>. As such, very few of them are ready to take any kind of action that involves payment. Because a free online quiz is, uh, free, it’s a fantastic way to move new prospects further down your funnel.</p>
<h3>21. Dyson</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-dyson.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Dyson" width="352" height="295" /></div>
<p>If the AWS ad and the UMass Dartmouth ad got together and started a family, this example from Dyson would be their glorious child. Why say “We make 5-star products” or “Our products will exceed your expectations” when you can use a customer testimonial to say <em>both </em>of those things in a much more organic and believable way?</p>
<p>If you want to go one step further—and why wouldn’t you?—I’d encourage you to combine the power of a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/05/customer-testimonials">testimonial</a> with the power of visual imagery (i.e., a picture of your product <strong>in action</strong>). As much as I like this Dyson ad, it would be slightly better if we saw a customer actually using the product being promoted.</p>
<h3>22. AAA</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-aaa.jpg" alt="banner ad example from AAA" width="358" height="305" /></div>
<p>This is hands-down the <strong>best </strong>use of visual imagery out of the whole bunch. When I look at this picture of the woman inspecting under the hood, I immediately flash back to all the times I’ve found myself stranded on the side of the road. With those flashbacks, of course, come all the associated emotions: frustration, anger, anxiety, and so on. Emotions like these are incredibly good motivators—which is why AAA is tapping them to get people to sign up.</p>
<p>Think about the emotions you want to stir inside your prospects. Then, think about how you can use simple, direct imagery to get the job done. If you’re truly thoughtful, you’ll put together some winning banner ads.</p>
<h3>23. One A Day</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-one-a-day.jpg" alt="banner ad example from One A Day" width="624" height="88" /></div>
<p>Here’s another great example of a banner ad that directly addresses a common myth. In this case, One A Day is undermining the idea that being health conscious is complicated and time-consuming. As this ad does a stellar job of communicating, all it takes to improve your nutrition is a single daily supplement.</p>
<p>I love the design of this banner, too; I think the use of bright colors is an effective way to cast a positive light on top of the messaging. Plus, making the CTA “Save Now” rather than “Buy Now” is a tremendous way to sneak an additional value proposition into the ad.</p>
<h3>24. Liberty Mutual</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banner-ads-examples-liberty-mutual.jpg" alt="banner ad example from Liberty Mutual" width="361" height="300" /></div>
<p>Finally, we’ve got this winner from insurance provider Liberty Mutual. Unsurprisingly, it’s the copy (and value prop) that I’m most fond of: <em>We’ll do the work while you save money</em>.</p>
<p>What makes this banner ad <em>great </em>rather than <em>good </em>is the use of a specific number ($782). Again, it’s all about making your message <strong>resonate</strong>. If Liberty Mutual simply said, “You could save money,” that wouldn’t make much of an impact on their prospects.</p>
<p>When someone sees $782, their mind goes straight to all the things they could do with those savings: pay rent, make a car payment, put a dent in their debt, etc. In other words, the inclusion of a specific number makes this ad emotional—and, therefore, far more memorable.</p>
<p>If the main value prop behind your banner ad is savings, consider using a specific number.</p>
<h2>Let these banner ads examples inspire your next campaign!</h2>
<p>Like I said earlier, we all need creative inspiration every now and then. So take a look at these great examples, get your ideas rolling, and then get started on your next campaign—complete with your own clickable banner ads!</p>

<h3><span lang="EN">Key takeaways</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Mobile, mobile, mobile. More than anything, that’s the word that stands out to me when I look over this first batch of stats. People watch a ton of YouTube content on their phones, and as stat #12 makes abundantly clear, it’s not an activity they do exclusively on the go. It’s time to part ways with the myth that consumers only use their phones when they’re commuting to work or standing in line for coffee. Believe it or not, your prospects are watching mobile <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/27/youtube-live">YouTube videos</a> while sitting on the couch and drinking white wine—entirely disinterested in moving an inch.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Here’s what that means: You need a <strong>full-funnel </strong>mobile strategy—one that takes advantage of everything YouTube has to offer. With 70% of watch time taking place on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/10/mobile-marketing-strategies">mobile</a> and 51% of users returning to the site daily, it’s safe to assume that you have the power to reach prospects at <strong>all stages of the customer journey</strong>. With a six-second bumper ad, you can introduce yourself to a wide range of brand new prospects and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/05/brand-awareness-campaigns">drive awareness through the roof</a>. Elsewhere, you can target a smaller (and more qualified) crop of users with a TrueView for Action campaign. The specifics will vary from business to business, but the takeaway for <em>everyone </em>is that YouTube attracts consumers from all stages of the funnel.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">Elsewhere, please note stat #8 and stat #9: 500 hours of content are uploaded every minute, and one billion hours of content are watched every day. Being generic is simply not an option. Whether you plan to reach your audience through organic content or paid ads, it’s imperative that you try to do something that nobody else is doing. Don’t be so different that you confuse and/or turn your prospects off; just be different enough that you don’t fade into the background. </span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN">Key takeaways</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Evidently, YouTube users—especially those in their twenties and thirties—rely heavily on the platform to learn how to do things. For those of you interested in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/06/04/5-content-marketing-statistics">content marketing</a>, this is an incredibly important insight. By creating educational YouTube videos related to your business, you can raise awareness and establish authority among your target audience. For example, if you were marketing an Italian restaurant, you could create how-to YouTube videos for different recipes. It’s safe to assume that anyone who YouTube searches “how to make gnocchi” would be interested in learning more about your restaurant!</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">Here’s the other key takeaway from this set of stats: YouTube isn’t just for young people. Even if <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/09/18/beginners-guide-to-target-markets">your target audience</a> is on the older side (e.g., baby boomers), you can still get a tremendous amount of value out of the platform—both from content marketing and paid advertising. Plus, YouTube is an <em>especially </em>valuable channel if you’re targeting parents, college graduates, individuals with high salaries, or some combination thereof. At the risk of beating a dead horse, I want to reiterate one more time: YouTube marketing is worthwhile for <strong>all kinds of businesses</strong>—not just businesses targeting teenagers and young adults.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">My advice? Use organic content marketing to attract new eyeballs and use paid advertising to <em>retarget </em>those eyeballs. This doesn’t have to be rocket science. As the data shows, YouTube users get a ton of value out of simple educational content. With the right videos, you can bring hundreds—potentially <em>thousands</em>—of new prospects to the top of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/07/marketing-funnel">marketing funnel</a>. From there, paid campaigns like TrueView for Action can work their magic.</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN">Key takeaways</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">There’s a lot to unpack here. Let’s start at the top with stat #21: Among businesses, YouTube is the <a href="https://buffer.com/state-of-social-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second-most popular</a> place to post videos. Facebook, unsurprisingly, still reigns supreme. To get the best results, I recommend sharing content <strong>across both platforms</strong>. As I shared in a recent post about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/30/facebook-video-views">Facebook video views</a>, however, Facebook frowns upon content creators who repurpose videos originally published on other platforms. In other words, simply taking your YouTube content and sharing it on Facebook isn’t the best idea.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Here’s my advice: <strong>Dig into your audience data.</strong> Although it seems as if everyone with an internet connection uses both YouTube and Facebook, there’s a good chance that you attract a unique audience on each platform. By digging into the data, you can see which kind of content does best on YouTube and which kind of content does best on Facebook. If you can optimize your content on each of the world’s biggest video-sharing platforms, you’ll attract a steady stream of qualified prospects.</span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">YouTube Studio offers plenty of helpful audience insights.</span></em><span lang="EN"> </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Next: A mobile YouTube ad is 84% more likely to engage prospects than a TV ad. Why? Because people use TV commercial breaks to scroll through social media and search stuff on Google. Therefore, I recommend <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/10/15/multi-channel-marketing">reinforcing the messaging of your YouTube ads with your Facebook and Google ads</a>. That way, even when your prospects opt for TV instead of YouTube, you can communicate the value of your product and keep your brand top-of-mind. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Finally: Product review content is a legitimate phenomenon. Although it’s completely unethical to pay YouTubers to review your product, you can still get in on the action. I suggest regularly searching YouTube for reviews of your product and <strong>responding to each and every one</strong>. Whether the review is positive or negative, it’s imperative that you leave a thoughtful response in the comment section. First and foremost, this demonstrates that you take <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/24/customer-feedback">customer feedback </a>seriously. Plus, while responding to <em>positive</em> reviews gives other users an incentive to make review videos of their own, responding to <em>negative</em> reviews shows that you’re committed to holding your business accountable.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You own a small auto shop in Worcester, MA. Things are going well, but you can’t shake the feeling that you could be growing <em>faster</em>. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/06/referral-marketing">Referral marketing</a> isn’t bringing you as much business as it used to, and you don’t have the time or the resources to run a commercial on local TV.</p>
<p>So, you decide that it’s time to get serious about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/marketing-101">digital marketing</a>. To get a high-level sense of where you currently stand, you do a quick Google search for your shop’s name. Much to your chagrin, you find this on the search results page:</p>

<p>This, unfortunately, is a list of your three biggest competitors. Not only are their names featured prominently on the page, but they’ve also made it extremely easy for their prospects—i.e., <strong><em>your</em></strong> prospects—to get in contact with them.</p>
<p>Not ideal.</p>
<p>The good news is that yours is a simple problem to fix. With <strong>online reputation management</strong>, you can turn platforms like Google, Facebook, and Yelp into major revenue generators. Let’s dive deeper.</p>
<h2>What is online reputation management?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reputation-management">Online reputation</a> management, otherwise known simply as ORM, is the practice of improving the perception of your business in the eyes of potential customers. To break that down further, online reputation management involves two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identifying the online resources that potential customers may use to learn more about your business.</li>
<li>Taking steps to make sure those resources cast your business in a positive light.</li>
</ol>
<p>(If a potential customer does a Google search for your business and finds nothing but information about your <em>competitors</em>, it’s unlikely that they’ll perceive you in a positive light.)</p>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Having a presence like this in the search results makes you look trustworthy.</em></p>
<p>As you might expect, the goal of online reputation management is to grow your customer base and increase your revenue. As you might <em>not </em>expect, it doesn’t need to be expensive. If you’re savvy—and if you heed my advice—you’ll be able to manage your online reputation without breaking the bank.</p>
<p>Here are the practices and platforms I’ll discuss in today’s guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/12/local-seo">Search engine optimization (SEO)</a></li>
<li>Google My Business</li>
<li>Facebook (including <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/28/facebook-messenger-marketing">Messenger</a>)</li>
<li>Yelp</li>
</ul>
<h2>Online reputation management for small businesses</h2>
<p>As I’ve tried to make abundantly clear, this is a guide to online reputation management <strong><em>specifically</em> </strong>for small businesses. If this were a guide for large brands and corporations, I’d get into stuff like social media monitoring and slander investigations. For now, at least, we’re going to stick to the essentials.</p>
<h3>Search engine optimization (SEO)</h3>
<p>When someone searches for your business on Google, you want to own the top results. When I use the word “own,” I mean that in a literal sense. I’m referring to <strong>owned media</strong>, an umbrella term that encompasses all the online properties over which you have ownership. In the case of a small business, we’re typically talking about two major things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/07/07/website-design-inspiration">website</a></li>
<li>Your social media profiles</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s start with your website, as it&#8217;s the foundation of your online reputation and your digital marketing strategy. Getting your website to the top of the search results means engaging in search engine optimization, also known as SEO. As the name suggests, SEO is all about optimizing your website in order to make it as visible as possible in the search engine results.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>First things first: Making sure your website is indexed—i.e., making sure Google has stored your website in its digital library. To check, go to <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Search Console</a> and log in with the Google account associated with your business. (If you don’t have a Google account associated with your business, you’ll need to create one.) Click “Add a property,” select “Website” from the drop-down menu, and enter the exact URL for your website’s homepage. You’ll need to verify your ownership of the website, which you can do through your domain provider—Squarespace, GoDaddy, etc.—or, if you use it, Google Analytics.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">Once you’ve verified your ownership of the website and your Search Console account is ready to rock, select “URL Inspection<strong>” </strong>from the left-hand menu. Then, enter the URL for your website’s homepage into the search bar. If your homepage is indexed, you’ll see “URL is on Google” on your screen:</span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">If Search Console finds that your homepage is <em>not </em>indexed, you need to click “Request Indexing,” as seen in the lower right corner of the above screenshot. Once you’ve submitted your request, you can expect your homepage to be indexed within a day or so.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">If your website is small (i.e., the number of unique web pages is low), you can repeat this simple indexing process for each page. I also recommend using Search Console to submit a <strong>sitemap</strong>, which is simply a roadmap of your website’s pages. Although not <em>technically </em>necessary, a sitemap makes it easier for Google to find your web pages and add them to the index. Some website builders (e.g., Squarespace) will provide a sitemap for you, but this isn’t always the case. You can <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/183668?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build a sitemap manually</a>, or you can use a (trustworthy) <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/sitemap-generators/wikis/SitemapGenerators.wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third-party tool</a>.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">When we’re talking about small business reputation management, getting your website indexed is your most important task. Remember: The goal is simply to own the top results when potential customers search for your business. If you want to get a more in-depth understanding of SEO fundamentals, I recommend this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/30/seo-basics">beginner’s guide</a>.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Before we move on to Google My Business, I have a quick note on your social media profiles. Ideally, you’d like them to appear close to the top of the search results when someone searches your business’ name. Unfortunately, your level of control over this isn’t as high as it is with your website; although your Facebook page is considered part of your owned media, it’s officially Facebook’s property. What you <em>can </em>do is link to each of your social media profiles in the footer of your website’s homepage. This will signal to Google that you endorse those pages, and your endorsement will help them rank better when appropriate.</span></p>
<h3>Google My Business</h3>
<p>Remember that screenshot I shared in the introduction? The three competitors to your hypothetical auto shop?</p>
<p>The common thread across these three small businesses is that they’re all using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/12/google-my-business">Google My Business</a>—a free tool that allows you to connect with potential customers in the Google search results and on Google Maps. To create your profile—which, again, costs <em>nothing</em>—simply head to the <a href="https://www.google.com/business/">Google My Business website</a>, click the “Manage Now” button, and start entering your business’ information. (Triple-check that your name, address, and phone number are accurate.)</p>
<p><span lang="EN">Too many small business owners submit the minimum amount of information and leave it at that. Will doing so send your business into an immediate tailspin? No, but it <em>will </em>lead to a whole lot of missed opportunities. If you want to get the most out of Google My Business—if you’re serious about reputation management—you’ve got some work to do.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">When <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/27/google-my-business">optimizing your Google My Business profile</a>, keep this in mind: <strong>There’s no such thing as too much information.</strong> At the end of the day, you’re trying to give your potential customers the most complete and positive picture of your business possible. As such, you should provide:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Your hours of operation.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">The products and services you offer.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">A high-level description of your business.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Your business category(s)</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Attributes (depending on category)</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Photos and videos that document your atmosphere, your team, and your customers.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">A link to your appointment booking interface (if applicable).</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Links to your social media profiles (if applicable).</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">Without scrolling, I’ve learned a ton from this salon’s GMB profile. A great first impression!</span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">By now, you’ve probably noticed that Google My Business profiles include a feature that has a pretty strong influence over how your business is perceived: <strong>customer reviews</strong>. When a customer navigates to your profile, they have the option of writing a review and scoring your business on a five-star scale.</span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">One of the most important aspects of online reputation management is <strong>encouraging your customers to write Google reviews</strong>. Why? Well, according to BrightLocal, <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/research/local-consumer-review-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">85%</a> of consumers trust online reviews as much as they trust traditional recommendations. If you can get just a small portion of your customer base to submit positive reviews—ethically, of course, as buying reviews is a terrible idea—your GMB profile will become a massive generator of foot traffic.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">And by the way: According to that same BrightLocal <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/research/local-consumer-review-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a>, 97% of consumers who read online reviews also read businesses’ responses to online reviews. Good, bad, or somewhere in between—a key part of reputation management is responding to each and every review in a thoughtful manner. Indeed, nearly <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/research/local-consumer-review-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-third</a> of consumers will judge you based on whether or not you respond to your customers’ reviews.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">To sum up the guide so far: Google plays a fundamental role in online reputation management. As long as your owned media is at the top of the search results and your Google My Business profile is fully optimized—complete with photos and reviews—you’ll be in good shape.</span></p>
<h3>Facebook (and Facebook Messenger)</h3>
<p>Google isn’t the only resource your potential customers are using to learn more about your business. According to Square’s recent <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/townsquare/people-discover-new-businesses-on-facebook-more-than-any-other-channel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a> of over 1,800 consumers, 52% of people have discovered new businesses on Facebook. On a monthly basis, in other words, there’s an incredible amount of opportunity to grow your customer base.</p>
<p>Whether or not you capitalize on that opportunity depends on how much effort you put into your business’ Facebook page. So let’s talk about what needs to happen.</p>
<p>Head to Facebook’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/creation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">page creation center</a> and take care of the basics: name, category, address, phone number, and profile picture (i.e., your logo). Next, it’s time to submit your cover photo—a big decision, considering how much real estate it takes up on the screen:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="56aee550-0365-4e28-843e-ab0179b01cd4" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/online-reputation-management-facebook-page-creation.jpg" alt="Facebook page creation for online reputation management" width="624" height="364" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Your cover photo is probably the first thing a new visitor will notice, so think carefully about the impression you want to make. If you own a coffee shop, for example, you may want to share a picture of customers on their laptops—thus branding your business as a place to get stuff done.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">Once you’ve submitted your basic information and your two photos, you basically have free rein; Facebook doesn’t require you to tell your page visitors anything else. But if you’re committed to optimizing your online reputation, you should provide as much information as you can (as was the case with your Google My Business profile).</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">In the upper right-hand corner of your screen, you’ll find a button that reads “Edit Page Info.” Click on that.</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="3c676960-0a7b-4712-8cf2-84e15e8dbd9f" data-langcode="en">

</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Then, click the button on the left-hand side labeled “Templates and Tabs.”</span></p>

</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Note that you can visit Templates and Tabs and change the order of your tabs whenever you like. For now, click that “Edit Page Info” button in the top right corner. This will automatically bring you to the <strong>Page Info </strong>tab, which is where we’ll be working for the next few minutes.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">First things first: You need to write a brief description of your business. You’re limited to 255 characters—25 fewer than what you’re allotted for a tweet—so you have to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">make every word count</a>. I recommend talking about your products and services (as opposed to the story of your business) as doing so will help you attract relevant users. If you search “weight training” on Facebook, the top results are nearby gyms that offer personal training services. No matter what you sell, you want to be the top result when users search for things related to your business.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Properly categorizing your business <em>also </em>helps you attract relevant users. Make sure to categorize yourself in multiple ways to account for different people using different search terms.</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="8cbeed20-9058-4dce-87ee-e981cbe35eba" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Now, submit a link to your website and an email address at which visitors can reach you. You’ve already provided your phone number and physical address, so those are taken care of. Specify the neighborhoods/cities/regions you serve and your hours of operation for each day of the week. Finally, indicate the expensiveness of your products or services (on a scale from one to four dollar signs) to mitigate the risk of walk-in customers getting blindsided.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">At this point, you’re in terrific shape. Clicking that “Edit Page Info” button will give you access to all kinds of bells and whistles that you can browse at your leisure. I just have a few more points to make before tackling Facebook Messenger:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">As with Google My Business, make sure to upload plenty of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/26/product-photography">photos</a> and videos. This is a great way to give potential customers a tangible idea of what your business is all about.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">As with Google My Business, make sure to (ethically) encourage <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/08/customer-feedback-ad-copy">customer reviews</a> and go out of your way to respond to each and every one—even the negative ones.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Online reputation management is all about casting your business in a positive light, right? Right. So, riddle me this: What better way to cast your business in a positive light than by allowing your page visitors to get immediate answers <strong>at all hours of the day?</strong></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">No, I’m not suggesting that you forgo sleep and take up permanent residence in front of your laptop. What I <em>am </em>suggesting is that you bolster your business’ page (and your reputation) with a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/13/facebook-messenger-bots">Facebook Messenger chatbot</a>.</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="ee842156-8111-4b89-b4b1-778821f6db65" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/online-reputation-management-facebook-messenger-bot.jpg" alt="Facebook Messenger bot example" width="345" height="615" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">A Messenger chatbot is exactly what it sounds like: a simple piece of software that uses AI to converse with Facebook users—that is, a simple piece of software that can relieve you of your customer service duties while you’re busy with other tasks (or sleeping). I don’t mean to suggest that Messenger bots are capable of <em>completely </em>erasing human interaction; that’s not at all the case. But they’re extremely useful when you’re not around to answer your page visitors’ most pressing questions. By giving your visitors a quick, easy way to access information at all hours of the day, you greatly increase your chances of being perceived as reliable and trustworthy. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">If that’s not sound reputation management, I don’t know what is.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Here’s a <a href="https://chatbottutorial.com/messenger-bot-builder/">list</a> of some free bot-building platforms you may want to check out.</span></p>
<h3>Yelp</h3>
<p>Your owned media is consistently at the top of the search results. You’ve jam-packed your Google My Business profile and Facebook page with all kinds of relevant information. You’re literally helping customers while you sleep thanks to the power of a Messenger chatbot.</p>
<p>To complete the reputation management cycle, you’ve got just one more platform to tackle: Yelp.</p>
<p>Yelp is an online platform that connects consumers with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-marketing-2024">local businesses</a>. Much like Facebook and Google My Business, it allows you to provide basic information (address, hours, products and services, etc.) and it allows customers to voice their honest opinions.</p>

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/online-reputation-management-yelp-review.jpg" alt="Yelp review" width="503" height="376" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>An example of a glowing Yelp review.</em></p>
<p>Considering the similarities between Yelp and the platforms I’ve already discussed, you may be wondering why I’ve bothered to include it in this guide. Here’s why: Yelp is visited by more than <a href="https://www.reviewtrackers.com/blog/yelp-factsheet/">175 million</a> unique users every single month. If you neglect to create a profile, the prospects who search for your business will give their money to your competitors without hesitation.</p>
<p>Getting your business on Yelp is free and easy. Simply head to the <a href="https://biz.yelp.com/">Yelp for Business</a> website and click the “Manage my free listing” button. If your business is already on Yelp, you can claim it. If not, you can create the listing from scratch.</p>
<p>I’m not going to walk through the listing creation process because, at this point, I think you know the drill: <strong>Provide as much information as you can.</strong> Make products and services the focus of your business’ description. Highlight the amenities that make you stand out. Upload plenty of photos and videos for prospects to browse. Triple-check your address and contact information.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="12dcea5c-cb70-482e-9975-8fd8f1ece74d" data-langcode="en">

<p>Do consumers go to Google My Business to read reviews? Yes, they do. They go to Facebook for the same reason. But if there’s <em>one place</em> your potential customers are going to read others’ opinions, it’s Yelp. Let there be no doubt about that.</p>
<p>The simplest way to (ethically) get more Yelp reviews is to drop a link wherever you can: your email signature, your website footer, your social media bios, and so on. Note that you shouldn’t explicitly say “Write a review about us on Yelp,” but instead simply <em>direct </em>consumers to your Yelp profile and let them make their own decisions. This will not only lead to more customers <em>writing </em>reviews, but it will also lead to more prospects <em>reading </em>reviews. More prospects reading reviews leads to more customers, and on and on we go.</p>
<p>As always, it’s crucial that you’re vigilant about responding to reviews—especially the negative ones. Doing so makes you look good, no matter which way you cut it. And at the end of the day, if looking good to prospects and customers alike isn’t the exact point of online reputation management, then what the heck is?</p>
<h2>Online reputation management in a nutshell</h2>
<p>This guide is long enough as it is, so I’ll keep my concluding thoughts short and sweet. Maybe it’s just me, but when I first encountered the term “reputation management,” two words came to my mind: <em>expensive </em>and <em>complicated</em>.</p>
<p>As I’ve tried to make clear, my first impression of reputation management was completely misguided. Perhaps it’s a pricier, more complex endeavor for multinational corporations, but for a small business like yours, it couldn’t be more straightforward. That’s fantastic news, considering how much of a boost it can drive in your revenue.</p>
<p>Step one is identifying the online resources that potential customers use to learn about your business. I’ve taken care of that for you: Google, Google My Business, Facebook, and Yelp. All that’s left for you to tackle is step two: taking steps to ensure that those online resources cast your business in a positive light. I can’t do that for you, but if I’ve done my job right, this guide will make it a heck of a lot easier.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wisely, you’ve taken the dive into video marketing. Whether you’re using video to create educational content or product-focused advertisements, you’ve made the right decision. It is, after all, the year 2020; any <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/07/best-marketing-strategies">digital marketing strategy</a> that lacks video is incomplete.</p>
<p>Now that you’re in the game, it’s time for the hard part: figuring out how you’re going to increase your Facebook video views. Getting users to pay attention to your content—whether it’s paid or organic—is a daunting task. If you want to keep your prospects from scrolling directly past your videos, you need to put together some kind of plan.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-video-views-intro.jpg" alt="Facebook video views example image of people in front of camera" width="551" height="367" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>Let’s kick things off with a quick refresher on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/31/low-budget-facebook-ad-campaigns">Facebook ad campaigns</a>. Then, I’ll dive into my six tips for increasing your Facebook video views this year:</p>
<ol>
<li>Study the competition</li>
<li>Give users a reason to come back (i.e., provide value)</li>
<li>Create content specifically for Facebook</li>
<li>Make audio optional</li>
<li>Experiment with a home video aesthetic</li>
<li>Always be flexible</li>
</ol>
<p>P.S. Don’t bounce after the sixth tip; I’ve got some examples that everyone can learn from!</p>
<h2>Facebook video views campaigns</h2>
<p>If you’re thinking about putting some money behind your Facebook videos—which, for the record, I wholeheartedly recommend—this refresher is for you. For those of you who are strictly interested in organic video, the tips in the next section are still applicable!</p>
<p>Facebook offers 11 different types of campaigns to their advertisers—<strong>video views </strong>being one of them. When you elect to run a video views campaign, you send a simple (yet important) message to Facebook’s algorithms: <em>Getting people to watch my content is my top priority. </em>As such, the platform will optimize the delivery of your ads in order to get your videos in front of users who are most likely to engage.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-video-views-campaigns.jpg" alt="Facebook video views campaign setting" width="624" height="287" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>Although <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/10/facebook-ad-targeting-options">audience targeting</a> and placement targeting are important considerations, I’m not going to discuss them in this post. For our purposes, what I really want to focus on is <strong>budgeting</strong> (handled at the ad set level of the campaign creation process). When building out your budget, the first thing you have to decide is what you want to optimize for. In the case of a Facebook video views campaign, you have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ThruPlay (default setting): </strong>If your video is shorter than 15 seconds, Facebook will deliver it to users who are likely to watch the whole thing. If it’s longer than 15 seconds, Facebook will deliver it to users who are likely to watch for at least 15 seconds.</li>
<li><strong>2-Second Continuous Video Views: </strong>Facebook will deliver your video to users who are likely to watch for at least two continuous seconds.</li>
</ul>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-video-views-budgets-and-schedule_0.jpg" alt="Facebook video views campaign options: budgets and scheduling" width="624" height="273" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>It’s important that you think carefully about this decision—for two reasons. For one thing, it will determine Facebook’s approach to delivering your video ads (i.e., types of users, times of day, distribution across platforms, and so on). Additionally, it will determine your set of choices when it comes to deciding what you want to pay for. If you optimize for ThruPlay, the following are your payment options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impression (default setting): </strong>Pay every time your video ad is delivered to a user.</li>
<li><strong>ThruPlay: </strong>Pay every time your video ad is played to completion (if shorter than 15 seconds) or played for longer than 15 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose 2-Second Continuous Video Views, the following are your payment options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impression (default setting): </strong>Pay every time your video ad is delivered to a user.</li>
<li><strong>2-Second Continuous Video View: </strong>Pay every time your video ad is played for at least two continuous seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you pay for each impression or optimization event depends on your broader goals. Just keep in mind that impressions are cheaper because they’re (generally) less valuable.</p>
<h2>6 ways to get more Facebook video views this year</h2>
<p>Got your campaign settings ironed out? Awesome. Let’s discuss six tactics you can use to get more Facebook video views this year.</p>
<h3>1. Study the competition</h3>
<p>March 2019: Facebook <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/13/facebook-sunsets-relevance-score">sunsets</a> the opaque metric known as relevance score—essentially a more confusing version of Google’s Quality Score—in favor of three new replacements, one of them being <strong>quality ranking</strong>. As you might infer from the name, quality ranking measures the quality of your ad in comparison to the others competing for the same audience.</p>
<p>I repeat: in comparison to the others competing for the same audience.</p>
<p>If you earn a high-quality ranking, you’re rewarded in two ways: (1) your ad gets delivered more frequently and more favorably than your competitors’ ads, and (2) you get discounted prices for impressions and optimization events. To put it in terms of a video views campaign, earning a high-quality ranking means <strong>more video views at</strong> <strong>lower prices</strong>.</p>
<p>You know who your competitors are. Do some research. Find out what they’re doing with their video ads. Then, do it better. Just make sure you don’t plagiarize. (Duh.)</p>
<h3>2. Give users a reason to come back (i.e., provide value)</h3>
<p>May 2019: Facebook <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/05/updates-to-video-ranking/">announces</a> an update to their video ranking algorithm that explicitly increases the influence of three key factors, one of them being <strong>loyalty</strong>. To use their words:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Intent and repeat viewership are important factors we consider when surfacing videos to people in News Feed. Going forward, we will add more weight in ranking to videos that people seek out and return to week after week.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span lang="EN">Users watching your content regularly, users searching for your content regularly, users going out of their way to like and share your content regularly—these are things Facebook looks for in order to determine how loyal your viewers are. The math is simple: The more loyal your viewers are, the higher your organic video content will rank; the higher your organic video content ranks, the more video views you’ll accumulate.</span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-video-views-popular-videos.jpg" alt="Facebook video views example: popular video s" width="563" height="357" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>Facebook Watch is the platform’s hub for video content.</em></p>
<p>Earning the loyalty of users is imperative to your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/09/15/video-content-marketing">video marketing</a> success. Fortunately, the key to earning loyalty can be boiled down to just two words: <strong>provide value</strong>. If Facebook users walk away from your videos having gained something positive, the likelihood of them coming back increases exponentially. Accordingly, you need to ask yourself a question: <em>How can I give my viewers something valuable? </em>If you’re marketing an auto shop, you could provide value in the form of basic maintenance tips. If you’re marketing a college or university, you could provide value in the form of alumni testimonials. And if you’re marketing a bakery, you could provide value in the form of simple recipe videos.</p>
<p>Think about the value your business provides in general. Then, translate that into video.</p>
<h3>3. Create content specifically for Facebook</h3>
<p>In that same <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/05/updates-to-video-ranking/">blog post</a> about video ranking algorithm factors, Facebook also emphasized the importance of <strong>originality</strong>. Now more than ever before, the social platform is committed to “limiting the distribution” of unoriginal or repurposed content. If the full extent of your video marketing strategy is to (1) produce YouTube videos and (2) recycle them as Facebook videos, you’re not going to see the results you’re looking for.</p>
<p>In other words: If you really want to rack up Facebook video views, you need to create fresh content that’s made <em>specifically </em>for Facebook. You need a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/28/facebook-video-marketing">Facebook video marketing strategy</a>. It’s an approach that requires extra effort, but there’s no doubt that it’s worthwhile.</p>
<p>Creating fresh content specifically for Facebook isn’t solely about appeasing the video ranking algorithm; it’s also about delivering the best videos possible according to audience demand. I know it can seem as if everyone with a smartphone is active on every platform under the sun, but that’s simply not the case. Some of the folks who watch your YouTube videos are entirely uninterested in consuming your content on Facebook—and vice versa.</p>
<p>To put it differently: The audience you’re reaching on Facebook is <strong>unique</strong>. It follows, then, that the video content you produce for them should <em>also </em>be unique. Otherwise, you’ll miss endless opportunities to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/24/facebook-engagement">drive engagement</a> and increase your video views.</p>
<p>My suggestion? A simple survey. Ask your Facebook followers to describe the video content they like to see on the platform. Then, try your best to make it!</p>
<h3>4. Make audio optional</h3>
<p><a href="https://digiday.com/media/silent-world-facebook-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">85%</a> of Facebook videos are watched without sound. In part, that’s due to the fact that Facebook mutes videos by default. More impactful, however, is the fact that users are often scrolling through their News Feeds in settings where audio would be disruptive—the back of a lecture hall, the waiting room of an eye doctor, and so on.</p>
<p>In order to reach the widest possible audience—in order to consistently maximize your Facebook video views—it’s essential that your content is comprehensible <strong>without sound</strong>. Whether you’re providing basic car maintenance tips or demonstrating a product, viewers should have no problem understanding the message you want to communicate. If someone in a waiting room watches the first couple seconds of your video and realizes it’s incomprehensible without sound, they’re simply going to keep on scrolling.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-video-views-subtitles.jpg" alt="Facebook video with subtitles" width="624" height="318" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>Subtitles are practically a must.</em></p>
<p>If you want to challenge yourself, you can try to tell stories that are easily understandable with nothing but visual images. If you want to take the safer (and probably smarter) route, subtitles are your new best friend.</p>
<p>P.S: If you&#8217;re a WordStream Advisor user in need of some more clips to help with your video ad, take advantage of our <a href="/blog/ws/2020/05/19/wordstream-advisor-video-library-for-facebook-ads">Shutterstock integration</a> to and choose from thousands of high-quality video clips.</p>
<h3>5. Experiment with a home video aesthetic</h3>
<p>Producing videos that are incomprehensible without sound isn’t the only way to lose potential viewers. As some of you may have learned the hard way, many Facebook users are skeptical of content that comes across too … promotional. Although there’s no doubt that a growing number of people like to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/25/social-shopping">shop on social media</a>, you must always keep in mind that Facebook is <em>primarily </em>a place for users to connect with friends and consume content.</p>
<p>What I’m trying to say is that <strong>banner blindness </strong>is not limited to traditional <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/23/google-display-ads">display ads</a>. Just because Facebook users are scrolling through a News Feed rather than a blog post doesn’t mean they’re any less capable of identifying promotional content and moving directly past it.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-video-views-home-video-aesthetic.jpg" alt="Facebook video with home-movie aesthetic" width="624" height="453" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>Most users would spot this as an ad in a heartbeat.</em></p>
<p>In some cases, I think the most effective way to increase your Facebook video views is to experiment with a home video aesthetic—i.e., to create videos that require little-to-no budget. Why? Because ordinary people—those who <em>aren’t</em> using Facebook for marketing purposes—are constantly publishing videos that require little to no budget. When you’re scrolling through your News Feed, nothing stands out about a video that appears to have been recorded with a handheld smartphone. And although it seems counterintuitive, creating videos that <em>don’t stand out </em>is often the most effective strategy.</p>
<p>Try to create content that feels native to the Facebook platform; try to be (somewhat) casual. If you can do that, your chances of being perceived as overly promotional will drop dramatically.</p>
<h3>6. Always be flexible</h3>
<p>What works today isn’t necessarily going to work tomorrow. More specifically, what garners Facebook video views today isn’t necessarily going to garner Facebook video views tomorrow. As such, the longevity of your success depends heavily on your ability to <strong>adjust</strong>. No matter what, you have to be willing to evaluate your content’s performance and pivot in a new direction.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creatorstudio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creator Studio</a>—Facebook’s free, easy-to-use platform that allows you to upload and evaluate all your video content from one convenient place. As long as you have administrative access to a Facebook page, Creator Studio is yours to explore.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-video-views-graph.jpg" alt="Facebook video views graph" width="624" height="282" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>As you’re exploring, you’ll find that the left-hand menu includes a tab labeled <strong>Insights</strong>. Clicking that tab will open up a drop-down menu, and from there you can navigate to <strong>Performance</strong>. The Performance page is where you’ll find all kinds of helpful data: total minutes viewed, one-minute video views, three-second video views, engagements, net followers, and so on. Scroll down the page a bit and you’ll see a list of your individual posts titled <strong>Top Videos</strong>. As you can imagine, the list organizes your library of content from best performing to worst performing. Clicking on an individual post opens up an advanced analytics window—a place to evaluate everything from average watch time to audience retention.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-video-views-performance-stats.jpg" alt="Facebook video views performance stats" width="263" height="300" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>I share all of that to say this: Use Creator Studio to your advantage. Investigate your best and worst posts to find out what works and what doesn’t. Your flexibility will be rewarded with improved performance over time; among other things, that means more video views.</p>
<h2>3 examples to help you earn more video views</h2>
<p>Before we go our separate ways, let’s take a look at three real-world examples of (what I consider to be) effective Facebook videos.</p>
<h3>1. HellthyJunkFood</h3>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-video-views-example-video.jpg" alt="Facebook video screengrab" width="624" height="352" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Hellthyjunkfood/videos/346414752684486/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Watch the full video here.</em></a></p>
<p>This example from HellthyJunkFood—an unconventional web-based cooking show hosted by J.P. Lambiase and Julia Goolia (a real name, believe it or not)—checks two major boxes: It’s easy to enjoy without audio and it provides clear value to its viewers. Thanks to the duo’s sparing use of subtitles, you don’t need to hear what they’re saying in order to understand what’s going on. Plus, everyone who watches the video walks away with a much better idea of how to make homemade donuts. Talk about value!</p>
<h3>2. Sebastian Robeck</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-video-views-example-video-digital-marketing-agency.jpg" alt="Facebook video screengrab" width="624" height="403" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/SebastianRobeckForAgencyOwners/videos/468914380459103/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Watch the full video here.</em></a></p>
<p>This is an ad from Sebastian Robeck, a digital marketer who helps agencies grow their client bases. With this simple promo for his free training, he’s managed to check four of my boxes: It’s easy to understand without audio, it’s made specifically for Facebook, it provides clear value to its viewers, AND it uses a home video aesthetic. Once again, subtitles eliminate the need for audio. Because it’s made specifically for Facebook, Robeck is able to speak to a very defined audience. Value comes in the form of free knowledge, and the casual aesthetic allows the video to blend seamlessly into users’ News Feeds.</p>
<h3>3. University of Massachusetts Amherst</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-video-views-example-video-umass.jpg" alt="Facebook video example from UMass Amherst" width="624" height="351" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/UMassAmherst/videos/2377791778966847/%5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Watch the full video here.</em></a></p>
<p>Finally, we have an example from my beloved alma mater, the University of Massachusetts Amherst. This 60-second video is a funny, effective promo for New2U, the university’s annual end-of-summer sale that allows returning students to stock up on used dorm room essentials for incredibly good prices. Like our two previous examples, it checks multiple boxes: It’s easy to understand without audio, it’s made specifically for Facebook, AND it provides clear value to its viewers. At this point, the utility of subtitles is abundantly clear. Like Sebastian Robeck, the marketers at UMass understand the power of content that’s tailor-made for a specific audience. And of course, value comes in the form of discounted dorm room essentials. If this were your first exposure to the university’s Facebook page, it’d give you a strong incentive to come back for more content: <em>This is the place to find out about can’t-miss events!</em></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last August, we broke down the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/26/competitive-ads">11 best competitive ads we’ve ever seen on Google</a>. Although bidding on your competitors’ brand names is an effective strategy in and of itself, it’s just one iteration of broader marketing approach known as <strong>comparative advertising</strong>.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/comparative-advertising-pepsi-coke.jpg" alt="Coke and Pepsi cans image" width="768" height="432" /></div>
<p>Basically, comparative advertising encompasses any and all <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/12/marketing-ideas">marketing tactics</a> that involve the comparison of two or more products or services. Thanks to its broad definition, comparative advertising can be executed across media: digital, print, TV, radio, outdoor, and more. As long as the value of one product or service is being communicated through its comparison to <em>another</em> product or service, it qualifies as comparative advertising.</p>
<p>I’ve got plenty of examples to share with you all. But first, I think it’s worthwhile to discuss the <strong><em>why </em></strong>of comparative advertising.</p>
<h2>Why comparative advertising?</h2>
<p>Well, I sort of answered this question in the introduction: Like all marketing strategies, the goal of comparative advertising is to <strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/12/21/customer-perceived-value">communicate the value</a> </strong>of whatever product or service you’re promoting. Though it may seem as if some big name brands use comparative advertising strictly to entertain people (e.g., Wendy’s repeatedly tweeting about McDonald’s use of frozen patties), the true purpose of the strategy is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">communicate value</a>. Wendy’s wants you to laugh, but they also want you to associate their food with freshness.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/comparative-advertising-wendys-tweet.jpg" alt="Wendy's tweet" width="800" height="703" /></div>
<p>What’s unique about comparative advertising is the <strong><em>way </em></strong>value gets communicated. Whereas a non-comparative ad may say something along the lines of, “This perfume will make you smell good,” a comparative ad may opt for something like, “That perfume will make you smell good, but this perfume will make you smell <em>irresistible</em>.” Now, the value of Perfume A comes not only from its quality, but also from the <em>disparity in quality</em> between it and Perfume B. Perfume A is valuable, in part, because it is better than Perfume B.</p>
<p>Comparative advertising gives your audience an anchor—something concrete, something they can use as a reference point to better understand the value of your product or service. If you’ve never heard of Perfume A, being told that it’s “good” might not mean much to you. But if you’re already familiar with Perfume B, being told that it’s inferior to Perfume A might make enough of an impression to get you interested. Comparative advertising allows you to capitalize on the recognizability of your competitors’ brands; it allows you to turn their market share into an asset.</p>
<p>One last point before I move onto the examples: There’s nothing wrong with entertaining people. According to a <a href="https://clutch.co/agencies/resources/what-consumers-want-in-advertising" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 Clutch study</a>, 53% of consumers remember ads that make them laugh. Humor is an effective way to make your messaging stick, and engaging in comparative advertising gives you plenty of opportunities to get your prospects chuckling. Should writing the perfect punchline take precedence over <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/06/how-to-market-a-product">communicating the core value of your product or service</a>? Of course not. But being funny and being memorable aren’t mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>On that note, let’s look at some real-world examples of effective comparative advertising.</p>
<h2>9 excellent examples of comparative advertising</h2>
<p>As you’ll notice, each of the advertisers highlighted below is a big name brand with a big name brand budget. Just because you don’t have the resources that <em>they </em>do, however, doesn’t mean you can’t learn from what they’ve done. Across these ads—which, again, come from several different media—the common lesson is that <strong>you can communicate value by asserting your advantage over the other businesses in your vertical</strong>.</p>
<h3>1. Mac vs. PC</h3>
<div>
<div class="video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video"><iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0eEG5LVXdKo?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
</div>
<p>What better way to kick off this list than with arguably the most famous comparative advertising campaign of all-time? For those who don’t know, Apple once promoted their Mac computers by running a series of TV commercials that personified the Mac and the PC in hilariously different ways—the Mac being laid-back and charismatic, and the PC being dorky and overwhelmed.</p>
<p>In one of the commercials shown above, the PC is sick with a virus—something Macs are immune to. As the PC sneezes, blows his nose, and eventually passes out, the Mac—portrayed by America’s sweetheart Justin Long—remains cool, calm, and collected. In addition to letting viewers know that Macs are impervious to viruses, the ad cleverly suggests that using a Mac is an easy way to become cooler.</p>
<h3>2. Verizon vs. AT&amp;T</h3>
<div>
<div class="video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video"><iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/klFbchu1nYI?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
</div>
<p>Though this Verizon ad is (clearly) from the pre-smartphone era, it’s still worth watching and discussing. As a Verizon customer walks through his college campus and enjoys playing online games and watching YouTube videos, an AT&amp;T customer is frustrated by his lack of access to 3G coverage (like I said: pre-smartphone). As this scenario plays out, the narrator repeats some memorable wordplay: “There’s a map for that.” The message? A map showing Verizon’s 3G coverage is far more impressive than a map showing AT&amp;T’s 3G coverage.</p>
<h3>3. Allstate vs. everyone else</h3>
<div>
<div class="video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video"><iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/osPQhrnzNYk?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
</div>
<p>Though perhaps not as <em>overtly </em>comparative as Apple’s Mac vs. PC campaign, Allstate’s wildly successful Mayhem campaign is an example of comparative advertising nonetheless. Taking a page from the Apple playbook, Allstate uses a human actor to personify a non-human entity—in this case, the non-human entity is mayhem. The overarching message of the campaign is that Allstate insurance is the smartest (most effective) choice in a world that’s unpredictable.</p>
<p>In this specific example, Mayhem—portrayed by Dean Winters—blocks a woman from seeing the pick-up truck in her blind spot. An accident ensues, and Mayhem warns the audience that having “cut-rate insurance” means paying for accident damage out of pocket. Therein lies the comparative element of the campaign: Mayhem is Allstate’s way of comparing themselves to lower-tier competitors.</p>
<h3>4. Miller Lite vs. Bud Light</h3>
<div>
<div class="video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video"><iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gl_GBZzO27c?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
</div>
<p>Here, we have a TV ad run by Miller Lite in response to a controversial Bud Light campaign. In the weeks leading up to this counterattack, Bud Light made headlines with the claim that their beer is healthier than others (e.g., Miller) due to the lack of corn syrup. Bud Light’s rivals did not take kindly to what they perceived as slander, of course, and Miller went so far as to parody their competitor’s infamous campaign.</p>
<p>The 30-second video takes place on the set of a Bud Light ad. When the director calls “Cut!” and the actors break from character, a few members of the cast and crew head to their tent to share a couple beers. Rather than opting for Bud Light, however, everyone grabs a Miller. As they chat, the audience is shown a simple message:</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/comparative-advertising-miller-lite-ad.jpg" alt="Miller Lite ad" width="770" height="364" /></div>
<p>Put differently: Miller Lite offers more value than Bud Light simply because it tastes better.</p>
<h3>5. Wendy’s vs. McDonald’s</h3>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/comparative-advertising-wendys-ad.jpg" alt="Wendy's tweet" width="800" height="754" /></div>
<p>We interrupt this litany of TV ads to bring you a different form of comparative advertising: a tweet. In the wake of Marvel Studios’ <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>, Twitter was overrun by memes related to the film’s ending (spoiler alert: Thanos turns half of living creatures into dust). Known for their light-hearted and unpredictable online presence, the social team over at Wendy’s couldn’t help but get in on the action.</p>
<p>The result? A destined-to-go-viral tweet that shows the McDonald’s Big Mac turning into dust. Although that image would’ve been funny (and topical) in and of itself, it was the caption that truly sent this thing over the top: “[That feeling when] your beef’s still frozen.” For those who don’t keep up with the goings on of multinational fast food restaurants—probably for the best—Wendy’s has built their brand around the use of fresh (i.e., never frozen) beef. In this case, they chose to communicate that message by way of comparison to McDonald’s.</p>
<h3>6. Samsung vs. Apple</h3>
<div>
<div class="video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video"><iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ZgYlpBWfPc?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
</div>
<p>Jam-packed with hilarious digs at iPhone fanatics, this ad for the Samsung Galaxy II is my favorite example of comparative advertising. As they wait in an outrageously long line for the debut of the new iPhone—this is implied, as the words “Apple” and “iPhone” aren’t said—Apple customers are blown away to meet people on the street who are using a different kind of smartphone: a Samsung.</p>
<p>As they marvel at the size of the Galaxy II screen and fantasize about the convenience of 4G speed, the Apple loyalists begin to realize that alternative devices have plenty to offer as well. To bring it all home, the 60-second video ends with a simple but powerful message: “The next big thing is already here.”</p>
<h3>7. Dove vs. everyone else</h3>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/comparative-advertising-dove-ad.jpg" alt="Dove ad " width="563" height="720" /></div>
<p>Like Allstate, Dove opted to compare themselves against a nameless amalgam of competitors rather than a specific rival. The message is simple and memorable: Whereas lesser lotions treat your skin harshly, Dove treats your skin with care. The inclusion of barbed wire, of course, is intended to drive the point home.</p>
<p>There’s something to be said about following in the footsteps of Dove and Allstate. When you go after a single specific competitor, there’s a greater chance of some consumers perceiving your marketing as malicious. Being perceived in this way can have disastrous consequences, as the negative connotation forged in your prospects’ heads may overpower your messaging entirely. Alternatively, going after an anonymous combination of competitors allows you to retain a good reputation while still communicating your value as a business in a memorable way.</p>
<h3>8. Popeyes vs. Chick-fil-A</h3>
<p>If you <em>must </em>go after a specific competitor, it helps when a large proportion of their customer base is united by a common frustration. Case in point: Popeyes’ recent shot at industry rival Chick-fil-A. The latter restaurant, for those who don’t know, is (in)famous for being closed on Sundays. As you can imagine, many fans of the Chick-fil-A menu are disappointed when the final day of the week rolls around and they’re unable to buy their favorite chicken sandwich.</p>
<p>Brilliantly, the marketing team at Popeyes noticed that National Sandwich Day 2019 fell on a Sunday and quickly went to work. In the ad, a man walks up to a highway sign advertising nearby restaurants and prints the words “Open Sunday” underneath the Popeyes logo. Directly to the left, of course, are the words “Closed on Sunday” underneath the Chick-fil-A logo.</p>
<p>Now <em>that </em>is a strong value proposition: “Our biggest rival is closed, but we’re still open. Come on by and enjoy a delicious chicken sandwich.”</p>
<h3>9. BMW vs. Mercedes</h3>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/comparative-advertising-bmw-tweet.jpg" alt="BMW tweet" width="711" height="747" /></div>
<p>We’ll wrap up this guide to comparative advertising with another example from Twitter. Last Halloween, BMW racked up tens of thousands of retweets and likes when they poked fun at rival auto manufacturer Mercedes-Benz. As you can see, the tweet features an image of a Mercedes-Benz sports car wearing a BMW costume. The punchline, naturally, is that the BMW is a superhero to the Mercedes. Every Mercedes wants to be a BMW in the same way that every kid in New York City wants to be Spider-Man.</p>
<p>Like the folks at Wendy’s, the BMW social team does a great job of keeping things light-hearted while still asserting themselves as the superior brand. You may think that a tweet like this does nothing more than make people chuckle, but remember this: 53% of consumers say they remember funny ads. If you’re trying to make a strong impression, taking a page from the BMW playbook might not be such a bad idea.</p>
