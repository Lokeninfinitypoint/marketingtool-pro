										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every business relies on leads–potential customers who have shown some level of interest in their product or service. But not all leads are the same. Some are ready to buy, while others need time, education, and engagement before they consider making a purchase.</p>
<p>Businesses categorize leads into three types to better understand and manage them: cold, warm, and hot. Cold leads are people who may not be aware of your brand or actively looking for a solution, while hot leads are highly engaged prospects who are ready to take action.</p>
<p>This article focuses on the key differences between hot vs. cold leads and why distinguishing between them matters. Knowing where a lead falls on the spectrum helps businesses tailor their marketing and sales efforts, ensuring that cold leads are nurtured effectively while hot leads receive the right push to convert.</p>

<div id="what-are-cold-leads"></div>
<h2>What are cold leads?</h2>
<p>Cold leads are individuals or businesses that haven’t interacted with your brand before. They’re unfamiliar with your product or service and often aren’t actively looking for solutions, yet. While they may not convert immediately, with the right approach, they can be nurtured into warm and eventually hot leads.</p>
<p>Cold leads share a few characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>They lack awareness of your brand or offerings.</li>
<li>They aren’t actively searching for the solutions you provide.</li>
<li>They require time and effort to build trust and interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Common examples include website visitors who haven’t interacted with your brand beyond a single page view or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-media-strategy">social media followers</a> who have never engaged with your content.</p>
<p>Similarly, people who interacted with your brand only once and didn’t show interest after can also be considered cold leads. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>People who <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/11/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups">signed up for a newsletter</a> but never opened an email.</li>
<li>Leads who downloaded a resource but haven’t engaged further.</li>
<li>Tradeshow or webinar attendees who haven’t responded to follow-ups.</li>
</ul>
<p>When working with cold leads, don’t jump straight into a sales pitch as that can push them away. These people are not ready to buy your products or avail your services, so engage them by offering them free advice and information, and keep them coming back to your website by posting helpful content.</p>

<h2>What are hot leads?</h2>
<p>Hot leads are individuals or businesses who are highly interested in your product or service and ready to make a purchase. They’ve moved past the awareness and consideration stages, and demonstrate strong intent to buy.</p>
<p>These leads are characterized by their active engagement with your brand, such as submitting inquiries, requesting demos, or reaching out for more information. They often have <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/25/buyer-persona-examples">clearly defined needs or problems to solve</a> and are actively comparing solutions, making them prime candidates for conversion.</p>
<p>For example, if someone directly requests pricing or contacts your sales team, they are a hot lead. The same goes for website visitors who spend significant time exploring product or service pages. These behaviors signal that they are not just interested but are preparing to make a decision.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/pool-installation-contact-form-png.webp" alt="contact form for pool installation company" width="1200" height="609" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90548" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/pool-installation-contact-form-png.webp 1200w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/pool-installation-contact-form-980x497.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/pool-installation-contact-form-480x244.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw" /></p>

<p>For hot leads, the focus should be on conversion. Fast and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/personalized-marketing">personalized responses</a> can reinforce their decision while highlighting your unique selling points and removing any potential barriers to purchase can ensure a smooth transition to a sale. At this stage, the goal is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization-marketing">simplify their buying process</a> and build confidence in their choice.</p>
<p>When you identify someone as a hot lead, do not delay your responses to them because they are likely talking to a competitor as well. Address all of their concerns and make the purchase process as frictionless as possible to convert hot leads into paying customers.</p>

<div id="how-to-convert-cold-leads-into-hot-leads"></div>
<h2>The three phases of converting cold leads into hot leads</h2>
<p>Converting cold leads into hot leads involves guiding them through three key phases: awareness, engagement, and nurturing. Each phase builds upon the last, gradually increasing their interest and readiness to buy.</p>
<h3>1. Awareness phase</h3>
<p>Start by making your brand visible to cold audiences. Use targeted ads, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO</a>, and social media to reach potential customers who may not know about your offerings. Use engaging, educational content, like blogs, videos, and guides, that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points">addresses common pain points</a> and introduces your solution in a way that feels helpful rather than sales-driven.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A blog post that ranks in SERPs can help you get on a potential lead&#8217;s radar.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Get copy-and-paste social media posts ready for the whole year</strong> in our <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteMonthlySocialMediaCalendarTemplate.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Template_MonthlySocialMediaCalendar_Download">free social media template</a>!</p>
<h3>2. Engagement phase</h3>
<p>Once you’ve captured their attention, focus on deepening the connection. Offer personalized emails and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/15/lead-magnet-ideas">lead magnets</a>, such as free trials, webinars, or downloadable resources, to encourage interaction. Build trust by sharing case studies and testimonials that showcase how others have successfully used your product or service.</p>

<h3>3. Nurture phase</h3>
<p>To keep the momentum going, maintain consistent follow-ups and use retargeting campaigns to stay top of mind. Marketing automation tools can help you track their engagement and deliver tailored content based on their actions. As they move closer to making a decision, ensure your messaging addresses their specific needs and concerns to make the transition into a hot lead seamless.</p>

<p>By moving cold leads through these phases, you’ll steadily build interest, trust, and readiness to convert, transforming them into valuable, sales-ready prospects.</p>
<h2>Tools and techniques for managing hot and cold leads</h2>
<p>Effective lead management is essential for converting prospects into customers and optimizing your sales funnel. The right tools and techniques can help you categorize leads, track their progress, and engage them strategically.</p>
<h3>CRM software</h3>
<p>These tools allow you to organize your leads, track interactions, and monitor their journey through the sales funnel. By keeping everything in one place, CRM software ensures that no opportunity slips through the cracks.</p>
<h3>Lead scoring</h3>
<p>By assigning scores based on behaviors such as email opens, website visits, or demo requests, you can identify when a cold lead transitions into a warm or hot lead. Most CRMs and marketing automation tools have a customizable <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-scoring">lead scoring</a> system that helps prioritize efforts, ensuring that the most sales-ready leads receive attention first.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/lead-scoring-from-dash-by-localiq-300x216.webp" alt="lead scoring number on dash by localiq dashboard" width="300" height="216" class="aligncenter wp-image-90491 size-medium" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/lead-scoring-from-dash-by-localiq-300x216.webp 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/lead-scoring-from-dash-by-localiq-480x346.webp 480w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/lead-scoring-from-dash-by-localiq-png.webp 625w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h3>Data analytics tools</h3>
<p>These tools provide valuable information about lead behavior, engagement levels, and conversion rates. By understanding what works and what doesn’t for different lead types, you can adjust your approach to maximize efficiency and results. <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> is a prime example of a data analytics tool you can use to measure the effectiveness of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/11/03/lead-nurturing">lead nurturing strategies</a>.</p>
<p>Combining these tools and techniques enables you to streamline your lead management process and tailor your efforts to each lead’s specific needs, improving your chances of success.</p>
<div id="building-a-feedback-loop"></div>
<h2>Beyond the funnel: Building a feedback loop</h2>
<p>The sales process doesn’t end with conversion, it’s just the beginning of a longer journey. Even hot leads need continued nurturing after they’ve made a purchase to ensure loyalty and long-term value. Engaging with customers post-sale provides opportunities to strengthen relationships, encourage repeat business, and gain valuable insights.</p>
<p>To build a feedback loop, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-get-customer-feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">encourage feedback from converted leads</a> to refine your strategies for both cold and hot prospects. Understanding what resonated with successful leads can help you replicate those tactics, while insights from those who didn’t convert can highlight gaps in your approach and areas for improvement.</p>

<p>Why so many failed email sends? Most of your emails either ended up in spam folders or worse, never reached your audience.</p>

<p>Your email sender reputation is the unseen gatekeeper determining whether your emails land in inboxes or vanish into digital oblivion. Understanding and managing email sender reputation is essential to maximize deliverability and engagement.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll explore everything you need to know about email sender reputation and equip you with actionable strategies to improve yours.</p>

<h2>What is an email sender reputation?</h2>
<p>Email sender <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reputation-management">reputation</a> is a metric that determines how trustworthy an email—and the account that sent it—is. It reflects how internet service providers (ISPs) view your emails and whether they think your recipients want to see them.</p>
<p>An email sender reputation is like a credit score but for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/01/email-marketing-tips">email marketing</a>. ISPs and email providers are like the credit providers. They review your reputation (or score) to decide whether you’re a risk or not. Then, instead of approving a loan, ISPs decide if your email gets blocked, gets labeled as spam, or makes it to the receiver’s inbox. Just like a credit score, the higher your reputation, the more likely you are to have success.</p>
<div id="how-are-email-sender-reputations-scored"></div>
<h2>How email sender reputations are scored</h2>
<p>The scale used to express an email sender reputation depends on the scoring system used by monitoring tools. Here are some common examples:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://gmail.com/postmaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Postmaster Tools</a> use a non-numerical range:
<ul>
<li><strong>Bad</strong>: Likely to have deliverability issues.</li>
<li><strong>Low</strong>: At risk but not critical.</li>
<li><strong>Medium</strong>: Average reputation.</li>
<li><strong>High</strong>: Strong reputation with minimal deliverability concerns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/snds/addnetwork.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft SNDS</a> (Smart Network Data Services) works similarly to Google Postmaster Tools, with qualitative insights rather than exact numbers.</li>
<li><a href="https://talosintelligence.com/reputation_center/email_rep" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Talos Intelligence</a> (Cisco) uses a numerical range of -10 (very poor) to +10 (excellent), with neutral at 0.</li>
</ol>
<ul></ul>
<ol></ol>

<div id="why-does-email-sender-reputation-matter"></div>
<h2>Why does email sender reputation matter?</h2>
<p>Email sender reputation directly influences whether your emails reach their intended audience or are sidelined as spam. A strong reputation ensures better deliverability and engagement. Your sender reputation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Determines inbox placement: </strong>A high reputation means more emails get to their intended inboxes. Low reputation means emails going to spam folders and never being seen.</li>
<li><strong>Impacts engagement metrics: </strong>A good reputation leads to higher inbox placement, which drives more opens, clicks, and conversions.</li>
<li><strong>Protects brand credibility</strong>: A poor reputation, signaled by spammy emails or frequent complaints, damages trust and risks alienating your audience.</li>
<li><strong>Drives ROI for email campaigns: </strong>A strong sender reputation gets you higher deliverability rates, and every percentage point in deliverability translates to better campaign performance and profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Avoids an email embargo: </strong>If your reputation falls too low, you risk being embargoed by ISPs or spam-monitoring organizations. A higher reputation keeps you out of this nefarious club.</li>
</ul>
<p>Email sender reputation impacts deliverability, engagement, brand trust, ROI, and your ability to avoid serious consequences like blacklisting. By prioritizing reputation management, you can make sure your emails consistently reach and resonate with your audience.</p>
<div id="8-factors" that-influence-sender-reputation="&quot;"></div>
<h2>8 factors that influence email sender reputation and how to control them</h2>
<p>Eight key factors shape your email sender reputation. Collectively, they signal to ISPs whether your emails are trustworthy and relevant. The good news is these factors are within your control, and you can manage them to improve your sender reputation.</p>
<h3>1. Bounce rates</h3>
<p>Bounce rates are the percentage of emails that fail to deliver, typically due to invalid, inactive, or non-existent addresses. A high bounce rate signals poor list hygiene.</p>
<p>ISPs interpret frequent bounces as a sign you’re not maintaining a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/11/how-to-build-an-email-list">quality email list</a>, which can lower your reputation. If you have a high bounce rate, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regularly clean your email list to remove invalid or inactive addresses</strong>: Use email validation tools like <a href="https://www.neverbounce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeverBounce</a> or <a href="https://www.zerobounce.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZeroBounce</a> to identify and remove addresses that are no longer valid or active.</li>
<li><strong>Implement double opt-in for new subscribers</strong>: Ensure that only valid and interested people are added to your list by requiring subscribers to confirm their email addresses before they are fully added.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor and update email collection methods</strong>: Evaluate how you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/11/email-list-building">collect email addresses</a> to ensure accuracy, such as using registration form validation to prevent typos and capturing only verified, high-quality leads.</li>

<h3>2. Spam complaints</h3>
<ol start="2"></ol>
<p>Spam complaints are the number of times recipients mark your emails as spam. When recipients mark your emails as spam, it’s a red flag for ISPs that your content is unwelcome. High complaint rates quickly erode your sender reputation and lead to lower deliverability.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set clear expectations during signup</strong>: Clearly <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/11/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups">communicate what type of content</a> subscribers will receive, how often you&#8217;ll email them, and any additional benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor and suppress unengaged recipients</strong>: Regularly review engagement metrics and remove or suppress subscribers who haven’t interacted with your emails for a long time.</li>
<li><strong>Use clear opt-in methods</strong>: Ensure that everyone on your email list has explicitly agreed to receive your emails.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Recipient engagement</h3>
<ol start="3"></ol>
<p>Recipient engagement is a measure of how recipients interact with your emails, including actions like opening, clicking, and reading. Engagement metrics like open rates, click-through rates, and time spent on emails reflect how interested recipients are in your content.</p>
<p>Low engagement suggests to ISPs that your emails lack value, which leads to inbox placement issues. To address this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personalize your emails</strong>: Tailor your content by using recipient data such as names, past interactions, or preferences.<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing"> Personalized emails</a> make recipients feel valued and increase the likelihood of engagement, which signals ISPs that your emails are relevant.</li>
<li><strong>Segment your audience</strong>: Group your email list into smaller, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/13/targeted-email-marketing-strategies">targeted segments</a> based on factors like demographics, purchase history, or behavior. Sending specific content to the right audience increases relevance and improves metrics like open and click-through rates.</li>
<li><strong>Optimize your email timing</strong>: Analyze when your audience is most likely to engage with emails and schedule sends accordingly. Tools like email marketing platforms can provide insights into <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/best-time-to-send-email-campaign">optimal send times</a> based on past performance.</li>
<li><strong>Create mobile-friendly emails</strong>: Many recipients open emails on mobile devices, so ensure your emails are optimized for smaller screens with responsive designs, clear fonts, and concise messaging. A poor mobile experience can lead to disengagement.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Sending practices</h3>
<p>Sending practices refer to the consistency and quality of your email-sending behavior, such as maintaining a steady volume and avoiding unverified lists, which impacts ISP trust.</p>
<p>ISPs monitor the consistency and legitimacy of your email-sending patterns. Sudden spikes in email volume or sending to purchased lists can raise red flags, harming your reputation.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to refine your email-sending practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maintain a consistent sending volume</strong>: Sudden spikes or drops in email volume can make ISPs suspicious of your activity. For example, sending thousands of emails after weeks of inactivity might trigger filters. Plan your campaigns to send emails at a steady and predictable pace to build trust over time.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid purchased or scraped lists</strong>: Using lists that haven’t been <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/15/lead-magnet-ideas">organically collected</a> leads to higher bounce rates, spam complaints, and potential spam trap hits. Instead, grow your list through opt-ins, where recipients voluntarily subscribe to receive your emails.</li>
<li><strong>Warm up new IPs gradually</strong>: If you’re starting with a new IP address, don’t send large volumes of emails immediately. Begin with smaller sends to highly engaged recipients, gradually increasing the volume to establish a positive reputation with ISPs.</li>
<li><strong>Respect frequency preferences</strong>: Give recipients control over how often they receive emails from you. Sending too many emails can annoy subscribers and increase complaints, while too few might result in disengagement.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Authentication protocols</h3>
<ol start="5"></ol>
<p>Authentication protocols are verification methods like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC that confirm your identity as a legitimate sender, reducing the risk of being flagged as spam. Here’s what each of these acronyms mean:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SPF (Sender Policy Framework)</strong>: An email authentication protocol that verifies whether a sender&#8217;s IP address is authorized to send emails on behalf of a domain.</li>
<li><strong>DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)</strong>: An email authentication method that uses cryptographic signatures to ensure the email&#8217;s content has not been altered during transit.</li>
<li><strong>DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance)</strong>: A policy framework that builds on SPF and DKIM to help email senders and receivers prevent spoofing and phishing while providing visibility through reports.</li>
</ul>
<p>Missing or misconfigured protocols make your emails appear suspicious and increase the likelihood of being flagged as spam.</p>
<p>Setting up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC improves email deliverability by ensuring your emails are authenticated and trusted by ISPs. These protocols protect your domain from spoofing and phishing attacks, enhance sender reputation by demonstrating compliance with authentication standards, and reduce the likelihood of being flagged as spam.</p>
<p>Additionally, DMARC provides valuable insights into email activity through detailed reports, helping you monitor and fine-tune your email strategy for better performance.</p>
<p>Here’s how to set up each protocol.</p>
<h4>Sender Policy Framework (SPF)</h4>
<p>Log in to your domain registrar or hosting provider to manage DNS records. Then, add a TXT record to your domain&#8217;s DNS with the following format:</p>
<p><strong>makefilev=spf1</strong></p>
<p><strong>include:example.com ~all</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Replace example.com with the email service providers you use (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid).</li>
<li>Use ~all for soft fail (recommended for testing) or -all for hard fail (stricter enforcement).</li>
</ul>
<p>After that<strong>, </strong>save changes to your DNS. Propagation may take a few hours. As a final step, use tools like <a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MXToolbox</a> or <a href="https://easydmarc.com/tools/spf-lookup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SPF Record Checker</a> to verify the setup.</p>
<h4>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)</h4>
<p>Most email providers (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid) offer a DKIM key in their account settings. Go to account settings and generate a DKIM key. After that, add a TXT record with the selector and public key provided by your email provider.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how that looks:</p>
<p><strong>vbnet</strong></p>
<p><strong>Name: selector._domainkey.example.com</strong></p>
<p><strong>Value: v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=&lt;public key&gt;</strong></p>
<p>Once the TXT record is added in your email provider&#8217;s settings, enable DKIM signing for outgoing emails. Use email testing tools or your email provider’s verification tool to confirm the DKIM signature is applied correctly. Besides <a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MX Toolbox</a>, <a href="https://www.mail-tester.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mail Tester</a> is also a good tool to test this.</p>
<h4>Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)</h4>
<p>Decide on your policy (monitoring, quarantine, or reject). For example:</p>
<p><strong>css</strong></p>
<p><strong>v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@example.com</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>p=none: Monitor and gather data.</li>
<li>p=quarantine: Mark unauthorized emails as spam.</li>
<li>p=reject: Block unauthorized emails outright.</li>
</ul>
<p>After that, add a TXT record to your DNS with the DMARC policy, like this example:</p>
<p><strong>css</strong></p>
<p><strong>Name: _dmarc.example.com</strong></p>
<p><strong>Value: v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@example.com</strong></p>
<p>Start with p=none to monitor activity, then move to stricter policies (quarantine or reject) as your setup stabilizes. Use a DMARC reporting tool like <a href="https://dmarcian.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DMARCian</a> or <a href="https://emailsecurity.fortra.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Agari</a> to analyze authentication reports and fine-tune your policy.</p>
<h3>6. Spam trap hits</h3>
<p>Spam traps are email addresses intentionally created by ISPs and anti-spam organizations to identify senders who are using poor list management practices. Real people do not use these addresses and never sign up for email lists, so if your email lands in a spam trap, it signals that you may be sending to unverified or outdated addresses. Spam trap hits can severely damage your sender reputation.</p>
<p>If you use double opt-ins for email signups and regularly clean your email list, your chances of landing in a spam trap are already low. In addition to that, make sure you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid purchased or scraped lists</strong>: Purchased or scraped email lists often contain spam traps. Always build your email lists organically through legitimate signup processes.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor engagement metrics</strong>: Keep an eye on recipient engagement (opens, clicks, etc.). If certain segments show no activity, suppress or remove them from your list to reduce the risk of hitting a trap.</li>
<li><strong>Conduct regular audits</strong>: Periodically review your list management practices and audit your email database to ensure compliance with industry standards. Besides the tools we have already recommended, <a href="https://kickbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kickbox</a> and <a href="https://debounce.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Debounce</a> can also help you with your audits.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Content quality</h3>
<ol start="7"></ol>
<p>Content quality refers to the relevance, clarity, and value of the emails you send to your audience. ISPs and spam filters analyze your content to determine whether it meets recipients&#8217; expectations or if it resembles spam.</p>
<p>Poor-quality content, such as misleading <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/31/email-subject-lines">subject lines</a>, excessive promotional language, or irrelevant messaging, harms your email sender reputation and reduces deliverability.</p>
<p>To ensure high-quality email content, follow these best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Craft clear and honest subject lines</strong>: Avoid clickbait or deceptive language in your subject lines. Use wording that accurately reflects the content of the email.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid spammy keywords and phrases</strong>: Words like &#8220;free,&#8221; &#8220;guaranteed,&#8221; and &#8220;act now&#8221; can trigger spam filters if overused. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/21/promotional-email-examples">Promotional emails</a> are okay; just keep your language professional and relevant to your audience.</li>
<li><strong>Provide value in every email</strong>: Deliver content that aligns with your recipients&#8217; interests and needs, such as helpful tips, exclusive offers, or personalized recommendations.</li>
<li><strong>Test and optimize your emails</strong>: Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/02/26/ab-testing-best-practices">A/B testing</a> to experiment with different subject lines, layouts, and content formats. Analyze the results to refine your approach and consistently improve the quality of your emails.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/email-sender-reputation-wordstream-spa.webp" alt="Email sender reputation - Example email from a spa." width="867" height="469" class="aligncenter wp-image-88774 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/email-sender-reputation-wordstream-spa.webp 867w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/email-sender-reputation-wordstream-spa-480x260.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 867px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Timely, </em><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-email-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>targeted emails</em></a><em> with clear subject lines and valuable content will leave you with a strong email sender reputation.</em></p>
<h3>8. Domain and IP reputation</h3>
<p>Domain and IP reputation reflect the trustworthiness of your sending domain and the IP address used to send emails. ISPs evaluate these reputations to decide whether your emails are delivered, flagged as spam, or blocked entirely. Poor practices or shared IP issues degrade your reputation.</p>
<p>To build and protect a strong domain and IP reputation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start slow and build up</strong>: When starting with a new IP, send emails in small batches to your most engaged recipients. Gradually increase the volume over time to establish a positive sending history and avoid ISP suspicion.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid sending from shared IPs (if possible)</strong>: On shared IPs, other senders&#8217; poor practices can affect your reputation. Use a dedicated IP if your email volume is high enough to justify it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Take charge of your email sender reputation</h2>
<p>Email sender reputation isn’t static; it evolves with every email you send. By addressing the eight factors that influence reputation, you&#8217;re not just fixing immediate problems but building a long-term strategy for trust and consistency.</p>
<p>Controlling these eight factors can serve as your blueprint for effective <a href="https://localiq.com/products/targeted-email-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email marketing</a>. Every step, from avoiding spam traps to warming up new IPs, contributes to a cohesive system that ensures your emails reach their audience.</p>
<p>Review your current practices, run audits, and start small by implementing one improvement today. By prioritizing these practices, you’ll create a system that amplifies your impact and makes sure your messages reach and resonate with your audience.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a recap of the eight factors that influence your email sender reputation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bounce rates</li>
<li>Spam complaints</li>
<li>Recipient engagement</li>
<li>Sending practices</li>
<li>Authentication protocals</li>
<li>Spam trap hits</li>
<li>Content quality</li>
<li>Domain and IP reputation</li>

<h2>What is brand perception?</h2>
<p>Brand perception goes beyond just a logo and a tagline. It encompasses everything from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/04/customer-experience-strategy">customer experience</a> and product quality to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/09/company-core-values">brand values</a> and social responsibility.</p>
<p>Here are just a few inputs that make up the perception people have about your brand:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Website:</strong> This includes the appearance, content, and user experience for all of your web pages.</li>
<li><strong>Branding:</strong> Your logo, mission statement, brand colors, and tag lines are part of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/23/how-brand-your-business">branding</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Social media presence:</strong> What you post, where you post, and how you engage with followers fall into the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/17/increase-online-presence">social media presence</a> bucket.</li>
<li><strong>Customer experience:</strong> This includes how customers feel about your products and service and how they share their experience online and in person.</li>

<div id="why-should-you-measure-brand-perception"></div>
<h2>Why should you measure brand perception?</h2>
<p>Think of brand perception as your reputation in the schoolyard. If you&#8217;re known for being reliable, trustworthy, and cool, classmates are more likely to befriend you.</p>
<p>In the business world, a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/06/online-reputation-management">good reputation</a> results in more people becoming your loyal customers. But if rumors paint a different picture, you might struggle to gain trust. That&#8217;s why it is important to understand and measure brand perception.</p>
<p>A strong brand perception builds trust and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/brand-loyalty">loyalty</a>, ultimately driving sales. It&#8217;s the invisible force shaping customer decisions and propelling business success.</p>
<p>When you track and quantify your brand’s perception, you can take action to shape it. Say you learn that people feel like your services are overpriced. Are they actually higher than your competitors? If not, you can launch some messaging to address that misperception.</p>

<h2>How to measure brand perception</h2>
<p>So, how do you gauge your brand perception? The good news is there&#8217;s a toolbox full of tactics at your disposal.</p>
<h3>1. Surveys and questionnaires</h3>
<p>The best way to find out what your customers think about your brand is to <em>ask them! </em>Here are three different ways you can gather customer feedback directly:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer satisfaction surveys</strong>: Use tools like <a href="https://www.google.com/forms/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Forms</a> and <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SurveyMonkey</a> to create custom surveys to assess customer satisfaction with your products, services, and overall brand experience.</li>
<li><strong>Brand awareness surveys</strong>: Design surveys that measure how well your target audience <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">recognizes your brand</a> name and logo.</li>
<li><strong>Brand attribute research</strong>: Ask customers to rate your brand on key dimensions like quality, reliability, and customer service.</li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>
<p>Here’s a great example. <a href="https://www.alishaarnold.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alisha Arnold</a> helps Airbnb hosts improve their rankings and get more bookings. Her goal for this year is to return to one-on-one coaching sessions. So, she set up a survey her followers can participate in to weigh in–and win prizes:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brand-perception-wordstream-giveaway.webp" alt="Brand perception - enter to win ad." width="497" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87145 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brand-perception-wordstream-giveaway.webp 497w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brand-perception-wordstream-giveaway-480x579.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 497px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C2ffzAop6gx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>2. Social media listening</h3>
<p>Another way of determining how your brand is received in the market is by <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/20/social-listening">listening</a> to those talking about it on social media.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can do that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sentiment analysis</strong>: Tools like<a href="https://brand24.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Brand24</a> and<a href="https://mention.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Mention</a> offer sentiment analysis features. These tools scan social media posts and comments for mentions of your brand and then categorize them as positive, negative, or neutral.</li>
<li><strong>Hashtag monitoring</strong>: Both Brand24 and Mention also allow you to track <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">hashtags</a> related to your brand and industry. This helps you understand how people talk about you and identify emerging trends.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement metrics</strong>: <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">51%</a> of the most memorable brands are those that engage with their customers on social media. Analyze native social media analytics to gauge engagement around your brand. Look at metrics like likes, shares, comments, and replies to understand how your audience interacts with your content.</li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>
<ul></ul>
<h3>3. Online reviews and ratings</h3>
<ol start="3"></ol>
<p>As mentioned above, potential customers will want to know how your brand treats people who do business with you. And they’ll do so by visiting the reviews and ratings you’ve received.</p>
<p>So, spruce up your record by doing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Review analysis</strong>: Claim your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/10/create-google-my-business-account">Google Business Profile</a>, Yelp account, and other <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/01/business-directory-listings">business listings</a>. These platforms allow you to respond directly to reviews, both positive and negative. So, check them regularly.</li>
<li><strong>Rating systems</strong>: Analyze the average star ratings given to your products or services on platforms like <a href="https://www.google.com/shopping?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Shopping</a> and industry-specific review sites. These ratings offer a direct indicator of customer perception.</li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>
<p>Here’s how one brand uses its great ratings. <a href="https://smilealot.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smile a Lot</a> is a Canada-based dental care business. Their official Instagram profile proudly displays high ratings and positive reviews their customers leave for them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brand-perception-wordstream-smileallot.webp" alt="Brand perception - online review screenshot." width="865" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87146 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brand-perception-wordstream-smileallot.webp 865w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brand-perception-wordstream-smileallot-480x333.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 865px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyx-F90MPY4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>4. Focus groups</h3>
<p>Use online communities like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/16/create-facebook-group">Facebook groups</a> or niche online forums on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/drive-traffic-from-reddit">Reddit</a> that are relevant to your industry. Here, you can engage in discussions and pose questions to get a feel for brand perception among your target audience.</p>
<p>Try searching for your business&#8217;s name in these forums. If you search for the products you sell, you may also see how your competitors are perceived.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.deargirlsltd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dear Girls</a> is an emotional well-being organization for Black women. Besides a Discord group and an active <a href="https://www.instagram.com/deargirlsltd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a> page, the brand has recently put out a call for its members to join a focus group. That will give them a source of direct feedback from the organization’s core audience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brand-perception-wordstream-deargirls.webp" alt="Brand perception - focus group flyer." width="613" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87147 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brand-perception-wordstream-deargirls.webp 613w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brand-perception-wordstream-deargirls-480x470.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 613px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C6JKvSeIlcf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>5. Net Promoter Score (NPS)</h3>
<p>Net Promoter Score, or NPS, measures customer loyalty by asking how likely they are to recommend a company&#8217;s product or service to others. It’s a great tool for incorporating <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/24/customer-feedback">customer feedback into your strategy</a>.</p>
<p>Negative NPS feedback acts as a red flag, highlighting areas where brand perception needs improvement. The proactive nature of NPS surveys demonstrates your commitment to customer success and a willingness to enhance brand perception.</p>
<p>There are several free NPS calculators available online. Tools like SurveyMonkey’s <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/nps-calculator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPS Calculator</a> allow you to create and send NPS surveys to measure customer loyalty and their likelihood to recommend your brand.</p>
<h3>6. In-depth interviews</h3>
<p>Do you know who your best customers are? You know, the ones who use your product the most, have maximum lifetime value (LTV), are willing to give feedback, and have switched from a competitor brand to yours recently?</p>
<p>If you can identify them, involve them in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One-on-one conversations</strong>: Schedule video calls with a handful of loyal customers or those who haven&#8217;t engaged with your brand recently.</li>
<li><strong>Stakeholder interviews</strong>: Expand your perspective by interviewing key suppliers and partners.</li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>
<p>Ask open-ended questions to delve into their experiences, motivations, and overall brand perception. Their insights will reveal blind spots in your brand perception and expose areas for improvement across the customer journey.</p>
<h3>7. Search engine data</h3>
<p>Monitor how often your brand is searched for on search engines, which is an indicator of brand recognition and interest. Use tools like <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Trends</a> or the <a href="https://ads.google.com/intl/en/home/tools/keyword-planner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads Keyword Planner</a> to monitor how often your brand name and related <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide">keywords</a> are searched. This will indicate brand awareness and interest levels.</p>
<p>Identify and analyze variations of your brand name and associated keywords. Look at branded terms (product names, taglines) and non-branded terms related to your industry. This helps reveal what aspects of your brand or products are attracting the most attention.</p>
<p>Let’s say you work for <a href="https://www.fourseasonsheatingcooling.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Four Seasons HVAC</a>, a Chicago-based HVAC contractor that offers heating, air conditioning, plumbing, and electrical services. Keywords like “HVAC service” and “air conditioner repair” are as relevant to them as branded key phrases like ”four seasons heating and cooling.” By keeping an eye on the search volume of their branded keyword, they can see if they are gaining or losing popularity. They can also track the People Also Ask section on Google to see what kind of questions people are asking about them.</p>
<p>You can also set up <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-set-up-google-alerts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Alerts</a> for your business or industry topics. You’ll get emails straight from Google whenever relevant content pops up on the search engine.</p>
<h3>8. Local events</h3>
<p>Participating in local events is a powerful way to engage directly with the community and gain valuable insights into brand perception. Select local events that align with your brand values and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a>. This could include community fairs, trade shows, sports events, or local festivals. Sponsoring such events is also a good idea.</p>
<p>Once you have chosen events to participate in, use your social media, website, and local advertising to promote them. Monitor the engagement these announcements receive to gauge initial interest and sentiment.</p>
<p>At the event, use surveys or quick polls at your booth to collect immediate feedback. Offer a small incentive for completing these surveys, like a discount or free sample of your products. Pay attention to how attendees react to your products or marketing materials. Direct interactions with the audience will provide qualitative insights that are as valuable as structured survey responses.</p>
<p>After the event, analyze the surveys and feedback forms that you gathered. Look for patterns or recurring themes that indicate general sentiment towards your brand.</p>
<div id="how-to-improve-brand-perception"></div>
<h2>How to improve brand perception</h2>
<p>To enhance your brand perception, start by listening closely to your customers. Use surveys and social media monitoring to gather their honest feedback. <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-respond-to-negative-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Address the negative reviews</a> and comments quickly and constructively. This will show that you value customer input and are committed to improvement.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brand-perception-wordstream-review-1.webp" alt="Brand perception - Negative review with a reply." width="876" height="481" class="aligncenter wp-image-87149 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brand-perception-wordstream-review-1.webp 876w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brand-perception-wordstream-review-1-480x264.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 876px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Next, amplify the positive. Share customer success stories and positive reviews on your platforms. Engage actively with your audience on social media, respond to queries, and join conversations. This demonstrates your brand&#8217;s commitment to customer satisfaction and its active presence in the community. Participate in local events to achieve the same results.</p>
<p>Finally, measure the impact of your efforts by tracking changes in customer satisfaction and brand loyalty over time. Adjust your strategies based on what the data tells you, and make sure your brand consistently aligns with customer expectations and industry standards.</p>
<h2>Boost your brand perception</h2>
<p>Brand perception may feel like a secondary metric to measure your business’ success. But it underpins every other tactic you use to find and sway new customers. A great brand perception can make your ads more efficient, your social media marketing more energetic, and your lead-generation efforts more effective. So, take a little time to monitor your reputation. It’ll pay back handsomely.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fitbit released its first product, the Fitbit Tracker, in 2009. By 2012, the brand had sold over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/472591/fitbit-devices-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 million</a> fitness trackers; by 2016, that number had jumped to over 22 million.</p>
<p>How did Fitbit grow so fast? By using a strategy called bandwagon advertising. It leverages social proof and the fear of missing out to encourage people to try new products and continue using them.</p>
<p>Here’s how bandwagon advertising works and how to use it to grow your business.</p>

<h2>What is bandwagon advertising?</h2>
<p>Bandwagon advertising taps into our desire to be part of the crowd. It convinces us that something is better simply because other people—especially those we look up to—already use it.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple breakdown of how bandwagon advertising works:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Message:</strong> &#8220;Everyone&#8217;s doing it, so should you!&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> Make you feel like you&#8217;re missing out.</li>
<li><strong>Psychology:</strong> People trust what others choose and don&#8217;t want to be left out.</li>
</ul>
<p>A simple version of bandwagon advertising would be images and copy showing many people happily using your product. Think of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">social media ads</a> with happy crowds using a new phone, social media posts filled with positive reviews, or an image of an influential soccer player chugging the latest sports drink. When people see these messages, they’re attracted to the idea of joining the “in crowd” by buying the product.</p>
<p>To make the idea more concrete, let’s return to Fitbit’s example. The company uses three tactics that combine to create a bandwagon advertising strategy.</p>
<p>First, it created<a href="https://cassiuslife.com/504676/will-smith-fitbit-premium-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> partnerships with celebrities</a> to promote its wearable trackers as the next big thing. It wasn’t just athletes; people like Sarah Jessica Parker and Will Smith donned their Fitbits to engage audiences of all types.</p>
<p>Second, the brand launched specific <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/28/user-generated-content">user-generated content</a> campaigns to show how everyday users enjoy their fitness tracker. It then used the content on social media and in its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/25/email-newsletter-ideas">newsletters</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, Fitbit built bandwagon advertising right into its product. Users can choose to automatically share their workouts on social media, tapping into a powerful networking effect.</p>
<div id="what-are-the-advantages-of-bandwagon-advertising"></div>
<h2>What are the advantages of bandwagon advertising?</h2>
<p>Bandwagon advertising uses<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/27/trust-signals"> social proof</a> to influence consumer behavior.</p>
<p>With social proof as its foundation, bandwagon advertising:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Builds trust and credibility: </strong>When potential customers see others enjoying your product, it helps validate their buying decision.</li>
<li><strong>Creates urgency and FOMO:</strong> Bandwagon advertising makes it seem like everyone&#8217;s getting something you don’t have, and you don’t want to be left behind.</li>
<li><strong>Boosts brand awareness and sales:</strong> The more people see others using and loving your product, the more likely they are to remember your brand and buy from you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ready to turn the bandwagon effect into real results? In the next section, we&#8217;ll discuss seven bandwagon advertising ideas you can implement for your small business.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Bandwagon marketing starts with knowing your audience.</strong> Download the free guide, <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteTargetAudience.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_TargetAudineceGuide_Download">How to Find Your Target Audience</a>, to get started.</p>

<h2>7 bandwagon advertising ideas and examples</h2>
<p>Bandwagon advertising is a concept that’s easy to explain but can sometimes feel difficult to execute. Done well, it can give small and medium-sized businesses an advantage over the rest of the competition. Here are some bandwagon advertising ideas you can use for your next campaign.</p>
<h3>1. User-generated content competitions</h3>
<p>User-generated content is a great way to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/13/ugc-instagram">boost engagement</a> with your audience. It bypasses skepticism and builds trust because it showcases real people using and loving your product. That’s the perfect application of bandwagon advertising.</p>
<p>Here’s a great example of how to turn your customers into brand ambassadors. <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-run-a-facebook-giveaway-or-contest/">Run a contest</a> encouraging them to create and share photos or videos using your product. This uses social proof and increases <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">brand awareness</a> for free.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-filippo.webp" alt="Bandwagon advertising - social post with a contest." width="884" height="514" class="aligncenter wp-image-85595 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-filippo.webp 884w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-filippo-480x279.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 884px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Take inspiration from<a href="https://filippoberio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Filippo Berio</a>, a famous olive oil brand. The brand ran a contest on Pancake Day, asking users to post pictures of their delicious pancake creations (presumably made with Filippo Berio olive oil) and tag them with the branded <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">hashtag</a> #FilippinFilippo. The winner received a hamper filled with goodies, and Filippo Bero got tons of amazing photos to share on their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/11/social-media-marketing-tips">social media</a> profiles.</p>
<h3>2. Nostalgia-driven bandwagon</h3>
<p>People crave connection. And what connects us better than shared memories? Nostalgia-driven bandwagon advertising taps into this emotion, creating an instant bond with your target audience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-erstwilder.webp" alt="Bandwagon advertising - social post sharing My Little Pony-themed products." width="616" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-85596 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-erstwilder.webp 616w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-erstwilder-480x468.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 616px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here’s an example from <a href="https://www.erstwilder.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ErstWilder</a>, a jewelry brand. It launched a limited-edition collection of My Little Pony accessories. Here&#8217;s how they leveraged nostalgia-driven bandwagon advertising:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choose a nostalgic product:</strong> My Little Pony is a beloved cartoon from the 80s and 90s. By referencing it, ErstWilder instantly connected with a generation.</li>
<li><strong>Encourage participation:</strong> The brand encouraged fans to share photos with the hashtag #ErstWilderMLP, creating a community and showcasing the popularity of the collection.</li>
<li><strong>Create a sense of urgency:</strong> The copy mentions that it’s a limited edition, creating urgency and a fear of missing out, further fueling the bandwagon effect.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Interactive online polls</h3>
<ol start="3"></ol>
<p>Social media is all about <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/engaging-posts-on-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engagement</a>, and what better way to engage your audience than by asking their opinion? <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-do-a-poll-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Interactive online polls</a> create a fun and interactive way to leverage the power of the bandwagon effect, just like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cookscountry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@cookscountry</a> did on Instagram.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-pie2.webp" alt="Bandwagon advertising - Bracket showing various pie types." width="370" height="588" class="aligncenter wp-image-85597 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-pie2.webp 370w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-pie2-189x300.webp 189w" sizes="(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px" /></p>
<p>Cookscountry didn&#8217;t just ask its audience what pie they liked. The brand’s team turned it into a captivating series titled &#8220;Thanksgiving Pie Showdown.&#8221; They created four polls, each featuring two delicious Thanksgiving pie options.</p>
<p>The top contenders faced off in semi-final polls, keeping the audience engaged and building anticipation for the ultimate showdown. The two finalists battled it out in a final poll, with the winner crowned &#8220;Thanksgiving Pie Showdown Champion.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-pie1.webp" alt="Bandwagon advertising - Two-question poll to pick pie winner." width="366" height="586" class="aligncenter wp-image-85598 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-pie1.webp 366w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-pie1-187x300.webp 187w" sizes="(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px" /></p>
<p>Voters even had a chance to win all the pies in the competition. This added more excitement and boosted participation.</p>
<p>While the brand wasn’t selling pies, it used the bandwagon advertising effect to engage an audience for its media brand. Ideally, many of those participating in the popular poll will stick around to see what the business does next.</p>
<h3>4. Customer testimonials</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/03/testimonial-advertising">Testimonials</a> are gold for marketers! They build trust, sound believable, and get people on the bandwagon.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-outdoorvoices.webp" alt="Bandwagon advertising - Proposal scene in a social media post." width="878" height="500" class="aligncenter wp-image-85599 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-outdoorvoices.webp 878w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-outdoorvoices-480x273.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 878px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.outdoorvoices.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outdoor Voices</a> gets it. They use short video testimonials with real people using their clothes for everything from hiking to yoga to proposing to your significant other. They even have a hashtag, #DoingThings, to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/19/brand-community">build a community</a> and show how versatile their stuff is—showing everyday people, not models, keeping testimonials genuine, building trust, and driving more sales for the brand.</p>
<h3>5. Comparative advertising</h3>
<p>Competitor marketing can be a clever way to leverage the bandwagon effect. The idea is to focus on a unique feature or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">value proposition</a> you offer that sets your offering apart. Subtly suggest that everyone&#8217;s choosing you because of it, and watch the customers roll in.</p>
<p>Take<a href="https://www.motel6.com/en/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Motel 6</a>, for instance. Although its marketing doesn&#8217;t explicitly criticize other hotels, its &#8220;Pets Stay Free&#8221; policy speaks volumes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-motel6-1.webp" alt="Bandwagon advertising - Social post promoting Motel6 free pet policy." width="889" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-85600 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-motel6-1.webp 889w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-motel6-1-480x324.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 889px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>By highlighting this perk, Motel 6 subtly implies that other places might charge extra for furry companions. This positions them as the more pet-friendly and budget-conscious option. It also creates a bandwagon effect for pet owners as they see other pet owners taking advantage of this policy.</p>
<h3>6. Influencer endorsements</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/26/influencer-marketing">Influencers</a> can be a powerful tool for small businesses. They create a bandwagon effect where people are nudged to try a product because someone they admire seems to love it.</p>
<p><a href="https://pieminister.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pieminister</a>, a Bristol-based pie company, brilliantly uses celebrity endorsements. When famous mentalist Derren Brown (who lives in Bristol) performed in town, Pieminister sent him a sample pack. Impressed, Derren tweeted about the pies. He mentioned that there was &#8220;no request asking me to tweet.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-pieminister.webp" alt="Bandwagon advertising - Tweet from Darren Brown about pies." width="881" height="530" class="aligncenter wp-image-85601 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-pieminister.webp 881w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bandwagon-advertising-wordstream-pieminister-480x289.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 881px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This authentic endorsement was gold. This social proof, combined with Derren&#8217;s large following, increased Pieminister&#8217;s social media reach by a whopping<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2014/jun/26/celebrity-endorsements-promote-business-smes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 2,574%</a>!</p>
<h3>7. Influencer and community challenges</h3>
<p>Combining influencer power with interactive challenges creates a double-whammy of bandwagon effects to build brand awareness and loyalty.</p>
<p>One of the best examples is <a href="https://www.elfcosmetics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ELF Cosmetics</a>. It created the <a href="https://www.chatdesk.com/tiktok-campaigns-and-case-studies/elf-eyeslipsface-hashtag-challenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#eyeslipsface</a> challenge on TikTok, incorporating an original song and hashtag. The brand partnered with a whole squad of established and emerging beauty influencers, who created full-face looks using only elf products. ELF also encouraged users to share their own elf looks. The campaign resulted in billions of video and hashtag views.</p>
<h2>Jump on the bandwagon advertising…erm…bandwagon</h2>
<p>People are social creatures. When we see others having success, we want to join in. The examples above show just how influential a bandwagon advertising campaign can be.</p>
<p>Just remember to keep things light. Never use shame or “othering” to guilt people into trying your products. Instead, show them how people they admire solve problems and gain fulfillment using what you sell.</p>
