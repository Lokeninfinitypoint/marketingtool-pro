]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If someone asked you what your business does, would you be able to describe it accurately in a concise, compelling manner?</p>
<p>Better yet: would your description inspire a potential customer to <em>want</em> to learn more about what you have to offer?</p>
<p>Even further, suppose multiple people wanted that description in writing—sales team members, potential customers, existing customers who want to refer you?</p>
<div><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/marketing20one-sheet20feature20image.jpg" alt="marketing one-sheet summarizes your company" width="400" height="235" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That scenario is a problem for lots of organizations. Who you are, what you provide, why you&#8217;re so awesome—it&#8217;s all immediately and perfectly clear in <em>your</em> head, but how do you create that snapshot in someone else&#8217;s head? Fortunately, there is a solution. I’m talking about the trusty marketing one-pager (aka a one-sheet or sell sheet). In this post, I&#8217;m going to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>What a one-pager is (and what it is not), and why it is essential for marketing.</li>
<li>The core elements you need when writing a one-sheet (with copy suggestions).</li>
<li>Real examples of marketing one-pagers to help you visualize and gain some inspiration.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ll also provide some tools and resources that can help you bring a great one-pager to life for your business. So let&#8217;s get started.</p>
<div id="what-is-a-one-pager"></div>
<h2>What is a marketing one-pager?</h2>
<p>As you may have deduced, it’s a <em>single page </em>that distills down what your company does and for whom. (It can also be a single page about what a <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product"><em>product</em> or <em>service</em></a> does for specific target markets.)</p>
<p>Think of the one-sheet as what’s commonly called an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/16/elevator-pitch-examples-templates">elevator speech or pitch</a>. The name suggests that your marketing message should be delivered in the time span of an elevator ride. Its general purpose is to intrigue the listener enough to want to hear the entire <a href="/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">value proposition</a> in the near future.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Its general purpose is to intrigue the listener enough to want to hear the entire proposition in the near future.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The noticeable difference with a marketing one-sheet is that it&#8217;s in written format and is portable: it can be emailed, shared on social media, downloaded, printed out and mailed, and so forth.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/marketing20one-pager20example_0.png" alt="marketing one-pager example" width="396" height="724" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-write-one-pager-kaego-ogbechie-rust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>One-pager example source</em></a></p>
<p>So while your homepage might have a lot of the core information about your business, it&#8217;s designed to send visitors out to its other pages, where they can get a holistic view of your business. With a one-pager, you present a full snapshot of your business in, well, one page.</p>
<p>An effective marketing one-pager quickly orients the reader to the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/07/unique-selling-proposition">value of your business</a>, whether the reader is a customer, investor, potential partner, etc. Its overarching benefit is that it provides the clear, concise, benefits-driven communication that people desire when learning about a business.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>The overarching benefit of a one-sheeter: It forces clear, concise, benefits-driven communication.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4da.png" alt="📚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide download &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download">135 of the Best Words &amp; Phrases for Marketing with Emotion</a></p>
<div id="do-i-need-marketing-one-pager"></div>
<h2>Do I need a marketing one-pager?</h2>
<p>Aside from the scenario above, the one-pager is becoming a necessity in companies’ and individuals’ marketing toolkits. In fact, <strong>concise content</strong> is #4 in <a href="https://marketinginsidergroup.com/content-marketing/content-marketing-trends/#4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marketing Insider Group&#8217;s</a> list of 12 <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/12/content-marketing-trends">content marketing trends</a> now and for the foreseeable future</p>
<p>So, the one-sheet, once the thing companies stacked on waiting room tables and the go-to “leave behind” of sales reps on face-to-face visits, is coming back into vogue. And it’s doing so precisely because of its brevity. Moreover, it has tangible marketing value: It narrows your prospect’s focus (amid all the distractions of today), which bolsters your engagement chances.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/marketing20one-pager20brevity_0.png" alt="marketing one-pager brevity" width="800" height="351" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>So the answer to the above question? Yes, you need a marketing one-pager, to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a clear snapshot of your business in a noisy and content-saturated world.</li>
<li>Align with <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/18/post-covid-19-customers">current consumer behaviors</a> and attention spans.</li>
<li>Increase the chances of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/04/nurture-marketing">further engagement by prospects</a>.</li>
<li>Convey your company&#8217;s value.</li>
</ul>
<div id="how-to-create-one-pager"></div>
<h2>How to build your marketing one-pager</h2>
<p>When assembling your one-sheet, be selective about what you include. The layout and design are paramount. The one-sheeter must be visually appealing and inviting to read—without making it look like a lot of work to get through. Ultimately, your reader must comprehend it quickly and absorb the material in a useful way. The key here, and as is the case with any <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/03/copywriting-examples">copywriting</a>, you want the reader to <strong>take action</strong>.</p>
<p>Below I will provide the <strong>essential elements</strong> your one-pager should have (note: several real-world examples follow below). The pieces follow the typical top, middle, and bottom flow for written material. (For more copywriting help, these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/16/copywriting-formulas">formulas</a> might be of interest to you).</p>
<p>Are there exceptions to the layout and elements? Of course! This is marketing, and grey areas abound. But these elements should typically outweigh any <a href="/blog/ws/2016/04/13/retargeting-ad-ideas">creative, outside-the-lines thinking</a>.</p>
<h3>Elements to have at the top of your one-pager</h3>
<p>Here are the elements you&#8217;ll want at the top of your one-sheet.</p>
<p><strong>Company name and logo: </strong>Kind of a no-brainer here, right? You want to let the reader know who the content is from. Be mindful of the fact you have limited space—it is one sheet after all.</p>
<p><strong>Pain points: </strong>Call out what your target audience suffers from or needs help with. Be as specific as possible. Remember: you can&#8217;t be everything to everybody. Test this element of the one-sheeter repeatedly until you find the best performer. In essence, your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points"> pain point i</a>s your headline for your one-sheeter. So it has to grab attention.</p>
<p>For example, instead of saying something like “The Bay Area’s Number One HVAC Company” – bland, boring – it could be “Had Enough of Your Outdated Furnace Giving You the Cold Shoulder at Night?”</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The bottom line is, you’re hoping the reader is nodding her head “yes” when reading the pain point(s) of your one-sheet.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Solution: </strong>This is the <strong>pivotal point</strong> of the one-sheeter. It&#8217;s where you give your reader what they want more than anything, and that&#8217;s HOPE—hope that you can solve their problems. So if you’re our HVAC friend, then lay it out for the reader.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><em>“We’ve helped Bay Area folks stay cozy at night since 1948. They love our Five-Star Service and Better Business Bureau A+ rating. Our secret is staying technologically advanced while still servicing every make and model ever made. Seriously!”</em></p>
<p>See the below mockup of a one-sheet. Your headline should be something a bit more <a href="/blog/ws/2020/01/22/marketing-copy">compelling</a>, but this will help you to visualize the information you&#8217;re trying to convey.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/writing20a20marketing20one-pager20elements20of20top.png" alt="writing a marketing one-pager elements of top" width="800" height="624" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>One pager example adapted from <a href="https://app.xtensio.com/design/0k4c0o1e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Extensio</a></em></p>
<h3>Elements to include in the middle of your one-pager</h3>
<p>The middle of the one-sheet is where you can get into the specifics: the why and how of your business.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> List out a handful of your personal, company’s, or product/service’s features. These are the bells and whistles that you bring to the table:</p>
<ul>
<li>24/7 service</li>
<li>Advanced training and techniques</li>
<li>Free estimates</li>
<li>The new-and-improved version</li>
<li>Free consultation</li>
<li>Licensed in XYZ skill</li>
<li>Downloadable on all devices</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Answer the question &#8220;So what?&#8221; about your features. Insert &#8220;What this means to you is (answer)&#8221; after every feature you list.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Insert a &#8220;what this means to you&#8221; benefit after every feature you list in your one-sheet.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>For example, for “licensed in XYZ skill,” the benefit may be “What this means to you is you’ll rest easy knowing our team has full training and hands-on experience with your equipment. We know we’ll fix it and make it good as new.”</p>
<p>Other benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Save time</li>
<li>Save money</li>
<li>Produces the best results available, such as “increase leads by 10x.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The bottom line with benefits: How specifically will the features make the prospect’s life better? When producing any <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/12/28/content-marketing-advice">marketing content</a>, you should always put yourself in your readers&#8217; shoes and read it with their  &#8220;what&#8217;s in it for me&#8221; mindset.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The bottom line with benefits: How specifically will the features make the prospect’s life better?</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>For this section of your company one-sheet, these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/21/features-vs-benefits">finer points of features and benefits</a> will give you a better feel for what they are and how to use them.</p>
<h3>Elements for the bottom of your one-pager</h3>
<p>This is where you inspire and equip your reader to take action.</p>
<p><strong>Call to Action (CTA):</strong> What should the reader, after having been fully convinced YOU are the answer to their prayers, do next?</p>
<ul>
<li>“Start saving today!”</li>
<li>“Contact me for a free consultation”</li>
<li>“Learn more about XYX widget here”</li>
</ul>
<p>There are multiple ways to incorporate CTAs into your one-sheeter. This element, too, can and should be tested frequently. The CTA is probably the most overlooked element—but talk about an important one! We offer an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">in-depth look at CTAs</a> to bolster your one-sheeter’s performance.</p>
<p><strong>Contact information:</strong> Include everything about you or your company to make it easy for people to find you. Include your physical address (if applicable), social channels, email address, phone numbers—everything you feel comfortable sharing.</p>
<p>*Optional add-on for the one-sheeter: Include a brief testimonial or <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/16/get-more-google-reviews">customer review</a>. If space is at a real premium, only include a sentence or two of that stellar testimonial you’ve got lying around.</p>
<p>The takeaway here is that your company one-sheet is about the customer. You have so much to offer and want to tell it all, but when it comes to your one-sheet, resist the urge to make it all about your company. Make it about how your company knows and is the solution to your customer&#8217;s problems.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The one-sheeter is about the customer. Resist the urge to make it all about you or your company. Instead, make it about how you are the solution they need.</strong></p></blockquote>
<div id="one-pager-examples"></div>
<h2>Examples of great one-sheeters</h2>
<p>Let’s look at some specific examples of company one-sheets for context and inspiration. You&#8217;ll note there is no particular formula or layout. And yes, some <em>are</em> more than one page. Some essential elements are occasionally omitted, depending on the <em>brand</em>. Of course, big brands can get away with missing details because they&#8217;re well-known entities.</p>
<h3>HVAC one-sheeter</h3>
<p>This one is actually <strong>two</strong> pages online. Burleson Plumbing &amp; Heating does a great job of focusing on a specific offering with this one-sheeter. It’s all about their maintenance program and why it’s a good idea.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/one-sheeter20examples20HVAC.png" alt="one-sheeter examples HVAC" width="800" height="1046" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<h3>Social media consultant and speaker one-sheeter</h3>
<p>This one is also two pages online. Jasmine Sandler has a lot to offer. She clearly outlines <em>what</em> she does and <em>who</em> she does it for, along with providing multiple contact points. Last, she builds her credibility with previous press and speaker appearances listed.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/one-sheet20examples20digital20marketing20consultant.png" alt="one-sheet examples digital marketing consultant" width="800" height="1037" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/agentcy/jasmine-sandler-social-media-speaker-one-sheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<h3>Startup incubator one-sheeter</h3>
<p>A great example of a tight one-sheeter that covers every essential element and uses the space and graphics perfectly:</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/one20sheeter20examples20startup20incubtor.png" alt="one sheeter examples startup incubator" width="800" height="1133" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<h3>Mercedes-Benz one-sheeter</h3>
<p>A well-known brand that uses <a href="/blog/ws/2014/12/17/science-of-emotion-in-marketing-courtney-seiter">emotions</a> and visualization. It’s all benefits, nothing about features or pain points. But hey, it’s Mercedes-Benz. They don’t have to do much selling.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/one-sheeter20examples20mercedes20benz.png" alt="one-sheeter examples mercedes benz" width="800" height="1148" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<h3>Tech agency one-sheeter</h3>
<p>Fantastic one-sheeter that utilizes space and graphics to capture everything they do in a single sheet. The <a href="/blog/ws/2017/05/17/how-to-write-great-headlines">headline is intriguing</a> and grabs your attention.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/one20sheeter20tech20agency20example.png" alt="tech agency one sheeter example" width="800" height="1035" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://caddisart.com/download-our-one-pager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<div id="what-a-one-pager-isnt"></div>
<h2>What a one-sheeter is NOT (<em>usually</em>)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>It’s not a spec sheet</strong>. Those are separate documents to be used <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/01/bottom-funnel-conversions">further down the funnel </a>to support the decision-making process. However, a spec sheet or data sheet may be what your industry refers to it as. For example, in software, a prospect might request a data sheet that includes the standard things a marketing one-sheeter would.</li>
<li><strong>It’s not a company history, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/27/guide-to-about-us-pages">about us</a>, or personal bio page.</strong> That information goes on a separate web page. However, you absolutely want a brief snippet about <a href="/blog/ws/2016/12/07/company-mission-statements">who you are as a company or individual</a>.</li>
<li><strong>It&#8217;s not a total data dump</strong>. You don&#8217;t want to overload the reader with extraneous information because TMI will cause &#8220;reader overwhelm.&#8221; Stay brief and to the point. You want the reader to have enough information to take the next step, i.e., <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/07/call-to-action-marketing">click the CTA button</a>.</li>
<li><strong>It&#8217;s not a case study.</strong> That&#8217;s a separate, longer piece of content. The one-sheeter can mention a crucial point or <a href="/blog/ws/2015/05/05/customer-testimonials">testimonial</a> of a case study and even offer a link <em>to</em> the case study.</li>
</ul>
<div id="one-sheeter-creation-tools"></div>
<h2>Tools to create your company&#8217;s one-sheeter</h2>
<p>Once you have the template nailed for your one-sheeter, you’re ready to go. In fact, why not create multiple one-sheeters for multiple audiences? Swap out the information to make them for all of your products and services. You could even apply the same format for your company one-pager to your product, service, or program one-pagers.</p>
<p>Here are a few helpful resources to kick-start your one-sheet library:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jennifer Beever, a Certified Marketing Consultant, offers some excellent “Do’s and Don’ts” of <a href="https://www.newincite.com/one-sheets/14-dos-and-donts-of-marketing-one-sheets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing one-sheets here</a>.</li>
<li>Visme has multiple types of templates, including a <a href="https://www.visme.co/templates/product-sell-sheet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product sell sheet</a>.</li>
<li>Xtensio bills itself as “the easiest way for teams to create, manage and share beautiful living documents,” <a href="https://xtensio.com/how-to-create-a-one-pager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including one-pagers</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Get started on your company one-pager(s) now</h2>
<p>A compact yet informative page (or two) that distills your business down into its core value—what it provides, why it provides it, and how it benefits or solves pain points—is a powerful piece of content that you can use time and time again. Get started on your company one-sheet today and you&#8217;ll be surprised at how many times it comes in handy—and how many times it can be <a href="/blog/ws/2015/02/03/repurposing-content">repurposed</a>, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the world of paid digital marketing there are various components that determine whether your efforts are successful or not. But within the technical complexities of account structure, campaign optimization, conversion tracking, and audience targeting (amongst many others) lies an important detail that many advertisers—regardless of expertise—often neglect. That detail is branding.</p>
<p>Many advertisers direct a majority of their focus on the individual promotions themselves and the results they want to drive from them. Much less of this energy is spent on the impact and representation of their brand within all of this. And this is where the problem lies.</p>

<p>As mentioned, the popular approach to running paid ads is oftentimes focusing solely on producing the desired result no matter what—whether that be a click, form submission, or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/30/facebook-video-views">video view.</a> This guerilla-esque strategy drives marketers and business owners to sacrifice their own brand consistency in favor of something that yields a quick win within their goal parameters.</p>
<p>But this narrow thinking can cause problems down the line, particularly when the individuals <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/27/landing-page-forms">submitting forms </a>or arriving at landing pages have no idea of your business and what it does, or have failed to retain that memory over time.</p>
<p>The internet is a realm of reward system feedback loops and subliminal stimulus triggers. The brain processes images and words at lightning speed and determines which information has value—whether that value is the satisfaction of fulfilling <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/10/curiosity-gap">curiosity</a> or something more direct like a cheese pizza. This is why <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/07/15/clickbait">click-bait</a> exists.</p>
<p>But these “hacks” are oftentimes merely shortcuts to superflous results. When attempting to realistically <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/16/grow-your-digital-marketing-agency">grow your business</a> through advertising, it&#8217;s important that you drive the results you want while simultaneously leveraging your brand to leave a lasting impression on the user.</p>

<h2>The benefit of aligning branding and advertising</h2>
<p>It’s critical to have brand recognition and retention at all steps in the process of advertising. If the people you are marketing to have no familiarity with your brand, then to achieve this, your ads and landing pages will always need to speak to your core brand value proposition <em>in addition</em> to the value of the specific <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">product or service being offered</a>.</p>
<p>But as your company’s brand recognition grows and flourishes, the need to drive that core brand value proposition home through every ad campaign becomes less important—which is a good thing because that proposition can often become complex, ambiguous, or implied over time. Let’s use the extremely broad example of Coca-Cola.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="ba5b747a-9d5d-42d9-a357-42cd857ea1c6" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Rather beautiful for a company that has aided in tooth decay and the early onset of diabetes for decades, but I digress. Keep in mind that Coca-Cola owns a countless number of other companies at this point, aiding in the complexity of creating one <a href="/blog/ws/2016/12/07/company-mission-statements">inspiring mission statement</a>. The point is, because they have<a href="/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness"> built up such strong brand awareness </a>and recognition, Coca-Cola doesn&#8217;t need to explicitly state their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">brand messaging</a> through their mission statement. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean that they don’t continue express that brand messaging through their ads:</p>

</article>
</div>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/03/website-color-scheme">Consistent color schemes</a>, imagery, and tone account for instantaneous recognition from a user observing their content. This ad plays on one of Coca-Cola’s biggest brand value propositions: nostalgia. These subtle details fill in a variety of gaps of information already stored in the customer’s brain associated with the Coca-Cola brand. This allows for the individual to draw upon related information instantly in their mind without having to do any heavy cognitive lifting. This is the power of a strong brand.</p>

<h2>Branding and advertising alignment for small businesses</h2>
<p>Although a massive company that has had decades of success marketing carbonated sugar water surely won’t have any issues with brand recognition, smaller, more nuanced businesses will. The B2B tech space, for example, is swimming with companies that choose to neglect the existence of vowels in their names. When <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/04/nurture-marketing">potential prospects</a> in this space are inundated with the plethora of B2B tools that will supposedly make their lives easier, the brands will all start to blend together. This same reality rings true for many other industries as businesses compete for digital attention.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>In these cases, a strong brand will set you above the crowd of overly technical or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/21/features-vs-benefits">feature-based </a>propositions. A great example of this is the Boston-based tech company Drift. Drift’s platform allows companies to do a variety of sales and marketing-related activities that all inherently carry their own respective <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">value propositions</a>. However, their branding is broad enough to be digestible but specific enough to clearly hit home with their target audience:</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>Their product was once primarily focused around the “conversational marketing” aspect of their chatbots but now you can see the reuse and repetition of the words “revenue” and “acceleration.”</p>

</div>
<p>There is a clear effort on Drift’s part to rebrand, in a sense, away from the over-saturated chatbot market (one that they stand on top of) to convey that their product has much more to offer. It may not seem like a massive change but this messaging is carried throughout their site. The foundational function of their business is still <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/14/chatbot-marketing">conversational marketing</a> but the point of the matter is that their <a href="/blog/ws/2018/11/08/brand-story">brand story</a> encompasses all aspects of their platform and uses repetition throughout their digital properties to make “revenue acceleration” synonymous with their product perception. As I will explain, consistency is key.</p>
<h2>How small businesses can use branding to improve advertising success</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that big or small, brick-and-mortar or ecommerce, businesses must always incorporate branding into their advertising strategy for sustained growth. Below are some tips and guidelines for doing so.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AdWordsGrader_AWGrader"><strong><em>Find even more ways to improve your advertising success with our Free Google Ads Performance Grader!</em></strong></a></p>
<h3>Remain consistent</h3>
<p>When speaking with clients about branding, one of the most important points that I try to drive home is that of “brand consistency.&#8221; This means ensuring that your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/11/14/ppc-landing-page-experience">landing pages and ads use the same language</a>, tone, and color palette as the rest of your site. This may not seem like an important aspect but it&#8217;s not unlikely that individuals will research your business either before or after they <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/06/brand-advertising-for-conversions">convert on the ads </a>that you set before them.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say someone clicks through on a Coca-Cola ad and they are directed to a page with McDonalds colors, font, and tone. That individual will certainly be confused, believing that they clicked on the wrong link. The same goes for your business in a more subtle way. The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/02/landing-page-tips-and-tricks">impression left by your landing page </a>may not be drawn upon in their memory bank when subsequently <a href="/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">visiting your site.</a> You want everything to be consistent in order to enforce familiarity.</p>

<h3>Express the goal of the ad through the voice of your brand</h3>
<p>Establishing a consistent and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/05/02/persuasive-copywriting-tips">persuasive brand on your website </a>will make incorporating these aspects into your advertising much easier. Focusing on the goal of your advertising should always be your first concern, but reinforcing your company identity should be a close second. One way to kill two birds with one stone is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/14/ppc-ad-copywriting">structure your ad copy</a> in a way that addresses the goal of the ad through the voice of your brand.</p>

<p>Let’s break down an example of this:</p>

</div>
<p>Toast effectively blends both their core brand messaging and functional messaging into this paid search ad. Highlighted in green is the functional messaging of the ad with the branding in red.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Adapt Fast w/ Online Ordering” and “Contactless Delivery” are the functional value propositions that entice the user to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2010/04/26/good-click-through-rate">click through on the ad</a>.</li>
<li>“All-in-1 Restaurant POS” and “One Platform to Power Your Restaurant” are the brand reinforcements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Slogans are an effective way to build a brand because it takes the overarching complexity of a business (or ideology in today’s day and age) and simplifies it into a digestible sound bite. As mentioned before with the Coca-Cola example, this simplified information is stored and recalled upon by the consumer’s brain when interacting with the brand. People who are familiar with Toast can easily construct a mental image when reading these words. The same methodology can be applied to the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/30/social-media-advertising-tips">paid social advertising </a>side as well:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="fbb81567-e912-44e6-82f2-3a49dbf948e1" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Toast reinforces its identity as the all-in-one restaurant POS system with “Built for Restaurants.” The imagery includes their POS systems themselves as well as their logo. The supporting copy speaks to the functional value proposition of the product, giving users a reason to click through.</p>
<h3>Employ a consistent landing page design</h3>
<p>Continuing with the Toast example, you can see how their website and landing page echoes the sentiment in the ad:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="51e09345-9899-41b5-ad09-ae01e6f599a4" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>This messaging can be found across their digital territories, reinforcing their place as the “all-in-one” solution for restaurants. There are a number of point-of-sale systems available for businesses, but Toast focuses solely on <a href="/blog/ws/2015/01/14/restaurant-marketing">restaurants</a>. This is their brand. You can see the repeated use of the term restaurants in almost all of their copy:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e4e28d91-baf2-4363-9903-95e7d7111d6b" data-langcode="en">

</div>
<h3>Pay attention to branding elements when advertising</h3>
<p>Branding has many components that could have their own separate posts entirely. To keep things simple, I’ll break it down to its simplest foundations. If you don’t feel like your business has a strong identity, you can get started with these:</p>
<p><strong>Colors</strong></p>
<p>What color scheme do you feel conveys what your business is about. This may seem silly to some of the more analytical types but colors in themselves can trigger <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/12/17/science-of-emotion-in-marketing-courtney-seiter">emotions</a>. Branding is all about consistency and repetition. Color schemes become synonymous with brands and feelings, hence why so many companies will rebrand using different colors and logos if their previous combination was tarnished by a scandal or something negative.</p>
<p><strong>Language</strong></p>
<p>Take everything that your business does and does well and try to condense this into a digestible and memorable combination of words. Slogans are powerful for conveying your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/07/unique-selling-proposition">unique value proposition</a>, and you can always build off of them with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/03/copywriting-examples">supporting copy</a> so you don’t feel like you have to cram too much into one sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Repetition</strong></p>
<p>The key to creating a brand is to reinforce an identity through repetition and consistency. As I have mentioned, the more times that individuals are exposed to your <em>same</em> message, color scheme, logo, etc., the more familiar and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/12/memorable-youtube-ads">memorable</a> you become.</p>
<h2>Advertise with brand in mind for long-term results</h2>
<p>Paid search ads are composed <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/07/26/expanded-text-ad-best-practices">entirely of words</a>, while display and social consist of both words and images. My suggestion is to pay close attention to how you are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/01/12/how-to-write-great-advertising-copy">writing your ads</a> and how you are representing your business through the imagery that you are using. You are better off with an ad whose message and imagery aligns with your business’s identity than one that is hyper-focused on the short term result that the user may be looking for. You should be aiming for a brand-laced ad that accomplishes both rather than a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">call-to-action-focused ad</a> that only drives graphs in positive directions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve covered the basics for landing pages many times here at WordStream, from our favorite landing page <a href="/blog/ws/2015/09/02/landing-page-tips-and-tricks">tips and tricks</a> to the best <a href="/blog/ws/2015/06/24/landing-page-tools">landing page tools</a> you can use to amplify your landing page performance. However, today I’d like to take a look at some <a href="/blog/ws/2017/09/21/landing-page-designs">landing page strategies</a> that go beyond the basics, so you can take your landing pages to a new level of conversion power.</p>
<p>You may have seen some of these strategies for high-converting landing pages before, but I’d like to illustrate some of the more subtle points as to why and how they can make your customer experience stand out. Some of these strategies might, in fact, be new to you. Either way, these real-world examples should provide a spark that you can employ in your own landing page optimization efforts to get significantly higher conversion rates.</p>
<p>But first, a quick note on landing page conversion rate benchmarks.</p>
<h2>What’s a High-Converting Landing Page?</h2>
<p>Our research indicates that <a href="/blog/ws/2016/02/29/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks">conversion rates vary by industry</a>, but averages generally fall between 2% and 5% for AdWords advertisers.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="dff70a61-5cec-4284-bcd3-50fe852197d7" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Does that mean you should settle for average? Of course not! There are lots of businesses out there who have managed to achieve higher conversion rates. <a href="/blog/ws/2014/03/17/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate">WordStream did a study</a> in 2014 that showed some advertisers – the best of the best – were getting <a href="/blog/ws/2017/08/02/conversion-rate-statistics">conversion rates</a> of 10% or more. That’s what you want to aim for!</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="cebcdb5e-5d65-4947-a361-d2c21c6d57bb" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Now let’s get on to the strategies that will help you raise your landing page conversion rates.</p>
<h2>1. Incentivize Your Visitors with an Irresistible Offer</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="cff2bc3d-ae56-4726-a2a1-a1380f6ddded" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Vitacost does a great job of making an offer that helps close the deal right away. I’m a huge proponent of giving new customers an incentive to <strong>take action right now</strong>, and after about five seconds on the site this enticing offer pops up—a 10 percent discount—and it’s something the main competition is not doing. Given this, I’d be more inclined to shop with Vitacost since they’re giving me immediate savings.</p>
<p>Additionally, the page itself gives a clean, well-laid-out impression, and it makes the benefit statement clear: save up to 37 percent on organic foods. Specificity sells, and pinpointing it at this granular level makes it more believable.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the main takeaway here is that <strong>the offer provides visitors with something they can use right now</strong>.</p>
<h2>2: Limit Choices</h2>

<p>In this example for project management software, Wrike takes minimalism to the extreme. Often with software you’re given multiple choices, but in this case Wrike limits the offer to one main choice at ten dollars a month, billed annually, with a free plan available. They chose to use very little text and make the offer straightforward and to the point.</p>
<p>In this case they went counter to what’s normally recommended for <a href="/blog/ws/2016/02/24/landing-pages-for-lead-generation">lead gen</a> situations, which is to use the standard three feature and benefit statements, include a list of plans available, and have a form to fill out.</p>
<p>In addition, this landing page stands out because of the <a href="/blog/ws/2016/06/07/hero-images-guide">eye-catching hero image</a>, and it leverages credibility boosters with the Gartner mention and the big-name brand customers along the footer, both of which are best practices for landing pages.</p>
<h2>3. Provide Customer Service with a Lighter Touch</h2>

<p><a href="/blog/ws/2016/03/21/live-chat-support">Live chat</a> is nothing new, but in this case American Eagle offers it in a less intrusive way than many others do. There’s little more annoying than the chat pop-up that comes out of nowhere like a pushy salesperson. In this case when searching for “men’s shorts,” the live chat sits in the corner ready for you if you want it. Of course, you have to give up your email address to use it—American Eagle wants to get something out of the chat, right?</p>
<p>In addition, American Eagle uses a nice header image that highlights their wide selection. We covered <a href="/blog/ws/2016/04/05/product-landing-pages">product-landing-page best practices</a> recently here at WordStream if you want more tips on how to optimize them.</p>
<h2>4. Go for a Test Drive</h2>

</article>
</div>
<p>Webex’s landing page for webinar software really nails it when it comes to the test drive. You can either sign up as an individual or group to see the product in action before you decide to buy. This “hands-on” approach helps prospects visualize how they’d be able to use the software in their own lives, which can be a crucial deal-maker and help <a href="/blog/ws/2016/02/03/increase-sales-online">close sales</a>.</p>
<p>The form is a bit long for my taste and would be something to test for sure. We covered <a href="/blog/ws/2015/07/27/landing-page-forms">landing-page forms</a> last year and it warrants revisiting if you use a form on your landing pages.</p>
<p>In addition, following the three feature and benefit statements, Webex builds credibility a la McDonald’s by showing a running tally of the number of webinars they’ve hosted in the last month. This credibility booster falls right in line with what Dr. Rober Cialdini mentions as “social proof” in his widely read and quoted “<a href="http://www.influenceatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/E_Brand_principles.pdf">Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion</a>.” (If you haven’t read the book, I suggest you pick it up soon. It’s pre-internet but the principles stand the test of time.)</p>
<p>In the book Cialdini mentions that social proof—the fact that other people are using or buying the product—helps new prospects feel at ease about the purchase decision because they know lots of other people are customers too. I’ll reference more Cialdini later.</p>
<h2>5. Provide Real-Time Social Proof</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="3e2ea6ed-0249-4c82-8d2e-9da162a3cc37" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/high-converting-landing-pages-H.png" alt="high converting landing pages" width="720" height="383" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Similar to Webex’s running tally, Timberwolf Bay, a vintage home furnishings company, posts a running update of orders. You see where the person was and what they bought, and it’s updated in real time.</p>
<p>This little feature builds confidence in the company because, as Cialdini mentions, it implies that people just like you are buying from this website. Who wants to feel like they’re the only customer on a website? Also, it’s pretty fun to watch the orders pop up!</p>
<p>Another example (below) of this strategy comes from Zingerman’s, a popular food market in Ann Arbor, Michigan, except they put the running tally in the footer:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="ebae5b52-723a-465e-924a-3d36dfaaeab0" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<h2>6. Use Scarcity and Urgency as Motivators</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="2791f61b-a27c-4e69-bf56-199536d935f3" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/high-converting-landing-pages-J.png" alt="high converting landing pages" width="720" height="527" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Here again Timberwolf Bay does a great job of using another of Cialdini’s principles: scarcity. When you’re looking for “timberwolf bay automobiles,” you’re shown the existing inventory. If you’re dying to get B.B. Korn Race Car, hurry. If you wanted the brass accordion “headlight” sconce, you’re out of luck.</p>
<p>Kidding aside, the real-time quantity updates can motivate people to buy now. Showing that an item sold out implies a) your company moves a lot of product and b) visitors need to take action because products DO sell out. The bottom line here is that scarcity motivates people to buy because we hate to feel like we’re going to miss out on something.</p>
<p>Building off the scarcity theme, we should also consider urgency. When we know a sale ends soon, we’re more apt to buy rather than wait. In the example below, Gilt does a great job with a countdown timer to let people know the sale ends soon, so they better act fast:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e5af1a38-f5e9-43b4-a274-73bf80f82bbe" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<h2>7. Show the Value</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="a6e795e9-dec8-4664-a049-1520c3987bd6" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/high-converting-landing-pages-L.png" alt="high converting landing pages" width="800" height="415" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Everyone loves a deal, and on this page Eastbay does a good job highlighting how they’ve slashed the price on “men’s kobe shoes.” If Eastbay simply showed the new price, a visitor would have no context to put the price in perspective. Now, a potential customer will hopefully think “wow, this is a great deal, I need to take advantage of this.” At the very least, the shopper will bookmark this page to buy after doing some comparison shopping.</p>
<p>In addition, Eastbay highlights free shipping prominently in the header, so that’s even more incentive for the visitor to buy from this landing page.</p>
<p>The bottom line in this case: It pays to illustrate the value.</p>
<h3>A Final Word on High-Converting Landing Pages</h3>
<p>These have been just a few <a href="/blog/ws/2015/06/15/landing-page-inspiration">examples of landing pages</a> that go beyond the basics of effective landing page strategy and execution. To be sure, landing pages and their tactics evolve constantly, and as digital marketers we have to always be testing to see what works.</p>
<p>What other strategies have you seen employed to create high-converting landing pages?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lots of advertisers wonder <a href="/blog/ws/2016/01/25/does-facebook-advertising-work">if Facebook advertising really works</a>. Take a look at these numbers: 85% of new WordStream users are already advertising on Facebook; Facebook ads get 22 <strong>billion</strong> clicks a year, and those ads reach a total of 1.6 billion active monthly users. It’s clear Facebook is an attractive channel for advertisers—that many users can’t be wrong.</p>
<p>In 2016 it’s a must-have channel for any serious online marketer. I mean, just look at all the data on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/27/facebook-earnings-q4-2015/">user growth and revenue</a> at Facebook.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="f3ef71cf-b7d4-4ea0-9c88-ef4a2315ec70" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Wow, though: Have you looked at all the crazy stuff Facebook offers? It’s information overload and can cause paralysis.</p>
<p>On the plus side, it’s quite simple to boil Facebook ads down to some basics that will help drive <em>great</em> results when implemented properly. Let’s not overcomplicate this one.</p>
<p>So what are some tactics advertisers can focus on to harness the power of Facebook? Let’s take a look at five key things <a href="http://fashletics.com/">Fashletics</a>, an athletic jewelry company in Miami, Florida, did to drive quality traffic at a low cost per conversion during a six-week holiday campaign.</p>
<p><strong><em>Related: <a href="/blog/ws/2017/02/28/facebook-advertising-benchmarks">Facebook Ad Benchmarks for YOUR Industry</a></em></strong></p>
<h2>1: Have Rock-Solid Ad Targeting</h2>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2015/10/20/facebook-audience">Facebook’s targeting</a> capabilities offer a scary amount of information – which is great for advertisers. You can make the case that you can get too granular on any platform, but when you want solid conversion rates at a great cost per conversion, go deep, especially when you’re budget is limited.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Fashletics, Facebook offers a perfect fit for the primary audience: females who are into fitness, primarily CrossFit.</p>
<p>In this instance, Fashletics set targeting as follows:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="4a0146c5-9989-4cc4-bece-ed2aeb919cc0" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-conversions-targeting-options.png" alt="Facebook conversions targeting options" width="299" height="245" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>With these targeting capabilities, Fashletics hit the sweet spot of its market: Women who are into a variety of fitness activities in the U.S. and who, most importantly, would likely be interested in the Fashletics product line.</p>
<p>2021 update: Facebook targeting is getting more challenging due to iOS 14+ privacy features and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/08/google-floc">Google&#8217;s deprecation of third-party cookies</a>. Use our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/13/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-world">post-iOS 14 Faceboook targeting tips</a> to continue building effective audiences for your campaigns.</p>
<h2>2: Make Sure Your Visuals Stand Out</h2>
<p>This should come as no surprise, but Facebook – like most other contemporary advertising channels – is visually driven. Clean, crisp, <a href="/blog/ws/2016/03/01/content-marketing-images">eye-catching images</a> stand out and help your brand image. Don’t skimp on this. Invest in professional images that showcase your product(s).</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="f30c78a4-c657-4e19-b480-c58462aedbfc" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-conversions-ad-example.png" alt="Facebook conversions ad example" width="424" height="401" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<h2>3. Use Copy That Speaks to Your Target Audience Specifically</h2>
<p>In the above example, the <a href="/blog/ws/2016/03/14/ppc-ad-copywriting">ad copy</a> speaks the customer’s language. It’s the type of copy (using words like “tough,” “authentic,” and “breaking point”)  that gets the target market nodding and saying “yes, that’s me, this is exactly who I am.”</p>
<p>What makes it go even further is that it excludes people by saying it’s not for everyone – it’s for an elite target market that doesn’t want to wear something that could be bought anywhere. Exclusivity sells.</p>
<h2>4. Test Your Ads (Seriously, Test Your Ads)</h2>
<p>This is no surprise to anyone reading this. We have to <a href="/blog/ws/2016/10/27/facebook-ad-copy-tests">test our Facebook ads</a> all the time. Yes, it’s kind of a pain, but it reveals so much about your customer. And those “learning moments” carry forward to the rest of your advertising channels.</p>
<p>In Fashletics’ case, two scenarios were created in which the choice was either free shipping or a percentage discount. Without reading ahead, I bet you can guess which one most consumers chose.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="31044210-d668-4169-8d45-85ccd899040f" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-conversions-ad-test.png" alt="Facebook conversions ad test" width="732" height="366" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Not all that surprisingly, free shipping won by a more than two-to-one ratio. We can infer from this data that people hate doing math, because a 30% off offer would have actually been cheaper than free shipping, but the bottom line is this: people love their free shipping!</p>
<h2>5. Use Facebook Remarketing</h2>
<p>Without a doubt, if you don’t know how to remarket, figure it out. With Facebook’s <a href="/blog/ws/2015/11/16/facebook-remarketing">remarketing features</a>, you can reach people who visit your website and then go to Facebook. Since these are people who have already shown an interest in your offerings, they’re much more likely than strangers to convert.</p>
<p>In Fashletics’ case, two ad sets ran: one to target people who visited the site in general, and another set to target people who <a href="/blog/ws/2016/03/17/shopping-cart-abandonment">abandoned their shopping cart</a>. This is a very basic approach, for sure, but you can get super-specific with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/952192354843755">Facebook’s pixel</a>.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e0f62317-4a9e-409e-941a-55a25d298009" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-conversions-create-audience.png" alt="Facebook conversions create audience" width="607" height="471" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>As the data below indicates, Fashletics got 141 sales at <strong>an astonishing CPC of $0.44</strong>, not to mention an additional 137 page Likes, in six weeks.</p>
<p>What really stands out is the success rate with cart abandoners – hey, come back and finish that order you started!</p>
<h3>Results of Facebook remarketing campaign</h3>

</article>
</div>
<h2>Final Results</h2>
<p>Often people ask <a href="/blog/ws/2015/09/14/facebook-advertising-cost">how much Facebook advertising costs</a>. Given industry averages, Fashletics experienced tremendous success with a fairly modest budget and was able to beat the averages:</p>
<h3>Overall Facebook Averages for 2015:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Average Facebook Ad cost per click: $0.27</li>
<li>Average click-through rate: 1.5%</li>
<li>Average Facebook Ad cost per click: $0.21</li>
<li>Average click-through rate: 1.8%</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fashletics Averages for Holiday Campaign:</h3>
<h3>Results of regular campaign</h3>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="18079c4c-7f72-4f2d-8e3b-d7a7526c0846" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<h3>Overall Totals: Regular + Remarketing</h3>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="d6e01515-a96a-463b-80ab-c9c90c1dcddb" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>In addition to the final data, we were able to identify some other KPIs (key performance indicators) that helped Fashletics determine the efficacy of <a href="/facebook-advertising">Facebook advertising</a>.</p>
<h3>Key Performance Indicators:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost per conversion:</strong> $5.79 – meaning Fashletics paid that amount for each conversion. This is one of the most meaningful metrics because it allows Fashletics to know how much each new customer cost.</li>
<li><strong>Conversion rate:</strong> 3.6% – meaning 3.6% of Fashletics’ clicks convert.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bonus Benefits of a Facebook Ad Campaign</h2>
<p>In addition to conversions and additional Likes, during the course of the campaign, Fashletics saw <a href="/blog/ws/2014/08/05/increase-email-signups">email subscribers</a> increase by approximately 1,000 people. There’s gold in an email list, so in addition to sales and Likes, Fashletics can continue to market directly to its subscribers on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Of course, not every company can emulate these types of results (it’s marketing, folks – nothing is guaranteed!), but the Fashletics story is enough to make any advertiser who’s on the fence about Facebook marketing take notice and give it a shot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most digital marketers agree that landing pages can make or break any campaign, be it PPC, social media, email, or display ads. Once you get people to click, the landing page has to convince your visitor to complete the conversion.</p>
<p>To assist in the goal of landing page success, a number of software platforms exist to help marketers test landing page elements. Visuals, calls-to-action (CTAs), layouts, offers, buttons, and many more elements can be tested. Software can help you conduct A/B tests and create new landing pages on the fly. Just a tweak with the placement of a key visual element might lead to a significant increase in <a href="/effective-landing-pages">landing page performance</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when it comes to the actual <em>words</em> on the landing page, marketers tend to rush the process, going with a combination of gut feelings, past campaigns, and cursory competitive reviews to piece together landing page copy. This method leads to costly mistakes and wasted time until the “right” message gets discovered through trial and error.</p>
<p>Despite all the conveniences afforded users with software and testing, they all overlook what accounts for the absolute <em>biggest</em> factor in landing page success: <strong>the words on the page</strong>. And some of the most successful landing page copy comes directly from customers. It’s not creative writing—it’s sales writing.</p>
<p>This guide will show you how to improve your landing page copy and ensure your messages are on point using the “<strong>Voice of the Customer</strong>” process. Market research methods and voice-of-customer (VOC) data are positioned as the most effective means to find, not create, the right words to use on landing pages to <a href="/conversion-rate-optimization">increase conversions</a>.</p>
<h2>What Is Voice of the Customer?</h2>
<p>Voice of customer analysis, also known as VOC, is a market research technique that focuses on customers’ (and prospects’) wants and needs, then prioritizes them into a hierarchical structure before prioritizing them in terms of relative importance and satisfaction with current alternatives. VOC is a way to describe your customers’ experiences with and expectations for your products or services.</p>
<p>Voice of the customer is actionable data that includes a <a href="/blog/ws/2014/09/18/beginners-guide-to-target-markets">target market’s</a> <strong>desires, pain points, preferences, expectations, and aversions</strong>. Once VOC data has been captured (via methods I’ll explain a bit later), it can then be used to create landing page copy, sometimes using the exact words that come from prospects and customers during voice of customer research.</p>
<p>As technical as VOC sounds, it can be distilled down to basic questions and answers with prospects and customers, and simply <em>listening</em> to the various conversations occurring online and offline.</p>
<p>The messages on the landing page below, from FreshBooks, comes from <a href="/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points">knowing what their customers’ pain points are</a>. It’s simple to deduce that their research shows the target market, who are small business owners:</p>
<p>1) views billing as painful,</p>
<p>2) sees accounting as challenging,</p>
<p>3) needs access from anywhere, and</p>
<p>4) doesn’t want to waste time with billing.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>This type of actionable insight is gleaned from VOC research, and it makes landing page messages highly impactful for the target audience. It also separates the ho-hum landing page from the home run landing page.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2014/08/07/improve-writing-skills">A great copywriter</a> can use emotional appeal, action verbs, and <a href="http://boostblogtraffic.com/power-words/">power words</a> to make a message feel compelling, at least to other marketers, but the question remains: Is this how the target audience feels? Companies know the features and benefits of their products inside and out, but do those benefits match what the target audience desires?</p>
<h2>Existing Approaches to Landing Page Copy And Their Flaws</h2>
<p>Landing page design, aesthetics, and user experience are all important, but they’re at-a-glance components. The serious visitor—the target audience marketers want to convert—will read the words on the page, and if that copy misses the mark, a potential sale just left the website.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Guessing:</strong> Trying a variety of random messages to see what works. As advertising great Claude Hopkins wrote in <em>Scientific Advertising</em> in 1923, “Guesswork is very expensive.” Sure, the right message may be found eventually but not before a lot of money has been spent and time gone by.</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing from competitors:</strong> Not flat-out stealing, but making a landing page just slightly different from the competition’s, under the assumption they know what they’re doing. But what if their assumptions are wrong? Then you’re also starting off with the wrong message.</li>
<li><strong>Recycling messages:</strong> Using tired, <a href="/blog/ws/2014/06/04/marketing-cliches">cliché messages</a> that make vague promises to no one, e.g., “World-class software solutions for changing times.” Nonsense cliché messages are signs of laziness and only lead to boredom—and who wants to buy a service or product from a lazy, boring company? It’s anyone’s guess what this software does in these changing times.</li>
</ol>
<p>The point of marketing is to solve a specific problem for a customer. To do this, the first requirement is to understand the pain or problem the prospect has, then tell them how the product or service in question remedies the problem, <em>in the customer&#8217;s voice</em>.</p>
<h2>Closing The Gap Between Target Audience And Message</h2>
<p>The ideal solution for the landing page copy problem would be a software product that runs an algorithm to tell marketers exactly which words to use – or just writes it for them. Unfortunately, no one’s created that (yet), though it could be in the works in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>The only way to know what customers want, to know what their true pains are and what the ideal solution would be, is to <strong>ask them or observe them</strong>. Armed with this knowledge, marketers can create landing page copy that positions their product or service as the exact solution the prospect needs.</p>

<h2>How to Conduct Voice of Customer Research</h2>
<p>Some research methods, such as surveys and interviews, require detailed planning, while others require nothing more than structured eavesdropping. The more research conducted, the better, but for landing page copy most marketers need only use a few of these options. Depending on the project, marketers may employ all the methods or just a few.</p>
<p>It’s best to aggregate all the research sources into a final report for future use. It can also serve as a creative brief for future projects—until the market or the product, service, or company changes.</p>
<p>For all the methods below, except surveys and interviews, a simple document or spreadsheet, like this, should suffice to capture and communicate your VOC findings:</p>
<h3>Example tracker</h3>

</article>
</div>
<p>But as the voice of customer process evolves, it can become more sophisticated. The key thing is to use the same format for all research so combining it all at the end goes smoothly.</p>
<p>Whatever research method you choose, keep track of your findings and look for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>common phrases</strong></li>
<li>the <strong>particular pains </strong>that your customers and prospects experience</li>
<li><strong>what people want or expect</strong> in your product or service</li>
</ul>
<p>…to name just a few.</p>
<h2>Research sources for customer insights</h2>
<p>You can find even more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/17/customer-insights">ways to collect customer insights here</a>.</p>
<h3>Internal company sources</h3>
<p>Internal sources such as customer service and sales reps, who have front-line experience with prospects and customers, serve as excellent sources of voice of customer information. They have phone calls, email exchanges, and even online chats with the target audience to pull from. Volumes of specific feedback, including complaints and praise, reside with these internal sources.</p>
<h3>Voice of customer surveys</h3>
<p>Formal surveys can be done either on the company website or via email. Fortunately, survey companies have all the tools to assist in the creation and execution of surveys. Among the best known are Survey Monkey, where <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/">practically any type of survey can be created</a>, and Qualaroo for <a href="https://qualaroo.com/">on-site surveys</a>, which appear directly on websites and typically ask one or two questions.</p>
<p>For surveys it’s best to put extra thought into the types of questions to ask of both prospects and customers. The main point is to <strong>ask questions that will produce actionable answers</strong>. In other words, ask questions that have answers that can be used in creating your landing page copy.</p>
<p>Here are some sample voice of customer questions to ask in a survey and create the types of sound bites that prove useful in crafting copy for landing pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why did you choose our solution?</li>
<li>What’s most important in your product or service search? Price, quality, etc.</li>
<li>Why haven’t you solved this problem or pain point yet?</li>
<li>What work title best describes your job?</li>
<li>What do you dislike about the options available in the market now?</li>
<li>How does our product or solution make your life easier (i.e., fix the pain)?</li>
<li>What adjectives would you describe our product or service?</li>
<li>What would make our product or service better?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Customer interviews</h3>
<p>Interviews reveal how customers feel about a product, service, or company overall. Some of the best quotes and sound bites come from this source. In fact, this source often provides compelling social proof to be used in a landing page’s <a href="/blog/ws/2015/05/05/customer-testimonials">testimonials section</a>. They can even be used as headlines or subheads.</p>
<p>Claude Hopkins wrote, “The advertising man [or woman] studies the consumer.…They learn what possible buyers want and the factors which don&#8217;t appeal. It is quite customary to <strong>interview hundreds of possible customers</strong>.”</p>
<h3>Focus groups</h3>
<p>Focus groups still carry some weight, though the internet has diminished their use in many industries. Still, real one-on-one interaction with prospects and customers using a product can prove to be a goldmine. Unfortunately, these can be costly and probably aren’t feasible for small businesses.</p>
<h3>Online forums</h3>
<p>Forums exist for virtually every product or service in existence, and they are a treasure trove of customer feedback. Marketers can find community-based forums where the conversations flow freely about specific topics or whole industries and their participants. Company-sponsored forums focused on the company’s existing products and services keep the conversation focused.</p>
<p>A search for “smartphone forums,” for example, shows 23,000 results—and that’s where people are sharing their thoughts, feelings, and experiences in abundance.</p>
<h3>Review sites</h3>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2014/04/10/amazon-reviews">Reviews on Amazon</a> and other review sites like Yelp and Angie’s List contain specific reviews about products and services that can be used to inform your landing pages. In the case of Yelp and Angie’s List, those reviews are usually at the local level, giving marketers a good view of the local market. Review sites are also valuable for getting insights on how a target market feels in general about an entire industry.</p>

</article>
</div>
<h3>Question and answer sites</h3>
<p>Q&amp;A sites such as Quora and Yahoo Answers have engagement for a variety of questions, from the simple “How do I pick an accountant?” to “What is the best e-commerce platform in the world?” Quora tends to have higher-quality answers from people who work in the particular industries, so it may be more valuable for some industries than standard review sites.</p>
<h3>Blog comments</h3>
<p>Blog comments have <a href="http://www.inc.com/janine-popick/3-reasons-blog-comments-are-dead.html">been maligned</a> by internet marketers as dumping grounds for spam links. In fact, some sites have chosen to <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/removing-blog-comments/">remove comments</a> and move the conversation to social media. However, for high-traffic sites with popular topics, it’s not uncommon to see hundreds of comments from a target market. This is a front-row seat to how people feel and think. However, much like forums, blog comments can be filled with unhelpful comments from people who don’t add much insight to a topic. It can take some digging to find the gold.</p>
<h3>Social media</h3>
<p>Social media offers a glut of opinion and feelings, but sentiment analysis tools can shorten the time needed to <a href="http://blog.iprospect.ca/10-sentiment-analysis-tools-track-social-marketing-success/">find what a target audience is saying</a>. Marketers can join the conversation or eavesdrop on what’s being said. A company’s own social media channels can serve as optimal places to gauge customer sentiment. On the downside, social media can lack depth, leaning more toward short comments that don’t reveal much detail.</p>

<h3>Search engine research</h3>
<p>Search continues to be a fast path to find out what target markets think and feel. Odds are good that someone has written a piece that has the information you need to understand the market. Marketers can search “what to look for in XYZ product or service” and read an article (or report or industry website) from a trustworthy expert in the field—and it’s safe to assume the marketer’s target audience of prospects have read some of the same information during their own research, which means the landing page should address the exact same points brought forth in the article, report, or website.</p>
<h3>Competitor messaging</h3>
<p>Your competitors’ content and landing pages should be reviewed and catalogued to potentially learn from what they know about the market already. But relying solely on competitors, who may not have done any research themselves, can be risky, because they may just be guessing at what’s important to the target market.</p>
<p>This isn’t an exhaustive list of all the research channels available; however, it should get you started on where and how to conduct primary and secondary voice of customer research.</p>
<h2>How to Organize and Analyze Your VOC Research</h2>
<p>After the research phase is complete, the analysis begins to create a hierarchy of needs that’s prioritized by customers. Depending on the products or services, multiple customer profiles may emerge, each with different priorities.</p>
<p>For example, a web hosting company may find that small businesses are most concerned with price, while its enterprise customers are more concerned with security. That analysis might look something like this:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="337d4a29-1632-471a-89f4-4f604107d5b2" data-langcode="und">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/customer-hierachy-of-needs-1.png" alt="customer hierarchy of needs" width="585" height="365" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<h2>Should the VOC Match the USP?</h2>
<p>Ideally a company’s voice of customer data and USP match. The USP (<a href="/blog/ws/2014/04/07/unique-selling-proposition">unique selling proposition</a>) is the number one reason people pick a solution or service from a company, so it should match what customers say in the VOC research. It’s vital to test and reformulate a USP if it doesn’t match your customer’s needs and wants. For example, if price doesn’t matter to a target market, a company shouldn’t use price as its USP.</p>
<p>Part of the USP is the promise it makes to the target market, and voice of customer data can reveal what that promise should be. Of course, the delivery of that promise is paramount—and companies should avoid promising something they can’t deliver on.</p>
<h2>Final steps: Putting Voice of the Customer Research into Words</h2>
<p>VOC data will drive the creation of:</p>
<ul>
<li>headlines</li>
<li>subheads</li>
<li>bullet points</li>
<li>CTAs</li>
<li>testimonials</li>
</ul>
<p>And other copy on the landing page. Each written element of the landing page should be traceable back to the research. The question shouldn’t be, how do these words sound to the marketer? Instead it should be, <strong>how do they sound to the target audience</strong>? Do they address the prospect’s pain points and show how your solution or service will alleviate the pain?</p>
<p>It’s important to clarify that a company might have several types of customers, each with a different hierarchy of needs, therefore the landing page copy will differ for each offer and customer segment.</p>
<p>For a company’s homepage, it’s nearly impossible to create a message targeted at every conceivable visitor, so the best approach is to choose messaging that targets the most important prospect or customer segment.</p>
<h3>Examples of research copy placement on landing pages:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The product or service’s features and benefits (primarily the benefits) should match the target audience’s pain points from the research that was conducted. See the FreshBooks example from before.</li>
<li>Answer the “Is this solution right for me?” question by stating explicitly who the solution is for. Landing pages are no place for implying anything, and, again, visitors will read everything that’s targeted to them. The best way to do this is to use the intended audience’s title: “Project management software for <strong>freelance graphic artists</strong>.”</li>
<li>Repurpose a customer quote as a subheading: “ABC Plumbing truly does go the extra mile. –John Q. Customer”</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the mountains of research a company may produce, <a href="/blog/ws/2014/02/12/great-landing-pages">awesome landing pages</a> still require testing on an ongoing basis. Though it seems the research should be a one-and-done exercise, a good marketer knows the work is never finished and everything must be tested regularly because markets, needs, and wants change over time.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may have heard the big news that WordStream has added <a href="/blog/ws/2014/06/24/call-tracking-software">call tracking software</a> to its arsenal of PPC tools. This means you can now track the campaigns, keywords, match types, ads, and landing pages that drive inbound calls to your business. Not only that, each call gets recorded, so you can refer back to it for marketing and training purposes.</p>
<p>It’s a pretty freaking sweet feature, and, if you use it, it may change your business.</p>
<p>Let’s assume you already know it’s freaking sweet, you know that <a href="http://marketingland.com/marketing-power-processes-the-lord-of-the-rings-61378">inbound calls are worth 5 to 10 times the value of form fill leads</a>, and you’ve got call tracking set up. Now what?</p>
<p><strong>Now you start tracking performance so you know what’s working and what’s not. </strong></p>
<p>You already know the traditional <a href="/blog/ws/2014/02/06/adwords-metrics">AdWords metrics</a>, including which campaigns, keywords, ads, and landing pages trigger conversions on your site. But when it comes to prospects who pick up the phone and call, the ability to track conversions diminishes quickly unless you use call tracking.</p>
<p>The image below shows a snapshot of the types of data call tracking captures. With this in mind, let’s take a look at <strong>five of the most important metrics to monitor with call tracking</strong>.</p>

</div>
<h2>5 Essential Metrics To Use In Call Tracking</h2>
<h3>Number of calls</h3>
<p>Yes, this is pretty obvious: <a href="/blog/ws/2015/04/22/call-tracking-industries">If your business relies on calls</a>, you’re going to monitor this regularly. The great thing about <a href="/call-tracking">PPC call tracking</a> is that it records the call quantity on a regular basis so you don’t have to manually track inbound calls. You’ll have a deep view of call patterns by the hour, day, week, month, and year.</p>
<p>With PPC call tracking you’ll also have your PPC calls segmented from all other call types. That means you’ll know definitively if a call came from PPC without having to ask the caller (good luck with that), and the data won’t be intertwined with calls from organic or social media calls.</p>
<p>The point is that <strong>you can now tie PPC calls to your PPC costs</strong>. If phone calls are the lifeblood of your business, you now have a clear view of the true ROI of your campaigns.</p>
<h3>Call length</h3>
<p>Not all inbound calls are equal. The generally accepted view with call tracking is that long calls are better leads. The thinking goes that a prospect who spends a lot of time talking with a company representative is probably a hot lead – they wouldn’t keep talking if they weren’t still interested.</p>
<p>To help filter which calls are higher-quality leads, call tracking data reports the call length for each call. Call-length data tells you which campaigns, keywords, ads, and <a href="/blog/ws/2014/02/12/great-landing-pages">landing pages</a> lead to the longest (and likely best) phone calls.</p>
<p><strong>Key point with call length:</strong> Establish a minimum call-length threshold that qualifies a call as a lead. Not every single call is a legitimate lead because of the spam-call factor: those annoying auto-generated calls from a robot. In addition, some calls are from actual people but they turn out to be telemarketers who found you by conducting a search, just like anyone else did, and they’re not really leads.</p>
<p>To filter out the illegitimate calls, <strong>set a minimum call length as the threshold</strong> a call must reach before it’s considered a lead. This could be as short as 30 seconds and as long as a minute, but it really depends on your business’s sales process.</p>
<h3>Time of day and location</h3>
<p>AdWords Enhanced Campaigns give advertisers the <a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/how-to-use-bid-adjustments-to-get-more-out-of-your-adwords-enhanced-campaigns/66548/">ability to change bids</a> by location, time, and device. Call tracking data gives advertisers another reason to take advantage of this AdWords feature.</p>
<p>Now that you know which calls are converting, you can <strong>adjust bids based on the types and quality of calls received from different locations, days, and times</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, if the calls you receive on Friday afternoons tend to be non-converters, you could bid down during that time period. Further, you can apply the same logic to the locations where your ads are showing: If you know a particular metro area produces great phone leads, you can increase your bids for that area.</p>
<h3>Landing page performance</h3>
<p>Most landing pages give visitors two options: a form fill and a phone number. <strong>Without call tracking, most PPC advertisers can only gauge landing page success by form fills</strong>, which could lead you to believe your conversion rate is (a lot) lower than it is. Now, however, you can tie in phone calls to get a better grasp of landing page performance.</p>
<p>For example, it would be easy to deduce that a landing page with no form fills is a failure, but this is where call tracking comes into play. Call tracking data may reveal that that landing page delivers a high number of quality leads and conversions from phone calls.</p>
<p>Landing page analysis should be approached from different angles. Ask multiple questions about your pages’ performance. For example, ask which landing pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deliver the most calls</li>
<li>Produce the best calls, i.e., calls with qualified leads</li>
<li>Generate the most customers</li>
<li>Yield the best call conversion rate (just like click conversion rate, except you replace clicks with calls: conversions/calls = call conversion rate.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conversions</h3>
<p>Conversions are easily the most important metric of all. Take a top-down view of your campaigns and the calls created by each campaign. This includes the keywords, ads, match types, and landing pages.</p>
<p>An inbound call may take as little as a few minutes or as long as a few months to become a customer. Capture that first interaction that PPC produced so when the prospect becomes a customer—in a few minutes or months—you can track it back to that first click and know your return on PPC investment. You’ll also have a better understanding of your sales cycle—the amount of time it takes from initial contact to sealing a deal.</p>
<p>Another comparison to make is <strong>phone leads and their conversions versus web leads</strong> <strong>and their conversions</strong>. Track both types of leads to the very end of the sales funnel and learn which type of lead—phone or web—produces the most profitable type of customer. Knowing this will help you make adjustments to both phone and web strategies.</p>

<p>You’ve now got a good idea of what metrics to track with call tracking. For sure there are more complex and advanced metrics to pull in, especially when you throw Universal Analytics into the mix, but these five call tracking metrics are a great place to get started.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>(I.e. How to keep Google from turning your $500 budget into $600 in ad spend.)</h3>
<p>Take a look around any Google help forum and you’ll likely see questions about <a href="/blog/ws/2013/08/29/ppc-budget-guide">how Google Ads budgeting works</a>. They usually come from advertisers who’ve run over their monthly ad budgets for lack of understanding of this topic. I have to admit, I was one of those advertisers.</p>
<p>I would have felt a lot of embarrassment about my past mistakes if not for the fact the Google help experts had to do some double-checking of their own on it—that’s how (intentionally?) confusing this topic is.</p>
<p>Most, if not all, advertisers use monthly budgets. Of course, Google Ads runs on <em>daily</em> budgets. (2021 update: Not anymore! <a href="/blog/ws/2021/05/26/google-ads-monthly-spend-limit">Monthly spend limits have been rolled out in Google Ads</a>!). The way you work within this environment depends on whether or not your campaign runs every day of the month.</p>
<p>With full confidence intact, let’s review how budgeting works, especially when you’re using <a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2404244?hl=en">ad scheduling</a>.</p>
<h2>The Way Your Google Ads Budget Works For Campaigns That Run Every Day</h2>
<p>The most straightforward rule to remember is this, both for campaigns that run every day or that use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/13/how-to-set-up-ad-scheduling">ad scheduling</a>: Whatever number you put in as your daily budget, <strong>multiply it by 30.4 to determine the maximum amount you’ll be charged that month</strong>. Google uses a fixed 30.4 days for every month, so if you’ve got a budget of $500 to spend in a month, set your daily cap at $16.45 ($500/30.4 days = $16.55) if your campaign runs every day of the month.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adwords-daily-budget-monthly-cap-1.png" alt="AdWords Daily Budget Tips" width="639" height="191" /></div>
<p>Now, keep this concept of <a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2472781?hl=en">ad overdelivery</a> top of mind. Ad overdelivery allows Google Ads to spend up to 20% more of your daily budget on any given day. Now that $16.45 daily budget could become actual spend of $19.74 ($16.45 + 20% overdelivery = $19.74). Remember here, though, that your maximum monthly spend is your daily budget multiplied by 30.4, so to keep you from exceeding your monthly cap, Google will <em>underspend</em> your budget on other days to make up for the overage you spent on previous day(s). In short, they even things out.</p>
<h2>Ad Scheduling Makes Your Google Ads Daily Budget Murky</h2>
<p>If you’re using ad scheduling, forget everything I just said (okay, not everything). Ad scheduling adds a layer of complexity to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/14/google-ads-budgeting-strategies"> setting monthly budgets.</a> The key thing to remember is what I mentioned previously: Whatever number you put in as your daily budget, multiply it by 30.4 to determine the maximum amount you’ll be charged that month. Google sticks to its 30.4 days per month even if you’re not running ads every day of the month. It would be great if Google factored in ad scheduling, but they don’t, so you have to do some math.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adwords-ad-scheduling-settings-1.png" alt="AdWords Ad Scheduling" width="649" height="292" /></div>
<p>Let’s go back to our $500-a-month advertiser, but this time we only want to run ads on weekdays (M-F), and there are 20 weekdays in our example month.</p>
<p>Simple math would dictate a budget of $25 per day ($500/20 days = $25 per day), but Google actually interprets this as a monthly budget of $760 ($25 x 30.4 days = $760) and therefore could go ahead and feel free to spend up to 20% more each day your ads run. You (or your client) could end up spending $600 ($25 + 20% overdelivery x 20 days = $600) instead of the budgeted $500 because Google doesn’t have the “missing” 10.4 days to underspend your budget and even things out. The point: Google doesn’t account for the ad scheduling and the fact you’re actually only showing ads on 20 days, not 30.4.</p>
<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'></span></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4b0.png" alt="💰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Want more Google Ads budgeting tips? </strong></p>

<p><span></div></div></span></p>
<p>The solution to this issue requires a little math and some assumptions. First, assume you will incur costs that are 20% higher than what you have set as your daily budget. So in our example, I would reduce my daily budget to $20 to allow for 20% overspend (which would be $24) and finish the month just under budget at $480 ($24 x 20 days = $480). Going back to the daily budget x 30.4 rule, Google will interpret my $20 budget as a $608 monthly budget ($20 x 30.4). However, I won’t hit that because my daily budget is capped at $24 and I’m only running for 20 days.</p>
<p><strong>Final Takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re using ad scheduling, one thing to remember is <strong>you must recalculate your daily budget at the beginning of every month</strong> because not every month has the same amount of weekdays.</li>
<li><strong>The tips above are best applied when you’re in a competitive market and regularly hit your budget.</strong> If you’re having trouble hitting your budget, you might not need to be concerned with the 20% overdelivery and can therefore use a higher daily budget.</li>
<li><strong>You can also use Google Ads <a href="/blog/ws/2012/03/12/adwords-automated-rules">automated rules</a></strong> to set your campaign(s) to pause when they hit certain spend thresholds, but these too come with some nuances to be aware of.</li>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google AdWords takes the word “competitive” to new heights. This fluid auction, fired off whenever someone performs a Google search, provides a platform for advertisers to compete for attention, clicks, traffic, and conversions – in short, for customers.</p>
<p>Too often, however, PPC managers see the need to be competitive as a kneejerk cue to raise bids. Though a top rank <em>can</em> be helpful, and you might have to raise your bids to get there, it doesn’t guarantee clicks, let alone that those clicks will <em>convert</em> – and conversions are what matter most.</p>
<p>This guide will show you how to stand out in this competitive space without reverting solely to bid-pumping tactics. We’ll examine the digital real estate you’re competing for, what prompts your ads to show there, and specific steps you can take to compete in AdWords.</p>
<h2>Where Searchers Are Looking</h2>
<p>Take a step back and think about where searchers look when they see the SERP (search engine results page) and what influences where their eyes go. Naturally, they’ll go to the top of the page first because that’s what’s in front of them and they’re expecting the top results to (hopefully) solve their search.</p>
<p>Take this Nielsen Norman Group <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/">eyetracking study</a> with heat maps that show typical eye movements as a starting point:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="6413f0e2-650b-4141-87ea-4694589a8feb" data-langcode="und">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/competing-in-adwords-eye-tracking-1.png" alt="Eye Tracking AdWords" width="568" height="278" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>You’ll notice that the red areas, which indicate the popular viewing areas, form an F-shape. The top of the page gets the most attention first, and then eyes focus along the left-hand side, forming an F-shaped pattern – and all of this occurs in a matter of seconds or fractions of seconds. What this means to you is you’ve got to stand out!</p>
<p>Accordingly, from a PPC perspective, you might assume that you’ve got to be in a top-three position to get clicks – because no one looks at the right side of the page. Nothing could be further from the truth, and here’s why:</p>
<p>Overall, paid search ads account for six percent of total clicks. But, for keywords with high commercial intent, the sponsored results earn about <strong>twice as many clicks</strong> as the organic results. What does this do to the F-shape? It turns it into a backward F in which searchers are looking at the top and <em>right-hand side</em> of the page.</p>
<p>Even further, <a href="/articles/google-ads">our research shows</a> that sponsored ads for high-commercial-intent keyword searches receive 64.6 percent of clicks. In other words, <strong>those searchers looking to buy a specific product are <em>more</em> likely to click the sponsored ads</strong> than organic results. This is in part because Google populates the SERP for these commercial queries with a large proportion of highly compelling sponsored ads, such as Product Listing Ads. These splashy above-the-fold ads include eye-catching images and detailed product information. They’re hard for searchers who are shopping to ignore, and they may not even recognize them as ads.</p>

</div>
<p>Now that you know what the digital-real-estate layout looks like, let’s take a look at the variables that drive how you appear there and how you can stand out.</p>
<h2>An Ad Rank Refresher – And Major Update</h2>
<p>Ad rank, or, position, is a simple formula. It is (or used to be) a function of your bid and Quality Score. The timeless, soon-to-be-outdated <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyBB5h20xoc">video explanation</a> of Ad Rank from Google’s Hal Varian explains how this works, but here’s a visual overview of it:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="79f81988-a818-4f80-b3e6-eb9f6fb4407c" data-langcode="und">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/competing-in-adwords-ad-rank-formula-1.png" alt="AdWords Competition Guide" width="888" height="374" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>The thing to note about the formula is <strong>that by having a higher Quality Score, it’s possible to outrank a competitor who has a higher bid</strong>.</p>
<p>As we see in the example, Advertiser I outranks everyone even though she has the lowest bid, because of her stellar Quality Score of 10 (note: in ad rank, the higher number wins).</p>
<p>Advertiser IV, on the other hand, has done little to help himself by neglecting his Quality Score and relying on bidding high in the hopes of achieving top rank – and he still couldn’t do it because of his low Quality Score.</p>
<p>It’s important to realize that Google wants to show quality ads and provide good user experiences so people keep coming back to use their service. The example above drives home the point that merely bidding high isn’t enough to achieve a good ad rank.</p>
<p><strong>Where to find your Quality Scores</strong></p>
<p>Each keyword has a Quality Score, and you’ll find it right in the AdWords interface for each keyword:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="cba31eb1-5ad5-40ff-a8da-b09392d2ae39" data-langcode="und">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/compete-in-adwords-find-quality-score-1.png" alt="AdWords Competition" width="502" height="325" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>This is what you’ll see after you click the callout bubble under “Eligible”:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="76c3b842-2eea-445f-83dc-2b03596ff8b5" data-langcode="und">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-compete-adwords-quality-score-1.png" alt="AdWords Quality Score Diagnosis" width="300" height="111" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>As you can see, the three main drivers of Quality Score are click-through rate (CTR), ad relevance, and landing page experience. Google provides <a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2454010?hl=en">more detailed information</a> about those three and other variables affecting Quality Score, but CTR is widely known to be the most important of the three.</p>
<p>Additionally, a good Quality Score leads not only to improved rank, but also <a href="/blog/ws/2013/03/26/google-quality-score">lower costs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s where things get interesting for Ad Rank:</strong></p>
<p>You may have noticed we mentioned that Ad Rank <em>used to be</em> a function of your bid and Quality Score. That’s because Google <a href="/blog/ws/2013/10/24/adwords-ad-rank-algorithm">just recently announced</a> that the expected performance of your ad extensions will now be factored into the ranking equation. Theories as to why Google is doing this abound, but, suffice it to say, <strong>if you’re not already using extensions, now’s the time to do it</strong>.</p>
<p>Understanding <a href="/blog/ws/2013/06/03/adwords-ad-extensions-cheat-sheet">how extensions work</a> is imperative to good campaign performance. The examples below illustrate the “wow factor” your ads get with the addition of extensions.</p>
<p><strong>Extensions in Action</strong></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="fe5725e9-7e65-4186-b0e4-9636024a772a" data-langcode="und">

</article>
</div>
<p>Now look at this one. Same search, different advertiser, no extensions – which of the 3 ads would you click?</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0209fab4-674d-48eb-bff4-d1e88914724e" data-langcode="und">

</article>
</div>
<p>Now that extensions are part of the ranking equation, here’s where it all comes full circle: By using extensions and optimizing them, you’re improving your Ad Rank in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google now favors advertisers who are using ad extensions, and</li>
<li>Ad extensions improve your CTR, which in turn improves your Quality Score – that also helps your rank.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the Ad Rank function settled, let’s dive into actions you can take to compete at a high level in AdWords.</p>
<h2>What You Can Do</h2>
<p>Think about the tools at your disposal. AdWords gives search marketers an arsenal of free tools to compete for clicks. Take the time to learn them and you’ll capture more clicks and customers than your competition.</p>
<p>Success comes down to three things: showing up, taking up a lot of space when you do show up, and, finally, getting attention with great ad copy and offers. You don’t need to throw more <em>money</em> at your AdWords to compete—you need to throw more <em>time</em> at your AdWords to compete.</p>
<p>As with all things you do in AdWords, follow the ABT (Always Be Testing) path. Complacency ruins your chances for success, therefore, have a plan in place to ABT your campaigns.</p>
<p>Use the following tips as a checklist for what you can do on a regular basis to compete.</p>
<p><strong>CTR: </strong>Improve your click-through rate and your whole campaign benefits. Make your ads shine and you’ll outpace your competition and spend less money. Three simple ways to increase CTR include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Have compelling offers. </strong>The offer must stand out from the other ads. Make your offer exciting to potential customers.</li>
<li><strong>Use numbers in your ads</strong> (e.g., it’s not “A Huge Sale,” it’s “30% Off Storewide”). Numbers get attention and they sell.</li>
<li><strong>Make your CTA a strong one.</strong> Convey urgency: Order Today! Start Saving Now!</li>
</ul>
<p>CTR rests largely on ad copy (and extensions, below). The three tips above just scratch the surface of good ad copy. Read more about improving CTR in these articles:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="/blog/ws/2013/08/15/ad-copywriting-tips">How to Write Ad Copy for PPC: 5 Tips for Better Ad Writing</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ad Relevance:</strong> Make sure the ad is relevant to the search. A relevant ad provides information that matches the user’s search query. A best practice is to <strong>have the keyword in both the headline and description</strong>. (Our <a href="/20-minute-ppc-work-week">20-Minute PPC Work Week</a> has a built-in tool to make sure you’re doing it.)</p>
<p>Keywords in headlines and descriptions not only improve the relevancy of your ads, but also make it possible for your keyword to be bolded in the ad, which attracts eyeballs and clicks. Here’s an example for “home office desks”:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="474dc762-4c65-4f83-b1bd-d16495407f0a" data-langcode="und">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/compete-in-adwords-keywords-1.png" alt="Keywords in AdWords Ads" width="280" height="98" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>The extra bolding in the title, URL, and description makes the ad appear more relevant to the search, and it stands out in the sea of ads for that search query.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Solid CTRs and ad relevancy are best achieved with tightly themed ad groups. Ideally you’ll have 10 to 15 keywords per ad group so that your ads are highly relevant to the smaller ad groups. Yes, it’s more work, but it’s worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Landing Page Experience:</strong> The landing page is how you <a href="/blog/ws/2013/07/11/landing-page-conversion-rate-guide">make sure conversions happen</a>, so even if your CTR is great and costs are low, you’re not really competing if you’re not converting.</p>
<p>Your ROI soars with <a href="/blog/ws/2013/09/10/landing-page-builder">landing pages that work</a>. Though it’s easy to just send all of your visitors to your homepage, that’s hardly the best thing. Ideally your ad will take searchers to landing pages that are well-designed, reinforce the features and benefits of your offer, and provide for a smooth conversion. The golden rule for landing pages is to make it as easy as possible for your visitors to do business with you.</p>
<p><strong>Ad Extensions:</strong> You already know using extensions is now a must-do. Going into the particulars of each one is a <a href="http://marketing.wordstream.com/AdExtensionGuideDownload">whole other guide</a>, but if you’re in a hurry, check out our <a href="/blog/ws/2013/06/03/adwords-ad-extensions-cheat-sheet">cheat sheet</a> for extensions. Just remember: now that extensions are part of the ad rank equation, they’re not an option. It’s time to use them.</p>
<p><strong>Bids:</strong> This guide focuses on all of the things you can do besides tinkering with your bids. Nonetheless, a good bidding strategy does make you more competitive in AdWords. Tactics like <a href="/blog/ws/2013/08/27/adwords-bid-stacking">bid stacking with multiple match types</a> can maximize your budget. Read the <a href="/blog/ws/2012/03/14/ppc-bid-management-guide">bid management guide</a> to take an even deeper look at bidding approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Keywords: </strong>Think about the various <a href="http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2274277/Google-AdWords-Keyword-Match-Types-and-Negatives-The-Ultimate-Guide">match types</a> in AdWords and use <a href="/blog/ws/2013/11/13/adwords-geotargeting-local-ppc-guide">geotargeting</a> to be more relevant in search results. Look at your competitor’s <a href="/blog/ws/2013/03/19/why-bid-on-branded-terms-ppc">brand terms</a> and consider bidding on them. Chances are they’re already bidding on yours.</p>
<h2>More Pieces To The AdWords Puzzle</h2>
<p><strong>Establish a baseline:</strong></p>
<p>Use the Dimensions tab in AdWords to see where you’re ranking, what clicks you’re getting, and how conversions look in various ad positions. You’ll glean valuable insights from this data and might rethink your ad rank strategy.</p>

<p>Monitor this over time and test it to see what rank makes sense for your business.</p>
<p><strong>STR: </strong>Search Term Reports (STR) are often neglected (because who has time for that?) but you should <em>make</em> time. <a href="http://blog.whitesharkmedia.com/optimize-adwords-search-term-report">Use the STR</a> to find the cheaper, higher-converting keywords that have less competition as well as new keywords to bid on. You’ll also find potential <a href="http://marketing.wordstream.com/negative-keywords-expert-guide.html">negative keywords</a> to add to your campaigns so you’re not wasting money on bad keywords.</p>
<p><strong>Isolate Low QS Keywords: </strong>Sometimes you’ll have one or two keywords in an ad group that have consistently low Quality Scores no matter what you do. They become a drag on the whole group and your campaign. The way you address this is to employ the “peel and stick” method:</p>
<p>1. Download your keyword report with all Quality Scores included. Look for the keywords with low Quality Scores.</p>
<p>2. Create new, extremely tight ad groups for those keywords. Peel them out of the old ad group(s) and put them in their own ad groups with highly relevant ads and focused landing pages.</p>
<p>Alternatively, assess whether the keyword(s) make sense to be bidding on. Pause or delete them if you determine they’re not high-value keywords for your business.</p>
<p><strong>Seasonality: </strong>Holidays and business cycles are key opportunities to show your competitive edge. Timely, relevant ads and <a href="/blog/ws/2013/11/27/seasonal-landing-pages">seasonal landing pages</a> give you an advantage because you’re showing that you understand customer needs and mindsets.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2013/11/26/advanced-holiday-adwords-strategies">Holiday PPC Planning: Three Advanced Strategies for AdWords</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Competition:</strong> This last one tends to get overlooked. We get so wrapped up in our own metrics that we forget the obvious: Look at your competition.</p>
<p>Look at their ads and offers. Ask yourself if you’re truly competitive. If you can’t compete with the offer, make sure your ad copy and extensions improve your “click appeal” in spite of a weaker offer. Appearance, enthusiasm, and words sell!</p>
<p>Do some sleuthing, too. Use WordStream’s Competitor Website Crawler (under Keyword Research Tools in WordStream Advisor) to determine which keywords are most important to your competitors. If you know this you can attack them head-on for those keywords, or find weak spots (keywords they’re not focused on) and capture those clicks.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Now you’ve got the tools to compete in AdWords without falling back on bid-pumping. You also understand that rank is about more than your bid alone, especially now that extensions are part of the equation. Focus on taking up as much digital real estate as possible, and create ads and landing pages that work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/28/google-shopping-holiday-forecasts">the holidays come barreling in</a>, the last thing you need to worry about is pushing yourself away from turkey and stuffing to turn off your clients’ campaigns. Fortunately, there’s a quick and easy way to schedule your campaigns automatically: the Google Ads <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/01/google-ads-automated-rules">automated rules feature</a>.</p>
<p>I used to eschew this feature, opting instead to set reminders in my calendar, but a recent client request for specific days and hours during the holidays prompted me to learn how Google’s campaign automation works.</p>
<p>You can use Automate for lots of things, such as turning a campaign off when your budget hits a certain amount, or to receive an email when events occur on your website. For our purposes here, though, we’re going to focus on one thing: <strong>how to pause and enable campaigns on particular days and at particular hours</strong>.</p>
<h2>3 Steps to Using Google Ads Automation for the Holidays</h2>
<p>This is an easy three-step process:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
<p>Go to your Campaigns tab in Google Ads (formerly known as AdWords), click the three little dots in the dashboard from the right, and select &#8220;Create an automated rule.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="57aba0e8-aeec-417f-a47c-e91e9fd5ef10" data-langcode="und">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-ads-holiday-automation-1.png" alt="Google Ads Holiday Automation" width="1344" height="527" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
<p>Select &#8220;Pause campaigns&#8221; under &#8220;Type of rule,&#8221; then select the campaign or campaigns you want your rule to apply to:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="a544599b-01c2-4262-a1c8-10fb75cbf412" data-langcode="und">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-ads-holiday-automation-pause-1.png" alt="" width="919" height="464" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, you&#8217;re going to set the time and frequency of your automated rule:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="b85781a1-e944-4fb2-a865-05a29dca31aa" data-langcode="und">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-ads-holiday-automation-pause-2-1.png" alt="Google Ads Holiday Automation Pause" width="827" height="322" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Select “Once” in the frequency drop-down, and choose 12 AM for the day you want the campaign to pause. In this example, I’ve instructed Google Ads to pause the campaign on November 28 – and <strong>it will remain paused until I enable it again</strong> (more on this later). Set the “using data from” field to &#8220;Same day&#8221; (as opposed to &#8220;Same month&#8221; in the example here). Finally, you may want to assign a custom “Rule name” to your automation because it will help you identify your rules later on when you want to review them.</p>
<p>You can also select the option to receive an email when your rule actually takes effect or leave it set to email you only when a rule changes or if there’s an error in your rule, but that’s generally only going to come into play when you’re doing more sophisticated automations.</p>
<p>Hit “Save” and you’re done!</p>
<p><strong>One last step</strong></p>
<p>Okay, not quite done. I mentioned the need to enable your soon-to-be-paused accounts after the desired paused period has elapsed. You can set this to happen automatically for you so you don’t forget in your post-holiday grogginess.</p>
<p>Simply follow step one above, but this time select “Enable campaigns…”</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="41785ad4-ea08-4607-b251-c03187d74bc7" data-langcode="und">

</article>
</div>
<p>As I’ve chosen to have my example campaign pause at midnight, November 28, <strong>it will stay paused until I turn it back on manually or set an automated rule to turn it on</strong>. In my case, I set it to enable on December 2 at midnight (see below), at which point the campaign’s regular settings will kick in.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="c3106583-4bbe-495d-805d-b56c61c9e407" data-langcode="und">

</article>
</div>
<p>That’s all you have to do to free up some holiday time. Here are some closing notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can set the pause and enable rules for any time of the day, not just midnight. So, if you have a client who wants to only run until noon on the day before Thanksgiving, you can set it to pause at noon or whatever hour is desired.</li>
<li>If you want an overview of all the rules you set, use the &#8220;G-T&#8221; keyboard shortcut (i.e. &#8220;go to), which will open up your search bar. Type in &#8220;rules&#8221; to get an overview of all of your rules.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ask any business owner what he or she needs, and you’ll likely hear “more customers.” Businesses can’t just rely on their existing customers to fuel growth, so there’s a constant need for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/08/lead-quality">more leads who will eventually become clients</a>.</p>
<p>This guide will tell you how to use pay-per-click (PPC) advertising with Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords) to get more leads and grow your business.</p>
<h2>Who PPC Lead Gen Works For</h2>
<p>A common misperception is that PPC is only for e-commerce websites, but that’s not the case at all. PPC is a highly effective channel for websites and companies doing <a href="/blog/ws/2017/03/01/lead-generation-ideas">online lead generation</a>.</p>
<p>Lead generation (often referred to as “lead gen”) is a requirement for businesses that can’t or won’t do business with just anyone. There’s usually a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/25/lead-qualification">prequalification</a> and information-exchange period that takes place so the company and consumer can make decisions based on information.</p>
<p>Lead-gen business characteristics might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trial periods</li>
<li>Approval and denial processes</li>
<li>Long <a href="/blog/ws/2015/01/26/sales-cycle">sales cycles</a> because of the complex nature of the product or service</li>
<li>Price quotes</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, financial services (credit cards and mortgages), all types of insurance, and business-to-business software survive with lead generation or <a href="/blog/ws/2016/11/28/lead-capture">lead capture</a>. In fact, anyone who’s reading this guide is, or at some point has been, a lead for a company. As a lead you were categorized with a label, like “hot lead,” and were then marketed to on a regular basis until an event occurred: you may have signed up, were denied, decided to do nothing, or just went to the bottom of their lead pile to be marketed to later.</p>
<p>The <strong>goal of lead gen is to get prospects into the lead-tracking system</strong> (commonly depicted as a funnel – see below) to begin a contact period in which the company learns more about your needs and qualifications, and you learn more about the company’s products and services.</p>
<p>The <strong>ultimate goal is for a sales person to close the deal, so the company gains a new customer</strong>. It starts with obtaining basic information, like a name and email address, then progresses to getting more detailed information about the prospect.</p>
<h2>Why PPC Is Great for Lead Gen</h2>
<p>If you consider your typical <a href="/blog/ws/2015/05/07/marketing-funnel">lead funnel</a>, it won’t take long to realize you need to keep filling the funnel full of leads.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ppc-lead-gen-funnel-1.jpg" alt="Get More Leads with PPC" width="474" height="300" /></div>
<p>At first leads go into the top of the funnel, then work their way down to an eventual conversion. The challenge is getting the initial leads to feed the top of the funnel. Let’s look at the ways this may be accomplished and why PPC is an excellent source of leads:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blogging:</strong> This can be a good source of leads, but you need to a) constantly publish new content, b) hope your blog posts get shared a lot, and c) have a lot of blog subscribers. This takes time.</li>
<li><strong>Email:</strong> You can repeatedly email your existing subscribers, or you can rent or buy a list of email addresses and hope you’re targeting great new leads for your business.</li>
<li><strong>Social media:</strong> This can get you <a href="/blog/ws/2013/05/16/buying-twitter-followers-pros-and-cons">new followers</a> and fans and expose you to new prospects. However, it doesn’t mean those followers are in your <a href="/blog/ws/2014/09/18/beginners-guide-to-target-markets">target market</a> or need your product or service.</li>
<li><strong>Organic search:</strong> Organic ranking is the top of the heap. Approximately 85 percent of search clicks come from page one organic listings, and the clicks are free! The only problem is <a href="/blog/ws/2012/10/15/why-seo-is-harder-for-small-businesses">you’re competing with thousands of others for those positions</a>, and you’ve got to do a ton of on- and off-page SEO work and wait months, maybe years, to get to page one.</li>
<li><strong>PPC:</strong> You can instantly appear on page one and be in front of people who are searching for your solution to their problem. More people are aware of you and what you have to offer than before. Bingo!</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, PPC is a channel you pay for by the click. Do keep in mind, though, that <strong>no marketing channel is free</strong>. Someone has to manage social media, write the blogs, work with the SEO agency (not free), and publish the emails—and those people don’t do it for free.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of PPC for Lead Generation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Attract visitors who are looking for what you offer</li>
<li>Achieve immediate <a href="/blog/ws/2012/11/14/how-to-rank-for-a-keyword">keyword rankings</a> and traffic</li>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2013/08/29/ppc-budget-guide">Bid on various stages of the funnel</a></li>
<li>Control the message for each funnel stage</li>
<li>See what people are searching for and craft your message to their needs</li>
<li>Know more about your leads and their behavior</li>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2013/07/30/ppc-guide-for-beginners-1">Track ROI</a> down to the penny</li>
<li>Grow your database of leads and market to them with other methods</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Lead Gen Compares to E-Commerce</h2>
<p>Back to our initial statement about how e-commerce and lead generation both use PPC marketing. The most glaring difference is the qualification process: in e-commerce, there is none. As long as you have a credit card you’re in the target market.</p>
<h3>Lead gen vs. e-commerce ad copy</h3>
<p>Starting with the ad copy itself, you’ll notice the messages and calls-to-action vary between e-commerce and lead-gen companies:</p>
<div><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/lead-gen-vs-e-commerce-ctas-1.png" alt="Lead Gen vs. E-Commerce" width="643" height="194" /></div>
<p>Notice how e-commerce is about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/28/hyperbolic-discounting">immediate gratification</a> (and sales!), while lead gen is a bit more discriminating. It’s rarely the case where you become an immediate customer in lead gen because you have to go through a process first.</p>
<p>Here are some real-world examples of how the ad copy, CTA, and <a href="/blog/ws/2013/09/10/landing-page-builder">landing page experiences</a> compare. For lead gen, the keyword is “car insurance.”</p>
<div><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ppc-lead-generation-ads-ctas-1.png" alt="lead generation ppc ads" width="790" height="516" /></div>
<p>Now look at the e-commerce copy and CTAs used for “asics running shoes”:</p>
<div><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/e-commerce-ppc-ad-examples-1.png" alt="e-commerce ppc" width="763" height="518" /></div>
<p>The <a href="/blog/ws/2013/08/15/ad-copywriting-tips">ad copy</a> and CTAs are somewhat subtle in their differences. The landing pages, however, are where a distinct difference between e-commerce and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/28/lead-generation-for-contractors">lead gen</a> is clear.</p>
<h3>Lead gen vs. e-commerce PPC landing pages</h3>
<p>Here are some examples of <a href="/blog/ws/2016/02/24/landing-pages-for-lead-generation">lead-gen landing pages for PPC</a>:</p>
<div><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ppc-lead-gen-landing-page-example-1.png" alt="get leads with ppc" width="430" height="310" /></div>
<div><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ppc-lead-gen-landing-page-example-2-1.png" alt="PPC lead gen landing page" width="417" height="370" /></div>
<p>The landing pages are limited and with few distractions.</p>
<p>There’s a clear pattern of headline, benefits, and multiple calls-to-action: “Start,” “Get an online quote,” “Call,” etc.</p>
<p>Your choices are limited: either make a call or provide them with your zip code.</p>
<p>Visitors need to tell the companies more so the companies can start to qualify and route the leads through the funnel.</p>
<p>With e-commerce, it’s a different landing-page experience. Visitors are free to shop the stores and make purchases.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ppc-e-commerce-landing-page-example-1.png" alt="E-Commerce Landing Page" width="464" height="245" /></div>
<div><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ppc-e-commerce-landing-page-example-2-1.png" alt="PPC for E-Commerce Sales" width="463" height="279" /></div>
<p>Both landing pages are relevant to the search query <em>and</em> provide additional pages to look at.</p>
<p>There’s urgency associated with the “free ground shipping” offer – it’s a limited time offer so visitors are motivated to purchase soon.</p>
<p>The theme of both landing pages is to <strong>shop now</strong>. They’re encouraging visitors to make purchases now.</p>
<h2>How to Optimize Your Campaigns to Get More Leads Through PPC</h2>
<p>Optimizing lead-gen campaigns with Google Ads requires the same principles you incorporate with e-commerce: tightly themed ad groups, <a href="/blog/ws/2012/09/25/a-b-testing">testing ad copy and offers</a>, and a variety of keywords. The major differences are the types of calls-to-action and the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">landing pages</a>, as evidenced by the previous examples.</p>
<p>The goal is to keep <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/24/facebook-free-leads">topping off the funnel with qualified leads</a>, and you do this by collecting information from your visitors. It’s a numbers game because not every click you get is going to convert, therefore you need to cast a wide net and increase your chances of getting qualified leads with PPC.</p>
<h3>Actionable tips for improving your lead-gen performance:</h3>
<p><strong>Entice visitors with offers. </strong>Offer something (e.g., a free white paper or guide) in exchange for the visitor’s email, name, and more. At the very least, give them the opportunity to sign up for your blog or follow you on social media. Though the latter outcomes are not ideal, you at least have not wasted the click by getting nothing for it.</p>
<p><strong>Use focused landing pages. </strong>Repeat the benefits and why the person should give you their information. Ask for just the right amount of pertinent information instead of making the transaction appear laborious by asking for <em>too</em> much information. Use primary and secondary CTAs. Test landing page length and fields. In short, make it as frictionless as possible.</p>
<p>Example of a PPC landing page that was reached via PPC:</p>
<div><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pr-web-ppc-landing-page-for-lead-generation-1.png" alt="how to get more leads" width="400" height="349" /></div>
<p><strong>Things to notice:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Very few fields to fill in = increased response</li>
<li>Simple bullet point list of benefits</li>
<li>Testimonial and short client list</li>
<li>Free offer in exchange for information</li>
<li>Trust and credibility proof</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Try dynamic number insertion (DNI). </strong>DNI allows you to dynamically change the phone number that appears in your ads and on landing pages. This ensures your call representatives know <a href="/blog/ws/2012/12/10/three-types-of-search-queries">what type of keyword</a> triggered the call. You’re then better able to route calls to the right reps in your organization. Two of the better known providers are <a href="http://public.ifbyphone.com/">ifbyphone</a> and <a href="http://www.callrail.com/">Call Rail</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Invest in a solid CRM. </strong>Tracking your leads and staying in touch with them can become overwhelming—fast. A CRM (customer relationship management) program allows you to record who contacted you, what they were interested in, and what happened. You can then classify the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/12/how-to-generate-leads">leads you generated</a> and engage with them via email or a phone call.
