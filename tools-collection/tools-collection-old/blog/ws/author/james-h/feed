<h2>The biggest content marketing challenges in 2025</h2>
<p>We’re diving into the biggest <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/content-marketing-strategy-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content marketing</a> challenges businesses are facing and sharing what you can do about them to see the best results all year long.</p>
<div id="publishing-content-that-converts"></div>
<h3>Challenge #1: Creating content that converts users</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/articles/content-marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Content Marketing Institute’s research</a>, the top challenge marketers face with content creation is getting users to take a desired action.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenges-chart.webp" alt="top content marketing challenges chart research" width="1430" height="937" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91206" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenges-chart.webp 1430w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenges-chart-1280x839.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenges-chart-980x642.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenges-chart-480x315.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1430px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/articles/content-marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post">write blog posts</a> and post on social media all day, but if no one becomes a paying customer, there isn’t much point.</p>
<p>Some of your content will simply exist just for entertainment’s sake, and that’s okay. But you’re running a business, so some of it needs to get people to convert.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can overcome this challenge:</p>
<h4>Address the needs and pain points of your audience</h4>
<p>Some people wake up thinking they need cold-pressed juice. Others wake up thinking they want to eat something healthy but don’t have time to cook. Your content should tap into those real-life desires.</p>
<p>Here’s the difference:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenges-addressing-pain-points-png.webp" alt="addressing pain points okay vs better content example" width="936" height="201" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91207" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenges-addressing-pain-points-png.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenges-addressing-pain-points-480x103.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The first statement is informative, but the second one speaks to a specific need. Shift your message to why your product or service helps, and that’s when you’ll see people take action.</p>
<h4>Use headlines that hook people</h4>
<p>Think of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/01/headline-examples">headlines</a> like a storefront. If your signage is bland, people walk by. But if it’s compelling or sparks curiosity, they step inside.</p>
<p>See the difference:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenge-strong-headline-example-png.webp" alt="okay vs better headlines for prompting action in content" width="936" height="180" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91208" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenge-strong-headline-example-png.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenge-strong-headline-example-480x92.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Test different headlines and see what resonates with your audience. Try formulas like these:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question-based:</strong> Tired of Feeling Bloated? This Juice Might Be the Fix</li>
<li><strong>List-based:</strong> 5 Superfoods That Make Your Skin Glow (And How to Get Them in One Drink)</li>
<li><strong>Curiosity-driven:</strong> We Tried Mixing Beets and Pineapple: Here’s What Happened</li>
</ul>
<h4>Use calls-to-action that are easy to say “yes” to</h4>
<p>You’ve likely read an article, got to the end, and then just left. That’s what happens when there’s no clear next step.</p>
<p>Your content needs <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">calls-to-action (CTAs)</a> as a natural next step. But not always in a pushy, “buy now” way.</p>
<p>Let’s say you post a blog on how to naturally boost your immunity with juice. Instead of ending it with a friendly sign-off, give people a reason to act. Say something like “Want to try an immunity-boosting juice? Order online and pick up in 15 minutes!”</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/270d.png" alt="✍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Need help finding the perfect CTA?</strong> Free guide download &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download">The 42 Best Call to Action Phrases Ever (&amp; Why They Work)</a></p>
<div id="knowing-your-audience"></div>
<h3>Challenge #2: Knowing your audience</h3>
<p>Some businesses think they know their customers. The owner of a juice bar might think “We sell smoothies, so our <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/target-audience/">target audience</a> is health-conscious people.”</p>
<p>But that’s too broad, and it’s not that simple. Are they busy professionals grabbing some juice before work? Gym-goers looking for a protein boost? Different people need different messages.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to get inside your audience’s head:</p>
<h4>Do audience research</h4>
<p>Instead of making assumptions, do some actual research. And your content will be better for it.</p>
<p>Look at the customers coming through the door. See who’s placing orders online. Are they mostly young professionals? Students? Parents?</p>
<p>Check out the conversations in places like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reddit-marketing">Reddit threads</a> and Facebook groups. Scope out the reviews of your competitors to see what people are saying about products like yours.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f575-fe0f-200d-2640-fe0f.png" alt="🕵️‍♀️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Want to understand who you should target with your content marketing?</strong> Download the guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteTargetAudience.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_TargetAudineceGuide_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links">How to Find Your Target Audience [Simple Steps!]</a></p>
<h4>Create buyer personas</h4>
<p>Once you’ve gathered some info, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/23/buyer-personas">create buyer personas</a>. Map out who your actual audience is, so you can talk to them like real people.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/buyer-persona-definition-png.webp" alt="definition of and info about buyer personas" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90344" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/buyer-persona-definition-png.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/buyer-persona-definition-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here’s an example for that juice bar: One persona could be “Fran, the Fitness Enthusiast.” She’s 30 years old and lives in the city. She regularly hits the gym at 6 a.m. and needs a smoothie right after. Fran also loves organic ingredients and reading about personal health.</p>
<p>When creating content for this persona, you’d talk about protein blends, superfoods, and the benefits of adding things like turmeric for recovery.</p>
<h4>Use analytics to track audience engagement</h4>
<p>If your content isn’t working, the analytics will tell you. Google Analytics, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/05/social-media-metrics">social media insights</a>, and email open rates also tell a story. Which pages and posts get the most engagement?</p>
<p>Let’s say you post a reel about a new kale smoothie, but it flops. Meanwhile, a post about the best juice combos for glowing skin gets a lot of action. That’s a clue that your audience might care more about one thing over another. Adjust your choices for content accordingly.</p>
<h4>Ask your audience for feedback</h4>
<p>Nothing beats real conversations with your audience. Run a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-do-a-poll-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quick Instagram poll</a>, ask for feedback at checkout, or include a one-question survey in your email newsletter.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ask-for-feedback-email-png.webp" alt="email asking for feedback on upcoming offer" width="1200" height="642" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91211" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ask-for-feedback-email-png.webp 1200w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ask-for-feedback-email-980x524.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ask-for-feedback-email-480x257.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>People may share their opinion if they feel like your brand is listening to them. Plus, their answers will give you content ideas.</p>
<div id="differentiating-content-from-the-competitors"></div>
<h3>Challenge #3: Differentiating content from the competitors</h3>
<p>It’s not easy to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-differentiate-content">stand out</a>. The good news is you don’t need to do any crazy marketing tactics. You just need to be real with your content. Stories create emotional connections, and sharing your expertise builds trust. Do both, and people will remember your content.</p>
<p>Here’s how to start differentiating yourself:</p>
<h4>Tell a story</h4>
<p>Numbers and stats can help build credibility. But if you want your content to leave a mark, give storytelling a go. Research suggests that personal stories and gossip make up <a href="https://www.soocial.com/storytelling-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 65%</a> of our conversations. It’s just how people connect.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re researching information about brakes on your car. As a reader, what do you think would be more memorable&#8211; a dry, factual post about brake repairs? Or an anecdote about a driver who avoided a major accident thanks to a quick visit to a trusted mechanic?</p>
<p>Make your content memorable by weaving in real stories. <a href="https://www.blog.thebrandshopbw.com/brand-storytelling-statistics-and-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55%</a> of consumers are more likely to remember a story than a list of facts.</p>
<p>Now put yourself in the shoes of a mechanic shop owner. Instead of just saying that regular oil changes extend the life of an engine, bring it to life with a real example. Maybe you had a customer who hadn’t changed their oil in 15,000 miles, and their engine was about to fail. Sharing a story makes the point hit home.</p>
<p>And you’re not limited to just <em>your</em> experiences. A glowing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/19/customer-testimonial-examples">customer testimonial</a> about how your shop diagnosed a transmission issue when another shop couldn’t figure it out? That’s more convincing than simply talking about your services.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/customer-testimonial-example-auto-mechanic-png.webp" alt="descriptive customer testimonial for an auto mechanic shop on website" width="1200" height="774" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91236" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/customer-testimonial-example-auto-mechanic-png.webp 1200w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/customer-testimonial-example-auto-mechanic-980x632.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/customer-testimonial-example-auto-mechanic-480x310.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://superiorautoservice.net/testimonial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>People remember stories more than a list of benefits. If someone hears about how your shop helped a stranded driver get back on the road in time for a job interview, that sticks. And when they eventually need car repairs, guess who they’ll think of? Hint: you.</p>
<h4>Give away knowledge and assets</h4>
<p>Some businesses keep their knowledge locked up, so to speak. They’re afraid that customers won’t need them if they reveal too much. But people <em>want</em> to see that you’re an expert.</p>
<p>And the best way to show them? Give them real, valuable insights.</p>
<p>Running that mechanic shop, you already know most car maintenance content out there is predictable. So, offer something people <em>aren’t</em> seeing out there. Maybe a breakdown of how to spot shady repair shops, or an insider’s guide on which warning lights need immediate attention and which ones can wait.</p>
<p>Love free stuff? So does everyone else.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/15/lead-magnet-ideas">downloadable guide</a>, like a DIY road trip safety checklist or a printable maintenance log for tracking oil changes and tire rotations, gives people something practical.</p>
<p>Sharing knowledge doesn’t mean giving away your business. It proves you know your stuff!</p>
<div id="creating-content-consistently"></div>
<h3>Challenge #4: Creating content consistently</h3>
<p>Consistency builds momentum and keeps your audience engaged. But who has time to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-brainstorm-business-ideas">brainstorm content ideas</a> when you’re juggling so many other things?</p>
<p>That’s why you need a plan.</p>
<h4>Develop a schedule and stick to it</h4>
<p>If content is an afterthought for you, it probably won’t happen. So, block out time to plan, create, and post. Or hire someone to do it for you. Whether it’s twice a week or twice a month, consistency matters.</p>
<p>For a juice bar, that could mean every Monday is a post of behind-the-scenes video of your team prepping fresh fruit. Wednesdays are for sharing a customer’s favorite juice order with a fun caption. And on Fridays, you drop a weekend promo.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-plan-template-wordstream-png.webp" alt="content plan template outline from wordstream" width="767" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91237" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-plan-template-wordstream-png.webp 767w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-plan-template-wordstream-480x563.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 767px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Get our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-plan">content plan template</a> to help you get started and stay on track.</em></p>
<h4>Set aside dedicated time for content creation</h4>
<p>There will be times when you’re waiting for a free moment to sit down and work on content, and it never comes.</p>
<p>So, set a time each week to create content in bulk for the future. Make it part of your routine, so it doesn’t feel like another last-minute task.</p>
<h4>Develop a “bank” of ideas and log them as they come to you</h4>
<p>Ever had a great idea for a piece of content, only to forget it in an hour? That’s why you need a bank/library/whatever to save ideas.</p>
<p>Use an app on your phone, a Google spreadsheet, or even a notebook to jot down ideas as they come up. Hearing that more and more customers are raving about your peanut butter acai bowl? Make a note to feature customer favorites.</p>
<p>Before you know it, you’ll have a list saved of content ideas to pick from.</p>
<div id="producing-high-quality-content"></div>
<h3>Challenge #5: Creating high-quality content</h3>
<p>If your content is just a slightly different version of what’s already floating around online, what’s the point? Your goal should be to rise above all the noise, but this is no easy feat&#8211;it’s a top challenge in the content world, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1366088/top-content-marketing-purposes/">per Statista</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s how to create something that’s both useful and high quality:</p>
<h4>Aim to create something better than what’s already out there</h4>
<p>Before you start writing, Google the topic you’re about to cover. What’s ranking? What’s missing from the top-ranking content? Is anything outdated?</p>
<p>If every article about “Why your car won’t start” just lists the usual stuff (dead battery, no gas, etc.), you should go beyond that. Include real customer examples, troubleshooting steps, and when it’s time to call a mechanic.</p>
<p>The more helpful and detailed your content is, the better it will be by comparison.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenge-strong-post-content-example-png.webp" alt="okay vs better content example" width="936" height="247" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91209" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenge-strong-post-content-example-png.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenge-strong-post-content-example-480x127.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Support claims with data and research</h4>
<p>Anyone can say they’re the best mechanic in town, but proving it is what convinces people. So, support your content with real data, stats from trusted sources, and even case studies.</p>
<p>For example, instead of saying, “Tire pressure affects fuel efficiency,” you could say:</p>
<p>“Driving on underinflated tires can <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/files/u/publication/gas-saving_tips.pdf?fbb3c63ad5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower gas mileage by 3%</a>, according to the US Department of Energy. That could cost you an extra $100 a year at the pump.”</p>
<p>Numbers can make your content credible.</p>
<h4>Create detailed outlines for each piece</h4>
<p>Ever start writing an article, only to have no idea where it’s going next? That’s what happens when you don’t have an outline prepared.</p>
<p>Give yourself (or whoever’s writing) some direction. Here are some steps to guide you in putting together a good outline:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research your topic. Collect data, stats, and insights that support your arguments.</li>
<li>Determine the main theme. This will be the foundation of your outline.</li>
<li>Break down the main points you want to cover.</li>
<li>Organize ideas into a hierarchical structure.</li>
<li>Arrange your ideas in a logical order that flows and makes sense.</li>
<li>Fill in supporting details like examples and quotes from reputable sources.</li>
</ul>
<div id="aligning-content-with-the-buyers-journey"></div>
<h3>Challenge #6: Aligning content with the buyer&#8217;s journey</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-the-buyers-journey/">buyer’s journey</a> describes the stages that a person might go through before buying, including awareness, consideration, and decision. It represents the relationship that potential customers have with your business, from learning about you all the way to becoming a customer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/buyers-journey-png.webp" alt="buyers journey graphic" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91210" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/buyers-journey-png.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/buyers-journey-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Some people are just discovering your juice bar for the first time. Others are weighing their options. And some are ready to buy but need a nudge. If you want your content to work, it should meet people where they are.</p>
<h4>Awareness stage</h4>
<p>At this stage, people aren’t searching for your business specifically. They’re looking for a solution to their needs. Maybe they’re Googling things like “best ways to boost energy naturally.”</p>
<p>Your job is to create content that answers these broad questions without pushing a sale. At this stage, your CTA should be light and educational, like “Follow us for more nutrition tips.”</p>
<h4>Consideration stage</h4>
<p>Now, they’re interested. They want a smoothie, but they’re weighing their options. Should they make their own at home or head to a local juice bar? This is where you show what makes your product the best choice.</p>
<p>Your CTA should nudge them forward, like “Check out our menu to find your perfect smoothie.”</p>
<h4>Decision stage</h4>
<p>At this stage, they’re ready to buy. But maybe they need one last reason to choose you. A one-time deal, a convenient option (like online ordering), or a little extra reassurance could do the trick.</p>
<p>No more soft-sell CTAs. This is where you give a push, like “Order now and pick up in 10 minutes!”</p>

<p>Let’s dig deeper into each tip.</p>
<div id="put-together-a-content-strategy"></div>
<h3>1. Put together a content strategy</h3>
<p>Hoping a blog post will have people flocking to your site? That might’ve worked years ago when the web wasn’t saturated with content that’s been done dozens of times over. But in 2025, posting and praying for traction is a waste of time.</p>
<p>You need a plan that keeps your content strategic and different from everything else out there. Here are some ways you can do that.</p>
<h4>Set goals that matter</h4>
<p>Before you write, ask yourself: What’s the point of this content? Are you trying to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/keyword-mapping">rank for a valuable keyword</a> or educate potential customers?</p>
<p>An auto body shop, for instance, might aim to attract local customers by ranking for “best collision repair near me,” while an auto parts retailer might focus on detailed product guides that help people choose the right brake pads. Your goals should define your strategy.</p>
<h4>Know your audience</h4>
<p>Who’s reading your content? And what gets the most engagement? Study <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-pain-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer pain points</a> and look at <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-trends-2025">search trends</a>. See what your competitors’ content might be missing, and address that in your own content.</p>
<p>Use these questions to identify your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/target-audience/">target audience</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who’s buying from you or working with you now?</li>
<li>What are their shopping habits?</li>
<li>What are they buying?</li>
<li>What info are they using to make a buying decision?</li>
<li>Where are they located?</li>
<li>Where are they hanging out online?</li>
<li>Where are they finding you?</li>
<li>When do they interact with your business?</li>
<li>When are they looking for you and your business?</li>
<li>Why are they buying from you?</li>
<li>Why are they buying from your competitors?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Address current industry issues and trends</h4>
<p>There aren’t many industries that are stuck in time. Keeping with the automotive theme, EVs are becoming more popular, and self-driving tech is evolving.</p>
<p>Your content should reflect the trends. If you&#8217;re running a mechanic shop, you could write about how new EVs impact traditional maintenance. Stay ahead of the conversation, and you won’t have to chase engagement.</p>
<h4>Get your timing right</h4>
<p>A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-plan">content calendar</a> lays the foundation for your publishing schedule. No need to scramble for ideas, and you’ve got topics lined up ahead of time. Examples for the mechanic shop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seasonal content: Push winter tire guides in fall, not January.</li>
<li>Local events: If your town has a big car show, create content around prepping a vehicle for display.</li>
<li>Industry happenings: Cover major automotive recalls or tech breakthroughs as they happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s what a content calendar can look like, <a href="https://kantree.io/blog/tips/using-kantree-as-a-content-planning-solution-with-templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">courtesy of Kantree</a>:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/content-calendar-example-png.avif" alt="example of content calendar" width="1040" height="625" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90760" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/content-calendar-example-png.avif 1040w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/content-calendar-example-300x180.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/content-calendar-example-1024x615.avif 1024w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/content-calendar-example-768x462.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/content-calendar-example-980x589.avif 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/content-calendar-example-480x288.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1040px) 100vw, 1040px" /></p>
<div id="focus-on-quality-over-quantity"></div>
<h3>2. Focus on quality over quantity</h3>
<p>People don’t care how much you post–they only care about how good it is. So, if you’re running a travel agency, don’t pump out generic “Top 10 Beaches in the Caribbean” articles that a thousand other sites have already covered. Instead, create something that people can’t find anywhere else.</p>
<h4>Prioritize researched, in-depth content</h4>
<p>Readers want insider knowledge, real experiences, and even some secrets.</p>
<p>Let’s say that travel agency specializes in Jamaica. Instead of writing a listicle about the best things to do in Jamaica, they could cover topics like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hidden Waterfalls in Jamaica That Only Locals Know About</li>
<li>How to Plan a Stress-Free Trip to Jamaica with Kids</li>
<li>The Best Time to Visit Jamaica Based on What You Want to Experience</li>
</ul>
<h4>Aim for evergreen content that will be relevant over time</h4>
<p>A well-written post should be like a great Jamaican rum, getting better over time. Or is that only for wine?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/10/16/guide-to-evergreen-content-marketing">Evergreen content</a> stays relevant long after you hit publish. A guide to all-inclusive resorts in Montego Bay can be timeless, although it may need some updates in the long run. A post about an upcoming festival, on the other hand, is probably only going to be useful leading up to the event.</p>
<p>Focus on creating something that will still provide value next year and beyond.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/first-page-of-google?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_10WaysFirstPageGoogle_Download">10 Tangible &amp; Free Ways to Get on the First Page of Google</a></p>
<div id="meet-the-users-intent"></div>
<h3>3. Meet the user’s intent</h3>
<p>If you’re creating content without thinking about <em>why</em> someone is searching for the topic, you’ll probably miss the mark.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/keyword-search-intent-1-png.avif" alt="different types of keyword intents" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90734" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/keyword-search-intent-1-png.avif 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/keyword-search-intent-1-300x192.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/keyword-search-intent-1-768x492.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/keyword-search-intent-1-480x308.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" /></p>
<p>Take a real estate business in Tampa, FL, for example. If they want to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-differentiate-content">stand out</a>, they can’t just write about homes for sale in Tampa and call it a day. You need to understand exactly what people are looking for and give it to them. And you have to do it better than anyone else if you want to stand out.</p>
<h4>Research some keywords first</h4>
<p>Figure out what your potential readers (and customers) are actually searching for. Tools like Ahrefs, Semrush, and WordStream’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">Free Keyword Tool</a> can help you identify those keywords.</p>
<p>But intent matters too. Maybe even more than search volume.</p>
<p>Take these keywords:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best neighborhoods in Tampa (850 searches/month)</li>
<li>Tampa homes with boat docks (10 searches/month)</li>
</ul>
<p>Which one’s better? Sure, the first one gets more volume. But if you’re targeting people who are ready to buy a waterfront home, that second one is what you want for leads.</p>
<h4>Look at the search engine results</h4>
<p>Once you’ve got a keyword in mind, Google it yourself and look at the results. What’s ranking at the top? Blog posts? Video tours? Market reports?</p>
<p>If listicles rank well, your deep-dive essay might not be the right format. If short, transactional pages are ranking, a 3,000-word guide probably won’t cut it. The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/09/04/content-marketing-goal-alignment">type of content</a> you create should match what users (and Google) expect.</p>
<h4>Address the user’s needs directly</h4>
<p>Imagine a couple relocating from New York, searching for the best areas in Tampa for families. They probably don’t want a basic list. They want information about schools, public transit, etc. Instead of covering the same neighborhoods everyone else has already talked about, go deeper:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which areas have the best schools?</li>
<li>What’s the average home price in each neighborhood?</li>
<li>What’s the vibe: quiet suburban or walkable city streets?</li>
<li>What do actual residents say?</li>
<li>What are the commute times to downtown?</li>
</ul>
<div id="zig-when-everyone-else-zags"></div>
<h3>4. Zig when everyone else zags</h3>
<p>There’s a ton of cookie-cutter content out there. Not to mention a surge of AI-generated fluff.</p>
<p>Search “best things to do in Jamaica,” and you’ll see the same recycled list–Dunn’s River Falls, Seven Mile Beach, etc. These are great spots, no doubt (I’ve visited). But if everyone is writing about the same stuff, why would someone choose to read your content over the others?</p>
<p>If you want to stand out, offer something different. Challenge the status quo and people will pay attention.</p>
<p>Instead of writing another “Top 10 Attractions in Jamaica” article, try “5 Hidden Gems in Jamaica You Won’t Find on Tourist Maps.” Highlight real insider locations, like a peacock farm or a squeezed juice shack with no website.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/unique-content-idea-example-jamaica-png.avif" alt="example of unique content idea for visiting jamaica" width="1200" height="297" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90761" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/unique-content-idea-example-jamaica-png.avif 1200w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/unique-content-idea-example-jamaica-300x74.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/unique-content-idea-example-jamaica-1024x253.avif 1024w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/unique-content-idea-example-jamaica-768x190.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/unique-content-idea-example-jamaica-1080x267.avif 1080w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/unique-content-idea-example-jamaica-980x243.avif 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/unique-content-idea-example-jamaica-480x119.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Bring a fresh angle or a perspective that only <em>you</em> can provide. People associate Jamaica with white sand beaches and reggae. Try something intriguing, like what nobody tells you about visiting Jamaica during hurricane season.</p>
<div id="craft-compelling-headlines-and-introductions"></div>
<h3>5. Craft compelling headlines and introductions</h3>
<p>If your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/headline-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">headline</a> doesn’t stop people in their tracks, it’s not helping your content stand out. Your page could be a goldmine of helpful information, but if nobody clicks, then nobody’s reading it.</p>
<p>See the difference for a mechanic shop:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-bad-headline-png.avif" alt="difference between good vs boring headline" width="936" height="189" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90739" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-bad-headline-png.avif 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-bad-headline-300x61.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-bad-headline-768x155.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-bad-headline-480x97.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" /></p>
<p>A headline that stands out isn’t just descriptive. It taps into curiosity or urgency makes people want to click (without baiting).</p>
<p>Tactics to try:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use numbers</strong>, like “7 Signs Your Brakes Are About to Fail”</li>
<li><strong>Create curiosity gaps</strong>, like “The One Oil Change Mistake That Could Ruin Your Engine”</li>
<li><strong>Promise a transformation</strong>, like “How to Make Your Car Last 200,000 Miles Without Costly Repairs”</li>
<li><strong>Use </strong><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/trigger-words/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>trigger words</strong></a> to spark an emotional reaction, like these.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, someone clicks to your page. Now what?</p>
<p>Hook readers with an introduction that pulls them in. Don’t let them hit the back button before they reach the good stuff!</p>
<p>You could start with a relatable problem, use a vivid scenario, or make a promise. Or some combination of these.</p>
<p>See the difference:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-introduction-png.avif" alt="good vs boring introduction in stand out content" width="936" height="330" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90740" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-introduction-png.avif 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-introduction-300x106.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-introduction-768x271.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-introduction-480x169.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" /></p>
<div id="make-your-content-scannable-and-visually-appealing"></div>
<h3>6. Make your content scannable and visually appealing</h3>
<p>People like to skim and scan. They’re looking for quick answers, takeaways, and visuals to illustrate concepts. If your content is a wall of words, it’s overwhelming and not very inviting.</p>
<p>To keep readers engaged, structure your content so they can find what they need fast. Here are a few tips to do that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use headings and subheadings:</strong> These guide the reader and make the content easy to skim. Not everyone will read your page from beginning to end.</li>
<li><strong>Use bullet points and numbered lists: </strong>These highlight bite-size bits of information and keep attention from drifting. They make step-by-step instructions clear.</li>
<li><strong>Keep paragraphs short: </strong>If your paragraphs are longer than 3-4 lines, consider breaking them up. Nobody wants to sift through walls of text to find something.</li>
</ul>
<p>Us humans, we’re visual creatures. We process images <a href="https://medtechintelligence.com/column/the-power-of-visuals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60,000</a> times faster than text. So, if you’re only using words, you’re missing an opportunity to stand out.</p>
<p>For example, this is an ad but still illustrates the point. The visual is easier to process than a bunch of text explaining how to wear a face mask properly.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/visually-appealing-ad-example-png.avif" alt="example of visually appealing yet informative ad" width="664" height="376" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90762" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/visually-appealing-ad-example-png.avif 664w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/visually-appealing-ad-example-300x170.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/visually-appealing-ad-example-480x272.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px" /></p>
<p>Try these to make your content more appealing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Images: </strong>A well-placed photo or diagram can reinforce your point or provide more context to the topic.</li>
<li><strong>Infographics:</strong> If you’ve got a bunch of data points to share, show them in a graphic.</li>
<li><strong>Videos:</strong> If a video can explain it better than text, use one. Plus, some people prefer video over other formats.</li>
</ul>
<div id="include-data-and-expert-insights"></div>
<h3>7. Include data and expert insights</h3>
<p>Anyone can just make a claim. But backing it up with cited facts and expert opinions will turn your content into a resource that people trust.</p>
<p>Data gives your claims real weight. Instead of vague statements, say something concrete like this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-claim-png.avif" alt="good vs boring claim in stand out content writing" width="936" height="229" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90741" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-claim-png.avif 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-claim-300x73.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-claim-768x188.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-claim-480x117.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" /></p>
<p>The more specific you can get, the better. If you’re writing about the best Tampa neighborhoods for first-time buyers, show stats about affordability.</p>
<p>Know what makes your content even more credible? Expert opinions.</p>
<p>Give readers insights they can’t get from run-of-the-mill articles. If you’re a real estate agent, ask a mortgage broker to help you out with some firsthand knowledge to make your content unique.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-statement-png.avif" alt="good vs boring statement in content writing" width="936" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90742" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-statement-png.avif 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-statement-300x118.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-statement-768x301.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-statement-480x188.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" /></p>
<div id="tell-a-story"></div>
<h3>8. Tell a story</h3>
<p>Facts and stats add credibility. If you want to take it a step further so your content <em>really</em> sticks, tell a story. Research shows that personal stories and gossip make up about <a href="https://www.soocial.com/storytelling-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">65%</a> of our conversations. It’s how we connect.</p>
<p>So, make your content memorable by weaving in real anecdotes. <a href="https://www.blog.thebrandshopbw.com/brand-storytelling-statistics-and-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55%</a> of consumers are more likely to remember a story than a list of facts.</p>
<p>Don’t just say that Dunn’s River Falls is a must-visit in Jamaica. Bring things to life with a real experience to make your content feel human. And when people connect with you, they trust you.</p>
<p>You can also weave in stories and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/19/customer-testimonial-examples">testimonials from customers</a>. These build trust with readers and make your content more compelling. Instead of just listing the perks of staying at a luxury resort, you could also tell the story of a past customer.</p>

<div id="try-different-content-formats"></div>
<h3>9. Try different content formats</h3>
<p>If you’re only publishing blog posts, you’re leaving potential traffic and conversions on the table. People consume content in different ways–some love reading an in-depth article, while others prefer a quick video.</p>
<p>If you want to stand out, experiment with different formats and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/03/repurposing-content">repurpose your content across multiple platforms</a>.</p>
<p>Some topics work best in written form, while others need a visual touch. Mix up your content game with blog posts, videos, infographics, downloadable assets, and more.</p>
<p>Don’t just create once and move on, though. Smart marketers repurpose their content across different channels. You could…</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn a blog post into a video script and post it on YouTube.</li>
<li>Break down key points into LinkedIn posts.</li>
<li>Convert original research into an infographic.</li>
<li>Take highlights from an expert interview and create a podcast clip.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all content formats perform equally, though.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/blogging-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bloggers who produce strong results</a>, the most effective formats are roundups, infographics, and original research. Try some of these, see what gets the best engagement, and do more of that.</p>

<div id="be-giving"></div>
<h3>10. Be giving</h3>
<p>Some businesses don’t want to reveal how they do things. They don’t want to reveal their secrets. But customers don’t want to guess whether you know your stuff or not. They want to see proof.</p>
<p>And the best way to prove it?</p>
<p>“Give away” your best tips and tricks. If you run a mechanic shop, don’t post the same generic car maintenance advice everyone else does. Share insider knowledge, especially if your competitors aren’t talking about it. Impress your readers!</p>
<p>Give people something they won’t find in every other auto blog. You might create something like “How to Tell If a Mechanic Is Overcharging You, Straight from an Honest Mechanic.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mechanic-advice-video-png.avif" alt="mechanic advice video" width="2162" height="628" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90764" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mechanic-advice-video-png.avif 2162w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mechanic-advice-video-300x87.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mechanic-advice-video-1024x297.avif 1024w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mechanic-advice-video-768x223.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mechanic-advice-video-1536x446.avif 1536w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mechanic-advice-video-2048x595.avif 2048w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mechanic-advice-video-1080x314.avif 1080w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mechanic-advice-video-1280x372.avif 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mechanic-advice-video-980x285.avif 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mechanic-advice-video-480x139.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 2162px) 100vw, 2162px" /></p>
<p>Also, who doesn’t like free stuff?</p>
<p>Offering a downloadable checklist or ebook can leave a lasting impression. That mechanic shop could create a printable tire pressure and oil change log for customers to track their maintenance.</p>

<div id="promote-and-distribute-your-content"></div>
<h3>11. Promote and distribute your content</h3>
<p>You’re done once you hit publish. No matter how great your content is, you still need to distribute it to the world if you want to stand out.</p>
<p>Meet your audience where they are. Promote your content across multiple channels, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social media:</strong> Don’t just share the link and call it a day. Turn key points into LinkedIn posts or Instagram carousels.</li>
<li><strong>Email newsletters:</strong> Share the new content in your next email with a compelling hook. Give readers a reason to click.</li>
<li><strong>Online communities:</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reddit-marketing">Reddit</a>, Facebook groups, and Quora can be great for sharing helpful content if you’re not spammy about it. Answer questions and link to your content if it adds value.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborations:</strong> Have connections in your industry? See if a complementary business will share your content with its audience.</li>
</ul>
<h2>So, do you want to your content to perform better?</h2>
<p>Content in 2025 needs to break through the noise. If you’re saying the same things as everyone else, you’ll be shouting into the void.</p>
<p>But if you prioritize quality over quantity and offer something that’s truly unique, that’s when people pay attention.</p>
<p>Be bold. Be different. And most importantly, be helpful.</p>

<h2>What is AI referral traffic (and why it matters)</h2>
<p>AI referral traffic is any traffic driven by an AI tool or platform. This includes ChatGPT, Perplexity, or any other platforms we mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>As more people use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/chatgpt-search" rel="noopener">AI search engines</a> to find information, and as more AI search engines pop up, you have the opportunity to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drive traffic</a> from those searches.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ai-referral-traffic-example-chatgpt-png.webp" alt="example of chatgpt search with referral traffic potential" width="1200" height="876" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90002" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ai-referral-traffic-example-chatgpt-png.webp 1200w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ai-referral-traffic-example-chatgpt-980x715.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ai-referral-traffic-example-chatgpt-480x350.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw" /></p>

<h2>6 ways to get more referral traffic from AI search</h2>
<p>Try these tips to see more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/11/29/referral-traffic" rel="noopener">referral traffic</a> from AI search to your website.</p>
<div id="make-it-easy-for-ai-crawlers"></div>
<h3>1. Make it easy for AI crawlers to find content on your site</h3>
<p>AI crawlers (or spiders) sift through an endless supply of pages on the web, trying to match users with the most relevant content. If your site is slow or hard to navigate, you’re basically presenting crawlers (and users, for that matter) with a mess.</p>
<p>Here’s how to make it easy:</p>
<h4>Improve page speed and mobile friendliness</h4>
<p>Page speed is a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/09/google-ranking-factors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google ranking factor</a>, so your site needs to load fast for Google. But it should also be fast for AI. Crawlers are built to scan and summarize content quickly, and there’s a chance they might time out and not fully crawl everything if your site is slow.</p>
<p>Google’s <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Page Speed Insights</a> tool makes it easy to see how fast your pages load and what elements can be addressed. Simply plug in the URL of the page you want speed insights for and get results in just seconds.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/pagespeed-insights-tool-example-results-png.webp" alt="example report for google pagespeed insights tool" width="1200" height="853" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90003" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/pagespeed-insights-tool-example-results-png.webp 1200w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/pagespeed-insights-tool-example-results-980x697.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/pagespeed-insights-tool-example-results-480x341.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Some quick fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compress images with tools like <a href="https://tinyjpg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TinyPNG</a> or <a href="https://squoosh.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Squoosh</a></li>
<li>Try using lazy loading</li>
<li>Use a content delivery network (CDN) to speed up load times globally</li>
<li>Eliminate unnecessary plugins and scripts. If your site is running five different tracking codes, it might be time to clean things up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your site also needs to be mobile-friendly, and the most common way to achieve this is through responsive web design. A responsive site automatically adjusts your page sizes, layout, button types, and more to work better on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Plus, AI search is built to answer questions on the go, whether someone’s using voice search in a car or scrolling through results on their phone. If and when you show up in AI search results, you don’t want visitors to arrive at a clunky design.</p>
<h4>Use internal links for optimal crawlability and discoverability</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/04/internal-linking" rel="noopener">Internal links</a> connect different pages of your website, making it easier for AI crawlers to navigate between them. These links also help the crawlers find all the content on your site. If a page exists without any links pointing to it (i.e., it’s an orphan page), a crawler might not see it.</p>
<p>You can add internal links in your navigation, footers, within each piece of content, and in other places.</p>
<p>As the crawlers move through your site, they collect more information about your content that influences whether or not you’ll be mentioned and listed in AI results. Internal links have great benefits for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/27/seo-metrics" rel="noopener">SEO performance</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/how-web-crawlers-work-png.webp" alt="graphic showing how web crawlers work" width="676" height="510" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90004" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/how-web-crawlers-work-png.webp 676w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/how-web-crawlers-work-480x362.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 676px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>A well-linked site helps AI understand the relationships between your content, making it easier for the platforms to cite your pages when users search topics related to your site.</p>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Make sure you can reach any page of your site in three clicks or fewer from any other page. One way to do this is through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/topic-clusters-for-local-seo">topic clusters</a>.</p>
<div id="target-conversational-queries"></div>
<h3>2. Target conversational queries</h3>
<p><a href="https://backlinko.com/google-keyword-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">91%</a> of all search queries are considered long tail, or conversational. Sure, people still search broad terms like “garden hoses.” But with AI, people talk to it like they would a friend, asking questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s the best garden hose that won’t kink?</li>
<li>Which hose is best for a big backyard?</li>
</ul>
<p>Tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Copilot can generate ideas and variations of how users ask about a topic. Even though these don’t have actual search data (like volume or intent), the ideas can still be worth considering since they come from AI itself–the very place you want to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/offset-lower-website-traffic">get traffic</a> from.</p>
<p>For example, instead of targeting just “garden hoses” in your content, ask an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency">AI tool</a> to provide questions and conversational phrases about the topic. You might get responses like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s the best garden hose for water pressure?</li>
<li>Which garden hose lasts the longest?</li>
<li>What size hose do I need for my yard?</li>
</ul>
<p>AI search engines will return clear, direct answers in response to conversational queries. So, your page content should do the same.</p>
<p>Also consider the “People also ask” (PAA) section in Google results for more ideas. Google practically hands you a roadmap to conversational search. The PAA section lists related questions you can use and answer in your content.</p>
<p>As an example, when I search “garden hoses,” this is what the PAA section shows. And when I click on a question, even more questions will appear at the bottom of the list.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/people-also-ask-results-garden-hoses-png.webp" alt="example of people also ask results for garden hoses query" width="903" height="286" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90005" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/people-also-ask-results-garden-hoses-png.webp 903w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/people-also-ask-results-garden-hoses-480x152.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 903px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>3. Improve the E-E-A-T signals of your content</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://www.seerinteractive.com/insights/what-drives-brand-mentions-in-ai-answers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seer Interactive study</a> about what drives brand visibility in AI answers showed that brands ranking on the first page of Google have a strong correlation.</p>
<p>And when they filtered the data to focus on solution-oriented websites, there was an even stronger correlation, proving that quality content is important.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/llm-mentions-by-serp-factor-seer-study-png.webp" alt="seer study results showing correlation of LLM mentions by serp factor" width="996" height="549" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90006" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/llm-mentions-by-serp-factor-seer-study-png.webp 996w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/llm-mentions-by-serp-factor-seer-study-980x540.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/llm-mentions-by-serp-factor-seer-study-480x265.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 996px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.seerinteractive.com/insights/what-drives-brand-mentions-in-ai-answers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>What does that mean for you?</p>
<p>To <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/05/chatgpt-seo">rank high in search engines</a>, and thus appear in AI search, your content needs to be the most reliable, well-supported option for the topic. And this is where <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/14/google-e-e-a-t" rel="noopener">E-E-A-T</a> comes in: Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. These are the guidelines Google uses to evaluate content quality.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/google-eeat.webp" alt="definition of google e-eat" width="918" height="580" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90007" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/google-eeat.webp 918w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/google-eeat-480x303.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 918px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Thin, basic content doesn’t cut it. AI search prioritizes content that fully answers someone’s query.</p>
<p>Let’s say you sell project management software, and you’re creating a comparison piece titled “Top 10 Project Management Tools.” Instead of just listing the tools with a description and price for each, you should aim to stand out by putting together helpful, in-depth information that’s backed by data and reputable sources.</p>
<p>For the article, you could improve its E-E-A-T signals by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Including side-by-side feature comparisons (e.g., how the tools stack up for workflow automation).</li>
<li>Sharing common pitfalls to avoid, like failing to onboard your team properly.</li>
<li>Tailoring recommendations for freelancers, startups, and enterprises.</li>
<li>Using stats with cited sources.</li>
<li>Quoting industry experts.</li>
<li>Referencing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/03/how-to-write-a-case-study">case studies</a> to back up claims.</li>
<li>Using images and videos to support concepts.</li>
</ul>
<div id="earn-more-brand-mentions"></div>
<h3>4. Earn more brand mentions on the web</h3>
<p><a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stephen Wolfram wrote</a> that ChatGPT “looks for things that in a certain sense match in meaning.” It’s trained based on what it has learned from the web.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/how-can-my-brand-appear-in-answers-from-chatgpt-perplexity-gemini-and-other-ai-llm-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rand Fishkin of SparkToro created a video</a> about large language models (LLMs) using mentions as their currency.</p>
<p>So, to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/10/link-building-secrets">get links</a> and traffic from LLMs, you need to get your brand mentioned on sites that cover topics related to your business. You want to signal to AI that you’re a notable brand in your space.</p>
<p>If you sell project management software, Google some of your target keywords and see what ranks. Reach out to those sites to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engage with industry blogs and media. Get featured in “Top 10” roundups and sponsored features.</li>
<li>Collaborate with well-known project management experts on webinars, podcasts, or guest blog posts.</li>
<li>Cross-promote with complementary brands. Team up with a time-tracking app or collaboration tool.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Optimize for featured snippets and AI Overviews</h3>
<p>If your content is a wall of text, it’s like handing over a puzzle with missing pieces. But if you break things up with clear headings, short paragraphs, and easy-to-read lists, you’re basically spoon-feeding the AI exactly what it wants to show users.</p>
<p>Look at the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-overviews-breaking-search">AI Overview</a> for the query “What size hose do I need for my yard?” It’s all bite-sized information with headings and lists. You can’t argue that it’s not organized. Or not straight to the point.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ai-overview-result-garden-hose-png.webp" alt="ai overview for search around garden hoses" width="876" height="845" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90008" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ai-overview-result-garden-hose-png.webp 876w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ai-overview-result-garden-hose-480x463.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 876px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here’s how to optimize for those kinds of results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Answer the intent of the query without any fluff. AI is going to concisely give users the information they want, so you should too. Get to the point right away.</li>
<li>Use H1s, H2s, and H3s properly. Your main heading (H1) should set the stage, while subheadings (H2s and H3s) break content into logical sections. You can even go H4 and beyond if the content is deep enough to warrant that.</li>
<li>Put sets of bite-sized information in bullet points, like this very set you’re reading now.</li>
<li>Put sequences and steps into numbered lists.</li>
</ul>
<p>By structuring your content with AI crawlers in mind, you’re increasing the odds of getting featured in AI-driven results and attracting human visitors to your site.</p>

<h3>6. Adapt your content strategy for specific AI platforms</h3>
<p>Pay attention to <em>how</em> the various AI platforms respond and <em>what</em> they respond with. Tailor your content to those characteristics.</p>
<p>For example, when I start searching on Perplexity, it provides auto-suggestions. And when I search “project management for,” this is what comes up:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/perplexity-auto-suggestions-example-png.webp" alt="auto suggestion example on perplexity" width="675" height="521" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90009" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/perplexity-auto-suggestions-example-png.webp 675w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/perplexity-auto-suggestions-example-480x370.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 675px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you’re <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/target-audience-examples">targeting certain types of businesses</a>, this can be a goldmine of ideas to create content around. Experiment with your target keywords to see what comes up.</p>
<p>Perplexity also produces related questions at the very end of its responses. You could create content that answers these exact questions. These are the questions that appeared at the end of “project management for engineers:&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/perplexity-related-questions-example-png.webp" alt="example of related questions on perplexity search" width="658" height="296" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90010" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/perplexity-related-questions-example-png.webp 658w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/perplexity-related-questions-example-480x216.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 658px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As another example, take ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Chris Long of Go Fish Digital <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chris-long-marketing_seo-tip-take-the-queries-youre-tracking-activity-7288185314395725824-ya_0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared a post on LinkedIn</a>, suggesting you search your target keywords in ChatGPT (one at a time) to see which ones trigger the search function.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/search-function-triggered-on-chatgpt.webp" alt="example of query where search function was triggered on chatgpt" width="1280" height="1972" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90011" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/search-function-triggered-on-chatgpt.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/search-function-triggered-on-chatgpt-980x1510.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/search-function-triggered-on-chatgpt-480x740.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1280px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chris-long-marketing_seo-tip-take-the-queries-youre-tracking-activity-7288185314395725824-ya_0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Once you learn which ones trigger a search response (as opposed to chat), look at the type of results. Are they listicles? Are they comparison pieces?</p>
<p>Take inspiration from what’s there and build a strategy to optimize for those on your site.</p>

<h2>How to track site traffic from AI search</h2>
<p>Naturally, you should monitor the traffic you get from AI to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which platforms bring you the most traffic.</li>
<li>The types of content that are most effective for getting AI traffic.</li>
<li>The topics generate the best quality AI traffic–look at conversions, time on site, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/17/ga4-features-for-advertisers">GA4</a>, here’s how to identify traffic from a few of the platforms:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tracking-generative-ai-traffic-ga4-png.webp" alt="chart showing generative ai tracking in ga4" width="1429" height="1143" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90012" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tracking-generative-ai-traffic-ga4-png.webp 1429w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tracking-generative-ai-traffic-ga4-1280x1024.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tracking-generative-ai-traffic-ga4-980x784.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tracking-generative-ai-traffic-ga4-480x384.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1429px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.seerinteractive.com/insights/are-ai-sites-like-chatgpt-sending-your-website-traffic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>I recommend creating a custom channel group, which will allow you to easily compare data against other channels like organic search, direct, etc.</p>

<p>And then you can break things down from there, by source (AI platform), by landing page, etc.</p>

<h2>Start driving more AI referral traffic</h2>
<p>This will likely include a bit of trial and error. Figure out what’s most effective for your site in bringing in AI traffic (and eventually <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-lead-generation">leads</a>), and then do more of that.</p>
<p>While organic and paid traffic from search engines like Google aren’t going anywhere, it doesn’t hurt to incorporate some of these tactics into your strategy to help you capture traffic from these often-used AI tools (and keep up with how Google continues to expand <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-mode">AI use in results</a>).</p>
