<h2>What are the benefits of an AI tool for your marketing agency?</h2>
<p>Every <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/pay-per-click-agency">marketing agency</a> can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-in-marketing">use AI</a> to its advantage. Here are a few ways it can help yours.</p>
<h3>Brainstorm ideas</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-ai-tools">AI writing tools</a> and search engines can spark new ideas for your marketing content and campaigns.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/08/chatgpt-prompts">Prompt an AI tool</a> with questions like, “What are 20 B2B pain points companies face in the [input] industry?”. Or try, “Give me 50 campaign ideas to attract new customers in the [input] industry.”</p>
<p>While you have to verify accuracy and weigh different ideas, it’s a great starting point to get in a creative flow.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency-wordstream-prompt.webp" alt="AI tools for marketing agency: Screenshot of a prompt and response from ChatGPT." width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-80946 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency-wordstream-prompt.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency-wordstream-prompt-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>In this example, I type a question into ChatGPT, and it gives me 20 blog topic ideas to help brainstorm future articles.</em></p>
<h3>Automate repetitive tasks</h3>
<p>AI <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-digital-marketing-agency">marketing agency</a> tools help reduce predictable tasks. Whether hitting publish or transferring an inbound marketing piece to WordPress, you can save hours with efficient automation.</p>
<p>You can save precious hours you would have spent doing grunt work and instead use them to strengthen your marketing strategy and produce more materials.</p>
<h3>Reach new markets</h3>
<p>AI platforms can identify <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/04/customer-segmentation-models">audience segments</a> you hadn’t thought of before. You can also reach more markets by automating your process and easily repurposing different content mediums for new platforms.</p>
<p>Many opportunities exist to reach new markets with impressive research and content creation tools.</p>
<h3>Reduce avoidable human error</h3>
<p>Using the power of machine learning and AI, marketing AI tools can identify and correct errors before your clients see them.</p>
<p>A tool like Grammarly, for example, can correct grammar and spelling errors and improve phrasing automatically. AI is a great option that helps the marketing team be more productive while avoiding common issues.</p>
<h3>Save on costs</h3>
<p>Whether you need to save on production value with videos or crank out first drafts of social media content, there are plenty of areas where you can save time, labor, and money on daily marketing tasks.</p>
<p>That gives you and your team more time and energy to focus on the most essential, important tasks.</p>
<p>Now that we know the benefits of AI marketing agency tools, let’s review some of the best ones.</p>

<h2>Top AI tools for your marketing agency</h2>
<p>Most AI marketing tools are built for a specific purpose, like writing new copy or automating a workflow. That’s how we’ve categorized this list, based on the primary challenge each tool tackles.</p>
<div id="AI-tools-for-content-creation"></div>
<h3>AI tools for content and copy creation</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-copywriting-tools">AI copywriting tools</a> have received the most spotlight in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/24/technology/ai-technology-progress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent years</a>. That’s helped fuel the creation of innovative <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/05/generative-ai-in-digital-marketing">generative AI</a> tools with a growing list of useful features.</p>
<p>Since content isn’t all copy, we’ve included platforms that help you create and edit video and image assets, too.</p>
<h4>1. ChatGPT</h4>
<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT-3.5</a> and ChatGPT-4 (Open AI continues to create new versions) have led the AI writing craze by offering one of the most accessible copywriting tools.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency-wordstream-chatgpt.webp" alt="AI tools for marketing agency - ChatGPT homescreen. " width="870" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-80947 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency-wordstream-chatgpt.webp 870w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency-wordstream-chatgpt-480x331.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 870px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://chat.openai.com/auth/login" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>The platform is excellent for brainstorming. If you’re working on an email newsletter, social media campaign, or blog article, you can ask for ideas, outlines, lists, and many other starter materials to help you save time.</p>
<p>Some marketing agencies use it for content development, though there are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/28/ai-for-marketing">risks in trusting</a> its accuracy. Plus, the output often feels “AI-written.” But it’s a great trusty sidekick to get projects started and boost your marketing efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> ChatGPT-3.5 is free to use, ChatGPT-4 starts at $20 per month.</p>
<h4>2. Jasper</h4>
<p><a href="http://jasper.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jasper</a> is another great AI writing solution built for teams and creative workflows.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency-wordstream-jasper.webp" alt="AI tools for marketing agency - Jasper homescreen." width="847" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-80948 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency-wordstream-jasper.webp 847w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency-wordstream-jasper-480x340.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 847px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.jasper.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>You can efficiently work with the platform for quick project creation and execution. The tool offers <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-prompts-for-social-media">prompts</a> and automates the “human” part of AI writing by incorporating your brand voice.</p>
<p>The tool also helps you write more factually (compared to ChatGPT) and on-brand.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Plans start at $59 a month (billed annually).</p>
<h4>3. Copy.ai</h4>
<p>An alternative to Jasper, <a href="http://copy.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Copy.ai</a> helps marketing teams automate blog briefs, create copy (like scraping URLs for AI ad copy), and accelerate other writing tasks.</p>

<p>Copy.ai has many prompts and tools to help guide your writing queries for better results.</p>

<h4>4. LocaliQ&#8217;s Google Ads AI Copy Tool</h4>

<p>With this AI tool, you can pick between numerous “Breeze Agents”—think of them as chatbots specialized in specific departments—to automate particular workflows. For example, the Content Agent is useful for generating and repurposing landing pages, blog posts, or any other type of content.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Social Media Agent streamlines social media management-related tasks. It can deliver content and ideal posting time suggestions, generate network-specific posts, and even suggest social campaign ideas based on your business details and previous social performance.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing: </strong>You can get started with Breeze AI for free.</p>
<h4>12. Wordable</h4>
<p>Transferring content from Google Docs to a CMS like WordPress can take thousands of hours and dollars. Between formatting posts and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-content-beginners-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimizing them for SEO</a>, publishing content is a huge time sink. <a href="https://wordable.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wordable</a> does it in one click.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency-wordstream-wordable.webp" alt="AI tools for marketing agency - Wordable home screen." width="936" height="553" class="aligncenter wp-image-80956 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency-wordstream-wordable.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency-wordstream-wordable-480x284.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://zapier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>It works by connecting different platforms with APIs so they work together. If you start a new Word doc for each client project, then create an event in Asana, and generate a bill in an accounting tool, Zapier will link those platforms so it all happens as soon as you create the Word doc.</p>
