										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>If you’re aiming to drive exceptional results with digital marketing in 2024, Facebook is highly likely to play a pivotal role in your plans. </span></p>
<p><span>That’s no surprise—Facebook is a certified advertising powerhouse. The platform attracts <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 3 billion</a> monthly active users, and research suggests that Facebook often delivers the <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/hubspot-blog-marketing-industry-trends-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest ROI</a> among all social media networks.</span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/facebook-ads-trends-statistics.jpg" alt="facebook ads trends - facebook stats callout" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-79167 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/facebook-ads-trends-statistics.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/facebook-ads-trends-statistics-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>

<h2>4 key Facebook ads trends to watch in 2024</h2>
<p><span>We know Facebook is one of the best <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/best-advertising-platforms/">advertising platforms available</a>. So before we share some golden advice for creating high-performing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-objectives">Facebook ads in 2024</a>, let’s take a look at four Facebook ad trends that will have a big impact on the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> social media marketing</a> world.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4ca.png" alt="📊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Find more Facebook ads info specific to your industry with our new <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteFBBenchmarks.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_FBBenchmarks_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Ads Benchmarks</a> report!</p>
<h3>1. Influencer marketing will continue to evolve and expand</h3>
<p><span><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/digital-marketing/influencer-marketing-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Influencer marketing</a> has been hugely popular with social media advertisers for a long time, and it’s easy to see why.  </span></p>
<p><span>By partnering with the right influencer, you can instantly connect with a pre-built audience of highly engaged customers. Not only that, but you can also rapidly build authority and credibility for your products by creating high-quality, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/04/unique-blog-ideas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">authentic content</a>. </span></p>
<p>That said, the top <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ads-brand-suitability-controls">Facebook ad</a> trend for 2024 is that influencer marketing will be adopted by many more Facebook advertisers, from punchy small businesses to global corporations.</p>
<p><span>Why? </span></p>
<p><span>Well, for one thing, influencer marketing is undeniably effective. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/insights/grow-brand-awareness-and-sales-with-influencer-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">84%</a> of global consumers say they’d purchase a product based on influencer content, while Facebook campaigns that combine regular ads and influencer ads are <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/insights/grow-brand-awareness-and-sales-with-influencer-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">85% more likely</a> to drive users to add products to their shopping baskets. </span></p>
<p>However, the real key for 2024 is the rise of the micro-influencer.</p>
<p><span>Many brands may previously have dismissed influencer partnerships because they assumed they were too expensive, but micro-influencers enable marketers to enjoy all of the benefits of macro-influencers without the excessive costs. </span></p>
<p><span>Micro-influencers may attract smaller followings, but they’re often highly respected in very specific niches. While a global perfume brand may find success with a celebrity influencer, a business selling accounting software will probably benefit from a more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-targeting">targeted</a> approach. </span></p>
<p><span>Data shows that smaller influencers deliver <a href="https://www.spiralytics.com/blog/micro-influencers-statistics/#:~:text=Market%20Share,from%2089%25%20to%2091%25." target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher engagement rates</a> than mega-influencers across social channels, and 82% of consumers claim they’d follow recommendations given by micro-influencers. </span></p>
<p><span>If you’ve previously avoided influencer marketing on Facebook because of the costs, 2024 is your opportunity to build credibility and generate sales with strategic micro-influencer partnerships.</span></p>

<h3>2. AI-powered Facebook Messenger experiences will be adopted at scale</h3>
<p><span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/28/ai-for-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artificial intelligence (AI) for marketing</a> has been making waves in recent years. <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/ai-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI statistics</a> show that over <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/social-media-trends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80%</a> of marketers and advertisers are already using AI tools. </span></p>
<p>If you’re not<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/05/generative-ai-in-digital-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> incorporating AI</a> into your Facebook strategy next year, you’re missing out on fantastic opportunities for customer engagement, chat support, and lead generation. In fact, <span><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/chatbot-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chatbot statistics</a> show that chatbots are equipped to handle <a href="https://www.demandsage.com/chatbot-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70%</a> of customer conversations, and 55% of businesses generate more sales when they utilize chatbot solutions.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/13/chatbot-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI-powered chatbots </a></span><span>implemented through Facebook Messenger, for example, can be incredibly powerful for any business. </span></p>
<p><span>While all of this may sound pretty futuristic, AI technology has never been more accessible for Facebook advertisers. Facebook ads <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/09/introducing-ai-powered-assistants-characters-and-creative-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently announced</a> an &#8220;AI Studio&#8221; that will allow businesses to create their own AI applications, and there are plenty of third-party tools that can help you launch Facebook chatbots in a matter of minutes. </span></p>
<p>Below are a few different ways that you can utilize AI-powered Facebook chatbots in 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><strong><span>Improve customer engagement. </span></strong><span>Chatbots can respond to customer requests immediately, guiding users through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/24/faq-page">FAQs</a> and providing them with instant answers. </span></li>
<li><span> </span><strong><span>Scale up chat support. </span></strong><span>Facebook chatbots can deal with a huge volume of customer requests, meaning you can allocate human resources more effectively. </span></li>
<li><span> </span><strong><span>Generate quality leads. </span></strong><span>You can use chatbots to gather customer information and qualify leads, which can be hugely beneficial to your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/11/28/facebook-ads-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook ads conversion rates</a>. </span></li>
<li><span> </span><strong><span>Cross-platform integration. </span></strong><span>Chatbots can be integrated with various e-commerce and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/09/crm-for-small-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CRM platforms</a>, which helps you build a seamless marketing strategy.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>By leveraging the power of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-copywriting-tools">artificial intelligence</a> in 2024, you can dramatically improve customer experiences, strengthen brand loyalty, and increase sales through <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/lead-generation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lead generation</a> and automated upselling.</span></p>

<h3>3. Ecommerce will integrate even more closely with Facebook and Instagram</h3>
<p><span>Social media is no longer just about content and communication. Platforms like Facebook are a direct getaway to online shopping, which is a game-changer for ecommerce brands. </span></p>
<p><span>Ecommerce features on Facebook have been rapidly evolving in recent years, from mobile-first <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/announcing-facebook-shops" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Shops</a> to sales-focused <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1362234537597370" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advantage+ campaigns</a>. Online shopping is now central to the Facebook experience, and this trend will inevitably continue in 2024.</span></p>
<p><span>It’s estimated that <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/facebook-statistics/#Facebook_shopping_stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">37%</a> of Facebook users made a purchase through the platform in 2023—and when you consider <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/31/facebook-audience-targeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the scale of the Facebook audience</a>, the opportunity for ecommerce brands becomes clear. Consumers want to enjoy convenient and fast shopping experiences, and Facebook allows users to discover, view, and purchase products in a matter of clicks. </span></p>
<p>So what does this mean for digital marketers on Facebook this year?</p>
<p><span>Well, establishing a strong shopping presence on Facebook is no longer optional for ecommerce businesses—it’s mandatory for success. If you want to maximize sales in 2024, make sure that you’re delivering a seamless customer experience on Facebook with shoppable ads, convenient ordering options, and product-led campaigns. </span></p>
<p><span>Rather than treating your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/16/facebook-business-page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook business page</a> and website catalog as separate entities, think about how you can connect the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/19/customer-journey-map-templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> customer journey</a> and open as many consumer touchpoints as possible.</span></p>

<h3>4. UGC will continue to skyrocket Facebook ads engagement</h3>
<p><span>The user-generated content (UGC) style of advertising has been dominating platforms like TikTok recently, but this content will also deliver fantastic results for Facebook advertisers in 2024. </span></p>
<p><span>User-generated content is fast becoming an invaluable asset for brands of all sizes. Rather than launching super-polished ad campaigns, many businesses are leveraging low-budget UGC assets that feel authentic and, more importantly, drive conversions.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are just a few of the benefits that UGC can provide for Facebook advertisers: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><strong><span>You can build credibility with your audience. </span></strong><span>90% of consumers claim that <a href="https://www.nosto.com/blog/42-statistics-about-user-generated-content-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">authenticity is important</a> when deciding which brands they like, and UGC inherently feels authentic, raw, and trustworthy. </span></li>
<li><span> </span><strong><span>You can increase clicks &amp; conversions. </span></strong><span>UGC can <a href="https://getflowbox.com/blog/ecommerce-conversion-rate-ugc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase your CTRs</a> by up to 300%, and more high-quality clicks are fantastic news for your Facebook conversion rates. </span></li>
<li><span> </span><strong><span>You can launch cost-efficient campaigns. </span></strong><span>As the name suggests, user-generated content is created by normal users. While you may need to spend time and effort sourcing UGC assets, it’s essentially free content that can deliver brilliant returns.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>If you want to drive optimal results with Facebook Ads in 2024, then you’ll need to craft an effective UGC strategy. That means finding ways to harvest UGC (i.e. launching competitions, searching hashtags) and leveraging these assets in paid campaigns. </span></p>

<h2>How to use these Facebook ads trends to your advantage</h2>
<p><span>Now that we’ve covered the major Facebook ads trends that will impact advertisers this year, let’s <a href="https://upbeatagency.com/how-to-create-facebook-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explore some key tips</a> for creating high-impact, high-converting Facebook ads. </span></p>
<ol></ol>
<h3>1. Utilize short-form video to capture attention</h3>
<p><span><br />
Short-form video reigns supreme on social media, and while TikTok may be famous for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/13/video-ad-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snappy video content</a>, Facebook audiences are equally engaged with this format.</span></p>
<p><span>Social media users are scrolling through tons of fresh content every time they log in, so attention is a precious commodity for advertisers. Long-winded video assets aren’t likely to maintain audience interest, so aim to create punchy ads that land your key messages fast!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://bloggingwizard.com/facebook-video-statistics/#:~:text=72%25%20of%20people%20prefer%20short%2Dform%20video%20content%20on%20Facebook&amp;text=Consumers%20enjoy%20short%20and%20engaging,norm%20across%20social%20media%20platforms." target="_blank" rel="noopener">72%</a> of Facebook users claim to prefer short-form videos, so keep this in mind when you’re producing new assets.</p>
<p><span>Grab attention quickly with bold visual hooks, focus on delivering clear and compelling product messages, and wrap things up with a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/05/best-call-to-action-phrases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong CTA</a>.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/facebook-ads-trends-short-form-video.jpg" alt="facebook ads trends - short form facebook video example" width="677" height="459" class="aligncenter wp-image-79157 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/facebook-ads-trends-short-form-video.jpg 677w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/facebook-ads-trends-short-form-video-480x325.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 677px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/success/castlery"><em>Source</em></a></span></p>
<h3>2. Leverage the power of UGC across your campaigns</h3>
<p><span>We’ve already covered the incredible effectiveness of UGC for advertisers, so make sure you’re integrating this content into your Facebook campaigns as often as possible. </span></p>
<p>There are many different types of user-generated content that you can utilize in 2024, from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-reviews">product reviews</a> to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-testimonial-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer testimonials</a> and organic posts.</p>
<p><span>Since UGC is sourced from real customers, it feels more authentic, trustworthy, and persuasive for potential shoppers. Use this to your advantage—if you can regularly collect and distribute UGC assets on Facebook, then you’ll steadily build brand credibility and generate sales. </span></p>
<p><span>The more customers you convert, the more opportunities you have to source fresh UGC assets! When used correctly, UGC is the gift that keeps on giving to Facebook marketers.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f331.png" alt="🌱" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Get more ideas to improve and grow your Facebook ads using our free <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-advertising?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FBGrader_FBGrader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Ads Grader</a>!</p>
<h3>3. Create a frictionless shopping experience</h3>
<p><span>If you want to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/01/11/increase-online-store-sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generate sales</a> through Facebook advertising, then you need to remove as many obstacles as possible from the customer journey. </span></p>
<p><span>Start by setting up a well-organized, appealing Facebook and Instagram Shop. This is your virtual storefront on both Facebook and Instagram, so follow best practices like showcasing your top-selling products, optimizing your product pages, and using shoppable tags to drive conversions</span><span> </span></p>
<p>You should also leverage Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1362234537597370" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advantage+ Shopping</a> campaigns, which allow you to dynamically test and optimize creative combinations to deliver optimal results.</p>
<p><span>Finally, ensure that your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/14/website-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> website is well-designed</a> and easy to use. If audiences click and visit your landing page, they need to be able to navigate between pages, explore different products, and complete purchases quickly and easily. </span></p>
<p><span>If the Facebook customer journey feels convenient and engaging, your ads are infinitely more likely to drive conversions.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/facebook-ads-trends-instagram-shop.jpg" alt="facebook ads trends - shops storefront and product page example" width="710" height="417" class="aligncenter wp-image-79158 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/facebook-ads-trends-instagram-shop.jpg 710w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/facebook-ads-trends-instagram-shop-480x282.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 710px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/introducing-facebook-shops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></span></p>
<h3>4. Launch DCO and Tailored campaigns to drive personalization at scale</h3>
<p><span>If you’re not already running <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/m/one-sheeters/dynamic-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dynamic Creative Optimization</a> (DCO) or Tailored campaigns, then make space for them in your 2024 Facebook plans. </span></p>
<p><span>DCO and Tailored campaigns both allow you to test a mind-blowing number of ad variations at scale. The Facebook algorithm will automatically combine and run different creative elements (e.g. images, videos, CTAs) to see which assets perform best. </span></p>
<p>However, it’s not just about optimizing your Facebook ads to maximize conversions. It’s about delivering personalization at scale.</p>
<p><span>Rather than launching generic ads and hoping for the best, you can automatically tailor your assets to your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-targeting">target audience</a> based on their interests and behaviors. </span></p>
<p><span>For example, let’s say a user has recently viewed a specific product on your website. By dynamically retargeting them with this exact product (and similar recommendations) you dramatically increase the relevance of your ads and the likelihood of a conversion. </span></p>
<p><span>This is a fantastic way to scale up your Facebook ad campaigns while maintaining efficiency, so be sure to leverage this strategy next year.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/meta-ads-update-tailored-campaigns.jpg" alt="meta ads update - tailored campaigns home page" width="870" height="395" class="aligncenter wp-image-76164 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/meta-ads-update-tailored-campaigns.jpg 870w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/meta-ads-update-tailored-campaigns-480x218.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 870px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>5. Use broad audience targeting to fuel the Facebook algorithm</h3>
<p><span>Casting a wide targeting net on Facebook can be a game-changer for the efficiency of your ad campaigns. </span></p>
<p>This may sound like a pretty simple strategy, but it’s a small tweak that can make a big impact on your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics">conversion rates</a>.</p>
<p><span>While it’s easy to get carried away with the granular <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/13/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-world">targeting options available on Facebook</a>, a super-niche audience is more likely to restrict campaign performance than improve it. </span><span>That’s because the Facebook algorithm needs sufficient scale to test different audiences, make optimizations, and gather learnings. The more users the platform can reach, the more insights it can gather—and this is crucial for achieving superior ROI. </span></p>
<p><span>Instead of narrowing down your Facebook audience too much, try to be patient. Start with broader targeting, allow the learning phase to progress, and give the algorithm the best chance of identifying high-value segments for your brand.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Black Friday is a fantastic opportunity for ecommerce advertisers to skyrocket product sales and attract hordes of new customers.

<h2>Best practices for Black Friday Facebook ads for ecommerce businesses</h2>
<p>Follow these best practices, and you’ll be able to transform Black Friday madness into highly lucrative sales.</p>
<div id="groundwork"></div>
<h3>1. Lay down the groundwork before Black Friday kicks off</h3>
<p>A lot of your most important work as a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/20/facebook-ad-guidelines">Facebook advertiser</a> will actually take place before the sales even begin.</p>
<p>For example, if you wait until the Black Friday event begins to start <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">generating website traffic</a>, you’ll be miles behind the competition already. Instead, you need to focus on building up receptive, high-quality <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/04/facebook-retargeting">retargeting audiences</a> in the lead-up to Black Friday weekend.</p>
<p><strong>This all starts with the </strong><a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/business/tools/meta-pixel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Facebook Pixel</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>With the Facebook Pixel in place, you can begin to construct retargeting audiences based on customers who have engaged with your ads, visited your website, or purchased your products. These segments are known as Custom Audiences, and since they’re already familiar with your brand/products, they’re significantly more likely to convert.</p>
<p>(If you have a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/11/how-to-build-an-email-list">sizeable email list</a>, you can also use customer email addresses to build a new Custom Audience on Facebook.)</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/black-friday-facebook-ad-custom-audiences.jpg" alt="black friday facebook ads - custom audiences on facebook ads" width="621" height="597" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76442" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/black-friday-facebook-ad-custom-audiences.jpg 621w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/black-friday-facebook-ad-custom-audiences-480x461.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 621px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/business/tools/ads-manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Source</i></a></p>
<p>Custom Audiences can last for up to 180 days, so if you start <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">driving traffic to your website</a> in advance, you can hit the ground running on Black Friday. Rather than starting from scratch, you can immediately target hot prospect audiences that have previously engaged with your business, allowing you to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/11/increase-conversion-rates">maximize conversions</a>&#8211;and fast.</p>
<p>You can also use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-lookalike-audiences">Lookalike Audiences</a> to expand your Custom Audience targeting, extending the reach of your campaign while still focusing on relevant consumers.</p>
<p>Black Friday is a ridiculously competitive period, so advertisers that can immediately <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/12/facebook-ads-cost">focus on cost-efficient audiences</a> will have a serious advantage.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite16FBAdsStrategies.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_16FacebookStrategies_Download">The 16 Most Effective Strategies for Facebook Ads Success</a></p>
<div id="segmentation"></div>
<h3>2. Be smart with audience segmentation</h3>
<p>As I’ve already mentioned, building up re-engagement and retargeting audiences ahead of Black Friday is key.</p>
<p>But it’s also important to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/10/20/facebook-audience">segment these audiences</a> effectively.</p>
<p>For example, users who have completed multiple purchases on your website in the last 60 days should be a high priority. These are existing customers who are clearly interested in your products and represent a massive revenue opportunity on Black Friday.</p>
<p>On the other hand, users who have previously viewed one of your videos may be curious about your products, but not quite ready to commit to a purchase.</p>
<p>Rather than treating all of these audiences as equal, think carefully about how you’ll approach them on Black Friday. While high-value customers may just need a simple discount message, ad engagers might require a little more convincing to make the leap and purchase a product.</p>
<p>You should also consider how to balance your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/28/small-business-budget">marketing budget</a> across these retargeting audiences.</p>
<p>When it comes to Black Friday, there’s no room for inefficient spending. Identify your ‘bullseye’ audiences of hot prospects and existing customers, and make sure you’re allocating enough budget to drive as many conversions as possible.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f3af.png" alt="🎯" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Need targeting help?

<div id="assets"></div>
<h3>3. Launch eye-catching creative assets</h3>
<p>High-quality <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/23/facebook-ad-examples">creative assets</a> can be a powerful weapon during the pandemonium of Black Friday. Capturing the attention of your audience is half the battle.</p>
<p>To start with, make sure that both your products and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/08/black-friday-ppc">Black Friday promotions</a> are crystal clear in your ad visuals. Users are going to be scrolling through an ocean of generous discounts, so they need to understand your offering at a glance.</p>
<p>You can also look at previous competitor Black Friday campaigns in the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/06/facebook-ad-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Ad Library</a> to gather valuable intel. How are they positioning their products and price promotions, and how can you differentiate your brand this year?</p>
<p>Whether it’s a static image or a video, make sure that your creative assets are designed to immediately grab attention. Motion and color can be super effective here, so don’t hesitate to think outside the box and separate yourself from other marketers.</p>
<p>Remember, the most successful Black Friday advertisers aren’t trying to create artistic masterpieces. They’re using high-quality product images and bold visuals to communicate their promotions and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/29/holiday-marketing-trends">generate sales</a>.</p>

<div id="adformats"></div>
<h3>4. Experiment with different ad formats to achieve superior performance</h3>
<p>Black Friday is an unpredictable event for Facebook advertisers. What might work in your normal campaigns may not perform here, and vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>To help you identify new creative opportunities and effective placements, make sure you’re experimenting with </strong><a href="https://upbeatagency.com/facebook-ad-types/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>different ad formats</strong></a><strong> across Black Friday. </strong></p>
<p>Not only will a diverse combination of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-learning-phase">ad formats</a> keep your creative messaging fresh, but it will also provide you with more opportunities to engage your audience and showcase your product promotions. By testing out new ideas and reacting quickly with optimizations, you’ll significantly increase your chances of <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-increase-sales-for-your-business-on-a-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">driving sales</a>.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/black-friday-and-cyber-monday-insights-from-facebook-and-instagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook data shows</a> that video assets are extremely popular during Black Friday, with 30% of mobile shoppers claiming that video is the best format for discovering new products.</p>

<p>Getting out of your comfort zone is very important during the Black Friday weekend, since many of the usual <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-objectives">Facebook advertising rules</a> change. If you typically only run one or two types of Facebook ads, push the boat out, and try something new&#8211;you might be surprised at the results.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/26a1.png" alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Get more helpful Facebook advertising data in our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/11/28/facebook-ads-benchmarks">updated benchmarks</a>!</p>
<div id="copywriting"></div>
<h3>5. Use action-driving, sales-led copywriting techniques</h3>
<p>Since you’ll be facing intense competition during Black Friday, every <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/facebook-ads/facebook-ads-best-practices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">element of your Facebook ads</a> will need to be designed to drive clicks and conversions.</p>
<p>Your <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSContentDLWebBlogInContentTextLinkTrickstoClicks.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_TrickstoClicks_Download">ad copy</a> is one of the most important factors to consider here.</p>
<p>Creativity is important, but incentivizing action is even more important. Whenever you’re crafting ad copy for Black Friday activity, focus on communicating clear discounts and compelling <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/20/product-positioning">product benefits</a>&#8211;there’s no room for irrelevant information.</p>
<p>While functional ad copy may not be the most witty or imaginative, if it generates sales, it’s doing a good job.</p>
<p>Use your primary text to land your major selling points (i.e. 30% off this product collection) and then use additional copy to highlight added benefits such as free shipping or returns.</p>
<p>You should also look to employ sales-led copywriting techniques to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/21/emotional-ad-copy-examples">make your ads as persuasive as possible</a>. For instance, scarcity (i.e., only X products left) and urgency (i.e., sale ending in X hours) are powerful motivators for shoppers. You can also highlight big, simple percentages (e.g. 70% off normal prices) to make an immediate impact on consumers.</p>
<p>The more value your ad copy is communicating, the more likely customers are to convert.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/black-friday-facebook-ad-action-copywriting.jpg" alt="black friday facebook ad ecommerce - ad copywriting example" width="751" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76447" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/black-friday-facebook-ad-action-copywriting.jpg 751w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/black-friday-facebook-ad-action-copywriting-480x382.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 751px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://adespresso.com/blog/facebook-ads-examples-for-black-friday-and-holiday-advertising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Source</i></a></p>
<div id="scale"></div>
<h3>6. Don’t hesitate to scale up successful strategies</h3>
<p>The Black Friday sale moves fast, and if you want to drive optimal results through Facebook ads, you need to be decisive.</p>
<p>By scaling up successful tactics and audiences, you can make the most of the sales period to maximize conversions. However, you won’t have the luxury of time&#8211;if you’re going to scale up budgets, you’ll need to scale them quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>So how can you prepare for speedy and effective budget scaling during Black Friday?</strong></p>
<p>To give yourself the biggest number of opportunities to scale, it’s a good idea to start your campaign with a diverse mix of broad audiences. While you’ll always want to allocate a healthy budget for your red-hot retargeting segments, you’ll also need to balance this out with larger audiences that will ensure sufficient scale.</p>
<p>Once you’ve identified creatives or audiences that are generating high volumes of conversions, you can begin to scale. This could be vertical scaling (i.e. increasing ad set budgets) or horizontal scaling (i.e. replicating/tweaking successful tactics).</p>
<p>It’s worth remembering that the Facebook ads landscape is highly contested during Black Friday, so you’re likely to pay more for impressions and conversions than usual. However, if you can scale up your campaigns effectively, your sales figures will compensate for it!</p>
<div id="delivery"></div>
<h3>7. Optimize your ad delivery to stay competitive</h3>
<p>Launching Facebook ads during Black Friday can be a frantic time, but to deliver the best possible returns for your business, it’s crucial to stay focused on ad delivery.</p>
<p>As mentioned, Black Friday is a unique event where you’ll be facing a ridiculous amount of marketing competition. Because of this, you may notice a couple of common issues with ad performance&#8211;restricted delivery and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/12/facebook-ad-benchmarks">escalating campaign costs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Fortunately, if you keep your eye on the ball, you can make a few key adjustments to overcome these obstacles and ensure consistent ad delivery. </strong></p>
<p>The first thing you’ll want to do is accelerate Facebook ad delivery. When you accelerate delivery at the ad set level, you’ll allow the Facebook algorithm to invest your budget as quickly as possible, while still considering your bid cap.</p>
<p>This essentially means that Facebook will be delivering your ads as frequently as possible, which is perfect for a time-sensitive period like Black Friday.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/black-friday-facebook-ad-delivery-type.jpg" alt="ad delivery type facebook ads black friday" width="936" height="211" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76450" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/black-friday-facebook-ad-delivery-type.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/black-friday-facebook-ad-delivery-type-480x108.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://adespresso.com/guides/facebook-ads-optimization/delivery-placements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Source</i></a></p>
<p>However, that doesn’t mean your investment will be wasted on ineffective tactics. By putting smart <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/27/facebook-automated-rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automated Rules</a> in place, you can set up triggers that will automatically pause underperforming ads and protect your budget.</p>
<p>For instance, you may want to implement a rule that instantly pauses ads generating low clicks or a poor ROAS. This allows you to maintain campaign effectiveness while still accelerating delivery for a limited time.</p>
<p>Since you’re likely to spend more during a Black Friday campaign, it’s also a good idea to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/141820733085330" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adjust the spend limit</a> on your Facebook Ads account. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/18/social-media-advertising">Advertising costs</a> tend to increase rapidly over the Black Friday weekend, so if you want to avoid issues with ad delivery, you’ll want to give yourself a little more flexibility in terms of campaign spend.</p>
<div id="changes"></div>
<h3>8. Avoid making last-minute changes to your Facebook Ads campaign</h3>
<p>Although Black Friday can be a chaotic time for Facebook advertisers, you need to avoid making last-minute tweaks and adjustments to your campaigns.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p><strong>Because whenever you launch new Facebook ads, the algorithm automatically enters a </strong><a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/business/help/112167992830700?id=561906377587030"><strong>Learning Phase</strong></a><strong>. </strong></p>
<p>During this time, the platform will serve your ads to different audience segments, gather performance insights, and make optimizations to improve performance. Results will often fluctuate during this initial learning period, but this is completely normal. While it might be tempting to intervene, you need to trust the algorithm and be patient.</p>
<p>The Learning Phase usually needs to complete around 50 conversion events before performance stabilizes, so if you start interfering with your campaign, this learning process will reset&#8211;and you’ll be back to square one.</p>
<p>(As you’ll already know, time is money during the Black Friday weekend, and any optimization delays can be very costly!)</p>
<p>To avoid the need for last-minute changes, make sure that you’ve triple-checked everything from your target audiences to your creative headlines. It’s fine to pause ineffective audiences and upweight high-performing tactics once you’ve gathered robust data, but don’t rush in to make tiny tweaks during the Learning Phase.</p>
<h2>Create compelling ecommerce Black Friday Facebook ads</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With its colossal reach, engaging ad formats, and suite of marketing tools, TikTok is an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/11/advertising-on-tiktok">essential platform</a> for any marketer looking to drive rapid results.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-stats.jpg" alt="tiktok marketing stats" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75576" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-stats.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-stats-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-happens-in-an-internet-minute/#:~:text=TikTok%20statistics&amp;text=In%202022%2C%20TikTok's%20user%20base,post%20across%20social%20media%20sites." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stats source</a></em></p>
<p>But while it’s relatively easy to start using TikTok, mastering the platform is a whole different story.</p>
<p>If you want to maximize your conversions and reduce acquisition costs, then you’ll need to be smart with your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/tiktok-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok marketing strategies</a>. That means refining your audience targeting, leveraging as much data as possible, and crafting TikTok ads that will drive consistent action.</p>
<p>But don’t worry&#8211;you’re in the right place.</p>
<p>We’ve pulled together nine proven TikTok marketing strategies that will help you to reach high-value audiences at scale, dramatically improve cost efficiency, and skyrocket your conversions.</p>
<h2>9 best TikTok marketing strategies</h2>
<p>Use these strategies for improved TikTok marketing and better results.</p>
<h3>1. Include a compelling call to action (CTA)</h3>
<p>This may sound obvious, but the impact of a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/05/best-call-to-action-phrases">strong CTA</a> should never be underestimated.</p>
<p>Your CTA ultimately nudges prospects to the next stage in the customer journey. For instance, let’s say that you’ve captured the interest of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a> with a high-quality video ad&#8211;you’ve showcased your products, highlighted their key benefits, and demonstrated your value as a brand. What comes next?</p>
<p>If your CTA is weak or unclear, customers may scroll through to the next video without a second thought. But if you’ve included a clear and compelling CTA, you’ll be in a great position to increase clicks&#8211;and more importantly, conversions.</p>
<p>Ideally, you should incorporate a CTA into both your TikTok video assets and ad text, as this will increase your chances of driving action. In fact, TikTok platform data shows that CTAs in text format can deliver a staggering <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/creative-that-drives-conversions?redirected=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">152%</a> lift in conversions for marketers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-cta.jpg" alt="tiktok marketing - example of post with in-text cta" width="627" height="593" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75577" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-cta.jpg 627w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-cta-480x454.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 627px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You should also ensure that your CTA slots neatly into the customer experience, creating a seamless user journey.</p>
<p>For example, if you’ll be driving customers directly to a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">landing page</a> where they’ll be prompted to book a call, then “Contact Us” makes a lot more sense than “Shop Now” as a CTA button. The more logical and convenient the customer journey is, the more likely you are to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/31/increase-conversions">increase conversions</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Start with broad targeting and refine</h3>
<p>TikTok offers a wide range of granular, data-driven <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/23/tiktok-ads-targeting">targeting options</a>, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you should always focus on smaller audience segments.</p>
<p>Starting with broad audience targeting is a fantastic way to gather performance insights that can fuel your campaigns and supercharge conversion rates.</p>
<p>But how can broader targeting enable you to reach and convert high-value customers?</p>
<p>It’s all about the <a href="https://searchengineland.com/how-tiktok-algorithm-works-390229" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok algorithm</a>.</p>
<p>Whenever you launch a new TikTok campaign, the algorithm will enter a “<a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/learning-phase?lang=en">Learning Phase</a>.” During this time, the algorithm will expose a range of different audiences to your ads, gathering data on which users are most likely to click and convert. While your CPA may fluctuate in these first few days, it will quickly stabilize once the Learning Phase progresses.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-learning-phase-chart.jpg" alt="tiktok marketing - chart that shows conversions relative to learning phase" width="835" height="398" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75563" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-learning-phase-chart.jpg 835w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-learning-phase-chart-480x229.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 835px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>By starting your campaign with a wider audience, you essentially provide the algorithm with the scale it needs to test, optimize, and evolve.</p>
<p>The more users that can be reached throughout the Learning Phase, the faster the algorithm can identify audiences that are converting from your ads, which is crucial for cost efficiency.</p>
<p>While there’s nothing wrong with focusing on smaller audience segments once you’ve <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gathered sufficient data</a>, it’s a good idea to cast a wider net initially. Not only will this help the algorithm to collect performance insights, but it will also help you to dramatically increase conversions in the long run.</p>
<h3>3. Use full-screen vertical videos</h3>
<p>Here’s a simple <a href="https://upbeatagency.com/tiktok-marketing-strategy/">TikTok strategy</a> that can make a big difference to your conversion rates.</p>
<p>Whenever you’re creating new <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/tiktok-ad-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok ads</a>, make sure that you’re producing full-screen vertical videos that are tailored to the platform.</p>
<p>The vast majority of TikTok users consume content in portrait mode, so if you want to drive engagement and boost conversions, you’ll need to reflect this in your creative assets. By shooting and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-edit-tiktok-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">editing TikTok videos</a> in a 9:16 aspect ratio, you can maximize the creative space you have available and increase the impact of your visual assets.</p>
<p>Not only will full-screen vertical videos appear more native to the TikTok platform, but they’ll also feel more natural for your target audience to engage with. TikTok users tend to respond to content that feels authentic, and your video production is a major factor here.</p>
<p>TikTok data even suggests that videos shot in a 9:16 aspect ratio see a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/creative-that-drives-conversions?redirected=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">91%</a> lift in conversions, so if you want to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/31/buying-motives">generate more sales</a>, think carefully about your creative approach.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-creative.jpg" alt="tiktok marketing - example of tiktok creative" width="853" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75564" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-creative.jpg 853w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-creative-480x338.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 853px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-GB/inspiration/mancave-tiktok-success-story" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Source</i></a></p>
<h3>4. Unlock the full potential of A/B testing</h3>
<p>A/B testing (also known as split testing) is a surefire way to improve your TikTok marketing performance and increase your conversion rates.</p>
<p>With a consistent, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/20/ppc-campaign-testing-tips">data-driven testing strategy</a>, you can begin to identify the best-performing elements of your current TikTok marketing campaigns while also removing inefficient tactics. But that’s not all&#8211;with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/11/copywriting-ab-tests">A/B testing</a>, you’ll also be able to discover brand new audiences and strategies that help you to drive <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/03/improve-conversion-rates">high-value conversions</a>.</p>
<p>There are many different variables that you can split test on TikTok, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ad formats</li>
<li>Audience targeting</li>
<li>CTAs</li>
<li>Creative assets</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/21/emotional-ad-copy-examples">Ad copy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-ads-bidding">Bidding tactics</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The TikTok marketing landscape is constantly shifting. Audience behaviors change, different content trends emerge, and new tools are released. A/B testing enables you to stay ahead of the curve and constantly evolve your strategy to maximize conversions.</p>
<p>Plus, setting up A/B tests on TikTok is a breeze. You can create split tests directly through the TikTok Ads Manager&#8211;just follow <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/create-split-test?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this guide</a> for more information.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-split-test.jpg" alt="tiktok marketing - split test set up in tiktok ads manager" width="857" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75580" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-split-test.jpg 857w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-split-test-480x336.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 857px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>5. Run short and snappy creative assets</h3>
<p>TikTok users tend to engage with video content that’s short and sweet, so if you want to generate more conversions, you’ll need to adapt your creative assets accordingly.</p>
<p>While it may be tempting to cram your TikTok ads with product details and selling points, shorter assets will perform infinitely better than long-winded videos. TikTok data shows that video ads between 21-34 seconds in length achieve a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/creative-that-drives-conversions?redirected=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">280%</a> lift in conversions compared to longer videos, so always keep this in mind when you’re producing content.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-shorter-video-content.jpg" alt="tiktok marketing - post shorter content - example from running coach" width="360" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75578" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-shorter-video-content.jpg 360w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-shorter-video-content-180x300.jpg 180w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></p>
<p>But how can you ensure that you’re creating punchy video assets while still delivering compelling messages? Here are some best practices to keep you on the right track:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Drill down to your most persuasive product benefits. </strong>Think about a central <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/20/product-positioning">product message</a> that will resonate with your target audience and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-pain-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resolve their problems</a>. Remember, it’s all about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/06/how-to-market-a-product">showcasing relevant benefits</a> rather than basic features.</li>
<li><strong>Refine your video assets and product messages. </strong>Don’t rush the creative process and overload your videos with weak content. Trim the fat, edit your content meticulously, and don’t hesitate to enlist the help of professional creatives/<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/19/copywriting-skills">copywriters</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on a high-impact CTA. </strong>Your CTA is the finishing touch on your video ads and will ultimately encourage your target audience to take action. Highlight your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">key product benefits</a>, prove how they’re relevant to your customers, and drive conversions with a strong CTA.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2"></ol>
<ol start="3"></ol>
<p>Reducing the length of your videos and refining your product messaging can be difficult, but short and snappy assets will help you to drive significantly more conversions on TikTok.</p>
<h3>6. Leverage Custom Audiences on TikTok</h3>
<p>Standard TikTok audiences can deliver great results for your business.</p>
<p>But if you really want to skyrocket performance and scale up your conversions, Custom Audiences are the way to go.</p>
<p>TikTok Custom Audiences are segments built using your own data, enabling you to target hot prospects that are already familiar with your brand, website, or products and used for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/16/tiktok-vs-instagram-reels-ads">TikTok advertising</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-custom-audiences.jpg" alt="tiktok marketing - set up custom audience" width="936" height="551" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75579" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-custom-audiences.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-custom-audiences-480x283.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/custom-audiences?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Since Custom Audiences have already expressed interest in your product offering, they’re significantly more likely to click and convert. This is great news for your conversion rate, allowing you to launch highly effective retargeting strategies that increase sales and reduce acquisition costs.</p>
<p>These are the different Custom Audiences available on TikTok:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer File.</strong> Upload your own customer files to target existing customers through TikTok.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement.</strong> Retarget users who have previously engaged with your ad campaigns.</li>
<li><strong>App Activity.</strong> Retarget users who have completed specific actions on your app.</li>
<li><strong>Website Traffic.</strong> Retarget users who have visited (or completed a specific action on) your website.</li>
<li><strong>Lead Generation.</strong> Retarget users who have engaged with your Lead Generation ads/completed a lead form.</li>
<li><strong>Business Account Audience.</strong> Retarget users who have engaged with your TikTok account/organic content.</li>
</ul>
<p>Custom Audiences can be incredibly powerful for TikTok marketers as they allow you to target high-value prospects at scale. Since you already know these users are familiar with your brand, you can lead with more sales-driven messaging to generate conversions.</p>
<p>If you’re seeing strong performance with Custom Audiences, you can also leverage <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/lookalike-audience?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lookalike Audiences</a> to increase reach while maintaining a focus on quality targeting.</p>
<p>Lookalikes are essentially users who share common traits with your existing customers, meaning they’re highly likely to engage with your TikTok ads and purchase your products.</p>
<h3>7. Produce high-resolution video ads</h3>
<p>There are plenty of data-driven tactics that can help you to drive more conversions on TikTok, from retargeting Custom Audiences to running A/B tests.</p>
<p>However, sometimes it’s the simple things that can make a big difference to your conversion rate&#8211; for instance, the quality of your <a href="https://localiq.com/products/video-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video ads</a>.</p>
<p>TikTok is a highly competitive marketing platform, and if you want to capture the attention of your target audience, then you’ll need to ensure you’re making a strong impression. Users are constantly scrolling through fresh content from publishers, advertisers, and regular accounts&#8211;if you’re running low-quality assets, you may find yourself being overlooked.</p>
<p>To help you maximize audience engagement and stand out in a cluttered feed, be sure to produce high-resolution TikTok video ads that feel polished.</p>
<p>Not only will high-resolution video ads look more appealing to potential customers, but they’ll also have a direct impact on your conversion rates. TikTok data shows that videos shot at 720p resolution (or higher) see a staggering <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/creative-that-drives-conversions?redirected=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">312%</a> lift in conversions compared to lower-resolution assets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-high-quality-video.jpg" alt="tiktok marketing - example of high quality tiktok video ad screenshot" width="697" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75565" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-high-quality-video.jpg 697w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok-marketing-high-quality-video-480x413.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 697px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/creative-that-drives-conversions?redirected=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Source</i></a></p>
<h3>8. Set up a frictionless customer journey</h3>
<p>It’s not just your activity within the TikTok app that will affect your conversion rates. You’ll also need to optimize the wider customer experience to maximize results.</p>
<p>Think carefully about how consumers will engage with your TikTok ads, interact with your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/18/website-maintenance">website</a>, and explore your products.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/the-buyers-journey.jpg" alt="buyers journey from awareness to retention" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75582" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/the-buyers-journey.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/the-buyers-journey-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>A disjointed <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/19/customer-journey-map-templates">customer journey</a> is a surefire way to deter potential customers from making a purchase. For example, if you’re sending users to a landing page that doesn’t align with your ad messaging, they’re likely to feel confused and frustrated.</p>
<p>If prospects click a “Learn More’” CTA, they’ll want to discover more information about your products. If they click “Buy Now,” they’ll probably want to reach the checkout as quickly as possible. Make sure that you’re building a seamless user journey that feels convenient and intuitive, with fast-loading pages and a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/15/website-accessibility">clear website structure</a> that’s easy to navigate.</p>
<p>By removing as many barriers as possible across the customer journey, you can increase conversions and drastically improve the efficiency of your TikTok campaigns.</p>
<h3>9. Remain diligent with campaign optimizations</h3>
<p>Finally, make sure that you’re constantly looking out for opportunities to <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/optimize-tiktok-ads/466735/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimize your TikTok ads</a>, remove inefficient strategies, and experiment with new tactics.</p>
<p>Consistent optimizations are key for improving performance over time, so getting comfortable with the TikTok Ads Manager is hugely important. If you’re not able to identify the ad types or audiences that are driving the most conversions, it’s going to be very difficult to refine your strategy and improve ROI.</p>
<p>Stay focused on your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">core metrics</a> (e.g., conversions, CPA) and utilize custom report templates to make the optimization process simpler.</p>
<p>It’s also vital to give the TikTok algorithm time to test, learn, and optimize whenever you launch a new campaign. Although it can be tempting to interfere when performance is fluctuating, implementing optimizations is much easier when the algorithm has gathered conversion data and identified profitable audiences.</p>

When you’re able to put your TikTok ads in front of the right customers, the results will speak for themselves.</p>
<h2>6 proven techniques for ultra-effective TikTok ads targeting</h2>
<p>Use these data-backed tactics for your TikTok ad targeting.</p>
<h3>1. Leverage your existing customer data</h3>
<p>Before you start planning your next TikTok campaign, think carefully about the data you currently have on your audience.</p>
<p>If you’re running an ecommerce business, you may already be sitting on a goldmine of audience insights and data signals.</p>
<p>For example, you might be able to delve into your internal data to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">understand the demographic profiles of your existing customers</a>. If you can identify the age, gender, and locations of your most valuable shoppers, then you already have plenty of fuel to power your TikTok ads targeting.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/munro-buyer-persona-example.jpg" alt="example of a visual buyer persona from munro" width="751" height="597" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71248" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/munro-buyer-persona-example.jpg 751w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/munro-buyer-persona-example-480x382.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 751px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/23/buyer-personas">Buyer personas</a> can also help inform your TikTok ads targeting.</em></p>
<p>You may even spot patterns around products that are appealing to specific types of shoppers, which can also help to shape your creative messaging.</p>
<p>Now, this isn’t to say that your future customers will necessarily be identical to your current audience.</p>
<p>You might discover entirely new audience segments on TikTok that are generating huge amounts of revenue, which is the beauty of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">social media marketing</a>. Plus, experimenting with different targeting tactics is a surefire way to improve results over time.</p>
<p>However, if you can hit the ground running by utilizing your existing <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer data</a> to inform your TikTok audiences, you’ll be in a good position to drive strong performance.</p>

<h3>2. Utilize interest and behavior targeting</h3>
<p>TikTok attracts <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/charts/global-tiktok-user-stats/#:~:text=TikTok%20will%20have%20834.3%20million,phenomenon%20has%20been%20incredibly%20quick." target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 830 million</a> monthly active users, which is a jaw-dropping <a href="https://upbeatagency.com/tiktok-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statistic</a>.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this is great news for marketers. You can reach a colossal audience of potential customers, and there’s plenty of opportunity for you to scale up your campaigns.</p>
<p>However, this also means that you need to tighten up your TikTok ads targeting as much as possible to avoid high volumes of wasted impressions.</p>
<p>Leveraging interest and behavior targeting is a great way to ensure that you’re reaching relevant and receptive TikTok audiences.</p>
<p><a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/interest-targeting?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Interest targeting</a> allows advertisers to target users based on their long-term interests and passions. You can target audiences based on broad interest categories (e.g. gaming, food, finance) but the TikTok algorithm will also suggest associated interests to broaden reach.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/behavior-targeting?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">behavior targeting</a>, you can reach users based on recent actions, such as commenting on a specific profile or sharing a particular type of video content.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-behavior-targeting.jpg" alt="tiktok ads targeting - interesting and behavior targeting in tiktok" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72185" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-behavior-targeting.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-behavior-targeting-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/interest-targeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Combining these two strategies will enable you to target relevant (and valuable) audiences.</p>
<p>For instance, if you’re a brand selling gym attire, then you could target interest categories such as ‘Apparel &amp; Accessories’ and ‘Sports &amp; Outdoors’ to find users that are likely to be interested in your products. You might also target users that have liked videos from well-known gym brands, as there’s a good chance that they’ll be open to your messaging.</p>
<p>Although these are relatively broad targeting tactics, the TikTok algorithm will be able to identify the best-performing segments within these groups, meaning you can effectively optimize your ads over time to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/03/improve-conversion-rates">maximize conversions</a>.</p>
<p>Think about it this way&#8211;interest and behavior targeting allow you to cast a wide net and reach users that are more likely to be interested in your brand.</p>
<p>Once you’ve gathered some performance data based on these larger audiences, you can refine your targeting, allow the TikTok algorithm to work its magic, and increase your ROI.</p>
<h3>3. Harness the power of Custom Audiences</h3>
<p>Custom Audiences are one of the most powerful tools available to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/11/advertising-on-tiktok">advertisers on TikTok</a>.</p>
<p>In basic terms, <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/custom-audiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Custom Audiences</a> allow you to target users that have already interacted with your brand in some way. These audiences are aware of your business, so you can focus on more action-led messaging to drive performance.</p>
<p>That means you can instantly engage hot prospects that are infinitely more likely to purchase your products, which is a game-changer for cost efficiency.</p>
<p>There are several different types of Custom Audiences available on TikTok, and selecting the right strategy is key to success. Marketers can choose to build the following segments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer File:</strong> Upload your customer data to match and target TikTok accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement:</strong> Retarget users that have previously engaged with your video ads.</li>
<li><strong>App Activity</strong>: Retarget users that have completed a specific action within your app.</li>
<li><strong>Lead Generation:</strong> Retarget users that have engaged with your <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/lead-generation-objective?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lead Generation ads</a> on TikTok.</li>
<li><strong>Website Traffic:</strong> Retarget users that have visited (or taken a specific action on) your website.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-custom-website-audience.jpg" alt="tiktok ads targeting - custom audiences for website traffic custom audience in tiktok ads" width="936" height="512" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72181" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-custom-website-audience.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-custom-website-audience-480x263.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/custom-audiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>All of these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/01/15/retargeting-ads">retargeting strategies</a> can be extremely effective at generating clicks and conversions since you’re reaching users that have already engaged with your business.</p>
<p>When it comes to targeting high-value prospects on TikTok, it doesn’t get much better than Custom Audiences.</p>
<p>You can also utilize different Custom Audiences depending on your main objective, but always make sure that you’re taking full advantage of these data-driven targeting segments.</p>
<h3>4. Capitalize on Lookalike segments</h3>
<p>Custom Audiences can deliver outstanding results for TikTok advertisers&#8211;but what if we told you that you could make them even more effective?</p>
<p><a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/lookalike-audience?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lookalike Audiences</a> allow you to effectively extend the reach of your Custom Audiences by identifying and targeting similar users.</p>
<p>The TikTok algorithm will analyze a few common attributes across your Custom Audiences (e.g. operating device, demographics, interests) and locate user groups with the same profiles.</p>
<p>If you’ve already discovered profitable TikTok audiences, why not make the most of them?</p>
<p>By building Lookalike segments, you can rapidly increase reach while still maintaining a clear focus on quality.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-lookalike-audience.jpg" alt="tiktok ads targeting - lookalike audiences" width="936" height="541" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72182" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-lookalike-audience.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-lookalike-audience-480x277.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is a fantastic way to leverage data about your high-value prospects and expand the scale of your TikTok campaigns.</p>
<p>You can use TikTok Lookalike Audiences in a few different ways to drive performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the beginning of a new campaign, launching Lookalikes helps the TikTok algorithm collect audience insights and optimize ads faster.</li>
<li>If you feel like you’re peaking in terms of conversion volumes, you can utilize Lookalike Audiences to expand reach and generate incremental sales.</li>
<li>Finally, if campaign performance is beginning to slow down, you can use Lookalikes to stretch out ad delivery and deliver additional impressions.</li>
</ul>
<p>A combination of data-driven Custom Audiences and tactical Lookalike Audiences is guaranteed to identify cost-effective prospects on TikTok.</p>
<h3>5. Analyze performance data and then optimize</h3>
<p>Implementing the above targeting strategies will help you to reach and convert valuable TikTok audiences&#8211;but if you want to maximize performance, you’ll need to stay close to your reporting data.</p>
<p>By constantly analyzing your campaign data and implementing optimizations, you’ll be able to focus on your most profitable audiences and significantly improve ROI.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on the delivery of different audience segments to understand your best-performing tactics. Trust what the data is telling you and be decisive with your optimizations.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-reporting.jpg" alt="example of tiktok ads reporting in tiktok ads manager" width="829" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72183" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-reporting.jpg 829w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-reporting-480x347.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 829px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/how-to-view-campaign-performance-tiktok-ads-manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Don’t hesitate to adjust your TikTok ad budgets. Bolster profitable audiences with incremental spend and pause underperforming segments.</p>
<p>Your ideal TikTok audiences are out there&#8211;you just need to work diligently and optimize your campaigns until you find them.</p>
<p>To further enhance your TikTok targeting, you should also put <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-pixel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok pixel</a> data to good use whenever possible. The pixel will provide you with incredibly useful insights about audience performance, helping you to establish the users that are completing purchases, generating revenue, and driving the best ROI.</p>
<p>Try to avoid making assumptions about your preferred audiences based on clicks alone.</p>
<p>If you dig deeper into your pixel data and calculate the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/16/return-on-ad-spend-roas">return on ad spend (ROAS)</a> you’re seeing from different targeting segments, you’ll discover the best-performing audiences in no time.</p>
<h3>6. Use A/B testing to fuel superior targeting</h3>
<p>One of the fastest ways to enhance your TikTok audience targeting is to utilize <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/02/26/ab-testing-best-practices">A/B testing</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/split-testing?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Split Testing tool</a> (available in the <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok Ads Manager</a>) allows marketers to quickly set up A/B tests and monitor the results in real time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-split-testing.jpg" alt="tiktok ads targeting - split testing tool in tiktok" width="896" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72184" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-split-testing.jpg 896w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiktok-ads-targeting-split-testing-480x321.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 896px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>By A/B testing different audience segments, you can rapidly compare performance and establish your best-performing strategies. The TikTok platform will ensure that your test audiences run with sufficient (and fair) budgets, and a ‘winning’ ad group will only be confirmed if the results are statistically significant.</p>
<p>If you’re keen to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/20/ppc-campaign-testing-tips">experiment with a new audience targeting strategy</a>, A/B testing is a brilliant way to gather results quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>However, there are a few best practices to keep in mind when you’re planning to launch A/B tests on TikTok.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t launch too many tests at the same time, or you may find yourself drowning in data and struggling to make the right adjustments.</li>
<li>Stay diligent with campaign analysis. A/B tests are only effective if you track performance and optimize accordingly, so keep an eye on your reports.</li>
<li>Give the TikTok algorithm space to work. Be patient with your tests, and don’t interfere with your audiences until you’ve gathered reliable data.</li>
<li>Ensure that all of your test audiences have a healthy budget. You’ll only be able to gather targeting insights if you have enough campaign data to review!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can stick to a consistent TikTok A/B testing strategy, you’ll find it much easier to refine your audience targeting and scale up your conversions.

<p>Let&#8217;s start with a little <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/03/how-to-advertise-on-facebook">Facebook advertising 101</a>. Facebook ads are image-based ads with captions that are delivered across the Facebook network.</p>
<p>They can be served in various placements, including Facebook Stories, Facebook Messenger, the Facebook home feed, and more. They’re also available in a wide range of different formats, and these formats are often designed to achieve specific <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/21/facebook-funnel">campaign objectives</a>.</p>
<p><u> <img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/facebook-ad-examples-grin.png" alt="facebook ad examples - grin" width="500" height="688" class="size-full wp-image-57961 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/facebook-ad-examples-grin.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/facebook-ad-examples-grin-480x660.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></u></p>
<p>For example, while Single Image and Video ads can be great for top-funnel activity, Collection and Advantage+ ads are built to generate clicks and conversions.</p>
<p>One of the biggest strengths of the Facebook advertising platform is its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/13/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-world">targeting capabilities</a>. Facebook harvests a huge amount of data from its users, which allows advertisers to leverage advanced targeting tactics that can deliver exceptional results.</p>
<p>You can also easily extend Facebook ad campaigns onto the Instagram platform, which is great for securing incremental reach and targeting new audiences.</p>

<p><a id="tiktok"></a></p>
<h2>What are TikTok ads?</h2>
<p>Now time for some<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/22/tiktok-ads"> TikTok advertising 101</a>. Like Facebook ads, TikTok ads are also available in a range of different formats.</p>
<p>However, while Facebook ads can appear in several different positions throughout the app (e.g., Reels, Stories, Messenger) the majority of TikTok ads are served in and around the main feed.</p>
<p>Standard TikTok video ads (i.e. In-Feed ads, Top View ads, etc.) are capable of generating huge audience reach and sky-high levels of engagement, which is why they’re popular with both smaller businesses and established corporations (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/11/advertising-on-tiktok">more on why you should advertise on TikTok here</a>).</p>
<p>For brands looking to make a statement on TikTok, formats like Branded Effects and Branded Hashtag Challenges can also be incredibly impactful.</p>
<p>These ads are designed to drive mass user engagement and incremental reach, and many brands have achieved viral fame by utilizing these creative formats.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt <a href="https://upbeatagency.com/are-tiktok-ads-effective-and-worth-the-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok ads can be highly effective</a> for digital advertisers, particularly if you’re able to tap into popular trends (like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/17/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok">Stitching</a>) and create content that resonates with your target audience.</p>

<h2>Facebook ads vs TikTok ads: Head to Head</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s time for a good old-fashioned social media showdown. We&#8217;ve done a comparison on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/16/tiktok-vs-instagram-reels-ads">TikTok ads vs Instagram Reels ads</a>, now it&#8217;s time to compare Facebook and TikTok in a few key marketing areas and see how these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/18/social-media-advertising">paid social</a> powerhouses stack up against one another.</p>
<h3>Costs</h3>
<p>To kick things off, let’s examine the <a href="https://leadsbridge.com/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-advertise-on-tiktok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average costs associated with TikTok ads:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>TikTok average CPM (cost per mille): $10.00</li>
<li>TikTok average CPC (cost per click): $1.00</li>
</ul>
<p>For comparison, below are the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/12/facebook-ads-cost">average costs of Facebook ads</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook average CPM: $7.00</li>
<li>Facebook CPC (Cost Per Click) &#8211; $1.00</li>
</ul>
<p>Both platforms are evenly matched when it comes to their average CPC, but Facebook is significantly cheaper than TikTok in terms of CPM. As a result, Facebook takes the victory in this category, enabling brands to achieve more cost-efficient reach.</p>
<p>However, this does come with a caveat.</p>
<p>It’s worth remembering that your campaign costs will be influenced by many factors, including your industry, target audience, ad formats, and bidding strategy. The above figures can be used as a helpful guide, but they’re certainly not written in stone.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/facebook-cpc-revealbot.png" alt="facebook ads average cost per click" width="720" height="418" class="size-full wp-image-70033 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/facebook-cpc-revealbot.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/facebook-cpc-revealbot-480x279.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://revealbot.com/facebook-advertising-costs/cpc-cost-per-click" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<h3>Demographics</h3>
<p>Now let’s break down the demographic profiles of the Facebook and TikTok audiences.</p>
<p>TikTok is known for its insane popularity among younger generations, and the data certainly backs this up. A whopping 41.7% of TikTok users fall into the 18-24 bracket &#8211; 31% are aged 25-34, while just 24.1% are aged over 35.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/tiktok-user-distribution-2023.png" alt="tiktok user distribution worldwide" width="720" height="487" class="size-full wp-image-70035 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/tiktok-user-distribution-2023.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/tiktok-user-distribution-2023-480x325.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1299771/tiktok-global-user-age-distribution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>Facebook, on the other hand, attracts a broader mix of age groups. Just 22.6% of the Facebook audience falls under the 18-24 umbrella, while 31% of the user base is aged 25-34, making this the largest segment on the platform.</p>
<p>Older generations are also better represented on Facebook, with 41% of users over the age of 35 compared to just 24.1% on TikTok.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/facebook-user-distribution-statista.png" alt="facebook user distribution worldwide" width="720" height="473" class="size-full wp-image-70034 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/facebook-user-distribution-statista.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/facebook-user-distribution-statista-480x315.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/376128/facebook-global-user-age-distribution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>So, what does this mean for marketers?</p>
<p>Well, if you’re interested in targeting Gen Z and younger millennial shoppers, TikTok is the place to be. The platform is massively influential among younger audiences, with data suggesting that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/gen-bypassing-google-tiktok-search-engine/story?id=88493981">40% of Gen Z</a> prefer using TikTok for searches rather than Google.</p>
<p>For brands less focused on younger generations, Facebook offers a more balanced user base, as well as a significantly higher reach. Facebook boasts around <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/#:~:text=How%20many%20users%20does%20Facebook,used%20online%20social%20network%20worldwide.">2.96bn monthly active users</a>, compared to TikTok’s <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tik-tok-statistics/">1.2bn monthly users</a>.</p>
<h3>Targeting</h3>
<p>Audience targeting is fairly standardized across TikTok and Facebook, with both platforms offering basic options such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Demographic targeting</em></li>
<li><em>Interest targeting</em></li>
<li><em>Behavior targeting</em></li>
<li><em>Device targeting</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em> <img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-720.png" alt="privacy-first facebook ad targeting guide" width="720" height="720" class="size-full wp-image-57051 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-720.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-720-480x480.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></em></p>
<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f537.png" alt="🔷" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong> Free guide!</strong></span></p>

<p>Advertisers can also build pixel data-fuelled Custom Audiences on both TikTok and Facebook, as well as generate Lookalikes based on these segments.</p>
<p>However, the main difference here is that Facebook has been collecting and harnessing audience data for significantly longer than TikTok.</p>
<p>Facebook first introduced its ad platform way back in 2007, while TikTok ads only launched in 2020. That’s a sizable head start for Facebook, meaning the platform has access to a lot more user data and audience insights that can be used to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/13/facebook-advertising-tips">improve campaign performance</a>.</p>
<p>Although TikTok and Facebook offer near-identical targeting options, Facebook has the edge because it&#8217;s sitting on a goldmine of historical data. (But we do break down some effective <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/23/tiktok-ads-targeting">TikTok ads targeting</a> strategies you should try here.)</p>
<h3>Formats</h3>
<p>TikTok and Facebook both offer a range of versatile ad formats, so let’s compare their offerings head-to-head.</p>
<p>Facebook allows advertisers to utilize the following ad formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Image ads</li>
<li>Video ads</li>
<li>Carousel ads</li>
<li>In-Stream Video ads</li>
<li>Stories ads</li>
<li>Collection ads</li>
<li>Messenger ads</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/facebook-messenger-ads-example.png" alt="facebook messenger ad example" width="505" height="497" class="wp-image-70037 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/facebook-messenger-ads-example.png 505w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/facebook-messenger-ads-example-480x473.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 505px, 100vw" /> A Facebook Messenger ad example. </em><em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/success/2-optus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Image source)</a></em></p>
<p>Below are the ad formats available on TikTok:</p>
<ul>
<li>In-Feed ads</li>
<li>Top View ads</li>
<li>Brand Takeover ads</li>
<li>Branded Hashtag ads</li>
<li>Branded Effects ads</li>
<li>Collection ads</li>
</ul>
<p><em> <img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/tik-tok-ad-examples.png" alt="tik tok ad examples" width="720" height="408" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-70036" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/tik-tok-ad-examples.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/tik-tok-ad-examples-480x272.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en/inspiration/next-681" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>Once again, this category is remarkably close between the two platforms. Both Facebook and TikTok offer ad formats that can be used to achieve specific objectives. For example, In-Feed video ads to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/05/brand-awareness-campaigns">build brand awareness</a>, or Collection ads to drive conversions.</p>
<p>The key difference here is that Facebook ads can be served in multiple environments across the app, while the TikTok platform design is more streamlined.</p>
<p>For example, Messenger and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/07/instagram-story-ads">Stories ads</a> appear in completely separate sections of the Facebook site, while TikTok ads are delivered in (or around) the home feed.</p>
<p>If you’re keen to test out a broad range of versatile ad formats, Facebook is a great option. However, if you want to maximize visibility, the simpler layout of TikTok may be more appealing.</p>
<h3>Analytics</h3>
<p>The ability to monitor, analyze, and optimize your paid social ad performance is crucial for success.</p>
<p>So which of these networks is best suited for campaign measurement?</p>
<p>The truth is that Facebook and TikTok are both well-equipped in the analytics department.</p>
<p>As marketing platforms, both Facebook and TikTok are designed to help advertisers achieve optimal results through accurate and accessible analytics. Each platform offers a built-in analytics dashboard (i.e. the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/ads-manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Ads Manager</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-GB/solutions/ads-manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok Ads Manager</a>) that enables brands to monitor performance, create custom reports, and track conversions.</p>
<p>Beyond basic analytics, Facebook and TikTok also offer additional measurement options, such as Brand Lift studies and the ability to implement a tracking pixel on your website.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/brand-lift-study-facebook-ads.png" alt="brand lift study in facebook ads" width="720" height="355" class="size-full wp-image-70038 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/brand-lift-study-facebook-ads.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/brand-lift-study-facebook-ads-480x237.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>

<p>You’ll never struggle to track and analyze your ad performance on either of these platforms, so this category is a clear draw.</p>

<a id="tips"></a></p>
<h2>How to use Facebook &amp; TikTok ads together</h2>
<p>TikTok and Facebook ads together are effective and profitable for businesses old and new, big and small.</p>
<p>Both platforms have their own unique strengths and marketing opportunities, which begs the question: How can you leverage both partners to accelerate your returns?</p>
<p>Let’s explore how you can combine Facebook and TikTok ads to drive optimum performance.</p>
<h3>1. Gather &amp; implement insights across platforms</h3>
<p>If you want to grow your business in today&#8217;s environment, a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/24/cross-channel-marketing-mistakes">cross-channel advertising</a> strategy is a must. This means running ads on different channels like search and social, as well as on different platforms within these channels, like on TikTok and Facebook within social.</p>
<p>Running ad campaigns across multiple social media platforms enables you to collect more insights and apply more learnings. Be sure to frequently analyze your campaign reports on both TikTok and Facebook to identify these valuable cross-platform opportunities.</p>
<p>For instance, there may be a high-performing Facebook audience segment that you can replicate on TikTok or an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/24/design-facebook-ads-free">effective creative asset</a> that you can repurpose across platforms.</p>
<h3>2. Strengthen your brand identity</h3>
<p>I emphasized the importance of solidifying your brand identity in my <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/12/06/facebook-advertising-trends">Facebook trends</a> post and this applies across platforms as well.</p>
<p>To do so, maintain a clear tone of voice across these platforms, use the same branding elements (colors, fonts, imagery, vibes), and regularly interact with your audience on both networks. Consistency is a great way to build trust among consumers, so use both Facebook and TikTok as a launchpad for your brand.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/brand-consistency-social-ads-beetology.png" alt="brand consistency across social ads" width="495" height="436" class=" wp-image-70046 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/brand-consistency-social-ads-beetology.png 495w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/brand-consistency-social-ads-beetology-480x422.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 495px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>3. Expand your campaign reach</h3>
<p>This may sound obvious, but make sure that you’re using Facebook and TikTok to effectively increase your overall reach and frequency.</p>
<p>Both of these networks give you access to unique audiences and specific demographics, so take full advantage of this. Experiment with different target audiences to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/26/prospecting-strategies-ppc-agencies">discover new prospects</a>, and make sure that both platforms have sufficient budget for scaling up (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/08/how-to-scale-facebook-ads">how to scale your Facebook ads here</a>).</p>
<h2><em></em>Maximize your Facebook &amp; TikTok ad returns</h2>
<p>TikTok and Facebook can both deliver outstanding results when used individually, but when these social media giants are combined, the sky’s the limit.</p>
<p>By capitalizing on the strengths of each platform and following some of these best practices, you can transform your paid social marketing into a well-oiled, conversion-driving machine.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook has a lot to offer advertisers, from impressive scale to data-driven audience segments and tactical ad formats. In fact, the average Facebook user clicks on <a href="https://adespresso.com/blog/facebook-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11</a> ads per month and<a href="https://www.kleinerperkins.com/perspectives/internet-trends-report-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 78%</a> of U.S. consumers have made purchases through discoveries on Facebook.</p>
<p>But social media moves at a dizzying speed. New features are constantly released, fresh audience trends emerge (and then inevitably vanish) and new marketing strategies explode in popularity.</p>
<p>As a Facebook advertiser, which trends should you look out for in 2025 and how can you stay ahead of the curve?</p>
<p>While we <em>don&#8217;t</em> have a crystal ball, we <em>do</em> have a wealth of paid social expertise and years of experience with running campaigns. And with that, we&#8217;re going to share:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four trends we think advertisers can expect from Facebook in 2025.</li>
<li>Seven tips to help you outshine your competitors and scale your success.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4 key Facebook trends to watch out for next year</h2>
<p>Before we get into the tips for <a href="https://upbeatagency.com/how-to-create-facebook-ads/">creating Facebook ads</a> in 2025, here’s a look at some key trends that we think will shape the overall <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/facebook-advertising-benchmarks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook marketing and advertising</a> landscape.</p>
<p><a id="video"></a></p>
<h3>1. Video advertising will remain insanely popular</h3>
<p>The popularity of social media video advertising has increased dramatically over time, and video ads are now used by a wide range of different businesses.</p>
<p>This isn’t surprising when you consider that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/25/facebook-video-ads">Facebook video ads</a> enable marketers to tell in-depth brand stories and showcase their products with eye-catching assets.</p>
<p>Plus, Facebook has invested heavily in its video offering.

<h3>2. Short-form video will reign supreme</h3>
<p>Short-form content came onto the scene with Vine, exploded in popularity with TikTok, and is now taking over multiple social media platforms—Facebook included. In fact, short-form videos have now become the default content type for many social feeds, and this trend will only continue to grow in 2025.</p>
<p>Facebook actually beats TikTok when it comes to short-form video consumption among US audiences (Source: <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/facebook-statistics/#Facebook_video_stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hootsuite</a>). This may seem surprising, but it speaks to the rapid uptake of short-form content across different social platforms.</p>

<h3>3. The &#8220;TikTokification&#8221; of creative content</h3>
<p>TikTok is a social media phenomenon. The platform has swiftly acquired a colossal audience (that’s still growing) and is now leading the charge when it comes to producing new social trends and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/types-of-social-media-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media content ideas</a>.</p>
<p>Influencer-style direct-to-camera videos are hugely popular on TikTok, and this type of content is now infiltrating every social media platform. If you want to avoid falling behind the competition, they’ll need to embrace the TikTok takeover.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/facebook-reels-examples.png" alt="facebook reels examples" width="720" height="358" class="size-full wp-image-68276 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/facebook-reels-examples.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/facebook-reels-examples-480x239.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>

<p>The same also applies to hashtag challenges, user trends, and viral audio tracks.

<h3>4. Shoppable ads will be adopted at scale</h3>
<p>Facebook has been consistently refining its social shopping offering over time, and the lines between online shopping and social media are becoming increasingly blurred.</p>
<p>Facebook Shops came onto the scene in early 2020, which allowed businesses to showcase and sell their products directly through the Facebook and Instagram apps.</p>
<p>Since then, the platform has continued to develop new social selling solutions. Facebook recently launched <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/guides/advantage-shopping-campaigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advantage+ Shopping</a> ads that enable brands to test creative variations and drive conversions through fully automated campaigns.</p>
<p>For ecommerce and direct-to-consumer retail businesses, setting up an efficient and optimized Facebook shopping presence will be key in 2025.

<h3>1. Establish a clear creative direction</h3>
<p>Wondering which creative style is going to drive the best results for your brand on Facebook? The classic user-generated content-style Facebook ads produce excellent results, especially for solution-based ecommerce products or lead-generation campaigns. This type of content tends to be less polished, with fewer logos and branded elements.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/user-generated-content-facebook.png" alt="user generated content on facebook" width="600" height="676" class="size-full wp-image-68279 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/user-generated-content-facebook.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/user-generated-content-facebook-480x541.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>However, many advertisers have now adopted this approach. You may want to try out trending sounds and engaging visuals to stand out in a competitive feed. If you’re in the fashion or clothing industry, consider creating more polished videos with premium-style imagery, fast motion, and strong branding.  Audiences expect to see clothing products showcased upfront, so make sure that you’re placing your wares on center stage.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/24/design-facebook-ads-free">Here are some of the best free tools for designing Facebook ads like a pro.</a></p>

<a id="advantage"></a></p>
<h3>2. Try out Advantage+ campaigns</h3>
<p>Advantage+ campaigns are an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/27/facebook-automated-rules">automated campaign type</a> where Facebook optimizes campaign settings to maximize returns. They&#8217;re essentially streamlined conversion campaigns that reduce manual inputs for advertisers and save them time. Advantage+ will also run campaigns specifically for catalog ads and app installs, and automatically optimize your creative assets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/facebook-advantage-campaigns.png" alt="facebook advantage plus campaign example" width="720" height="361" class="size-full wp-image-68280 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/facebook-advantage-campaigns.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/facebook-advantage-campaigns-480x241.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1720288338140238"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>Advantage+ campaigns have delivered positive returns for many brands so far, so they’re worth pursuing, particularly for newer advertisers. Plus, Facebook is likely to continue improving the Advantage+ product, meaning these campaigns are a safe bet for the foreseeable future.</p>

<a id="scale"></a></p>
<h3>3. Use cost per result bidding to scale budget</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/08/how-to-scale-facebook-ads">Effectively scaling up your Facebook campaigns</a> is crucial to generating more conversions and improving the efficiency of your ad spend.</p>
<p><strong>Cost per result goal bidding</strong> (formerly cost cap) is a reliable and efficient method for budget scaling and can deliver consistent results for Facebook advertisers in 2025. Start by testing out several bids through CBO (Campaign Budget Optimization) with a minimum spend on each ad set. Since Facebook will automatically test various bids across different ranges, you’ll be able to scale up successful tactics quickly and effectively.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/facebook-ads-bidding-cost-per-result-goal.png" alt="facebook ads bidding - cost per result goal" width="600" height="500" class="size-full wp-image-65848 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/facebook-ads-bidding-cost-per-result-goal.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/facebook-ads-bidding-cost-per-result-goal-480x400.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You’ll also be able to leverage these insights to set up larger ABO (Ad Budget Optimization) campaigns with increased spend on the best bids.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a sufficient budget for testing multiple bids, then set up one ad set with a cost-cap bid slightly higher than your current Facebook CPA.<br />
<a id="broad"></a></p>
<h3>4. Guide the algorithm with broad targeting</h3>
<p>You’ll need to stick to <strong>broad audience targeting</strong> while scaling up your campaigns to allow the algorithm to collect data and implement optimizations. Stack Interest categories that have performed well previously to increase audience size.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/how-to-scale-facebook-ads-detailed-targeting.png" alt="how to scale facebook ads - detailed targeting" width="720" height="352" class="size-full wp-image-61646 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/how-to-scale-facebook-ads-detailed-targeting.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/how-to-scale-facebook-ads-detailed-targeting-480x235.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It’s also important to guide the ad account in the early stages of your campaign if you’re on a small budget.</p>
<p>Try and use interest targeting to build relevant audience segments initially, and once you’ve collected enough data, test out broader audiences with no interest layers to scale up your campaign.</p>
<p>If you want to skyrocket your campaign scaling, don’t obsess over finding the perfect ad for a specific target audience. Test everything on larger audiences to generate valuable insights and find a broad creative appeal that resonates with the majority of users.</p>
<h3>5. Be patient with your Facebook ad sets</h3>
<p>Whenever you make changes to your Facebook ads, you reset the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/13/learning-period">algorithmic learning period</a>. So try to avoid tweaking or adjusting your ad sets, particularly in the early stages of a campaign, to allow them to optimize effectively. This has always been advisable, and it seems like this will be more important than ever in 2025.</p>
<p>Monitor ad set delivery to ensure that your results are improving over time and stick to 20% scaling every couple of days to maintain optimal performance. If you need to scale faster, duplicate the ad set to experiment with different tactics.<br />
<a id="placements"></a></p>
<h3>6. Use multiple placements &amp; formats</h3>
<p>Facebook offers advertisers a wide range of high-performing placements and formats, so make sure you’re capitalizing on these opportunities with a proper balance of image, video, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/21/facebook-carousel-ads">carousel ads</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ad-placements-preview.jpg" alt="" width="607" height="420" class="size-full wp-image-12683 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ad-placements-preview.jpg 607w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ad-placements-preview-480x332.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 607px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in ecommerce, TikTok-style reel videos can also deliver tremendous performance, so be sure to jump on this trend before it becomes too saturated.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, creativity will be key to differentiating yourself from the competition in 2025, so focus on engaging and unique executions. Adapt popular content styles from the likes of TikTok and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/22/instagram-reels-ideas-for-businesses">Instagram Reels</a> (e.g. presenters talking to members of the public, trending sounds, and hashtag challenges) and act decisively to avoid missing out.<br />
<a id="reporting"></a></p>
<h3>7. Make the most of improved Facebook reporting features</h3>
<p>iOS and other privacy updates have caused disruptions in the Facebook targeting and reporting ecosystem, but Facebook has been working on improvements and solutions that you can (and should) use to your advantage when <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/26/how-to-optimize-facebook-ads">optimizing your Facebook campaigns</a>.</p>
<p>For example, the reintroduction of the 28-day click attribution window<b> </b>will be valuable for harvesting more granular insights and viewing demographic audience breakdowns in the ad account. Also, the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/06/facebook-conversions-api">Facebook Conversions API</a> can help you close gaps in pixel data resulting from the deprecation of third-party cookies.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-facebook-conversions-api-works-1.png" alt="" width="720" height="361" class="size-full wp-image-50355 aligncenter" /></p>
<p>Facebook is likely to continue developing tools that enable brands to close the gap on attribution, so be sure to explore these new features to enhance your reports. The more campaign data you can access, the easier it will be to implement effective optimizations.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that new terms for self-serve ads manager accounts suggest that Facebook is both reducing its accountability and tightening restrictions, so keep an eye on these updates to stay in the loop.</p>
