<p>LinkedIn is a thriving platform that millions of professionals use to keep up with their industry, find jobs, grow their skills, and build their networks—making it a powerful marketing tool for B2B businesses, no matter how big or small.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to use LinkedIn to market your business, but your first and foremost priority should be getting your company page right.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/linkedin-company-page-gannett.png" width="720" height="417" alt="gannett linkedin company page" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>Luckily, over the past year or two, LinkedIn has introduced several features to aid in your LinkedIn marketing efforts. So today, we&#8217;re going to be covering:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to create a complete LinkedIn company page</li>
<li>10 LinkedIn marketing features you need to be using</li>
<li>Four examples of LinkedIn company pages</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why create a LinkedIn company page?</h2>
<p>With <a href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/linkedin-statistics/">756 million</a> members making over one billion interactions each month, a great company page is your access point into this powerful community. It gives a snapshot of your business, including company details, products and services, and culture. You can use it to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate thought leadership.</li>
<li>Educate and inspire your audience.</li>
<li>Express your brand voice and values.</li>
<li>Attract top talent.</li>
<li>Build a community.</li>
<li>Network effectively</li>
<li>Improve your discoverability on Google</li>
<li>Show prospects the people behind your company</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, LinkedIn is the top content distribution channel for <a href="https://siteefy.com/internet-statistics/">94%</a> of B2B marketers. But with so much happening on the platform, you need to create your company page the <em>right </em> way to stand out from all the noise.</p>
<h2>How to create a LinkedIn company page (the right way)</h2>
<p>To create a LinkedIn company page, make sure you&#8217;re logged into your personal account. Then go to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/setup/new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.linkedin.com/company/setup/new/</a> and let the platform walk you through the setup.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-create-linkedin-company-page.png" width="719" height="483" alt="linkedin company page creation window" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>Make sure you complete every section (including the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/linkedin-banner/">banner</a>) so you can get discovered by more of the right people and build your network of followers, connections, customers, and employees.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what a complete page will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>LinkedIn public URL</li>
<li>Tagline</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Profile photo (your logo)</li>
<li>Cover photo</li>
<li>Website</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Phone number</li>
<li>Industry</li>
<li>Company size</li>
<li>Company type</li>
<li>Year founded</li>
<li>Specialties</li>
<li>Hashtags (though relatively uncommon on LinkedIn)</li>
</ul>
<p>So let&#8217;s look at VentureFizz&#8217;s LinkedIn company page:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/linkedin-company-page-information-venturefizz.png" width="600" height="842" alt="example of complete linkedin company page by VentureFizz" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>From this snapshot, we can quickly learn that VentureFizz is a small, private, Pennsylvania-based company that helps professionals to discover the best jobs and companies in the tech industry.</p>
<p>And as you carry out your marketing activities, you&#8217;ll populate the rest of the tabs on your company page, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Posts</li>
<li>Jobs</li>
<li>People</li>
<li>Events</li>
<li>Videos</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/linkedin-company-page-tabs.png" width="600" height="827" alt="example of linkedin company page tabs by sendgrid" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>Okay so now that we&#8217;ve walked you through the basics, let&#8217;s get into the features and some more examples.</p>
<h2><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">10 LinkedIn company page features you need to be using</span></h2>
<p>Here are 10 powerful features you should be using on your LinkedIn company page so your business can attract followers, employees, and customers.</p>
<h3>1. LinkedIn Stories</h3>
<p>Like most other major social media networks, LinkedIn has now adopted stories, which refresh every 24 hours. Their twist to this is to “<em>Share what’s happening in your professional life</em>.”</p>
<p>Use this post type to share tips, updates, and hiring alerts, as well as to express your company culture.<em><strong> </strong></em>This feature also lets you add stickers or overlay text to your video or image, and followers can respond to your story through direct messages—making it even easier for you to start a conversation.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/linkedin-company-page-features-stories.png" width="300" height="646" alt="example of linkedin story" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/27/linkedin-stories">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>If you want to spice up the video further, you can use one of my favorite video editing tools called <a href="https://www.movavi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Movavi</a> to create the video offline and then upload the story to Linkedin. Most people don’t realize it, but this is what the more successful creators do to make their videos stand out on places like <a href="/blog/ws/2021/06/22/instagram-reels-ideas-for-businesses">Instagram Reels </a>and <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/11/advertising-on-tiktok">TikTok</a>.</p>
<h3>How to create a LinkedIn story:</h3>
<ol>
<li>On your homepage, tap on the &#8220;+&#8221; sign on your profile.</li>
<li>Upload a video or image from your gallery. Alternatively, you can record a new one.</li>
<li>Add stickers or text to your video or image.</li>
<li>You have the option to mention any relevant profiles.</li>
<li>Hit &#8220;Share Story&#8221;, and you&#8217;re done.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also add a call to action to your stories. For instance, if you’re able to offer a white paper to individuals who are interested in how your company can help them, you’d tell them to give their email address for access and then use <a href="https://www.onehourprofessor.com/best-email-marketing-software-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email marketing software</a> to automate a follow-up process to convert them to a customer.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2021/04/27/linkedin-stories">Get more LinkedIn Story tips and ideas here.</a></p>
<h3>2. Featured Posts</h3>
<p>The Featured Posts section is only available for individual accounts, but since your account impacts the way others see your business, we&#8217;re including it. Use it to highlight your best work and showcase your expertise and thought leadership.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a great example of featured posts by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/akdefazio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Akvile DeFazio</a>, president of Akvertise, Inc.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/linkedin-company-page-features-featured-posts-example.png" width="600" height="683" alt="example of featured posts on linkedin profile" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>You can either link to content you&#8217;ve created that&#8217;s already on the web, or upload media like PDFs, slide decks, photos, etc.</p>
<h3>How to add LinkedIn Featured Posts:</h3>
<ol>

<li>On the “featured” tab, click the plus icon.</li>
<li>Choose the content type (posts, articles, links, media)</li>
<li>Provide the required information.</li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-add-linkedin-featured-posts.png" width="720" height="376" alt="screenshot of adding linkedin featured posts" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>There is no limit to how many featured posts you can add, and you can reorder or delete them directly on your profile page.</p>
<h3>3. Polls</h3>
<p>LinkedIn polls are a great engagement tool where you can get quick feedback from your audience. Use it to find out the type of content your audience would like to see more of, or to identify the latest trends in your market so you can make better-informed decisions.</p>
<p>Below is an example from Drift, which uses LinkedIn polls to ask interesting, hypothetical questions that effectively get the audience involved:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/linkedin-company-page-poll-example.png" width="500" height="401" alt="example of linkedin company page poll" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/linkedin-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<h3>How to create polls on LinkedIn:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to your feed page.</li>
<li>Click the &#8220;+&#8221; icon to add a new post.</li>
<li>Click that three-dot icon to view more options.</li>
<li>Select &#8220;Create a poll.&#8221;
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/linkedin-company-page-how-to-create-polls.png" width="500" height="465" alt="create poll tab for linkedin company page" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</li>
<li>Next, add the question and answer options (max four options), and choose a duration for the poll (one day, three days, one week, or two weeks).
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/linkedin-company-page-features-create-a-poll.png" width="500" height="543" alt="poll settings on linkedin" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</li>
<li>Finally, click &#8220;Done&#8221; and share your poll as a regular post.</li>
</ol>
<h3>4. Events</h3>
<p>LinkedIn&#8217;s Events feature can help you boost the visibility of your <a href="/blog/ws/2018/04/25/event-marketing">online and offline events </a>and get more people to sign up.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/linkedin-company-page-events.png" width="500" height="620" alt="example of linkedin company page events section" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>You can make your event public or make it private and send individual invitations to the people in your network.</p>
<h3>How to create a LinkedIn event:</h3>
<ol>
<li>On your homepage, navigate to the Events tab located on the left side.</li>
<li>Click the &#8220;+&#8221; sign next to &#8220;Events.&#8221;</li>
<li>Add the details of your event, including the name, organizer, date, broadcast link, time, descriptions, etc.</li>
<li>Select event visibility.</li>
<li>When you&#8217;re done, click &#8220;Create&#8221;.</li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/linkedin-company-page-event-creation.png" width="500" height="513" alt="linkedin company page event creation tab" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>To give your event more reach, retarget the people who attended your previous events to promote your upcoming ones.</p>
<h3>5. Audience and comment privileges</h3>
<p>This is yet another great feature from LinkedIn that rolled out in January 2021 and allows you to adjust audience privileges on individual posts. You have five options for customizing post visibility, which are displayed under &#8220;<em>Who can see your post?</em>&#8221; section:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/linkedin-company-page-features-view-restrictions.png" width="400" height="346" alt="linkedin company page visibility settings" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>There are also three options to customize comment permissions, and these appear under “<em>Who can comment on your post?</em>”</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/linkedin-company-page-features-comment-settings.png" width="400" height="198" alt="comment settings for linkedin company page" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<h3>6. Name pronunciation</h3>
<p>Name pronunciation allows you to record how your name is pronounced and display the audio clip on your profile so others can listen to it. Granted, this isn’t necessarily for Linkedin Company pages, but it can be quite important.</p>
<p>This feature promotes <a href="/blog/ws/2020/11/5/accessibility-inclusivity-advertising">inclusivity</a> and is helpful to use before speaking to investors, potential customers, partners, and more.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/linkedin-company-page-features-name-pronounciation.png" width="500" height="283" alt="name pronunciation feature for linkedin profile" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://beebom.com/linkedin-display-name-pronuciation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<h3>How to record your name on LinkedIn:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to your profile page.</li>
<li>Click on the &#8220;Edit&#8221; icon.</li>
<li>Click &#8220;Add Name Pronunciation.&#8221;</li>
<li>Next, tap the &#8220;Record&#8221; icon and record your name.</li>
<li>If you want to re-record, simply click &#8220;Retake.&#8221;</li>
<li>Once happy with your recording, click &#8220;Apply.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/linkedin-company-page-features-record-name.png" width="300" height="271" alt="record name screen on linkedin" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<h3>7. Reactions</h3>
<p>With LinkedIn’s new “Reactions” feature, you no longer get a one-dimensional view of how users engage with your content. In addition to “liking” your post, they can now also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Celebrate</li>
<li>Show support</li>
<li>Give some love</li>
<li>Find it insightful</li>
<li>Express their curiosity</li>
</ul>
<p>So for example, you may get the “Support” reaction when you share news about your charitable efforts. This gives you a more well-rounded understanding of how people feel about your content.</p>
<p>To use post reactions, simply hover over “Like” and all the reaction symbols will popup as shown in the image below:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/linkedin-company-page-reactions-to-posts.png" width="450" height="411" alt="linkedin post reactions" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<h3>8. Organic “carousel” posts</h3>
<p>Before this new feature came around, whenever you wanted to share a series of images organically in a post, you had to upload it as a gallery, which was hard to navigate.</p>
<p>Now, you can share a multi-page PDF document on the platform and it will display it as a scrollable carousel.</p>
<p>This format makes it a lot easier to tell a coherent, engaging story or set of tips.</p>
<p>The example below shows a State of the Connected Customer report shared as a document by Salesforce, which previews in a convenient carousel format so people can easily scroll through it.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/linkedin-company-page-features-example-organic-carousel-posts.png" width="500" height="568" alt="linkedin organic carousel post example" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/salesforce_4th-connected-customers-report-activity-6734618241097986048-qlew/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<h3>How to create an organic carousel post on LinkedIn:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Click on the option to create a new post.</li>
<li>Select the document icon.</li>
<li>Choose which document you want to share.</li>
<li>Add a document title.</li>
<li>To save and publish, click “Done.”</li>
</ol>
<h3>9. LinkedIn Live</h3>
<p>These days, live video is pivotal for<a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business"> social media marketing</a> and engagement. That&#8217;s why so many people greeted the new LinkedIn Live feature with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Compared to native videos on the platform, live videos from the same broadcasters receive up to <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/linkedin-live#:~:text=Live%20videos%20get%2C%20on%20average%207x%20more%20reactions%20and%2024x,of%20meaningful%20reach%20and%20engagement." target="_blank" rel="noopener">7x </a>more reactions. They also get up to 24x more comments, which is something that marketers looking to boost real-time engagement will appreciate.</p>
<p>Use it to conduct interviews with industry experts, run Q&amp;A sessions, share your latest case study, or talk through a benchmarks report. You can even use LinkedIn Live to broadcast product launches and live events, like BMW did:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/linkedin-company-page-features-linkedin-live-example.png" width="720" height="346" alt="linkedin company page feature — linkedin live" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/video/live/urn:li:ugcPost:6777248338237505536/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>Just keep in mind that this feature isn&#8217;t yet available to everyone. You must apply in order to get access.</p>
<h3>10. Lead gen forms in product pages</h3>
<p><a href="https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/linkedin-pages/product-pages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product pages</a>, a feature that was added in 2020, allow brands to <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">promote specific products</a> so organizations can provide overviews, showcase product reviews, and answer questions in one centralized place.</p>
<p>Thanks to a recent addition to the platform&#8217;s features, brands can now add lead generation forms <em>directly </em>to product pages on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>These forms can autopopulate with user information at the click of a button—a feature that most marketers will appreciate as it helps to <a href="/blog/ws/2015/08/10/increase-conversion-rates">improve conversion rates</a>.</p>
<h2>Great examples of LinkedIn company pages</h2>
<p>Here are three fantastic examples of LinkedIn company pages, as well as a brief explanation of what makes each of them great. Use them as inspiration to help you capitalize on the opportunities offered by these new LinkedIn company page features.</p>
<h3>1. Unilever</h3>
<p>Unilever is a consumer goods company that specializes in food and drink, as well as beauty, cleaning, and personal care products. With over 15 million followers on LinkedIn, they must be doing something right.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/linkedin-company-page-example-unilever.png" width="720" height="385" alt="great linkedin company page example by unilever" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/unilever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View Unilever&#8217;s LinkedIn company page here</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>What makes this page so great?</strong></p>
<p>Unilever&#8217;s LinkedIn company page is an excellent expression of its <a href="/blog/ws/2021/06/09/company-core-values">core values</a> and <a href="/blog/ws/2021/07/02/how-to-write-a-business-mission-statement">mission statement</a>. There are partnerships, employee stories, articles about the company&#8217;s nonprofit efforts, and content that celebrates other companies making a difference in the world. Check out their colorful and attractive &#8220;Life&#8221; tab:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/linkedin-company-page-example-unilever-leadership-team.png" width="600" height="554" alt="great example of linkedin company page by unilever—leadership team" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/unilever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View Unilever&#8217;s LinkedIn company page here</a>.</em></p>
<p>This LinkedIn page does a great job of showcasing Unilever as a great company to partner with or work for.</p>
<h3>2. Jabil</h3>
<p>Jabil also keeps a finger on the community’s pulse and uses its LinkedIn company page to shares its nonprofit initiatives—in particular, participating in a wide range of local events for the American Heart Association, breast cancer research, Veterans Day, and more.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/linkedin-company-page-example-jabil.png" width="720" height="494" alt="linkedin company page example by jabil" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/jabil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View Jabil&#8217;s LinkedIn company page here</a></em></p>
<p><strong>What makes this page so great? </strong></p>
<p>One of the things that make this page so awesome is that it showcases <a href="/blog/ws/2021/04/28/diversity-in-marketing">diversity in the company&#8217;s workforce</a>.</p>
<p>It elevates employee faces and voices and puts a spotlight on their community work. The company also regularly shares inspiring and heart-lifting quote cards on their page, which helps to keep users engaged and coming back for more.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/linkedin-company-page-example-jabil-team-headshots.png" width="720" height="426" alt="linkedin company page example by jabil — diverse leadership team" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/jabil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View Jabil&#8217;s LinkedIn company page here.</a></em></p>
<h3>3. Coca-Cola</h3>
<p>Coca-Cola&#8217;s LinkedIn company page regularly highlights content from its widely successful digital magazine that has turned out thousands of stories since its launch nearly a decade ago.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/linkedin-company-page-example-coca-cola.png" width="720" height="514" alt="great example of linkedin company page by coca cola" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-coca-cola-company/life/9fde2cd8-05f6-4e42-a322-01aec5d580f6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View Coca Cola&#8217;s LinkedIn company page here.</a></em></p>
<p><strong>What makes this page so great?</strong></p>
<p>While you may see more consumer-focused content from Coca-Cola on Facebook, it shares more business innovation, jobs, and workplace content for its older and more professional audience on LinkedIn, as evidenced by the <em>Life </em>section on their LinkedIn company page:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/linkedin-company-page-example-coca-cola-life.png" width="600" height="782" alt="great linkedin company page example by coca cola" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-coca-cola-company/life/9fde2cd8-05f6-4e42-a322-01aec5d580f6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View Coca Cola&#8217;s LinkedIn company page here</a></em></p>
<h2>Get more out of your LinkedIn company page</h2>
<p>Marketing and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/05/linkedin-advertising">advertising on LinkedIn</a> makes a lot of sense whether businesses use it to attract prospective employees, investors, partners, or customers. But, to get the most out of the platform, you need to have a stand-out company page. So make sure you populate every section and make use of these features!</p>
<ol>
<li>LinkedIn Stories</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On YouTube, first impressions matter. One of the most effective ways to win the hearts of new viewers on your channel is with a captivating trailer.</p>
<p>In this article, you will learn how to make a great trailer for a powerful YouTube hook.</p>
<h2>What is a YouTube channel trailer?</h2>
<p>A YouTube channel trailer is a video designed to help viewers quickly learn about your channel. When enabled, the trailer is displayed at the top of your YouTube channel page and plays automatically for your non-subscribed visitors.</p>
<p>The trailer is crucial because if you&#8217;re going to put in the effort to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promote your YouTube channel</a>, you&#8217;ll need a way to convert that traffic into subscribers.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you should include in your trailer in order to hook viewers in immediately:</p>
<ul>
<li>A quick introduction of your business and who your channel is for (bloggers, hikers, gamers, etc.).</li>
<li>An overview of the type of video content you publish.</li>
<li>A highlight reel of your video content.</li>
<li>Your schedule for uploading videos.</li>
<li>A compelling call to action (CTA) encouraging viewers to subscribe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s a super simple YouTube channel trailer template from Biteable:</p>
<div><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/youtube-channel-trailer-template-biteable-1.png" alt="screenshot of youtube channel trailer template by biteable" width="720" height="403" /></div>
<h2>How to create a YouTube channel trailer</h2>
<p>So how can you create a YouTube channel trailer that covers all the bases above in an interesting way? Let&#8217;s dive in.</p>
<h3>1. Step into your viewers&#8217; shoes</h3>
<p>To create an awesome YouTube channel trailer, you should assume that the viewer knows absolutely nothing about you or your brand and ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does the viewer immediately want to know about my channel?</li>
<li>What knowledge is most important to impart in the first few seconds?</li>
<li>How do I want the viewer to <em><a href="/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">feel</a> </em>after watching my channel trailer?</li>
<li>Why should they be compelled to return to my channel?</li>
<li>What tone should I use—playful, humorous, serious, informative?</li>
<li>What color schemes and fonts are aligned with my brand?</li>
</ul>
<p>Viewers should be certain that they’ve found the right channel for them in the first 5-10 seconds &#8211; just from the information you provide them within your video trailer.</p>
<p>These questions are crucial to achieving your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/28/facebook-video-marketing">video marketing</a> goals, whether that&#8217;s to build a community or <a href="https://www.onehourprofessor.com/how-to-make-money-on-youtube/">make money on YouTube</a>. When you understand what your audience wants—and not what you <em>think</em> they want—you’ll be able to serve up valuable content.</p>
<h3>2. Create a well-structured script</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to be speaking in your trailer, write a script or jot down some talking points for your video.</p>
<p>Structure your video from start to finish and put a clear and compelling message in it. The more succinct and impactful your channel trailer, the more effectively it will work to get you <a href="/blog/ws/2020/05/14/how-to-get-more-views-on-youtube">more views</a> and new subscribers on YouTube.</p>
<p>From the words and images appearing on the screen to the music and sounds that viewers hear, everything should clearly communicate your channel’s message <em>and </em>match the way your <a href="/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">brand looks and feels</a>.</p>
<p>Here is an example of an awesome (scripted) channel trailer:</p>
<div style=text-align:center;>
<div class="video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video"><iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bNk5lrcSwkk?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Important Note: </strong>Using a script or outline for your trailer is important even if you&#8217;re not someone who <a href="https://www.g2.com/categories/social-media-mgmt#learn-more">usually plans out their videos</a>.</p>
<p>You have to cover a lot of material, and you only have a minute or so in which to do it. A script will help you avoid a lot of &#8220;<em>umms</em>&#8221; and make it possible for you to hit all your key points in the least amount of time possible.</p>
<h3>3. Use captions and clips</h3>
<p>To make your trailer more appealing, combine short scenes, sounds, text (either music or voiceover, or both). Add a short title within the first screen or list out key topics you&#8217;re covering in the video.</p>
<p>Also, you may want to use captions for those watching the trailer with the sound off. Maybe they&#8217;re listening to music at the same time, or were put off when it started playing automatically.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of a captioned YouTube channel trailer:</p>
<div><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/youtube-channel-trailer-what-you-will-share-1.png" alt="youtube channel trailer screenshot with text overlay" width="720" height="398" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qT3huBQQabQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View channel trailer here</a></em></p>
<h3>4. Include music and high-quality graphics</h3>
<p>Nothing draws in your viewers more than animated graphics combined with the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/18/music-in-ads">right music</a>. Great visuals will keep your viewers spellbound, and the music will set the tone and energy for your channel trailer.</p>
<p>Just make sure that you only pick music and graphics that are consistent with your words, channel, and brand<strong>.</strong> A cohesive brand image leads to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">increased brand awareness</a>, making your company and its product memorable and recognizable to viewers.</p>
<p>There is plenty of <a href="https://www.onehourprofessor.com/best-graphic-design-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">graphic design software</a> that makes it easy to keep your images consistent and high-quality.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Appealing to the senses in your video trailer can <a href="/blog/ws/2021/01/13/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing">emotionally</a> move your viewers to subscribe.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>While not a channel trailer, Asana shows a good example of unique illustrations:</p>
<div><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/youtube-channel-trailer-illustration-style-1.png" alt="youtube channel trailer tips—example of illustrative video" width="720" height="405" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY0-gsNImlk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View video here</a></em></p>
<p>According to expert video strategists, it&#8217;s important to keep the viewer’s eyes moving so you can retain their attention on your video.</p>
<p>This aspect is particularly important because, as you know, YouTube channel homepages often look quite &#8220;busy&#8221;.</p>
<p>Everywhere you look there are buttons, playlists, <a href="https://instasize.com/blog/how-to-create-eye-catching-youtube-thumbnails" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video thumbnails</a>, and even an option for visitors to leave your channel altogether!</p>
<p>But, although fast-moving, dynamic footage has been shown to increase engagement, keep in mind that this type of content isn’t ideal for <em>all </em>YouTube channels—like a meditation channel, for instance.</p>
<p>However, you <em>can </em>still use elements like text, visually appealing images, and short scenes to draw your viewer’s immediate attention.</p>
<h3>5. Keep it short</h3>
<p>The entire point of a YouTube channel trailer is to pitch great things about yourself, your brand, and your content to new viewers in <strong>the quickest way possible</strong>.</p>
<p>So, unlike <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/13/explainer-videos">explainer videos</a> (which are great within your channel), the channel trailer itself should instantly arrest the attention of your viewers and in a few short seconds, convey all the information they need to decide whether or not yours is the right channel for them.</p>
<p>After all, what are the odds that someone will sit through a five or ten-minute video before deciding whether or not they are in the right place?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Although there isn&#8217;t a “perfect” length for a YouTube channel trailer, you should aim for about 30 to 90 seconds. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This should be sufficient for you to tell new visitors who you are, what type of content to expect from your YouTube channel, and when you will be posting new uploads.</p>
<p>Remember, when it comes to YouTube channel trailers, less is more.</p>
<h3>6. Show highlights</h3>
<p>As YouTube says, &#8220;Show, don&#8217;t tell&#8221;. In addition to sharing all the important information pertaining to your brand and channel, you can also show your audience a highlight reel that makes them want to view the videos in your channel.</p>
<p>And make sure these are actual highlights from actual videos in your channel. This will save you from <em>unsubscribes </em>down the line when it turns out that your videos weren&#8217;t at all what new subscribers expected.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re worried that you won&#8217;t have enough time to give your audience the information they need <em>as well as</em> show a highlight reel, don&#8217;t worry. You can do both at the same time. Will Smith’s YouTube channel trailer is essentially one big highlight reel.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/youtube-channel-trailer-will-smith-highlight-reel-1.png" alt="youtube channel trailer tips—example of trailer using highlight footage" width="720" height="430" /></div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFknCgyJOI4">View video here</a></p>
<p>As a small business, you’re not going to have extreme highlights like this, but you can use short scenes to<strong> show your audience the nature and tone of your videos.</strong> Are they funny, educational, serious, relaxing, entertaining, actionable?</p>
<p>Highlights for your business might include are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bloopers and other funny clips</li>
<li>Clips that show the interesting ways you’ll provide information</li>
<li>Clips of industry influencers you’ll interview</li>
</ul>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/youtube-channel-trailer-highlight-clips-1.png" alt="examples of highlight clips you can use for your youtube channel trailer" width="720" height="450" /></div>
<p>This will be easy to do if you have already published some videos on your channel. Simply choose one of your best clips and include it as a highlight reel in your channel trailer.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Use your YouTube channel trailer to show your audience what they can expect from and look forward to in your videos. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This brings us to the next and shortest tip:</p>
<h3>6. Stockpile videos beforehand</h3>
<p>You&#8217;re not going to have any highlights to show if you don&#8217;t already have videos ready. You don&#8217;t have to have them all published, but enough to support the claims in your trailer.</p>
<p>In SearchLab&#8217;s YouTube channel homepage, you can gather right away from the video thumbnails that you&#8217;re going to learn local SEO and laugh.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/youtube-channel-trailer-searchlab-greg-gifford-1.png" alt="youtube channel homepage with thumbnails" width="720" height="365" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3kf-yP3bwhI6YvFFeKfegA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>SearchLab&#8217;s YouTube channel homepage</em></a></p>
<p>Note also that video thumbnails are an excellent <a href="/blog/ws/2021/06/10/youtube-seo-tips">YouTube SEO tactic</a>.</p>
<h3>7. Take viewers on a journey</h3>
<p>As humans, we tend to gravitate towards other people, and showcasing your unique personality in front of the camera enables you to deeper stronger connections with new audiences.</p>
<p>That’s where storytelling comes in. The most successful channel trailers are those that take viewers on a journey.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Don&#8217;t simply provide information to viewers; take them on a journey and <em>show</em> your story. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This means everything from the reason you started your channel to the topics your cover, and everything in between. Stories can be mesmerizing!</p>
<p>Storytelling also comes with the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It<strong> hits the emotional quotient</strong>;</li>
<li>It makes it easier for you to <strong>convey your personality</strong>;</li>
<li>It k<strong>eeps your viewers engaged</strong> and eager for more;</li>
<li>And, it also <strong>makes your content more memorable</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you tell personal stories in a fun, fresh, and relatable way, people feel like they know you, which ultimately leads to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/12/how-to-get-subscribers-on-youtube">more subscribers to your channel</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a YouTube channel trailer that takes viewers on an exciting journey:</p>
<div><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/youtube-channel-trailer-storytelling-foodtube-1.png" alt="example of youtube channel trailer using storytelling" width="720" height="403" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://youtu.be/Wqko7xVKW2s">View trailer here</a></em></p>
<h3>8. End with your subscribe CTA</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;ve followed the tips above, you&#8217;ve given viewers enough reasons to subscribe. But you still need to make the deliberate ask</p>
<p>Here are a few common subscribe pitches:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Make sure to hit the subscribe button&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;If that sounds good, subscribe to my channel right now&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Go ahead and subscribe right now so you don&#8217;t miss anything&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;And now, it&#8217;s time to subscribe!&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>It doesn&#8217;t matter <em>how </em>you phrase your pitch, but make sure that it’s explicit and on-brand.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>If you are interested in learning <strong>how to become a social media influencer</strong>, read on to discover the step-by-step process for achieving that goal.</p>
<h2>9 steps to become a social media influencer</h2>
<p>Becoming a social influencer takes patience and determination. There are a lot of influencers out there already, not to mention rising competition with <a href="https://theinfluencermarketingfactory.com/virtual-influencers-survey-infographic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virtual influencers</a>. But with these tips and steps, you&#8217;ll be on your way to influencer-dom in no time.</p>
<h3>1. Choose a niche</h3>
<p>Your first step is to choose a specific niche. This step is a must, and without it, you will have a hard time building an audience of engaged people who are interested in your message.</p>
<p>Every <a href="https://www.mayple.com/content/marketing-influencers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing influencer</a> that you see on YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, etc. has a <a href="/blog/ws/2014/10/28/niche-marketing">niche</a>.</p>
<p>Without a defined niche, it won&#8217;t matter what other advantages you have because you’ll have to compete with everyone for your audience’s attention. Also, you will be speaking and marketing to everyone, which will ultimately result in you actually reaching no one.</p>
<p>To choose your niche, ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you love?</li>
<li>What are you good at?</li>
<li>What are you passionate about?</li>
<li>What are your interests?</li>
<li>What weird quirks do you have?</li>
<li>What do you enjoy?</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, if you have always been into fitness and working out, then it makes sense for you to become a social media influencer who empowers and motivates others about their fitness goals.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-become-a-social-media-influencer-fitness-niche-1.png" alt="how to become a social media influencer—google search suggestion showing niche markets" width="800" height="321" /></div>
<p>Any of these things can become valuable assets in helping you naturally attract an audience of like-minded people.</p>
<p>Make sure your choice reflects your personality because that&#8217;s the only way people are going to relate to <em>and </em>trust you and your words.</p>
<p>People recognize energy, and if <em>you </em>don&#8217;t believe in what you&#8217;re doing, they will be able to pick up on that and you will lose your audience.</p>
<p>But, when people recognize your <strong>true passion for the work you do</strong>, it makes it a lot easier for you to attract an audience and maintain engagement.</p>
<p>Regardless of the niche you choose, make sure that your topic is something that you truly enjoy. This is important to your eventual success because it will inspire you to keep going when things are hard —even if only for the fact that you enjoy what you do.</p>
<h3>2. Choose your main platform</h3>
<p>As a <a href="/blog/ws/2013/06/21/social-media-influence">social media influencer</a>, there are tons of different channels that you can use, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>YouTube</li>
<li>Instagram</li>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Tik-Tok, and more</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you begin your campaign to become a social media influencer, you need to get your presence on the profiles you choose. You can use a variety of social networks, but you must choose <strong>one main platform</strong> where you are going to focus most of your content. You can still be active and engage on other networks, but most of your efforts will go into this one social media channel.</p>
<p><strong>There are many factors to consider when selecting the right social media networks for you. </strong>First, <strong>look at other influencers</strong> in your niche and identify which are <em>their </em>main social media platforms.</p>
<p>Your main channel will also depend on <strong>your type of niche</strong>. For some fashion influencers, <a href="https://www.candybar.co/blog/how-to-make-money-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram is the best choice</a>, but for video game influencers, it may be <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/video/4-strategies-steal-youtube-influencers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> or Twitch.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-become-a-social-media-influencer-social-platform-comparison-1.png" alt="how to become a social media influencer—social platforms compared" width="800" height="586" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://medium.com/the-logician/how-to-become-an-influencer-84810180850f">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>Similarly, Pinterest, Snapchat, Twitter, and all the other major social media networks can be suited for different influencers depending on specific factors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The audience you want to target</li>
<li>The channels that other influencers in your niche mainly use</li>
<li>The kind of content you will create</li>
<li>How comfortable you are <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/11/at-home-diy-video">in front of the camera</a></li>
<li>How good you are at creating <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post">engaging written content</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Generally speaking, YouTube is a good place to start for most influencers as it’s been around for some time, can be <a href="https://www.onehourprofessor.com/how-much-do-youtubers-make/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very lucrative</a>, and has a very established foothold on the internet.  If you’re worried about spending a lot of money to launch your channel, like many first-time YouTubers, consider a <a href="https://invideo.io/make/youtube-intro-maker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube Intro maker</a> to get started.</p>
<p>Consider each of these factors to help you determine <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business">which social media platform is best for you</a> to use as the central channel to broadcast your message.</p>
<h3>3. Define your audience</h3>
<p>Along with choosing the right niche, your success as a social media influencer also depends on <a href="/blog/ws/2014/09/18/beginners-guide-to-target-markets">finding the right audience</a> or community to support you.</p>
<p>Without followers, fans, or subscribers, your brand will be worthless on social media. So, before you start posting on your chosen social media platform, you need to <strong>define your target audience</strong>.</p>
<p>You want to focus on those people and communities who will be the fuel that <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/01/brand-strategy">powers your brand</a> on social media.</p>
<p>Your ideal audience will depend on the type of market you are in. For instance, if you are a <em>business</em> influencer and your goal is to educate others with <a href="https://www.problemio.com/udemy/white-labeling-or-buying-udemy-courses.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">course licensing</a> programs, your audience is likely to be on sites like LinkedIn and Twitter. If there are business-related videos, you may find them on YouTube, as well.</p>
<p>For <em>lifestyle </em>influencers, you will probably find your audience on Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube.</p>
<p>Here are the steps to take to define your audience:</p>
<p><strong>1. Demographics</strong></p>
<p>To find your ideal audience’s <a href="/blog/ws/2021/01/28/instagram-demographics-2021">demographics</a>, ask questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is my target audience’s age and gender?</li>
<li>Where do they live?</li>
<li>How internet savvy are they?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Challenges</strong></p>
<p>To figure out your target audience’s challenges, ask and answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do they know about your <a href="/blog/ws/2017/04/06/how-to-market-a-product">product</a> or brand?</li>
<li>If so, why wouldn&#8217;t they use your product?</li>
<li>Or why aren&#8217;t they using it as much as you&#8217;d like them to?</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of all the barriers that may be leading to this.</p>
<p><strong>#3: Motivators</strong></p>
<p>To discover your intended audience&#8217;s motivators, come up with answers to the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What </em>about your product or brand would encourage your target audience to engage with you?</li>
<li><em>What </em>about your product would make them want to use it?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>#4: Pain Points</strong></p>
<p>Is there anything about your product or brand that might frustrate your audience? Make a list of any and all such potential <a href="/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points">pain points</a>.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-become-a-social-media-influencer-pain-points-1.jpg" alt="how to become a social media influencer—types of audience pain points" width="800" height="400" /></div>
<p><strong>#5: WIIFM (What&#8217;s in It for me?)</strong></p>
<p>This question is all about <em>why </em>your customers should consider using (or continue to use) your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">products or services</a>. You should be able to make it clear <strong>what&#8217;s in it for them</strong>.</p>
<p>By considering all the factors above, you will be able to hone in on your target audience on social media where they are already hanging out.</p>
<h3>4. Develop a content calendar</h3>
<p>As a social media influencer, you have to consistently <a href="/blog/ws/2017/03/15/quality-content-defined">create valuable content</a> that your audience (and search engines/social media algorithms) will love.</p>
<p>People value commitment and consistency in social influencers. You need to show up every single day with a consistent message and produce useful content that is relevant to your audience.</p>
<p>Once you know what type of content you need, you must develop a content calendar to help you consistently create content.</p>
<p>Some of the work for developing a content calendar will be done already in the previous step.</p>
<p>By answering the questions above, you will not only be able to identify your target audience and where they’re likely to be convening on social media, but you will also be able to determine the best type of content that will help you create an effective <a href="/blog/ws/2016/08/19/influencer-marketing-content-promotion">influencer campaign</a> to market your brand successfully.</p>
<p>Below are a few tips to help you develop an effective content calendar for your social media <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing/2020-influencer-marketing-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">influencer marketing</a> strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create and give away high-quality content that’s packed full of value</li>
<li>Plan your content marketing strategy for social media by mapping out your goals and the type of content that works best to help you achieve them.</li>
<li>Decide on a posting frequency on each social media platform</li>
<li>Choose the <a href="https://www.hopperhq.com/best-time-to-post-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best times to post your content</a> where you are likely to get the most engagement from your audience.</li>
<li>Choose the right <a href="https://localiq.com/products/social-media-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media management</a> tools to develop your calendar. Or you can create your own Excel-based calendar.</li>
<li>Fill up your calendar with a variety of content formats, topics, types of posts, etc. Include information on the sites where you&#8217;ll post the content, along with times and dates.</li>
<li>Finally, you can schedule your posts. This is different from creating a content calendar because this process involves actually setting up the queue for your content to get posted on social media at preset times using automated tools like <a href="https://buffer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buffer</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Strategically generate traffic</h3>
<p>The more traffic you can generate on social media, the bigger an influencer you will become. As your following grows, other people will follow you, too, and you will be able to leverage the power of <a href="/blog/ws/2017/01/10/social-proof-guide">social proof </a>to reach an even bigger audience of fans and followers.</p>
<p>However, in the beginning, you need to find ways to strategically <a href="/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">generate traffic</a> so you can get the momentum going.</p>
<p>Here are a few easy, yet effective ways to generate more social media traffic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make it easy to share your content so your audience can share it with their networks</li>
<li>Tag others and <a href="/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">use the right hashtags</a> to increase your visibility</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://acquire.io/blog/proactive-customer-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proactive customer service</a> tools like a  <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/04/how-to-build-a-chatbot-your-brand">chatbot</a> on your social media profiles</li>
<li>Post your content during times when your audience is most active</li>
<li>Consistently interact with your audience and provide tons of value</li>
<li>Invest in <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/02/reasons-to-advertise-on-social-media">social media advertising</a> to expand your reach</li>
<li>Write creative and compelling <a href="/blog/ws/2010/09/29/unusual-effective-calls-to-action">calls to action</a></li>
<li>Engage with other industry influencers to boost your authority and credibility</li>
<li>Establish good <a href="https://coveredpress.com/blog/what-is-media-relations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">media relations</a> that will elevate media publicity and promotion</li>
<li>Mention social media accounts in emails: newsletters, <a href="/blog/ws/2017/08/18/welcome-email">welcome messages</a>, outreach templates, etc.</li>
<li>Add plenty of eye-catching visuals, including images, videos, infographics, etc. to make your content stand out and increase engagement and shares</li>
<li>Consider engaging your brand in other places like <a href="https://www.onehourprofessor.com/best-webinar-software-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hosting webinars</a>, audio podcasts, video interviews, and more.</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Collaborate with other influencers</h3>
<p>Collaborating with other influencers in your niche allows you to gain fans from their communities.</p>
<p>Influencers on social media have a huge reach that often extends to the millions, and working with them can help expose your content to a massive brand-new audience and drive even more traffic to your profiles.</p>
<p>There are many different ways you can work with influencers in your niche.</p>
<p>One way is to <strong>pay them to promote your content</strong> or products. But, this can be hard when you are just starting out.</p>
<p>Engaging organically might be the best and most effective way to help you build your own audience. To do this, simply <em>ask </em>them to share your post anytime you publish something that&#8217;s share-worthy.</p>
<p>To boost your chances of success when using this strategy, you can feature influencers in your content by covering their stories, doing interviews, or creating expert roundup articles. Then, tag them when you share the post and the influencers are likely to want to share it with their own networks.</p>
<p>So, for instance, on Twitter, you might gather different tweets from expert marketers, and then create a post on “expert marketing tips”. Once you tag the influencers, it&#8217;s likely that they will retweet the post to showcase it to their own audiences.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-become-a-social-media-influencer-promote-other-influencers-1.png" alt="how to become a social media influencer—tweet tagging other influencers" width="600" height="528" /></div>
<p>This type of strategy is not something you do once and you&#8217;re done, but rather you need to do it often so you can continue to gain fans from other influencers&#8217; communities.</p>
<h3>7. Engage your audience</h3>
<p>This is a big one because if you don&#8217;t consistently <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/30/social-media-engagement">engage with your audience on social media</a>, they’re likely to lose interest in your business and brand.</p>
<p>Your content is an important part of your<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/digital-marketing/influencer-marketing-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> influencer marketing</a> strategy, but without engagement, it won&#8217;t matter how good or insightful the content is.</p>
<p>Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube want to see people engaging with your content. It sends them a strong signal that you are posting things that your audience actually <em>wants </em>to see, which gives your content and your activities on social media (such as promotion and advertising) the necessary social proof.</p>
<p>In turn, the algorithm on each social site will surface your content to more people who are interested in the same subject.</p>
<p>It becomes like a snowball effect where the more engagement you get from your content the more people get to see your content, which helps you generate even more engagement, and so on.</p>
<p>Also, brands looking for influencers to help them carry out their social <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/holiday-influencer-marketing">influencer marketing campaigns</a> want people who can push their followers to make purchases (or follow the brand, too), instead of just silently observing the promoted content.</p>
<p>To have this type of impact as an influencer, your audience needs to feel like they <strong>know you</strong>. You need to let them know that you appreciate them and always thank your fans for their support.</p>
<h3>8. Make it easy for brands to contact you</h3>
<p>Another important tip to help you grow as a social media influencer is to make it super easy for brands to find and contact you.</p>
<p>As you can see from the chart below, there’s money to be made, in every industry and on every social media channel &#8211; but only if the brands can find you.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-become-a-social-media-influencer-money-1.png" alt="how to become a social media influencer—followers vs income per platform" width="800" height="664" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://www.stedavies.com/social-media-influencer/">Image source</a></p>
<p>Different brands find influencers on social media using different methods.</p>
<p>To find <strong>influencers on YouTube</strong>, brands might conduct Google searches for relevant influencers in the niche. For instance, they might google &#8220;top YouTube accounts for [niche]&#8221;, or something like that.</p>
<p>To find <strong>influencers on Instagram</strong>, brands might use a tool like <a href="https://pro.iconosquare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iconosquare</a>, an analytics tracker that helps them see how relevant and engaged a particular influencer’s audience is.</p>
<p>Alternatively, they could search for relevant hashtags on the platform to see which accounts pop up that have the best engagement rates.</p>
<p>To find <strong>influencers on LinkedIn</strong>, they might search for relevant keywords, posts, and locations.</p>
<p>On Twitter, they might use the <a href="https://twitter.com/search-advanced?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advanced search tool</a>, and on Facebook, they could search for the admins of groups with high engagement rates.</p>
<p>No matter where brands find you, make it as easy as possible for them to contact you by making sure your <strong>contact information</strong> is clear and visible.</p>
<p>Write a <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/09/instagram-bios"><strong>compelling bio</strong></a> that announces to brands that you are an influencer and that you are open to collaborations.</p>
<p>If potential clients have to search for ways to contact you, it&#8217;s likely that they will give up and go with a different influencer.</p>
<h3>9. Over-deliver on brand partnerships</h3>
<p>When working with brands, always go above and beyond expectations in order to encourage more bookings from that brand.</p>
<p>Brands love to work with social media influencers who deliver <strong>immense value</strong>, and anytime you over-deliver on your brand partnerships, you make it more likely that they will want to work with you again.</p>
<p>This is a powerful tactic that also puts the powerful <strong>law of reciprocation</strong> in your favor. When you provide value for a brand, they are compelled to want to do something for you in return.</p>
<p>This tactic also works great when dealing with your audience.</p>
<p>Although sometimes, you may come across skeptical people who may think you are only giving out valuable content because you expect something in return, when you&#8217;re consistent and genuine in your intentions, over time, your audience will start to trust and appreciate that you really are just thinking of them.</p>
<p>And when the time comes where you <em>do </em>ask for something (such as their email address), they will be compelled to give it to you.</p>

<p><span lang="EN">With Googlers finding so many different and unique ways of searching for common issues, this is precisely the reason why LSI keywords have become such a large part of Google&#8217;s ranking factors. <span lang="EN">From an SEO perspective, using LSI keywords has very positive results. By using them in your content, you will be able to boost its contextuality and improve your search visibility. </span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">In this article, I’m going to provide everything you need to know about LSI keywords so that you improve your SEO, drive more relevant traffic to your site, and attract more customers. I will cover:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">What LSI keywords are;</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">The key benefits of LSI keywords;</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">What LSI means for SEO; </span></li>

<p><span lang="EN">You’ll finish reading with not only a clear understanding of why LSI keywords are so crucial to content marketing and SEO; but also the tips and tools to implement them in your own strategy.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">So if you&#8217;re ready, let&#8217;s get started.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span lang="EN">What are LSI keywords?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Google has been talking about the importance of LSI keywords since 2015. However, they haven&#8217;t spent a lot of time explaining to Internet marketers exactly what LSI keywords are. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">LSI stands for Latent Semantic Index(ing). This is a computer program that is designed to learn a wide variety of synonyms based on context. It’s a method that uses mathematical techniques to find relationships between words and concepts within a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/12/28/content-marketing-advice">piece of content</a>.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/lsi20keywords20diagram.png" alt="LSI keywords diagram" width="800" height="402" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://organiksoft.com/what-are-lsi-keywords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">Here’s a more practical definition of LSI keywords: </span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN">In terms of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/01/17/seo-content-beginners-guide">SEO</a> (search engine optimization), LSI keywords are search terms related to the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2010/07/21/blog-keyword-targeting">main keyword you are targeting</a>. They help to support your content and add more context to make it easier for both users and search engines to know what your content is about.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Both the above and below are examples of suitable LSI keywords for this post’s primary keyword, which is “<em>LSI keywords</em>”:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">What are LSI keywords</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">LSI keywords examples</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">How to use related keywords </span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Tools to find LSI keywords</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Do related keywords affect SEO</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Semantic keywords</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">As you can see, each of the phrases above is suitable for accompanying the main keyword (“LSI keywords”). </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Don’t worry if this sounds a little complicated (especially since our keyword includes the word &#8220;keyword&#8221;). Later on, we’ll look at the different ways to easily find LSI/related keywords, as well as how you can use them in your content to <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/02/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps">appear higher</a> and more frequently in relevant search results. </span></p>
<h3>Are LSI keywords the same as synonyms?</h3>
<p>While some LSI keywords can be synonyms, not all synonyms are LSI keywords. The majority of LSI keywords are <a href="/blog/ws/2021/01/13/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing">words and phrases</a> that are <em>closely related</em> to your main keyword. So, using synonyms in your posts can help your article’s on-page SEO, but synonyms aren’t LSI keywords.</p>
<p>For example, a synonym for the word “jacket” would be “coat”. However, LSI keywords for “jacket” would include words like: reversible, winter, feather down, warm, padded, puffer, and so on.</p>
<p>A good way to understand the difference between synonyms and related keywords is to perform a Google search. The suggested searches that appear in the drop-down menu are LSI keywords:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/lsi20keywords20examples_0.png" alt="lsi keywords examples" width="721" height="379" /></div>
<h3>What are the benefits of using LSI keywords?</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">As I mentioned in the introduction, there are hundreds of thousands of Google queries performed each year that have never been searched. Google has made improvements to its algorithm to factor in context so that it can better understand related keywords. Google said:</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LSI20keywords20new20searches20on20Google_1.png" alt="LSI keywords new searches on Google" width="600" height="274" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-reaffirms-15-searches-new-never-searched-273786">Source</a></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Incorporating LSI keywords into your content boosts the contextuality of your content and yields <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/08/09/long-term-value-of-seo-myth">SEO benefits</a>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>They boost your website’s ranking in search engines: </strong>Sprinkling LSI keywords throughout your text helps search engines to understand your page and boost its ranking power.</li>
<li><strong>Semantic keywords improve your content’s relevance:</strong> Adding related words also helps to ensure you don’t overload your content with keywords, aka keyword stuffing.</li>
<li><strong>Related words increase the number of people who find your content: </strong>LSI keywords also help you provide a better search experience for users, which, in turn, translates into improvements in various ranking factors, such as time spent on a page, bounce rate, and more.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Do LSI keywords have any disadvantages?</h3>
<p>LSI keywords don’t necessarily have any disadvantages, but the indexing method does have some limitations. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn’t consider the order of words and disposes of all conjunctions and prepositions.</li>
<li>It considers words to have just <em>one </em>meaning.</li>
<li>It does not recognize underlying ideas and irony. In some cases, the meaning of the words may not match the meaning of the text.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span lang="EN">When did LSI keywords become relevant?</span></h2>
<p>If you’re wondering when LSI keywords became relevant, it all began in 2004 when latent semantic indexing was implemented in Google’s search algorithm. Its purpose was to assist the search engine in providing users with more relevant results.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/lsi20keywords20relevant20results.png" alt="lsi keywords relevant results" width="800" height="679" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">Google can produce relevant results for even figurative language.</span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">But, Google wasn’t just focused on keywords. The search giant also wanted to understand anchor text in hyperlinks, as well as groups of sites that link to each other (also known as <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/seo-street-smarts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO neighborhoods</a>). </span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">With all this in one algorithm update, Google dramatically changed the way it delivers search results. </span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN">No longer was the search engine targeting <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/exact-match">exact-match keywords</a> in web content. Now the algorithm could understand <em>context </em>and <em>synonyms</em>. <span lang="EN">Instead of looking at a single keyword and its frequency of use to find out what the page was about, Google could now analyze <em>everything </em>offered on the page.</span></span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/lsi20keywords20related20keywords.png" alt="lsi keywords related keywords" width="800" height="539" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://www.seocompetitors.com/latent-semantic-indexing/">Source</a></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">To better understand the impact of this change, let’s take a deeper dive into LSI keywords and their relationship to SEO. </span></p>
<h3>The Impact of LSI keywords on SEO</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">In the early days, Google’s crawlers, also known as “spiders”, would automatically find and scan websites by crawling from one link to another on connected web pages. As they crawled, they would look at the keywords on a page to help them identify its topic.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">For example, if you were to publish a post titled “21 Tips For Effective Email List Segmentation,” Google would scan your page to determine if you used the term “<em>email list segmentation</em>” in key areas on your website, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The title tag,</li>
<li>Content body,</li>
<li>Image alt text,</li>
<li>H1 heading, H2 and H3 subheaders, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">But, after the LSI update, Google’s crawling method changed, resulting in these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/12/local-seo">SEO improvements</a>:</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">Google understands pages better</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN">In addition to scanning your page for the main keyword, now it would also scan your page for various <em>related</em> keywords, such as: “email campaign,” “MailChimp,” “audience,” “subscribers,” “email tools,” and so on. <span lang="EN">What this means is, Google works to find out what the <em>overall </em>topic of a page is, and relies on latent semantic indexing to understand the content at a much deeper level than simply looking for multiple occurrences of a specific keyword.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">Google reads pages contextually</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Basically, Google’s algorithm now has the ability to “read” a page <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/advertising-channels/search/search-getting-smarter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the same way a human would</a>, and categorize keywords depending on the determined context. <span lang="EN">This means that the search engine can now differentiate between words based on even the <em>smallest </em>details (which is why <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/18/content-optimization">keyword mapping</a> is important). For instance, it can now tell the difference between literal and figurative expressions, like:</span></span></p>
<p class="text-align-center"><span lang="EN"> <em>“Don’t shoehorn LSI keywords into your content if they are not relevant.” </em></span></p>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">vs</span></em></p>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">“Use a shoehorn to protect shoes when you put them on.”</span></em></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">Google can generate even more relevant results</span></strong></p>
<p>According to this recent <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub45569/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research paper from Google</a>, they identify words that frequently occur together to help the bots more easily understand the main topic of the pages it scans. With more accurate categorization, results are even more relevant.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/lsi20keywords20results20are20more20relevant_0.png" sizes="(min-width: 1290px) 1290px, 100vw" srcset="https://wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/styles/max_325x325/public/images/media/images/lsi%20keywords%20results%20are%20more%20relevant_0.png?lWioYLovt22TCnHdtVvZ_bmZKXS1HESL&amp;itok=PWnLbAUe 325w, https://wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/styles/max_650x650/public/images/media/images/lsi%20keywords%20results%20are%20more%20relevant_0.png?_NCqBszmeUr3fhJQ33XOHxwKqpLEQLfc&amp;itok=rSrnkqzv 600w" alt="lsi keywords results are more relevant" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub45569/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p><strong>Google incorporates the overall picture of your business</strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN">In addition to that, their algorithm is designed to weigh your business name, website, and industry to help Google get a well-rounded understanding of each page on your site as it relates to your business as a whole. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Now can you see why LSI keywords have become such an important part of the search engine’s algorithm?</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Google’s main goal is to provide searchers with the most relevant results it can—even for the 15% of search terms that have never been searched before. That is an amazing standard of quality which would be impossible for the search engine to achieve without latent semantic indexing.</span></p>
<h2>Does YouTube use LSI keywords?</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Interestingly, it should be noted that even though Google owns <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/20/youtube-marketing">YouTube</a>, they primarily run on two different search engines and algorithms. What I’ve found surprising is that it doesn’t seem that, at the time of this writing, YouTube utilizes LSI keywords for rankings.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">As a YouTube creator myself, I try to include primary keywords in the titles of my videos and rarely pay attention to LSI keywords, and the videos still rank well. The only place I’d be able to put them is in the description of the video, but it doesn’t seem like it’s required.  </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">So while YouTube searches do pull up related suggestions, there aren’t many places to insert LSI keywords.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">YouTube SEO relies mainly on <a href="https://www.onehourprofessor.com/best-youtube-editing-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-quality editing</a> to increase engagement and the click-through rate of the thumbnails. Of course, I’m over-simplifying a complex algorithm, but it’s a universally accepted truth that high-quality editing, rather than LSI keywords, is the biggest factor in YouTube’s algorithm.  </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">So although LSI keywords seem to be an important factor on the Google search engine, they are not as important in the YouTube search engine.  </span></p>
<p>With that, let’s move on to the next section where you’ll discover 5 effective tools to help you find LSI keywords to use in your posts.</p>
<h2><strong><span lang="EN">How to find related keywords with LSI keyword tools</span></strong></h2>
<p>The first step in finding LSI keywords is to create a base of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide">important keywords for your business</a>. Once that’s done, coming up with related keywords will be easy. All you need is to do a little bit of research to uncover endless possibilities—and for that, you need tools. Here are five LSI keyword tools you can use to find suitable selections of related words.</p>
<h3>1. Google Autocomplete</h3>
<p>Google’s instant search feature is the simplest way to find keywords related to your main one. All you need to do is type your target keyword into Google’s search box and you will get a range of predictions as to what you might type next.</p>
<p>Look for the words that appear in bold as suggestions. Make a list of the ones that are relevant to your topic and incorporate them into your content.</p>

<h3>2. Google Related Searches</h3>
<p>You can also type your main keyword into Google and then scroll down to the bottom of the page to find the “Related Searches” section. Check out the listed terms to get more ideas for LSI keywords for your content.</p>

<h3>3. People Also Ask</h3>
<p>Yet another amazingly effective yet free resource, the “People Also Ask” box in the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/19/get-on-first-page-google">search results page</a> will provide you with tons more options. You can go into a few of the results to see if there are any additional words you can use. Look for the ones that are bolded, as in the example below.</p>

<h3>5. Serpstat</h3>
<p><a href="https://serpstat.com/">Serpstat</a> is yet another effective tool that helps you find semantically related phrases for your posts.

<p>Of course, there are many other related keyword finders out there, including <a href="https://ahrefs.com/keyword-generator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ahrefs </a>and <a href="https://moz.com/free-seo-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moz </a>SEO tools. These are great because they not only provide you with a comprehensive list of related keywords that people typically search for on the topic, but they also allow you to filter the words and phrases by connection strength, search volume, and cost per click.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to find LSI keywords using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords">free keyword research tools</a>, let’s look at the best ways to use them in your content and SEO strategy.</p>
<h2><span lang="EN">How to use LSI keywords for SEO </span></h2>
<p>The keyword generation tools mentioned above will provide you with a long list of suitable LSI keyword options for your content. Now it’s time to add them to your content and experience <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/05/08/seo-during-covid-19">SEO</a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/05/08/seo-during-covid-19">&#8216;s important benefits</a>.</p>
<h3>Choose LSI keywords best suited for your topic</h3>
<p>Before you determine how to incorporate LSI keywords into your text, you need to identify the ones best suited for your topic. For instance, if you were <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post">writing a blog post</a> targeting the main keyword “blog SEO”, the tool you’re using might spit out an endless list of options, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog seo checklist</li>
<li>Seo blog topics</li>
<li>blog post seo tips</li>
<li>Seo blogs for beginners</li>
<li>what are the advantages of seo</li>
<li>Seo blog meaning</li>
<li>Seo plugins for bloggers</li>
<li>How to write seo friendly post</li>
<li>blog seo for beginners</li>
<li>Seo latest trends</li>
<li>how to optimize your post for seo</li>
<li>&#8230;and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, most of these are good (depending on the context).</p>
<p>If you were creating a blog post for WordStream on the benefits of blogging SEO, you would pair the main keyword, “blog SEO” with relevant phrases like “<em>what are the advantages of SEO</em>” and “<em>blog SEO for beginners</em>”.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the post was about the different ways to optimize your blogging SEO, you would choose LSI phrases like “<em>how to optimize your post for SEO</em>” and “<em>X blog post SEO tips</em>”.</p>
<h3>Look at the total monthly search estimate</h3>
<p>Sometimes, determining the best LSI keywords for your phrases can be really difficult, as some suggestions may make sense as a completely different post altogether.</p>
<p>For example, if you were writing a post about “<a href="https://www.onehourprofessor.com/best-online-course-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>online course platforms</em></a>” you’d see LSI keyword suggestions like “<em>online course learning platforms.”</em></p>
<p>When this happens, you need to determine if the suggestion would make better sense as an individual article, or as an addition to the original post. For me, I usually look at the total monthly search estimate to decide whether it’s worth it to write something new, or include the suggestion as a part of the original article I’m researching.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LSI20keywords20search20volume.png" alt="LSI keywords monthly search volume" width="800" height="765" /></div>
<p>The keywords that your tool offers will work for different contexts, and you need to determine which ones will work best for the specific page you’re creating.</p>
<p>During your research, if you come across keywords that don’t fit your page, you can still make a note of them to use on different pages so you can improve the overall SEO of your website.</p>
<h3>Add LSI keywords to your page</h3>
<p>You should add your LSI keywords to the same places you would add your main keyword, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meta title and meta description</li>
<li>Headings (H1, H2, H3)</li>
<li>Image alt tags</li>
<li>Throughout the body text</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you sprinkle related words and phrases throughout your post in a natural-sounding way. This will help broaden your opportunities since you can’t use the main keyword over and over again in all the important areas of your page.</p>
<h3>Focus on user experience</h3>
<p>Don’t overuse LSI keywords in your content. While these aren’t your keywords, exactly, it’s still quite easy to overuse them—and if you do, you will get penalized for it. You want to include enough related words to make the context of your page immediately clear to Google and other search engines, but without ruining the reader’s experience.</p>
<p>To do this effectively, you must add related keywords while keeping the content cohesive, natural-sounding, and easy to follow. This will help you not only avoid penalties but also to improve your visitors&#8217; experience and ultimately, <a href="https://www.onehourprofessor.com/how-to-make-money-blogging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make money while blogging</a>.</p>
<h2>Final tips for using LSI keywords for SEO</h2>
<p>Here are some general rules for implementing related words in your content to enhance your SEO strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t go overboard with the use of synonyms</li>
<li>Write how you <em>speak</em>. If you wouldn’t say it in real life, it doesn’t belong in the text</li>
<li>Use a fixed ratio of related words and phrases to the rest of your content (eg. one LSI keyword for every 200-300 words)</li>
</ul>
<p>Although having a ratio such as the one above isn’t perfect—and it certainly doesn’t guarantee that you will rank for any of your chosen LSI keywords–it is a helpful guideline to get you going in the right direction.</p>
<p>Regardless of how often you use LSI keywords, your main priority should always be to offer <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/15/website-copy">clear, concise, and useful information</a> that helps readers find the answers and solutions they seek (while also helping you achieve your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/15/marketing-objectives">business objective</a> of transforming readers into paying customers, of course).</p>
<p>If you write with the aim of providing value first, you’ll find that you wind up using related keywords in a natural way throughout your text without making any conscious effort.</p>
