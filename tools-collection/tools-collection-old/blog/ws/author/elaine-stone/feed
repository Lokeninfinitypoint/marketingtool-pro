										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN">If your brick-and-mortar store is closed or you can’t make your product because your supply chain has collapsed, or you can’t fulfill customer orders, your incoming cash plummets, you could be in a state of <strong>negative cash flow</strong> during COVID-19. That means you have more cash leaving your business—whether that’s through paychecks, rent payments, paid marketing campaigns, and other fixed or variable costs—than you have coming in. That’s a problem, but it’s not a unique one. Even in a thriving economy, studies show that <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/187366" target="_blank" rel="noopener">82% of small businesses that fold do so due to cash flow issues</a><span lang="EN">. </span></span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/blog/news/small-business-cash-flow-the-state-of-payroll-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Intuit released its State of Payroll in early 2020, with a focus on small business cash flow.</em></a></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Given today’s market, though, working towards <strong>positive cash flow </strong>could be one of the most high-impact tasks you can do in the coming months to preserve your business’s future. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">To help you improve your cash flow, we’re going to share three principles to follow when managing your cash flow: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span lang="EN">Reduce costs</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Prioritize generating cash</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Empower your team</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="EN">For each, we’ll talk about how it helps with managing cash flow now, plus we’ll take a look at some examples of what you can do to make a difference for your business today. </span></p>
<h2>1. Reduce costs as much as possible</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">If you’re a small business owner, rethinking your business finances was probably one of the first things you did in March after ensuring your team was safe. If you applied for a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/01/cares-act-paycheck-protection-program">PPP loan</a><span lang="EN">, you’ve recently reviewed your financials in a level of detail that many of us don’t reach outside of tax season. But even if you have, you’ll want to continually re-examine your financials for the time being. And if you haven’t tackled this yet—or you’re taking this on for the first time due to downsizing here are some tasks you’ll want to check off your list right away.</span></span></p>
<h3>List all your fixed and variable costs to start cuts</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">First, in case it’s helpful, let’s review the definitions of <strong>fixed </strong>versus <strong>variable costs</strong>.</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="df9af167-5502-4007-9ad2-7532fcc93242" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/managing-cash-flow-fixed-vs-variable-costs.jpg" alt="fixed vs. variable costs" width="800" height="400" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Depending on your business model and industry, it’s frequently <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-Deloitte/gx-COVID-19-managing-cash-flow-in-crisis.pdf">easier to cut variable costs than it is fixed costs</a><span lang="EN">, so tackle those first. Can you find an alternate, less expensive way to ship your products? Can you temporarily cut your sales personnel’s commission and incentivize them in a different way? But also think through how you can actually change fixed costs into variable ones. When all else fails, try following in the footsteps of one entrepreneur, Brad Emerson, and cut literally anything you don’t need. During the Great Recession, he cut not only maintenance and computer costs, but also <a href="https://thehustle.co/small-business-owners-great-recession-covid19/">air conditioning</a><span lang="EN">. If there’s a time to practice running a lean business, it’s now. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">If this process of reviewing line items and determining where to make cuts is new to you, the <a href="http://sbacomplete.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/SBA-Cash-Flow-Template.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SBA’s free worksheet</a><span lang="EN"> and <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/calculators/breakeven.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Entrepreneur’s break-even calculator</a><span lang="EN"> can help you get started.</span></span></span></p>
<h3>Ask for help—and when you do, be human</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Our economy is an ecosystem; the people and entities that you buy supplies or rent property from depend on your business, so helping to preserve your business solvency is in their best interest. So, for example, if your business is going to have trouble paying rent, have a frank, virtual face-to-face with your landlord as soon as possible. When you do, be sure to be totally honest about what you really need<em> right now </em>versus the assistance you anticipate needing in the future. If you really can afford to pay your rent right now, but anticipate struggling in two months, don’t burn your bridges by asking for a pass on your rent this month. Letting your landlord help other, more immediately needy tenants this month—and saving them a ton of stress—you’ll not only preserve your access to the assistance you need when you <em>do </em>need it, but also your integrity will only benefit your business for years to come. </span></p>
<h3>Research alternate financing</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Between the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/01/cares-act-paycheck-protection-program"> emergency funding provided by the Federal government’s CARES Act</a><span lang="EN">, grants offered by corporations like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/boost/grants">Facebook</a><span lang="EN"> and <a href="https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/google-unveiled-a-massive-stimulus-program-of-its-own-including-340-million-for-small-businesses.html">Google</a><span lang="EN">, and donation-driven funds at the local level, there’s more than likely an available funding option that’s well suited for your business. Using a loan to inject cash into your business may seem like taking drastic steps, but it could mean the difference between having to totally rebuild your business during a recession and preserving a strong foundation to work with for the months ahead. </span></span></span></span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">So explore <a href="https://www.sba.gov/page/coronavirus-covid-19-small-business-guidance-loan-resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the SBA’s catalogue of resources</a><span lang="EN"> and Inc.’s <a href="https://www.inc.com/gabrielle-bienasz/small-business-grants-2020.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helpful list</a><span lang="EN"> of small business loan and grant options to brainstorm what might work for you, and contact your local city government to see what programs it’s launched or have planned. </span></span></span></p>
<h3>Remember that everyone else is in a tight spot, too</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Now’s the time to audit your catalogued invoices for any that are due but remain unpaid—a thankless task when the economy is doing well, but <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-Deloitte/gx-COVID-19-managing-cash-flow-in-crisis.pdf">a thoroughly necessary one now</a><span lang="EN">. If you haven’t yet, contact any customers or partners who owe you money right away and, again, have a human, empathetic, honest conversation with them. Give them the opportunity to be forthright about their own business situation and needs. If they need the help and you can manage it, consider extending their invoice’s due date. If they don’t need the help, take the opportunity to prompt a timely payment—your balance sheet will thank you. </span></span></p>
<h2>2. Prioritize generating cash over turning a profit</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Profit is total sales minus the total cost of producing those goods (your variable costs). <a href="https://www.inc.com/encyclopedia/cashflow.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Profit doesn’t equal positive cash flow</a><span lang="EN"> and, remember, what you need right now is <em>cash</em>. </span></span></p>

</div>
</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Refocusing on generating cash can definitely be a mental shift, but if you’ve already tackled the top-priority tasks to strengthen your cash flow (e.g., cutting variable costs), many of your usual profit-generating actions can be adjusted or reprioritized toward the goal of generating cash. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">For example, you’ve probably seen that many brick-and-mortar businesses are currently marketing their e-gift cards. While gift cards aren’t a new revenue stream for many businesses, they’re not usually something you’d put a lot of marketing effort behind, except perhaps as a “last chance” campaign targeting anyone who’s forgotten the next big holiday. But pivoting to focus on gift cards right now is an easy low-cost, low-effort way to get more cash in the door right away—without having to spend cash on the raw materials and other supplies needed to actually create your product or service (i.e., your variable costs).</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Here are some more ideas to try.</span></p>
<h3>Offer exclusive discounts to existing customers</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Acquiring a net new customer is <a href="https://www.inc.com/encyclopedia/cashflow.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">always more expensive than driving sales from prior or existing customers</a><span lang="EN">. In the current market environment—with millions of Americans unemployed and hesitant to spend money, and millions of others are working from home and desperate for distractions—it’ll be harder than ever to convert new business. But if you’re a consumer brand, your existing customers are likely bursting with pent-up demand. If you offer the right discount at the right time with compelling “exclusive” messaging, you’ll likely boost sales, generate cash, and promote customer loyalty. Also, if you sell a physical product, clearing out some of your inventory could help you cut back on rental or storage costs. </span></span></p>
<h3>Repackage your product or service for a consumer market</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Many products are generally sold to businesses with office space (e.g., office furniture) or that reach consumers via a middleman (e.g., Target)—perhaps yours included! Empower your marketers to whip out their rebranding ideas and pull together a simple landing page to get your product in front of consumers. For example, the team behind <a href="https://home.tryhungry.com/">HUNGRY@Home</a><span lang="EN"> is used to catering corporate events, but these days, they’ve pivoted to cooking and delivering healthy, safe, affordable family-style to people’s homes. </span></span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">HUNGRY@Home’s offering.</span></em></p>
<h3>Pivot your offering for better margins</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">If you can, change your offering to the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/18/post-covid-19-customers">new needs of your post-pandemic customers</a>. Consider offering products or services that offer high profit margins, economies of scale, and tried-and-true ways to collect payment. Whew! That was a lot. Let’s break that down: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">High profit margin: </span></strong><span lang="EN">Focus on producing products or services that you can charge a high price for, but that cost relatively little to produce. Fortunately, a Zoom subscription is pretty low-cost, so if you can leverage your team’s wide-ranging skills to deliver value virtually, do it. My favorite example so far: The local <a href="https://arthurmurray.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dance studio</a><span lang="EN"> my husband and I attend is holding classes online (highly recommend!). But it&#8217;s also doing a virtual “Dance Mixology” class with one of their teachers to promote a sponsorship campaign. Assuming he already owns bartending gear, and keeping the fixed costs of his salary and a Zoom subscription into account, the only added cost to creating this virtual product is the cost of the ingredients. So why not?</span></span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Economies of scale: </span></strong><span lang="EN">I’m seeing lots of restaurants adjusting their menus to focus on family-style meals, similar to HUNGRY@Home, or to a very limited menu. Purchasing supplies or raw materials in bulk is always a great way to save money, so if you can reposition your product offer to accommodate bulk buying of limited supplies, your cash flow will thank you. </span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Tried-and-true ways of collecting payment: </span></strong><span lang="EN">Remember what we discussed earlier about receivables? Especially if you’re launching a new or adjusted product or service, find ways to collect payment that don’t involve submitting and following up on an invoice. Invest in online checkout so that customers can pay immediately with a credit card <em>before </em>you deliver any value, even if the product you’re delivering is digital or virtual. Explore ways to pivot to a subscription model as well; given how cooped up and stressed many of us are these days, chances are that customers who like your product or service will want it again and may appreciate the ease of a subscription. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Find a niche in your neighborhood and fill it</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">As <a href="https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/cash-flow-management-strategies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shopify</a><span lang="EN"> points out, with Amazon prioritizing the delivery of groceries, diapers and infant formula, and personal care items, your local business might find an opportunity to step into that gap by providing faster, contactless delivery for beach reads, summer clothing and gear, home repair equipment, and other non-necessary, but definitely helpful products. </span></span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="64444720-c318-494a-a73c-047013ebb536" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/managing-cash-flow-trident.jpg" alt="Trident example" width="723" height="528" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Experiment with offering these products to existing customers at a discount, offering free or discounted delivery, or other offers to discern how to drive the most ongoing local demand while generating the most cash for your business. </span></p>
<h2>3. Empower your team with transparency</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">We’re all saying it so often these days that it’s already become cliche: “We’re all in this together.” We’re saying it, though, because it’s so widely applicable, whether you’re talking about protecting ask-risk neighbors or preserving your small business. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">As a business leader, now is not the time to hide in your office—or behind your laptop screen at home. It’s time to step up and lead—by empowering your employees to step up as well. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">How? First, <strong>be transparent about your real business metrics and what you need to achieve</strong>. In ordinary times, establishing a business objective that the whole organization can work toward together can generate a shared sense of mission, promote teamwork, and foster individuals’ pride in the business’s accomplishments. It’s natural, though, to hesitate about sharing metrics during a crisis like this, especially if your business goals from the booming start to the year have likely been thrown out the window. But if you <em>are </em>open about what needs to happen to keep the business afloat—and about your cash flow goals, in particular—you communicate how much you respect and trust your employees, and you empower them to work together to address those goals. </span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="9b291d27-4327-4e4c-b8d0-a33a91eac1ce" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/managing-cash-flow-employee-engagement.jpg" alt="Gallup graph of employee engagement" width="552" height="377" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">Being transparent about metrics and open to new ideas can also boost <a href="https://www.vantagecircle.com/employee-engagement-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">employee engagement</a>, which is good for business.</span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">To truly empower your team, you’ll also want to make sure that your employees all understand what the metrics mean. Show your team a P&amp;L and explain how it works. Walk them through a balance sheet. Describe the difference between profit and positive cash flow, and why positive cash flow is the current priority. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">But most importantly, make sure each person on your team <strong>understands where they personally drive business impact</strong>. As a marketer at a small business, my prior employer created a huge chart of where cash came in and went out; we each wrote our tasks on post-its and took turns placing the post-its on the chart to indicate where and when our everyday work impacted the business. Thanks to this incredibly helpful exercise, we all walked away with a far firmer grasp of how we could each make a difference. Try doing something like this virtually, with a Google doc or other tool. Tell your team to raise their hand immediately if they have an idea to improve cash flow, and emphasize that all ideas are good ideas, and <em>everyone</em>’s job is impactful and relevant. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">By taking the time to educate and empower your team, you’ll invest deeply in your team’s resilience and make huge strides toward unleashing their creativity and motivation to address your business’s challenges. Because we really are all in this together. </span></p>
<h2>Managing your cash flow isn’t new<span lang="EN">—and that’s good news</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Whether or not this particular economic crisis is your first rodeo, this is far from the first time that small businesses like yours have faced this level of uncertainty. As it so happens, we experienced one pretty recently—and the lessons learned in 2008, whether about cash flow management or any other business or leadership skill, are still incredibly valid.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">So as you work on improving cash flow with these tips, keep in mind what worked before—and listen to your colleagues or your business partners about their experiences. Reach out to small business owners and entrepreneurs in your network, and ask them what they did in 2008. Read about <a href="https://thehustle.co/small-business-owners-great-recession-covid19/">the experiences of Brad Emerson</a><span lang="EN"> and so many others. Research not just how businesses in your industry responded, but how your partners’ industries and verticals made their way. You can even get your whole team involved: In a shared place, document what you find, both what worked and what didn’t work. Review your findings together, and discuss how they support or undermine your potential path forward. The solution to your cash flow struggles could be unlocked just by asking a fellow small business owner a few questions.</span></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN">On Friday, March 27, the <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/co/start/strategy/cares-act-small-business-guide">Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act)</a><span lang="EN"> became US law. The largest stimulus bill in American history, the CARES act put into motion a momentous effort to provide financial relief for millions of Americans who have been economically impacted by the coronavirus pandemic—in particular, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/26/unemployment-claims-coronavirus-3-million/">3.3 million Americans who’ve filed for unemployment since March 14</a><span lang="EN">, and the small businesses who employ so many of them. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Though the CARES Act is packed with provisions for small businesses (including <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/26/821457551/whats-inside-the-senate-s-2-trillion-coronavirus-aid-package#small-businesses">emergency government grants and existing loan payment coverage</a><span lang="EN">), the $350 billion <strong><a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/paycheck-protection-program-ppp">Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)</a></strong><span lang="EN"> might be the most promising portion of the legislation. With its low interest rate and forgiveness potential, the Paycheck Protection Program aims to sustain small businesses through this pandemic without burdening them with significant debt to pay off when the crisis has passed—and, in the process, its goal is to keep people in their jobs and stem the tide of unemployment nationwide.</span></span></span></p>

<p>The rollout of the program hit many bumps along the way, and the original funding allotment rapidly ran dry. Now, Congress has passed another $310 billion round of funding late on Thursday, April 24 (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/ppp-house-interim-bill-covid-relief/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>TechCrunch</u></a>). We don’t yet know when the Small Business Association will reopen applications. But given how quickly the original funding dried up, if you want to access this resource to support your business, you will be ready to apply as soon as the loan application itself opens.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">Let’s dive into what information we have right now so that you can be ready to get the ball rolling for your business if and when the time comes. </span></p>
<p><em><span lang="EN">Please note: We are not legal experts. If you have specific questions about your business or loan application, please speak with your attorney and/or bank for clarification.</span></em></p>
<h2>What is the Paycheck Protection Program?</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">The Paycheck Protection Program is a <a href="https://www.sba.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Small Business Association (SBA)</a><span lang="EN"> loan program specifically designed to help small businesses continue to make payroll at their staff’s current pay rate, as well as cover key expenses that keep the lights on (think rent and utilities). Any loan funds used for these express purposes during the loan’s eight-week period will be eligible to be forgiven: in other words, if a small business uses the loan as it’s intended, they will likely not have to pay back a penny. </span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">By driving cash into threatened small businesses, the Paycheck Protection Program directly addresses what 70% of small businesses cite as their primary business challenge: <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/23/managing-cash-flow">cash flow management</a> (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/allbusiness/2019/04/21/cash-flow-challenges-facing-small-business-owners/#786e270c3656" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes</a><span lang="EN">). About half of small businesses don’t have enough cash on-hand to survive more than 27 days without incoming revenue, and about 25% can only make it 13 days or less with no revenue (<a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/institute/document/jpmc-institute-small-business-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JP Morgan</a><span lang="EN">). With a PPP loan to cover about two months’ worth of most costly expenses (payroll and rent), small businesses will be able to stretch out their existing cash reserves much longer. Hopefully long enough for this crisis to end and for businesses to re-open. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">In the meantime, with this loan, small businesses should be able to hold onto their existing team, preserve their retail or office space, and maintain their current utilities providers. This can provide small business owners and employees the opportunity to collaborate to find a way to pivot the business to find alternate revenue sources during COVID-19; and once the crisis ends, small business will still have their fully-trained team on-hand to ramp back up to their usual business model and capacity. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">If laying off all your employees is like taking the wheels off a bike so it can no longer run, think of the PPP as enabling small businesses to put on training wheels. You can keep going, though perhaps not as quickly. If you hit a bump, you might not fall totally over. But the most important thing is that you keep moving. </span></p>

<h2>How can the Paycheck Protection Program help your small business?</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve covered the goals and potential impact of this program, let’s take a closer look at the details. I’ll answer common questions that small business owners likely have about the PPP, including how to determine if you’re eligible, how to apply, how the PPP compares to SBA’s EIDL loans, and more.</p>
<h3>How do I know if I’m eligible?</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">You should be eligible to apply if: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">You’re a small business, 501(c)(3) nonprofit, or a 501(c)(19) Veterans Organization based in the United States.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">You have fewer than 500 employees.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">You’re self-employed or a sole priorietor. </span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Your business has been adversely impacted by COVID-19, and the current uncertainty makes it difficult to run your business.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">You need this loan to keep your business afloat.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Your business was fully operational on February 15, 2020, with employees on payroll.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>How much can I borrow through PPP?</h3>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">If you’re a small business: You can receive a loan for <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/023595_comm_corona_virus_smallbiz_loan_final_revised.pdf">up to 2.5x your average monthly payroll costs for the previous 12 months (up to $10 million total)</a><span lang="EN">. Note: A small business cannot claim any independent contractors’ usual pay in their “payroll costs,” as independent contractors are eligible to apply for their own loan (<a href="https://content.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2020-04/PPP--IFRN%20FINAL.pdf">SBA</a>) (updated 4/3).</span></span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">If you’re a sole proprietor or are self-employed (e.g., you run your own one-person marketing agency): Although you don’t have payroll costs in the same way, the loan amount you’re eligible for is still calculated based on your payroll costs for the past 12 months; you full loan amount may be up to $100,000 (the maximum amount small businesses are allowed to claim as payroll costs per employee). See the “What counts as payroll costs” section of this <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/PPP%20Borrower%20Information%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf">US Treasury resource</a> for more details. <span lang="EN"><em>Note: This information is up to date as of 4/1/20. We will update this section as more details for sole proprietors and self-employed individuals are clarified. If you have questions, we recommend speaking to an attorney. </em></span></span></li>
</ul>
<h3>What is the loan period?</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">The loan period lasts for eight weeks from the date of origination (the date the borrower officially receives the loan). Interest payments will be deferred for six months. The loan will be due in 2 years, and there’s no penalty for pre-paying (<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/PPP%20Borrower%20Information%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf">US Treasury</a>). </span></p>
<p><strong>Updated 6/10: </strong>The loan period has been extended for up to <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1026" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twenty-four weeks</a>.</p>
<h3>What can I use the loan money for?</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">The loan is designed to help keep businesses running and people employed. Based on the latest guidance from the <a href="https://content.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2020-04/PPP--IFRN%20FINAL.pdf">SBA</a>, you should plan to use at least 75% of the loan monies to pay your staff’s salaries during the eight-week loan period, if you plan to apply for loan forgiveness. If you’ve had to lay people off, their pay will not be included in the calculation of the loan amount. But if you hire them back after submitting your application, we believe you can use your loan monies to pay them. If you lay off additional employees after applying for the loan, or if you decrease your employees’ pay, the amount you will be eligible to have forgiven will be impacted.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The remainder of the loan amount (up to 25%) can be used on:</p>
<ul dir="ltr">
<li>Rent</li>
<li>Interest on their mortgage principle</li>
<li>Utility payments</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">If you stick to the above expenses (75% for payroll, no more than 25% for rent, mortgage interest, or utilities), you should be able to have 100% of their loan forgiven (updated 4/3). Learn more details from the SBA <a href="https://content.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2020-04/PPP--IFRN%20FINAL.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Updated 6/10: </strong>The requirement that borrower&#8217;s use 75% of funds on payroll costs has been changed to 60%. You can find more information on this update <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1026" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Is this different from the <a href="https://www.sba.gov/page/coronavirus-covid-19-small-business-guidance-loan-resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SBA’s Economic Disaster Injury Loan</a> (EIDL)?</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">The PPP <a href="https://www.inc.com/brit-morse/sba-loans-coronavirus-stimulus-package-cares-act.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">builds on the existing framework of the SBA’s 7(a) loan program for small businesses</a><span lang="EN">. The Paycheck Protection Program loans will co-exist with the SBA’s Economic Disaster Injury Loans, so you’ll want to evaluate both programs to select which option, if either, is better suited for your business.</span></span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p>If you’ve already taken out an EIDL due to COVID-19 related challenges, you may be able to refinance your existing loan as a PPP loan (<a href="https://www.foley.com/en/insights/publications/2020/03/sba-loans-under-the-cares-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Foley</u></a>).</p>
<h3>How can I apply?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">You will need to gather the required documentation, complete your PPP loan application (download the final application form <a href="https://www.sba.gov/document/sba-form--paycheck-protection-program-borrower-application-form">here</a>), and apply via an SBA-approved institution (find one <a href="https://www.sba.gov/paycheckprotection/find">here</a>), ideally your business’ existing bank. See more info from the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/PPP%20Borrower%20Information%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf">US Treasury</a> and the <a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/paycheck-protection-program-ppp">SBA</a> (updated 4/3).</p>
<h3>When can I apply for a Paycheck Protection Plan loan?</h3>
<p><strong>Updated 4/24: </strong>We don’t know when applications will re-open, once the new round of funding is signed into law, but the money will definitely go quickly. Potential applicants will want to contact their bank right away to begin this process if they haven’t yet. See this <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/PPP%20Borrower%20Information%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf">the US Treasury</a> for more details.</p>
<p><strong>Updated 6/10: </strong>The final day that Paycheck Protection Program loans will be approved is June 30.</p>
<h3>When will I get my Paycheck Protection Plan loan amount, if my application is approved?</h3>
<p><strong>Updated 4/24: </strong>We don’t know yet. We’ll update this as we find more information. Based on the first round of funding, the time it takes to receive funds may vary—some businesses in the first round received their loan monies quickly, while others experienced delays.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Quick question: When was the last time you purchased something online? Yesterday? This morning? Ok, cool. So when do you think you’ll <em>next </em>purchase something online? Tomorrow? Tonight? No shame—me too.</p>
<p>And we’re not alone. Last year, 80% of Americans shopped online at least monthly, and 5% were shopping online daily, <a href="https://v12data.com/blog/50-statistics-about-retail-marketing-and-consumer-shopping-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Commerce</a> reported. For many of us, online shopping has become a routine part of daily life, with huge impact on a global scale. Global ecommerce sales have skyrocketed over the last four years: According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statista</a>, in 2014, annual online sales totalled $1.3 billion USD worldwide; by last year, they’d doubled to $2.8 billion; and by 2021, they’re expected to nearly double again to <strong>$4.48 billion</strong>. That’s <strong>17.5% of retail sales worldwide</strong>.</p>

<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>Via </em><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Statista</em></a></p>
<p>Bottom line? Ecommerce is big and getting bigger. And navigating the ever-changing ecommerce terrain is a big challenge for small businesses used to the brick-and-mortar paradigm. So many factors impact your success online: how familiar people are with your brand, how effectively your Google Display ads are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/18/google-display-network-tips">raising awareness</a>, whether or not you offer <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/04/ecommerce-statistics">fast and free shipping</a>, how frequently your potential customers <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/23/ecommerce-kpis">abandon their carts</a>, and more.</p>
<p>But with these challenges also come opportunities. Let’s focus on just one for now: <strong>your product descriptions</strong>. In this guide:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ll break down why your product descriptions are an incredible opportunity to engage your potential customers</li>
<li>I’ll share five examples of insanely effective product descriptions</li>
<li>And I&#8217;ll explain how you can use these product description strategies for your own ecommerce business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s go!</p>

<h2>Product descriptions let you put your customers first</h2>
<p>If you’ve been reading this blog for a while, you’ve probably seen at least one of our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog?category=117&amp;author=All">customer spotlights</a>. We love our customers! As a former small business marketer myself, I love our passionate dedication to empowering and supporting small business growth.</p>
<p>For your business, too, your customers’ wins are your wins. If you’re a small retailer, this is true not just with your in-store customer service, but also your ecommerce website’s overall UX, its check-out flow, your online return options, and your product descriptions. <strong>By writing accurate, educational, and engaging product descriptions, a copywriter serves their customers just as much as a sales associate does when someone walks through your shop’s front door. </strong></p>
<p>In fact, your product description is arguably your best opportunity to provide the heart and soul of that in-store experience for online shoppers. It’s also your chance to snag prospects who research online before buying in-store, as do a whopping <a href="https://learn.g2.com/retail-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">81% of retail buyers</a>.</p>
<p>Don’t worry—you don’t need to be a brilliant copywriter to write product descriptions that work.</p>
<p>You just need to <strong>keep your customer first</strong>. Not sure how? Here are five examples of epic product descriptions that you can learn from and use as inspiration.</p>

<h2>1. Turn features into benefits</h2>
</div>
<p>Want a superweapon to ignite your customer’s interest in a product? It’s right under your nose: Take your product’s unique features and turn them into benefits.</p>
<p>What are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/21/features-vs-benefits">features and benefits</a>? Think about what gets you excited about your product that makes it different from your competitors’ products. It might be careful construction, ethically sourced materials, or all the bells and whistles you dreamed up over drinks one night. Those are features.</p>
<p>Now, think about what those things do for your customer. Does careful construction mean that your product is safe for children? Do ethically sourced materials make the buyer feel good about purchasing your product? Do those bells and whistles make everyone who sees your customer with your product weep with envy? Those are benefits.</p>
<p>In product descriptions, it’s easy to fall into the trap of only describing the features of your products. But when you just list the features, you’re not actually helping your buyer understand how your product will help them.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about a product page that communicates both features and benefits effectively.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/product-descriptions-weber-grill.jpg" alt="product description for a Weber grill" width="630" height="454" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>Via </em><a href="https://www.weber.com/US/en/grills/gas-grills/spirit-ii-series/44010001.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Weber</em></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the product description:</p>
<blockquote><p>Open your door to the world of grilling with the sleek Spirit II E-210 gas grill. This two burner grill is built to fit small spaces, and packed with features such as the powerful GS4 grilling system, iGrill capability, and convenient side tables for placing serving trays. Welcome to the Weber family.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bias alert: I kind of want this. My husband and I love summer, and we love burgers. But we’re urban apartment dwellers with no space for a BBQ.</p>
<p>The product description for this grill speaks to the target market (me!) by expressing how its main features address my need for a grill that can squeeze into a tiny balcony space.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Feature</strong></td>
<td><strong>Benefit</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>“Sleek&#8230;two-burner grill built for small spaces”</td>
<td>“The perfect size to grill up a couple of burgers for everyone in the family”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>“Convenient side tables…”</td>
<td>“&#8230;for placing serving trays”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>“Packed with [branded] features”</em></td>
<td><em>“Welcome to the Weber family”</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>See how the copy addresses the same primary buyer need multiple times? They’re well aware that my main concern when shopping for a grill is its size, and that if I’m not convinced that the grill will fit in my space and do a good job, I won’t buy it. The product description repeats that the grill is small and has side serving trays (features) to maximize my small space while making enough food for everyone (benefit).</p>
<p>And see the last example, in italics? The copywriter also knows that I have both <em>practical </em>needs and <em>emotional </em>ones. In this case, they’re assuming that, like many other urban millennials, I grew up in a suburban environment and desire a neighborhood-like community. Welcoming me into the Weber family if I purchase the grill fills that desire—a compelling benefit, if an abstract one.</p>

<h3>How to turn your features into benefits</h3>
<p>To get started writing features and benefits for your products, ask yourself some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who’s your target buyer?</li>
<li>What does that person need?</li>
<li>What do they want?</li>
<li>What are their pain points?</li>
</ul>
<p>Those answers will help you get started on a strong product description that turns features into benefits—and potential customers into buyers.</p>

<h2>2. Anticipate your buyer’s pain points</h2>
</div>
<p>You know what I want even more than a BBQ? A puppy. A snuggly, cuddly, floppy-eared little puppy.</p>
<p>But you know why I don’t have a puppy? They’re such a pain. They’re expensive, they bark at stuff, they pee on the floor, and they chew—on <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p>Guess who knows that? The people at KONG. Check it out.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/product-descriptions-kong.jpg" alt="product description from KONG" width="729" height="402" class="aligncenter" /></div>

<p>Here&#8217;s the product description:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This does a wonderful job of addressing the problems, needs, and worries of new pet parents. Here are three great examples from the copy.</p>

<p>The copywriter addresses multiple buyer pain points by pulling a ton of benefits out of just a few features. Pretty cool, right?</p>
<h3>How to address pain points</h3>
<p>To use this method in your product descriptions, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points">you need to identify pain points</a>. Got repeat customers? Send them a survey asking them why they bought your product and why they keep buying. Ask questions designed to draw out some of the ordinary problems they face every day. Got customer reviews? Peruse them to find common threads around your product solving the buyer’s problem.</p>
<p>For bonus points (see what I did there?), check out <a href="https://www.chewy.com/kong-puppy-dog-toy-color-varies-small/dp/38488" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chewy</a>’s description for the exact same KONG product. Map out how that copywriter addresses the buyer’s pain points, describing the same features and benefits in a slightly different way.</p>
<p>Sound good? Great. Let’s keep going.</p>

<h2>3. Make your buyer smarter</h2>
</div>
<p>Your job on the product page is to educate your customer. Write detailed, informative copy that helps your customer make a smart purchase decision.</p>
<p>How much information they’ll need depends on the company and the product. If you’re a well-respected brand, your customers are mostly repeat buyers, or your price point is very low, you’ll need to include less information. But if you’re a small, lesser-known brand in a high-competition industry, you’ll need to provide a ton of information to make your customer feel confident in their purchase.</p>
<p>Most small retailers fall into this latter category, where more information really is more. Here’s an example.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/product-descriptions-etsy-laptop-sleeve.jpg" alt="product description of a laptop sleeve" width="746" height="458" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>Via <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/KhaliKhutta?ref=simple-shop-header-name&amp;listing_id=512809233" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KhaliKhutta on Etsy</a></em></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the product description:</p>
<blockquote><p>Beautifully handmade laptop case/sleeve made in the Nepal Himalaya. It can be slipped inside your backpack or carried alone with space for all your work bits and pieces!</p>
<p>Designed and measured to fit a 12&#8243; to 14&#8243; laptops and with a convenient front pocket for your charger cable and notebook. We can also make you a custom sized and coloured sleeve to fit your laptop/macbook or tablet. Get in touch for details.</p>
<p>Hemp grows wild throughout Nepal and has long been used to create fabrics used in clothe making etc. You can now own a piece of this ancient tradition in the form of a functional, stylish laptop case.</p>
<p>Design Details:<br />
The main pocket (where your laptop goes) as well as the top flap, are made with wild hemp, harvested, spun and handwoven here in Nepal.<br />
The inside has Tibetain sheeps&#8217; wool for an effective, natural and sustainable padding (instead of chemical based neoprene used in most cases).<br />
The smaller, front pocket uses recycled wild hemp cloth &#8211; from bags used by farmers from rural Nepal. This is slightly thinner than the other wild hemp fabric in this item and because of its past use is beautifully soft. This front pocket can accommodate your laptop charger as well as a note book/pens etc. making it super convenient.</p>
<p>No Chemicals or Chemical Dyes<br />
We use only natural plant/mineral based dyes.<br />
We use no bleach or other chemical treatments or dyes in our production process.<br />
The fibres are hand-harvested, washed in pure Himalayan water and hand-spun, weaved and stitched.</p>
<p>SUPPORTING RURAL LIVELIHOODS IN NEPAL<br />
We work with a small group of Nepali handcrafters and local communities harvesting wild fibres to bring you these yoga accessories. We support rural livelihoods and cottage industries in Nepal by providing a wider market for their produce to help continue traditional skills and indigenous knowledge. By buying this item you are helping to support rural farmers in Nepal.</p>
<p>We do not mass-produce any of our range, but operate a batch process system. This means that all our items are made with that bit more care and love &#8211; and you can see that in the finished item!</p></blockquote>
<p>If you search for “laptop case” on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/03/how-to-sell-on-etsy">Etsy</a>, you’ll get upwards of 54,076 results. Handcrafted leather, all-recycled materials, faux marble, faux wood, cork—if you can think of a material, you’ll probably find a laptop case made out of it here. So why would you choose any of these, let alone this item in particular, which is an Etsy bestseller? You’d pick one because it’s the right size for your laptop, and you like how it looks. But if you’re an Etsy shopper, you likely also care about <em>how </em>the case was made, where the material came from and who did the labor.</p>
<p>The product description for this laptop case is 393 words long, but it doesn’t waste any time delivering the key selling points: The product is handmade in Nepal ( emotional need), and it can fit in a backpack or be used alone (practical need).</p>
<p>The copywriter spends the rest of the description blowing out these two main points. Where it really shines is the explanation of how the traditional materials aren’t just beautiful, but are also practical. Who would’ve thought that Tibetan sheep’s wool would be such a good cushion to protect a laptop? Or that the traditional weave of the hemp would keep the case light and easy to carry? Talk about educating your buyer!</p>
<h3>How to educate your potential customer</h3>
<p>Take some time to think through the likelihood that your target buyer has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchased from you previously?</li>
<li>Purchased this item previously, or a similar one, from another retailer?</li>
<li>Researched the item before hitting your product page? (Check Google Analytics to see where your traffic is coming from. It might yield some interesting insights.)</li>
<li>Any knowledge about the best practices for creating this product? If not, would they like to learn?</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Tell a story</h2>
</div>
<p>Who doesn’t love a good story? Bedtime stories, ghost stories, war stories, tragic star-crossed lover stories, that-awkward-thing-I-got-mocked-for-in-middle-school stories. Telling stories, both to ourselves and others, is part of what makes us human. It’s also a powerful marketing tool, especially for your product descriptions.</p>
<p>This description below does so much more than introduce a backpack and explain how many items it can hold. It tells (you guessed it) a story.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/product-descriptions-thinkgeek-backpack.jpg" alt="product description for a backpack" width="678" height="415" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>Via </em><a href="https://www.thinkgeek.com/product/lghk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>ThinkGeek</em></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the product description:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>ENDOR COMMANDO</h4>
<ul>
<li>Officially-licensed Star Wars merchandise</li>
<li>Sometimes blending in is the best plan</li>
<li>Big enough for your Ewok BFF</li>
</ul>
<p>Pack it up! We&#8217;re deploying to Endor in the morning, and you need to find a bag big enough for the essentials with extra space for a small teddy-bear like lifeform. Hypothetically. We&#8217;re not telling you to take an Ewok back with you, but… if you find your Ewok BFF, you&#8217;ll have the option.</p>
<p>This Star Wars Rebel Alliance Special Forces Rucksack is big enough to fit everything you need for your day, and then some (including an Ewok). The camo accents will make it harder for the Stormtroopers to spot you on Endor which is a huge plus, especially considering their rucksacks are (you guessed it) white. Sometimes standing out is the worst thing you can do.</p>
<p><strong>Product Specifications</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Star Wars Rebel Alliance Special Forces Rucksack</li>
<li>Officially-licensed Star Wars merchandise</li>
<li>Includes roll-top, 2 front zipper pockets, and 2 zippered side pockets  Endor Commando Alliance Special Forces patch is prominently featured on the front</li>
<li>Features faux Aurebesh on the side pocket (it would say &#8220;Restore the Republic&#8221;, but each letter is backwards) &#8211; you don&#8217;t want EVERYONE to know your true mission, do you?</li>
<li>Also shows the Rebel Alliance symbol</li>
<li>If you put an Ewok in the bag, don’t roll the top down too tight</li>
<li>Adjustable shoulder straps</li>
<li>Materials: Polyester, faux leather (vegan), and silicone strap closure</li>
<li>Dimensions: 18&#8243; tall x 12&#8243; wide x 5&#8243; deep</li>
<li>Care Instructions: Wipe clean with a damp cloth</li>
<li>Weight: 2 lb.</li>
<li><strong>WARNING &#8211; ENTANGLEMENT HAZARD. Keep away from very young children. Do not place around neck. </strong></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of telling you “this backpack will make you feel like you’re in Star Wars,” the copywriter instead tells a story that makes you imagine that you’re in Star Wars already—before you even buy the product. One of the bullet-point features promises that the backpack can fit your Ewok BFF, and this is recalled in the description below. In the middle of the standard specs at the end of the description, between the dimensions and weight, is a final note on carrying your Ewok BFF in this backpack: “If you put an Ewok in the bag, don’t roll the top down too tight.”</p>
<p>What does this Ewok BFF narrative actually tell you about the product? Nothing, really.</p>
<p><strong>But the story is there because this product description puts the customer first. </strong>We buy stuff, in general, because we think stuff will make our lives better. And we buy merch in particular because attaching a beloved brand to our identity makes us feel better about ourselves. (Yep, we’re going deep here.) If you’re 10, you might actually want to be Princess Leia and buy this backpack to feel like you’re her. If you’re 30, you might want to reclaim part of your childhood or perhaps take on the rebel persona to feel more confident in the real battles you do face every day. Either way, you want to feel like a character in Star Wars.</p>
<h3>How to tell your customers a story</h3>
<p>Jot down some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>What story would ignite your buyer’s imagination? How can your product support that story?</li>
<li>What’s your buyer’s underlying emotional or psychological need for this product? What stories could you tell that tap into or meet this need? How could that story feature your product?</li>
</ul>
<p>And then start drafting!</p>
<div id="surprise-and-delight"></div>
<h2>5. Surprise and delight your potential customers</h2>
<p>If you’re writing your product descriptions for your customers, you want to give them all the necessary information about the product so they can make an informed decision. But you also want to keep your customers engaged and write an on-brand product description that leaves a warm, fuzzy, and lasting impression.</p>
<p>How can you do that? By surprising and delighting your potential customers with a cute and creative product description. Let’s take a look at my last example.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/product-descriptions-loveco.jpg" alt="product description for candles" width="662" height="415" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>Via </em><a href="http://www.thelovestruckco.com/shop/unicorn-fart" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>LoveStruckCo</em></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the product description:</p>
<blockquote><p>Smells like unicorns farting pleasantly in your face.</p>
<p>|Notes of lemons, limes, cherries, grapefruits, berries and vanilla|</p>
<p>*No two Unicorn Farts are the same. Each one is unique.<br />
**No unicorns were harmed in the making of this candle. All unicorns are fed an organic diet of sugar and love.</p></blockquote>
<p>(I promise I’m not five years old. #sorrynotsorry)</p>
<p>Take in this beauty of a description. It’s short. No words are wasted. It bursts with helpful information about how to use and care for the product. It doesn’t just list details about the ingredients (“phthalates free”), but explains <em>why </em>the buyer should care about this (“does not pollute your home&#8230;supports American farmers.”) And at its end, it leaves you with a feeling: “You can feel good burning Love Struck Co. candles in your home!”</p>
<p>Thank you, LoveStruckCo., for reminding us all that we can.</p>
<h3>How to surprise and delight with your product descriptions</h3>
<p>Grab pens and paper, a colleague, and a fun snack (not optional), and start brainstorming! Answer the following questions based on what you know about your customers:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do they expect from your product? How can you upend that expectation?</li>
<li>If they won’t have any concrete expectations for your product, could you build expectation with the product title and then upend that expectation in the description?</li>
<li>What would make them laugh? Is their humor silly, dry, ironic, or witty?</li>
<li>What common memories or experiences might your customer base share? (<a href="http://www.thelovestruckco.com/shop/boyfriend" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This description from LoveStruckCo</a> is a good example of this.) How can you trigger this memory?</li>
<li>What would make your customer base compulsively “awwww,” cheer, or punch the air?</li>
</ul>

<h2>A product description checklist</h2>
</div>
<p>If you remember anything from this blog post, remember this: <strong>Write product descriptions that serve your customers.</strong> Meet your customers where they are. Understand their needs. Provide accurate, thorough information that helps them make a smart purchase decision. Tell them a story that helps them imagine how this product would make their lives better. And give them a good laugh.</p>
<p>If you need a little more inspiration to get started, try answering these 10 questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Who will buy and/or use this?</li>
<li>What ordinary problems do they deal with on a daily basis? How could this product solve them?</li>
<li>What makes this product different from other products on the market?</li>
<li>What else might someone buy to solve their problem? What are they currently using, if anything?</li>
<li>What makes this person <em>happy? </em>Afraid? Excited? Worried?</li>
<li>What does this person value?</li>
<li>What information, and how much, do they need to make a smart purchase decision?</li>
<li>What can you do that would surprise them?</li>
<li>What should your product make the buyer feel? How can your product description make them feel that without <em>telling </em>them to feel that?</li>
<li>How can you ask your real customers directly what their needs and pain points are?</li>
</ol>
