<p>Today I’m excited to announce that WordStream has joined a small and exclusive group of companies named as trusted advisors to Microsoft’s growing customer base for search advertising through the Bing Ads Network. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/bing-ads-elite-smb-partner">As an Elite Partner to Bing Ads</a>, we will have exclusive access to trainings and breaking news which our teams here can use to provide even better service and features to WordStream clients.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em>Kristen Yerardi, myself, and our Bing contact, Sam Brown</em></p>
<p>Bing launched this program last year for companies like us, who have proven success in helping small and medium-sized business compete in Bing Ads. We are thrilled to have been chosen as an Elite Partner, along with a few other chosen companies which have a similar in-depth understanding of search advertising and Bing Ads’ offerings.</p>
<p>Being an Elite Partner means that we meet Microsoft’s highest standards for providing reliable reporting, billing support, and trusted advice to our thousands of clients. We were chosen because of our history as a trusted consultant to a large base of SMBs running Bing Ads, and our customer service representatives maintain certifications as Bing Ads Professionals. I know our team is up to the challenge and will continue to exceed expectations.</p>

<p>“WordStream has successfully been offering increased levels of ROI to its search advertising clients thanks to our partnership,” said Steve Sirich, General Manager of Bing Ads marketing. “With the strong adoption of Bing Ads among WordStream customers, our ongoing partnership will clearly bring increased business opportunity for both our clients and our business.”</p>
<p>In 2016, Microsoft’s search advertising revenue grew 24%, and we know this partnership will bring increased opportunity for WordStream’s clients. We are excited to continue our mission to make online advertising easy for businesses of all shapes and sizes. As Bing grows globally, our relationship will only help us help our clients succeed through PPC. Thanks to Microsoft and thanks to you, our customers!</p>
