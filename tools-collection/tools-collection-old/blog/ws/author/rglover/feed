										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New use cases for AI pop up every day, each promising a utopia of ultra-efficiency and endless brilliant ideas.</p>
<p>But do they really work for small businesses, where there’s little time to develop complex solutions or wait for future returns?</p>
<p>To find out, I ran five experiments to see if AI workflows and prompts that marketers and business leaders are already using could be adapted for local businesses (think: plumbers, yoga studios, or private preschools).</p>
<p>In this guide, you’ll see what worked, what didn’t, and how you can use each tactic for your own business right now.</p>

<h2>1. Use online forums like a giant focus group</h2>
<p>Online forums are an absolute embarrassment of riches when it comes to learning about your customers. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reddit-marketing">Reddit</a>, Quora, and other niche messaging boards hold millions of unfiltered ideas and opinions you can use to guide content marketing, product development, positioning statements, and so much more.</p>
<p>Here’s the rub: there are SO many conversations happening that it’s nearly impossible for a human to sift through them all.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abbiemood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abbie Mood</a>, the marketing director at<a href="https://www.velocityadvisorygroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Velocity Advisory Group</a>, uses ChatGPT to scour these digital spaces for common questions her target audience is asking.</p>
<h3>The experiment</h3>
<p>For this experiment, I took on the role of a content marketer for a physical therapist and running coach. My goal was to get a list of questions my<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience"> target audience</a> of runners asks about nutrition so that I can turn them into a series of blog and social media posts.</p>
<p>Abbie gave me the editable prompt she uses for the task:</p>
<p><em>“What are the questions [target demographic] are asking the most frequently about [topic/service/pain point]? Look for them on social sites, forums, Reddit, Quora, and other places where [target demographic] ask questions. Find as many as possible. Then, categorize them and rank-stack them by frequency.”</em></p>
<p>I swapped in the demographic as “runners” and the topic as “nutrition.”</p>
<p>ChatGPT identified five topical categories, ranked them by frequency, and added some representative questions from these threads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-ranked-categories.webp" alt="AI experiments - Ranked categories from ChatGPT." width="856" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94517 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-ranked-categories.webp 856w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-ranked-categories-480x336.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 856px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This summary is great. But I also wanted the raw data organized in a table. Abbie has a prompt for that, too:</p>
<p><em>“Format the report with a table at the top summarizing your findings. Then, make each category a heading to be followed by a quick summary of what you found for that category and about a dozen bullets of direct quotes you found that represent that category.”</em></p>
<p>It created a table with 121 representative questions runners are asking about nutrition. They’re ranked by frequency and categorized by topic. The AI let me download the table into a CSV, and I did a little formatting to make it easier to read.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-frequency-chart.webp" alt="AI experiments - ranked categories in a chart." width="937" height="476" class="aligncenter wp-image-94518 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-frequency-chart.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-frequency-chart-480x244.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is a fantastic list of questions I can bake into<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/27/blog-post-ideas"> blog posts</a>, guides,<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/14/tiktok-trend-discovery"> TikToks</a>…whatever! The process took me less than five minutes to complete.</p>
<h3>How to use this tactic</h3>
<p>It’s easy enough to simply change the topic and audience in Abbie’s prompts. From there, I’d do a few more things to help fill my <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/24/editorial-calendar">content calendar</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Google and Ahrefs, Moz, or our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">Free Keyword Tool</a> to see if any of these terms have close SEO keyword equivalents.</li>
<li>Look for the questions that aren’t <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/01/competitor-keyword-analysis">answered to death by my content competitors</a>.</li>
<li>Look for obvious groupings of questions that can be expanded into a more comprehensive piece of content.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the potential goes far beyond content. I could see a nutrition business using this to either develop supplements or a dietary program that addresses these questions. Alternatively, an advertiser could build a campaign around how their products address these concerns.</p>

<div id="repurpose-long-form-content-into-social-media-posts"></div>
<h2>2. Repurpose content into social media posts in a flash</h2>
<p>No other marketing channel lets local businesses connect with so many people in such an engaging way as<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing"> social media</a> does. But a<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/plumber-marketing-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> plumber</a> or local dentist won’t typically have a full-time, dedicated social media marketer who can create posts fast enough to fill the never-ending need for content.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/annabyang/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anna Burgess Yang</a> knows this challenge well. She’s a<a href="https://www.annabyang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> content marketer</a> and a solopreneur who has to squeeze in time to do social while keeping a busy client schedule (plus billing and all the other tasks of a small business).</p>
<p>Luckily, Anna is also an<a href="https://www.annabyang.com/resources/products/smart-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> AI tool tinkerer</a>. She recently shared with us how she transforms interview transcripts and other lengthy assets into social media posts in just a few seconds. “I’ve already done the hard work by crafting long-form content. Why not use AI to speed up the process of creating social posts?” she explained.</p>
<h3>The experiment</h3>
<p>Anna uses a paid version of Writer for this job. I’m using trusty ol’ ChatGPT. My goal is to turn a blog post, this time from a <a href="https://fortsmithlandscaping.com/">local lawn care business</a>, into publishable social media content quickly.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-lawn-blog.webp" alt="AI experiments - Lawn care post." width="937" height="647" class="aligncenter wp-image-94519 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-lawn-blog.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-lawn-blog-480x331.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>

<p>Anna likes the prompt, “Summarize this post into three key takeaways.” I’ll start there. Here’s what ChatGPT gave me:</p>
<p>Here’s where Anna would move these three points into her task management tool and use them as the basis for future social media posts.</p>
<p>For my experiment, I’m going right to the social post writing stage. I’m not a fan of using AI to write copy wholesale. But I wanted to give it a try for this experiment.</p>
<p>Here’s the prompt I entered and one of the posts it wrote:</p>
<p><em>“Can you turn these three topics into three social media posts? Focus on a style that&#8217;s good for Facebook, but make them useful for Instagram and X/Twitter, too.”</em></p>
<p>Here’s one of the posts.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-social-post-1.webp" alt="AI experiments - social post from ChatGPT." width="937" height="427" class="aligncenter wp-image-94520 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-social-post-1.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-social-post-1-480x219.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It’s definitely not a style of post I’d publish. And the overuse of emojis is a common AI tell. But I do like that ChatGPT added some<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags"> hashtags</a>. It definitely needs a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action"> call to action</a>. And to be fair, the blog post was pretty high-level.</p>
<p>I decided to try one more. This is a much longer post about running nutrition. I skipped the “key takeaways” step and just asked for three social media posts.</p>
<p>I ran into a problem.</p>
<p>It gave me three different ideas for the same blog post. What I wanted was a series of three posts I could plan out for the next week. So I modified the prompt to:</p>
<p><em>“Read this blog post. Pull out three key points that would make good social media posts. Then write the three posts, making sure they don’t cover the same points. Keep them concise.”</em></p>
<p>It produced three posts around unique topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fueling before and during your trail run</li>
<li>Recovery and common nutrition mistakes</li>
<li>Smarter everyday nutrition for trail runners</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s an example of the output:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-everyday-nutrition.webp" alt="AI experiments - social posts by ChatGPT" width="937" height="488" class="aligncenter wp-image-94521 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-everyday-nutrition.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-everyday-nutrition-480x250.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Still not fantastic. But it’s at least a start.</p>
<h3>How to use this tactic</h3>
<p>After running this experiment, I think I’d use Anna’s initial method and just get ChatGPT to pull key concepts from a long bit of text.</p>
<p>For a local business, that could be a blog post or ebook. It could also be from the transcript of a talk they gave at a local event. Or it could even come from recorded customer conversations and sales pitches.</p>

<h2>3. Create comprehensive SEO outlines quickly</h2>
<p>The most effective blog posts are built on well-crafted outlines. When you have a solid structure, a novel theme, and strong key components (like stats and quotes), the end result has a much better chance of engaging readers and being<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google"> ranked by search engines</a>.</p>
<p>Now, it’s not new to ask AI to throw together a quick outline. But <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-long-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Long</a>, co-founder of <a href="https://nectivdigital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nectiv</a> (an SEO and GEO services provider), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chris-long-marketing_man-i-love-using-chatgpts-agent-mode-activity-7371516801362583552-6wzS?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAfpBUkBZn1g_3AT-AQ7-zTMTBRIIDRYtto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed a workflow</a> he uses to get a way more comprehensive version that’s dialed in for SEO.</p>
<h3>The experiment</h3>
<p>Chris <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/06/how-to-use-chatgpt-for-small-business-marketing">uses ChatGPT</a> in Agent Mode, along with a detailed prompt, to review currently ranking content, analyze informational gaps, and source questions that need to be answered based on a keyword.</p>
<p>In case you’re new to it, Agent Mode combines ChatGPT’s Deep Research capabilities with its Operational functions. That means you can give it complex, multi-step tasks that require digging through multiple websites.</p>
<p>I took on the persona of marketing manager for a private preschool. The test aims to determine if I can obtain a usable SEO-focused outline from ChatGPT’s Agent Mode for a relevant, high-volume keyword.</p>
<p>I decided to base this test on the keyword “preschool curriculum” because it has decent search volume and a manageable difficulty level.</p>
<p>I used the exact prompt Chris shared, only adjusting it for my keyword:</p>
<p><em>“Can you look at the top Google results for ‘preschool curriculum?’ Based on those results, can you provide a content outline that contains: 1) 6-8 sections of content to create with notes, 2) FAQs to add to the page, and 3) Semantic entities to include on the page.”</em></p>
<p>Agent Mode went to work. Over the course of 8 minutes, it read several ranking articles and seemed to search for subtopics (like match curricula, etc.). It also stated that it was verifying citations.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-prek-agent-mode.webp" alt="AI experiments - Agent Mode screenshot." width="709" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94522 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-prek-agent-mode.webp 709w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-prek-agent-mode-480x406.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 709px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As Chris suggested, ChatGPT created a pretty detailed outline. Each subsection had three to five bullet points with citations. This is the final subsection:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-curriculum-planning.webp" alt="AI experiments - One section of an outline." width="937" height="521" class="aligncenter wp-image-94523 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-curriculum-planning.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-curriculum-planning-480x267.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There was also a list of five FAQs and a big list of semantic entities to include.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-semantic.webp" alt="AI experiments - list of semantic elements." width="937" height="313" class="aligncenter wp-image-94524 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-semantic.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-semantic-480x160.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>I found the subtopics and semantic entities to be helpful. But I noticed some obvious sections missing for this to meet the reader&#8217;s intent. I think that’s down to two things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ChatGPT chose an intent: </strong>The intent of the highest-ranking posts was mixed. Some were promotional and aimed at educating parents about a school’s curriculum. Others were informational and written for an audience of teachers and administrators. ChatGPT chose a fairly generic intent designed for parents.</li>
<li><strong>It didn’t address Google search features: </strong>The outline doesn’t seem to follow or reference the topics in Google’s “People also ask” or “Things to know” snippets.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to use this tactic</h3>
<p>Chris’s strategy would be really useful to help a non-SEO expert create blog post outlines. You could even use this for your newsletter or lead magnet guides.</p>
<p>Chris said in his post that this is a progressive work that can take some back and forth to get it where you want it. Here are some things I’d do to dial in the results:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Confirm your target audience: </strong>Don’t make the AI decide who your audience is. Add that into your prompt so if the intent is a little murky, you’ll get an outline that’s relevant to the people you need to engage.</li>
<li><strong>Feed it SERP info:</strong> Agent Mode told me it can’t access live SERP features like People also ask. Those are important to address in an SEO blog post. So try copying and pasting them into your AI dialogue.</li>
<li><strong>Switch to standard mode for basic questions:</strong> Agent mode does a lot of deep thinking. If you just want to know something like “can you access SERP features,” it’s much faster to switch to the standard ChatGPT mode and ask it.</li>
</ul>

<div id="pull-insights-from-hundreds-of-customer-reviews"></div>
<h2>4. Pull insights from hundreds of customer reviews</h2>
<p>We write a lot about the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/24/customer-feedback"> importance of online reviews</a> for small businesses. In my opinion, they’re one of those marketing assets that are truly critical for growth but also really difficult to wrangle (especially if you get a lot of them).</p>
<p>My next experiment is based on an idea<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattmeazey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> posted by Matt Meazey</a>, a<a href="https://www.mattmeazey.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> freelance SEO consultant</a>, on LinkedIn. The idea is to get AI to review hundreds of online reviews for your business, then pull and organize valuable insights.</p>
<h3>The experiment</h3>
<p>I wanted to start off on a good foot, so I reached out to Matt for more details. He said he uses Agent Mode in ChatGPT for this one. Here’s the prompt Matt feeds it:</p>
<p>“Visit these two websites, analyze all reviews, and create a document here that summarizes the findings. I want to know commonalities and patterns, both positive and negative, for each of the venues and each product. I will use this insight to create content on the website, such as “guest says”.</p>
<p>I went a little broader with it and asked Agent Mode to find all reviews on Google, Yelp, or any other review sites for Rite Plumbing, an actual plumber based in New York. It spent 26 minutes on the task.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-yelp.webp" alt="AI experiments - Agent Mode screenshot." width="801" height="563" class="aligncenter wp-image-94525 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-yelp.webp 801w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-yelp-480x337.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 801px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Holy cow, did this one deliver! ChatGPT spun up a full report on what it learned from dozens of websites and possibly hundreds of reviews (it was hard to say how many in total).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-digital-review.webp" alt="AI experiments - Review of reviews in a chart." width="937" height="541" class="aligncenter wp-image-94526 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-digital-review.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-digital-review-480x277.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The report listed commonly perceived strengths of the business (responsiveness, good communication) as well as weaknesses (higher prices). It also elaborated on some of its findings for each review site.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-summary.webp" alt="AI experiments - Summary of reviews." width="937" height="326" class="aligncenter wp-image-94527 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-summary.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-summary-480x167.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>One thing I noticed was that my report didn’t show specific customer quotes. That’s because it couldn’t read the actual reviews from Google. It had to rely on third-party websites that mentioned those reviews.</p>
<h3>How to use this tactic</h3>
<p>There are several places I could use this information for my plumbing business. I could spot<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/01/business-directory-listings"> directories</a> where my rating is low and see if it’s getting review bombed. I could share the ratings on my website and social posts. I could also use the feedback to change up my services or reposition them to better meet expectations.</p>
<p>Matt uses actual customer quotes as<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/01/10/social-proof-guide"> social proof</a> in marketing assets, which is absolute gold. I think the next experiment would be to try giving ChatGPT a specific directory to see what it can read, and rework the prompt to ask for quotes.</p>
<div id="analyze-your-competitors"></div>
<h2>5. Analyze your competitors</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/competitors-ads">Studying your competitors</a> can be the best source of new ideas to grow your business. It’ll highlight gaps in your product or service offerings, give you new ways to position what you sell,  show you which customer segments aren’t being serviced, and a whole lot more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/celiaquillian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celia Quillian</a>, director of AI and growth at <a href="https://greenlight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greenlight</a>, told us how she makes that easier by using ChatGPT to analyze competitors’ websites for things like branding, product descriptions, and so on.</p>
<h3>The experiment</h3>
<p>I <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-in-marketing">tried a version of this</a> using the unpaid version of ChatGPT a while ago with limited results. For this experiment, I wanted to see if the updated, paid version could do better. And if it would work for a small local business. In this case, a yoga studio.</p>
<p>I started by asking ChatGPT to provide a comprehensive and reusable prompt. Here it is:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Review these three competitor websites: [link 1], [link 2], [link 3].<br />
Analyze them for:</em></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Pricing</em></strong><em><em> – How they show or hide prices, tiers, packages, or promotions.</em></em></li>
<li><strong><em>Branding &amp; Messaging</em></strong><em><em> – The tone, visuals, and value propositions they use to appeal to customers.</em></em></li>
<li><strong><em>Positioning &amp; Differentiation</em></strong><em><em> – What makes each stand out (or blend in) compared to the others.</em></em></li>
<li><strong><em>Website Experience</em></strong><em><em> – Ease of navigation, calls-to-action, and how clear it is for a visitor to take the next step.</em></em></li>
<li><strong><em>Content &amp; Engagement</em></strong><em><em> – Use of blogs, FAQs, videos, reviews, or other elements that build trust and engagement.*</em></em></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Finally, summarize the <strong>strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities</strong> for a small business competing with them.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I switched back to Agent Mode and put AI to work reviewing the websites of three top-rated yoga studios in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Using just this prompt, ChatGPT created an eight-column table with information for each of the three businesses. It was a little hard to read in the dialogue box, so I asked for a downloadable CSV file.</p>
<p>Again, a touch of formatting and, voilà:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-comp-chart.webp" alt="AI experiments - chart of competitor data." width="937" height="241" class="aligncenter wp-image-94528 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-comp-chart.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-experiments-wordstream-comp-chart-480x123.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>I think the best part is the cost analysis. If you pick the three studios nearest yours, you could quickly see if you’re over- or under-priced for your neighborhood. Plus, you’d get ideas for how to create and promote packages.</p>
<p>I also loved the weaknesses column. It shows several ways you could gain an advantage, like with pricing transparency and a more easily navigable website.</p>
<h3>How to use this tactic</h3>
<p>As is, Celia’s tactic is instantly usable for just about any local business. My experiment is also just the beginning of what you can learn.</p>
<p>For example, I asked a few of these questions and got back a lot more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do these websites have a blog, and have they published recently?</li>
<li>How does the website capture leads or motivate visitors to take the next step? Do they use specific calls to action? Is their schedule system easy to find?</li>
<li>What types of social proof do they include (reviews, testimonials, awards, etc.)?</li>
<li>What do they do for local SEO (do they mention the city or neighborhood name often, show involvement in community events, partner with local businesses)?</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have clued in on the mentions of “reviews.” You can combine this tactic with a review search to see what people say about your competitors and gather additional information to work with.</p>
<h2>Try these AI tactics for your business</h2>
<p>The goal of these experiments was to find ways a small business can use AI for better marketing. The overall answer is yes, each of these tactics can be adapted for a local business to use quickly.</p>
<p>Each business is unique, though. And AI has seemingly infinite adaptability. So try the prompts and workflows I’ve listed here, and then start asking your AI more questions about the results. If you want to know more about your competitors or which products people have the most problems with, challenge AI to figure it out.</p>

<h2>Fall content ideas for September</h2>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/september-social-media-holidays/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September</a> is one of those amazing shoulder-season months. It starts full of warm weather and long days, and by the end, we get the first taste of what autumn has to offer. So we’re making September an honorary fall month, even if much of it is in summer.</p>
<h3>Back to school</h3>
<p>Most students are back in the classroom by the beginning of September. Your content can be less about preparing for the new semester and more about coping with the first few days of class.</p>
<p>For a fun blog post, try writing about some <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/back-to-school-marketing-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back-to-school</a> craft ideas.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-back-to-school.webp" alt="Fall content ideas -Back to school craft ideas post." width="329" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94478 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-back-to-school.webp 329w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-back-to-school-165x300.webp 165w" sizes="(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px" /></p>
<p>That’s just the start. Whether it’s pre-schoolers on their first day away from home or college kids moving into their new dorm, there’s a lot to cover. Use these ideas to help smooth the transition, and you’ll build a lot of goodwill with your customers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/03/video-marketing-ideas">Video</a> funny skits about getting kids up and going in the morning.</li>
<li>Share some time-management plans for parents in your newsletter.</li>
<li>Create a menu of ideas for people who pack their kids’ lunches.</li>
<li>Have a photographer give tips on how to take the perfect back-to-school photo.</li>
<li>Get inspired by back-to-school<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/14/tiktok-trend-discovery"> TikTok trends</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Labor Day (changes annually)</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/12/labor-day-messages-greetings">Labor Day</a> weekend is the unofficial end of summer. Some of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/13/content-creation">content creation</a> should lean into the “one last hurrah” theme. But don’t forget that Labor Day is also about celebrating workers&#8217; contributions. A little appreciation post can go a long way to building relationships with your followers.</p>
<p>We all want to maximize our Labor Day weekend. Help your followers do that by putting together a list of Labor Day weekend events around town. Go the extra mile by listing restaurants and shops offering special deals. Or make it a roundup of local hiking trails and parks to get outside before the days get shorter.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-labor-day.webp" alt="Fall content ideas - Labor Day activity ideas post." width="364" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94479 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-labor-day.webp 364w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-labor-day-182x300.webp 182w" sizes="(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px" /></p>
<p>Let’s take the hard work out of Labor Day content. Use a few of these ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share a funny video or meme of what it feels like to get out of work on Friday before Labor Day.</li>
<li>Show your appreciation to parents with a heartfelt parents&#8217; appreciation post.</li>
<li>Create a list of fun family-friendly activities in your area.</li>
<li>Send grilling season off with a bang and post your favorite grilling recipes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>International Talk Like a Pirate Day (September 19)</h3>
<p>Well, shiver me timbers, me hearties! It’s Talk Like a Pirate Day—possibly the most fun day on social media.</p>
<p>There are so many content ideas to consider here. If it’s too much, try a simple punny pirate post. Cats are optional.</p>

<h2>Fall content ideas for October</h2>
<p>October is a magical month filled with the first falling leaves and the promise of holidays to come. From Halloween to Back to the Future Day, there are many events to celebrate this month.</p>
<h3>Breast Cancer Awareness Month</h3>
<p>You don’t need to be directly involved in a particular field to share awareness for an important cause. For example, this information technology company launched a campaign to help spread the word for Breast Cancer Awareness Month.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-think-pink.webp" alt="Fall content ideas - Think Pink post." width="383" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94481 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-think-pink.webp 383w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-think-pink-192x300.webp 192w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /></p>
<p>The campaign was clever. The brand asked followers to share the message on their own social media accounts using the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags"> hashtag</a> #thinkpink. For every share, the brand donated to a foundation that supports women dealing with cancer. Thousands of women were reminded to book checkups, and the foundation received vital financial support.</p>
<h3>National Pitbull Awareness Day (October 25)</h3>
<p>Pitbulls have a reputation that sometimes leaves them last to be adopted and first to be excluded. But on National Pitbull Awareness Day, you can change the conversation and help these pooches have a better life.</p>
<p>This insurance provider did it by publishing a post on its blog.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-pit-day.webp" alt="Fall content ideas - National Pitbull Day post." width="385" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94482 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-pit-day.webp 385w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-pit-day-193x300.webp 193w" sizes="(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px" /></p>
<p>Try this for yourself and tell the story of shelter dogs, share anecdotes from pitbull owners, or just show off some local dogs ready for adoption.</p>
<h3>Halloween (October 31)</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/halloween-promotion-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Halloween</a> still stands out as the tentpole of many October<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-calendar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> content calendars</a>, even with so many other motifs to tackle this month. Not only is it uber-popular (Americans spent over<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1012/how-much-americans-spend-on-halloween.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $10 billion</a> on Halloween in 2022), but it’s also full of visually engaging<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-marketing"> content marketing</a> possibilities.</p>
<p>Let’s start off with an easy and fun one. A vintage shop curated a carousel of offbeat costume ideas.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-costume.webp" alt="Fall content ideas - Costume ideas post." width="398" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94483 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-costume.webp 398w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-costume-199x300.webp 199w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px" /></p>

<h2>Fall content ideas for November</h2>

<h3>National Donut Day (November 5)</h3>
<p>Donuts are so well-loved that they get two days each year: National Donut Day is celebrated on June 6 and November 5. That’s understandable since donuts bring so much joy to the world.</p>
<p>This parent-focused magazine posted all the donut deals for its readers in one eye-catching image.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-donut.webp" alt="Fall content ideas - Donut Day post." width="389" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94484 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-donut.webp 389w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-donut-195x300.webp 195w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></p>

<li>Write up a blog post or email describing wild and wonderful donut-themed events like the donut mile (contestants eat a dozen donuts while running a mile).</li>
<li>Host a donut-eating contest or free donut giveaway at your location. Film the event, post it to YouTube, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-youtube-channel">promote it</a> with clips on social media.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Veterans Day (November 11)</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/veterans-day-posts/">Veterans Day</a> is when a grateful nation shows appreciation for the people who’ve served in the US military. Millions of men and women gave their time, talents, and often much more, so whatever content you post should focus on sincere appreciation for their sacrifice.</p>
<p>A simple, understated appreciation social media post with a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/veterans-day-greetings"> Veterans Day greeting is</a> a great option. See how Hydro Flask goes one step further by offering useful information along with it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-hydroflask.webp" alt="Fall content ideas - Veteran's Day post." width="353" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94485 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-hydroflask.webp 353w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-hydroflask-177x300.webp 177w" sizes="(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px" /></p>

</ul>
<h3>Thanksgiving (changes annually)</h3>
<p>There’s a big trend on TikTok of people searching for educational content, including tips for Thanksgiving. Take advantage of all that attention by posting a few helpful T-day clips.</p>
<p>Kroger went to TikTok to answer the age-old question, “What do we do with all these leftovers?”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-leftovers.webp" alt="Fall content ideas -Thanksgiving leftovers post." width="330" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94486 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-leftovers.webp 330w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fall-content-ideas-wordstream-leftovers-165x300.webp 165w" sizes="(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px" /></p>

<h2>What is content marketing?</h2>
<p>Content marketing is a strategic approach to creating and sharing valuable, relevant content that attracts and engages a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a>. Instead of pushing products directly, it builds trust and credibility by providing information, education, or entertainment that solves customer problems.</p>
<p>Content marketing is considered an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/05/inbound-marketing-examples">inbound marketing technique</a>. It’s designed to be an organic part of someone’s experience, like providing an answer to a question they’ve asked.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-dentist.webp" alt="Content marketing - post from a dentist" width="789" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94204 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-dentist.webp 789w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-dentist-480x365.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 789px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DOf9cExDG6F/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Compare that with outbound advertising strategies like a cold call, which are often meant to interrupt an experience.</p>
<p>Using content marketing can drive leads directly and help support other marketing activities. Say you run a car dealership, and someone reads your blog post about the best automotive finance options.

<h2>Benefits of content marketing</h2>
<p>Brands that build a successful content marketing strategy regularly outperform their non-content-using competitors. Here’s why that happens.</p>
<h3>Increases brand awareness</h3>
<p>A healthy content marketing program places your brand in front of more people more often. That’s why <a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/content-marketing-strategy/content-marketing-statistics?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">87%</a> of marketers say content has helped them increase their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">brand awareness</a>.</p>
<p>Each <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post">blog article</a>, social media post, and email you share increases your online footprint. This effect is compounded by the network effect, especially in social media.</p>
<p>Here’s how that works. Say you publish a unique guide on solving shin splints for runners.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-cornerstone.webp" alt="Content marketing - shin splints blog post." width="937" height="598" class="aligncenter wp-image-94205 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-cornerstone.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-cornerstone-480x306.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://cornerstonephysio.com/resources/shin-splints-medial-tibial-stress-syndrome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>It’ll solidify you as an expert in your current audience&#8217;s eyes, and it’ll increase your presence as they share it in their networks. And as their connections start following you, the network compounds.</p>
<h3>Improves the quality and quantity of leads</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.demandsage.com/content-marketing-statistics">76%</a> of marketers say content marketing helps them<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-generation-ideas"> generate more leads</a>. It does this by engaging people across the whole buyer’s journey. For example, when someone is just beginning to think about a problem, a helpful blog post will attract them, while it may not be the right time for an overt<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/12/20/creative-advertising-ideas"> promotional ad</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70%</a> of marketers say content marketing delivers “high-quality” leads. That’s because you can design content that helps people self-qualify as a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-scoring">good-fit lead</a>. If your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/unique-selling-proposition">selling proposition</a> is premium service for discerning users, your content can filter out extreme value shoppers who won’t buy what you sell.</p>
<h3>Enhances your credibility</h3>
<p>A disheartening <a href="https://www.inc.com/dakota-shane/96-percent-of-consumers-dont-trust-ads-heres-how-to-sell-your-product-without-coming-off-sleazy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">96%</a> of people say they don’t trust ads. But <a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/content-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">64%</a> of buyers say they do trust brands that create educational content. Oh, and that trust jumps to 73% a week after consuming that content.</p>
<p>Have you ever had a mechanic explain something technical to you in terms you could understand, and then prove what they said with examples? If so, you probably trusted that professional a lot more after the interaction. And that’s what content marketing can do for your business, only on a much larger scale.</p>

<h2>Content marketing challenges in 2025</h2>
<p>Content is one of your best bets for long-term growth and lead generation. But it&#8217;s not all smooth sailing. Quickly evolving tech, shifts in search, and AI-powered competitors have churned up the waters.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for these content marketing challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Constant SERP shuffling:</strong> Google continues to roll out new core updates, and each one seems to change the rules for ranking on search engine results pages. Your best bet here is to watch how other websites in your niche fare and stay up to date on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-ranking-factors-2025">what factors still help you land on page one</a>.</li>
<li><strong>AI Overviews swiping traffic:</strong> Google&#8217;s AI Overviews are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-overviews-impact-on-seo">accelerating the trend of zero-click search</a> (58% of searches result in zero clicks). You can <a href="ttps://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-referral-traffic">claw back some of that lost referral traffic</a> by optimizing for both AI Overviews and AI search engines like Perplexity and Gemini.</li>
<li><strong>Increased AI-powered competition:</strong> Generative AI tools let brands scale content production at an incredible rate, and it&#8217;s getting more popular to do so (around <a href="https://sqmagazine.co.uk/ai-in-social-media-tools-statistics/">60%</a> of US businesses say they use generative AI to keep up their social media content schedule). Your goal here shouldn&#8217;t be an arms race to the quality bottom. Instead, look for ways to make fewer assets stand out more. These <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-differentiate-content">ideas from marketing pros</a> will help.</li>
</ul>
<div id="how-content-marketing-works"></div>
<h2>How content marketing works</h2>
<p>Content marketing works by engaging an audience with helpful and entertaining content to gain their awareness and build their trust.</p>
<p>There are several steps that commonly happen during the content marketing funnel:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attract: </strong>Get the attention of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a> in the places they spend time using content that helps and educates rather than disrupts.</li>
<li><strong>Engage: </strong>Connect with potential buyers on channels like <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/social-media-campaign-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media</a> to continue conversations and further build relationships.</li>
<li><strong>Nurture: </strong>Motivate prospects through a designated buying journey with more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/personalized-marketing">personalized content</a> assets like newsletters and email drip campaigns.</li>
<li><strong>Convert: </strong>Turn followers into customers with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/01/bottom-funnel-conversions">conversion-focused</a> content like product comparisons.</li>
</ul>
<div id="common-types-of-content-marketing"></div>
<h2>Common types of content marketing (with examples)</h2>
<p>Once you start looking for it, you’ll see dozens of types of content marketing. The content types we’ve listed here tend to do most of the heavy lifting for many brands.</p>
<h3>Long-form content</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, long-form content typically includes larger assets, often with higher word counts. Blog posts,<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-write-an-ebook"> ebooks</a>, and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/03/how-to-write-a-case-study"> case studies</a> all belong to this category.</p>
<p>This type of content lets you focus on one or a few related <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide">SEO keywords</a>. Or you can use it to explain a completely new idea in a thought leadership-style post.</p>
<p>Have a look at this blog post about retiring in your 50s. It&#8217;s 2000 words long and ranks for a group of keywords related to retiring early, making it well-targeted to a middle-aged, financially successful audience.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.citizensbank.com/learning/how-to-retire-by-50.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>Social media posts</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">Social media</a> is a versatile content marketing platform. You use it to promote long-form content, share insights directly, gather and use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/user-generated-content">user-generated content</a>, and so much more. And since it’s a two-way communication channel, you can also engage with your audience directly.</p>
<p>You also have a lot of flexibility in the types of content you post on social media. This physical therapist is building an audience with simple tutorials on staying healthy and active.</p>

<p>Notice again how he’s narrowed the target audience down to runners. That’s a great way to make sure you’re content is relevant to your ideal customer.</p>
<h3>Email</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/03/email-marketing-best-practices">Email content marketing</a> can take a few forms. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/25/email-newsletter-ideas">Newsletters</a> are incredibly popular. So are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-nurturing-emails">email nurture campaigns</a> that keep people interested who aren’t ready to buy right away.</p>
<p>Here’s a monthly newsletter from a local <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/handyman-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handyman service</a>. It’s simple, timely, and has links to other resources and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/21/promotional-email-examples">promotions</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-handyman.webp" alt="Content marketing - Handyman newsletter." width="370" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94209 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-handyman.webp 370w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-handyman-185x300.webp 185w" sizes="(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px" /></p>
<p>The winning ingredient here is consistency. A monthly newsletter, sent at the same time each month, becomes very noticeable in an inbox.</p>
<h3>Podcasts</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-marketing-podcasts">Podcasts</a> have been around for a while, but they’ve really made a splash for content marketers in the last couple of years.</p>
<p>The great thing about this type of content marketing is that you can approach it in several ways. You can create your own podcast, be a guest on someone else&#8217;s, or sponsor a show that’s in your niche.</p>
<p>Outdoor retailer REI produces a regular podcast featuring stories from people doing cool stuff in the wild.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-rei.webp" alt="Content marketing - REI podcast" width="937" height="576" class="aligncenter wp-image-94210 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-rei.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-rei-480x295.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.rei.com/blog/podcasts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>If this sounds good to you, try searching for podcasts produced in your town. They could be a good place to get featured.</p>

<h2>How to build a content marketing strategy</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Set goals:</strong> Start by deciding if it’s traffic, conversions, awareness, or some other marketing metric you’re after.

</ul>

<h2>14 content marketing tips</h2>
<p>Now that we have a solid foundation, let’s work on making sure your content marketing strategy delivers the best return possible.</p>
<h3>1. Think distribution first</h3>
<p>It doesn’t matter how amazing your content is; it won’t help your business grow if no one sees it. That’s why you have to ask “what’s the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-distribution">distribution plan</a>?” for every bit of copy or video you create.</p>
<p>For SEO blog posts, the answer is straightforward. The core distribution plan is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/06/on-page-seo">optimize the post</a> so people find it on search engines.</p>
<p>For a thought leadership post or a new data study that no one is specifically searching for, you’ll need a more active distribution plan. That may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Posting it on social media</li>
<li>Asking <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/26/influencer-marketing">influencers</a> to share it with their audiences</li>
<li>Getting it picked up by a relevant news outlet</li>
<li>Sending it to your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/05/increase-email-signups">email subscribers</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-accountant.webp" alt="Content marketing - social post promoting a blog post." width="791" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94211 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-accountant.webp 791w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-accountant-480x364.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 791px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Social media is a natural fit for distributing blog posts like </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DOVJahpjPnW/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>this one</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<h3>2. Target accessible keywords</h3>
<p>When you’re choosing which keywords to target with content, you’ll need to look at both their search volume and keyword difficulty.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/wordstream-free-keyword-tool-results-cars.webp" alt="wordstream free keyword tool results for cars search" width="900" height="653" class="aligncenter wp-image-92356 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/wordstream-free-keyword-tool-results-cars.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/wordstream-free-keyword-tool-results-cars-480x348.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Search volume refers to the number of times people search for a term within a given month. The higher that number, the more people will see your content if you rank.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/articles/ultimate-guide-to-keyword-competition">Keyword difficulty</a> is an estimate of how hard it’ll be to get your content on the front page of search results. That’s important because even if people search for a term 10,000 times a month, no one will see your content if it isn’t ranking.</p>
<p>If your site is new or has a low domain rating (you can find that on tools like Ahrefs or Moz), then aim for keywords with a lower keyword difficulty and at least some traffic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-ahrefs.webp" alt="Content marketing - Ahrefs." width="937" height="519" class="aligncenter wp-image-94212 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-ahrefs.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-ahrefs-480x266.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Nike has a pretty good domain rating.</em></p>
<h3>3. Produce for the platform</h3>
<p>A long-form article is great for your blog, but it won’t work on most social channels. And of course, text doesn’t play on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/14/tiktok-trend-discovery">TikTok</a>.</p>
<p>Know what works on each channel you plan to publish on and create content specific to each.</p>
<h3>4. Make it mobile-friendly</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mobiloud.com/blog/what-percentage-of-internet-traffic-is-mobile?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Well over half</a> of all internet traffic comes from mobile devices. So the content you publish needs to be easily viewable on small screens.</p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, this means utilizing a responsive web design that optimizes itself according to the device.</p>
<p>But for content creators, it means things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing shorter paragraphs so people don’t see a screen full of text.</li>
<li>Breaking up content with bullet points, images, and subheads so it’s more skimmable.</li>
<li>Including graphics that make information easier to understand without a lot of copy.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-ortho.webp" alt="Content marketing - Orthocarolina blog post." width="325" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94213 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-ortho.webp 325w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-ortho-163x300.webp 163w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Short paragraphs, images, and internal links help break up walls of text on small screens.</em></p>
<h3>5. Research your content competitors</h3>
<p>Content competitors are the websites and organizations that publish content on the same topics as you. They may also be business competitors, but not always.</p>
<p>Researching your content competitors will yield a ton of valuable insights for your own content strategy. To start, read through their blogs and social feeds. Note what types of content they publish, how often, their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">brand voice</a>, and so on.</p>
<p>Then, review these guides to learn many more ways to learn from your competitors online:</p>

<h3>6. Look for topics in forums</h3>
<p>Online forums like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reddit-marketing">Reddit</a> are gold mines of audience research. Find the subreddits your target audience hangs out in. Review them regularly to see what challenges perplex them, what questions they ask, and what insider terms they use.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/1dz4u6w/ama_im_the_ceo_of_peg_city_car_coop_ask_me/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Ask-me-anything</em></a><em> (AMA) events are a great way to drum up questions and content ideas on Reddit.</em></p>
<h3>7. Use lead magnets</h3>
<p>Ideally, you want to turn content viewers into leads. One proven way to do that is by using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/15/lead-magnet-ideas">lead magnets</a>.</p>
<p>A lead magnet is a free piece of valuable content or offer (like an ebook or template) that a business gives away in exchange for a person’s contact information, usually an email address, to generate leads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-quiz.webp" alt="Content marketing - Quiz example." width="937" height="509" class="aligncenter wp-image-94215 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-quiz.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-quiz-480x261.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Try adding lead magnets to a pop-up that triggers when someone scrolls partway down a blog post. Tie the offer into the topic if possible (like offering a yard maintenance calendar on a blog post about growing grass).</p>
<h3>8. Repurpose content for more reach</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/13/content-creation">Creating content</a> takes time. You can multiply the return on a piece of content by<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-repurposing"> repurposing it</a> for use on several channels.</p>
<p>There are few limitations to how you do this. A single interview with an industry expert can become clips you share on social media, a long-form blog post, quotes for your next annual report, and fodder for getting featured in industry publications.</p>
<h3>9. Mention your products thoughtfully</h3>
<p>Nothing will lose trust faster than being overtly salesy when someone expects an unbiased answer to their question. But that doesn’t mean you can’t ever mention what you sell. You just have to be strategic in how you do it.</p>
<p>For example, it’s perfectly acceptable to include your product in a roundup of the best options in your category. It’s also fine to share a screenshot of what you sell if it fits in the narrative of your post. Just don’t promise a list of tips and make them all about your product.</p>
<h3>10. Make the most of your content evergreen</h3>
<p>In content marketing, evergreen content is material that remains valuable and relevant over time. It continues to attract traffic, engagement, and leads long after it’s published.</p>
<p>An example of an evergreen content post would be a guide to fixing a leaky faucet or creating a personal budgeting spreadsheet.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-budget.webp" alt="Content marketing - blog post about budgeting." width="937" height="588" class="aligncenter wp-image-94217 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-budget.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-budget-480x301.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.vermontfederal.org/blog/7-steps-for-creating-a-healthy-personal-budget" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>By contrast, time-sensitive content would be a news article about a one-time event in your industry or a list of timely trends.</p>
<p>Both are useful in a content strategy, but evergreen content delivers the best return over its lifetime.</p>
<h3>11. Use AI wisely</h3>
<p>AI has advanced at a rapid rate, and it’s now capable of spinning up entire blog posts and even videos in a matter of seconds. That challenge with letting it do so is that it can also do it for every one of your competitors just as easily. Which means your AI content will look an awful lot like theirs.</p>
<p>To get the efficiency benefits of AI without churning out copycat content, think of it like an assistant and a creative sparring partner instead of a writer or videographer.</p>
<p>Here are several ways you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-in-marketing">use AI</a> to create better content faster:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Summarize:</strong> Ask AI to provide key insights from a long video transcript or call recording.</li>
<li><strong>Suggest:</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-prompts">Prompt your AI</a> to suggest alternative titles, captions, or a starter outline you can riff off of.</li>
<li><strong>Scrutinize: </strong>Feed a piece of content to your AI tool and have it review for missing subtopics, logic gaps, or spelling errors.</li>
<li><strong>Survey:</strong> Give AI a large dataset and ask it to identify common themes or insights that can be turned into blog post topics.</li>
</ul>
<h3>12. Start optimizing for AI search engines</h3>
<ol start="12"></ol>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/ai-search-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI is taking over search</a> in a big way. People are using platforms like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/21/chatgpt-impact-on-marketing">ChatGPT</a>, Perplexity, and Gemini to find answers. And Google’s own <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-overviews-statistics">AI Overviews</a> are showing up on more results pages.</p>
<p>On one hand, that means less traffic being referred to your website from traditional search engine results. On the other hand, there’s a growing opportunity to generate <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-referral-traffic">referral traffic directly from these AI platforms</a>.</p>
<p>Much of what you do for SEO will help you get cited by AI. So go all in optimizing for Google’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/14/google-e-e-a-t">E-E-A-T signals</a>, target conversational queries, and try to earn more brand mentions on other websites.</p>
<p>On top of that, look at how each platform responds to your target keywords. Check how they autofill suggestions and take note of what related questions they suggest.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-related.webp" alt="Content marketing - Perplexity reply." width="937" height="422" class="aligncenter wp-image-94218 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-related.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-related-480x216.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Perplexity’s related questions</em></p>
<h3>13. Update old content</h3>
<p>Over time, some of the assets you create will fall out of date, lose search rankings, and stop pulling in new visitors. They aren’t dead; they’re actually a shortcut to boosting traffic.</p>
<p>Run a search on GA4 or your favorite SEO tool to find content that’s no longer performing. If it’s an evergreen post, look for ways to bring it back to life. Update links, include new data, and ID any informational gaps it’s not currently addressing.</p>
<h3>14. Use lots of original quotes and data</h3>
<p>Original insights and data are a magic pill of success in content marketing. They get cited by AI, help add authority for SEO, and help generate lots of media buzz and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/10/link-building-secrets">backlinks</a>.</p>
<p>You don’t need to commission a huge survey of your industry to generate new data (but do so if you can!). Try these options instead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interview internal and external experts for original insights and quotes.</li>
<li>Post a quick poll on social media.</li>
<li>Anonymize data about your customer base and share it.</li>
<li>Run experiments that test ideas from industry experts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Content marketing FAQs</h2>
<p>Got more questions about content marketing? We&#8217;ve got answers!</p>
<h3>Is it really worth doing content marketing in 2025?</h3>
<p>Yes, content marketing is still one of the most effective ways to grow a business in 2025. Trust is only becoming more important in the buying decision, and content helps you build it. Plus, content marketing is a great way to get found on more AI search results, so it’ll remain relevant in the future.</p>
<h3>What are the key content marketing characteristics?</h3>
<p>The four characteristics of content marketing are audience-focused, value-first, long-term, and relationship-driven. Together, these traits explain why it remains so effective in 2025. Content that solves real problems, builds trust over time, and strengthens customer relationships will consistently deliver valuable returns.</p>
<h3>What are the three C’s of content marketing?</h3>
<p>The three C’s of content marketing are creation, curation, and conversation. You create original content that showcases your expertise, curate relevant resources that add extra value for your audience, and spark conversations that build trust and lasting relationships.</p>
<h3>What is the main goal of content marketing?</h3>
<p>The main goal of content marketing is to attract, engage, and convert an audience by providing valuable, relevant information that builds trust and drives profitable customer action over time.</p>
<h3>How is content marketing different from traditional advertising?</h3>
<p>Content marketing differs from traditional advertising because it focuses on delivering helpful, relevant information that audiences seek out, while traditional advertising usually interrupts people with promotional messages. Instead of pushing products directly, content marketing builds long-term trust and relationships, making it less about quick sales and more about sustained customer loyalty.</p>
<h3>How do I start content marketing?</h3>
<p>You can start content marketing by first defining your target audience and goals, then building a strategy around the types of content that will serve them best (such as blogs, videos, emails, etc.). From there, research keywords, create a content calendar, and publish consistently, while promoting your work through the right channels and measuring results to refine your approach.</p>
<h2>Grow with content marketing</h2>
<p>There are dozens of types of content marketing and many ways to leverage each one. It’s easy to get bogged down with the options.</p>
<p>Our best advice is to start small by simply sharing your knowledge on the platforms with which you&#8217;re most comfortable. If you’re a divorce lawyer who loves TikTok, post a few videos explaining the biggest challenges of navigating a legal separation.</p>
<p>You can turn them into blog posts or Instagram Reels later. But for now, just get your brilliance out into the world and watch more people turn to you for answers.</p>

<h2>What is the Facebook algorithm?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/08/facebook-marketing-ideas">Facebook</a> algorithm is a system that combines artificial intelligence and rules-based decision-making to determine which content users see when they scroll through their feed. The algorithm creates a personalized experience, attempting to expose the posts, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/22/instagram-reels-ideas-for-businesses">Reels</a>, and Stories each user is most likely to engage with.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-plumber-297x300.webp" alt="Facebook algorithm - Facebook post from a plumber." width="297" height="300" class="aligncenter wp-image-94107 size-medium" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The Facebook algorithm seeks to </em><em>share content</em><em> that its users will engage with, like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/r/1CFaXEmBuE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this tutorial</a> on fixing a sink that has over 5,000 likes.</em></p>
<p>The complex algorithm evaluates thousands of signals, including previous user interactions, content type, content publishers, and previous engagements, to set its recommendations.</p>
<p>It’s helpful to remember that, above all else, Facebook prioritizes <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/06/10/facebook-post-engagement">increasing user engagement</a>. So as its algorithm evolves, it’s mostly done to serve that goal.</p>

<div id="how-does-the-facebook-algorithm-work"></div>
<h2>How does the Facebook algorithm work?</h2>
<p>The Facebook algorithm works by ranking all <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/10/facebook-post-ideas">possible posts</a> you could potentially see and predicting which ones you’re most likely to find meaningful or engaging. It gathers signals and uses predictive models to rank content in your feed.</p>
<p>Every time you open the app, the algorithm has to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>What content can it show?</li>
<li>What does it know about the post?</li>
<li>How relevant will it be to the user?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at how the Facebook algorithm answers these questions.</p>
<h3>The four steps of ranking content</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/718033381901819?id=208060977200861" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The algorithm uses a four-step process</a> to fill your screen with unskippable images, text, and videos:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Review the inventory:</strong> Facebook collects and reviews the set of posts shared by your friends and from the pages you follow.</li>
<li><strong> </strong><strong>Consider the signals: </strong>Then, the algorithm considers hundreds of thousands of signals from the available inventory of posts. It looks at things you’d expect, like who posted the content and when it was posted, as well as more subtle signals like what time it is now and how fast the internet connection is.</li>
<li><strong>Predict how the content will be received:</strong> Here’s where the magic of Facebook&#8217;s over <a href="https://transparency.meta.com/features/ranking-and-content/#prediction-models-used-in-ranking-connected-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 prediction models</a> comes in. They assess all the information from the first two steps to make an educated guess at how likely you are to do things like watch a video to completion, comment on a Story, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Apply a relevancy score:</strong> Finally, the algorithm gives every piece of available content a score based on how relevant it is to you. The highest-scoring content lands in your feed first.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-lsu.webp" alt="Facebook algorithm - Facebook post from LSU" width="530" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94108 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-lsu.webp 530w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-lsu-480x543.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 530px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/16sCwdzdS2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Great content</em></a><em>, relevant to your audience, will make its way through Facebook’s selection process.</em></p>
<h3>Recommended vs. connected content</h3>
<p>The Facebook algorithm serves up two types of content: connected and recommended. The system strives to show you a mix of both, and there are nuances to how each is ranked.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connected content: </strong>These are posts from friends, accounts you’re following, and groups you’ve joined. Most of the posts you see fall in this category, and it’s chosen based on how you’re connected to the publisher and how you’ve interacted with similar content.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended content:</strong> This includes posts published by accounts you aren’t friends with or following, but that may have some relevance to you. Facebook recommends this content based on how you’ve interacted with similar content from similar publishers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Facebook content standards</h3>
<p>You can’t discuss the Facebook algorithm without mentioning the platform’s two sets of content standards. If you run afoul of these rules, no amount of relevance or connection will get your post past the algorithm’s filters.</p>
<p>Facebook’s <a href="https://transparency.meta.com/en-gb/policies/community-standards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Community Standards</a> are rules about what people can and can’t share on the platform. They cover areas like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Violence and criminal behavior:</strong> Threats, terrorism, organized crime, and the like.</li>
<li><strong>Safety:</strong> Think bullying, harassment, suicide, or self-injury content.</li>
<li><strong>Objectionable content:</strong> Includes hate speech, adult nudity, and sexual exploitation.</li>
<li><strong>Integrity and authenticity:</strong> This covers misinformation, fake accounts, spam, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Respecting intellectual property:</strong> Things like copyright and trademark rights are covered here.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1257205004624246/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recommendation Guidelines</a> are the rules that govern what content Facebook will <em>not</em> suggest to users in areas like Groups, Pages, Marketplace, or the main feed. Even if a post doesn’t break Community Standards, it may still be downranked or excluded from recommendations if it could create a poor or unsafe experience.</p>
<p>These guidelines restrict things like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Borderline content</strong>: Sensational, misleading, or low-quality posts.</li>
<li><strong>Sensitive topics</strong>: Health claims, political or civic content, and unverified information.</li>
<li><strong>Potentially unsafe or inappropriate material:</strong> Violence, sexually suggestive content, and spammy links.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Facebook algorithm vs. other social media algorithms</h3>
<p>Another way to contextualize how the Facebook algorithm works is to compare it to other popular social media sites. Here’s a quick rundown of their key differences:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook algorithm:</strong> It prioritizes meaningful interactions between friends, family, and groups. Its ranking factors lean heavily on relationship strength, type of content, engagement, and recency.</li>
<li><strong>TikTok algorithm:</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-algorithm">The TikTok algorithm</a> focuses on the discovery of new-to-you creators through its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/07/how-to-get-on-tiktok-fyp">For You Page</a> (FYP). Ranking factors center around previous interactions (watch times, likes, etc.), video information, and your device and account settings.</li>
<li><strong>Instagram algorithm:</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-algorithm">Instagram’s algorithm</a> takes a blended approach that balances both personal connections and trending, engaging content. Its ranking factors rely on relationship history, engagement signals, and relevance to your interests, among others.</li>
<li><strong>X (formerly Twitter) algorithm: </strong>Real-time conversations and trending topics are at the forefront of what X’s algorithm shares most. It ranks content heavily on recency, engagement, and personalization to the user.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/giveaway-ideas">Giveaways</a> like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/r/14Jofhu3Vgj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one</a> are a great way to juice the Facebook algorithm with engagement.</em></p>
<h3>User controls</h3>
<p>Even though the algorithm is always working in the background to order the content on your feed, you have considerable control over what it chooses to show you. Here are several of the most prominent user controls you can apply to influence the algo:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Favorites: </strong>You can mark certain friends or Pages as Favorites so their posts appear higher in your feed.</li>
<li><strong>Snooze:</strong> Temporarily hide posts from a person, Page, or Group for 30 days without unfriending or leaving.</li>
<li><strong>Unfollow:</strong> Stop seeing posts from someone entirely while still staying connected.</li>
<li><strong>Hide Post/See Fewer Like This: </strong>Tell the algorithm you don’t want to see similar content in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Feed Preferences:</strong> A settings hub where you can manage Favorites, Snooze, Unfollows, and reconnect with people/Pages to shape your feed experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Facebook algorithm updates and trends to know about</h2>
<p>If there’s one thing constant about Facebook’s algorithm, it’s change. Here are some trends to be conscious of as you post throughout 2025 and beyond.</p>
<h3>Prioritizing Reels</h3>
<p>Starting around 2023, Facebook began increasing the weight given to short-form video content. They started pushing Reels into feeds and recommendations. This was likely a response to the popularity of TikTok.</p>
<p>For brands, that means it’s time to experiment with some quirky, little, fun, and educational videos if you want to expand your Facebook reach.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-dentist.webp" alt="Facebook algorithm - Facebook post from a dentist." width="399" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94110 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-dentist.webp 399w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-dentist-200x300.webp 200w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/r/17GHc5F3CF/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Even dentists</em></a><em> can have some fun with Facebook Reels.</em></p>
<h3>AI-driven content recommendations</h3>
<p>Given <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-meta-ends-ai-200401578.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s big AI push</a>, it’s no surprise that Meta rolled out more AI-powered suggestions in the Feed, surfacing posts from outside your friend network if they’re predicted to be relevant.</p>
<p>Hyper-relevance for your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a> is the name of the game here. Learn their vernacular and pay attention to the content they react to. Use that insight to publish posts they’ll like and share.</p>
<h3>Clickbait and engagement bait downranking</h3>
<p>Meta is <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/04/cracking-down-spammy-content-facebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explicitly targeting</a> obviously spammy content and taking steps to lower its reach. That either means penalizing their content in the rankings or removing accounts that coordinate fake engagement posts.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-clickbait.webp" alt="Facebook algorithm - Facebook post example from Facebook." width="690" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94111 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-clickbait.webp 690w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-clickbait-480x417.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 690px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/04/cracking-down-spammy-content-facebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>It’s a good time to steer clear of spammy tactics. If you’re not sure whether what you’re about to publish is clickbait, ask yourself, “Will this genuinely help my target audience, or am I posting this strictly for engagement?”</p>

<h2>10 ways to work with the Facebook algorithm (with examples)</h2>
<p>Now that we understand how the Facebook algorithm prioritizes content, let’s look at 10 ways you can work with it to give your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/02/facebook-marketing-for-small-business">Facebook marketing</a> a big boost.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-tips-list.webp" alt="Facebook algorithm - list of Facebook algorithm tips." width="675" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94112 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-tips-list.webp 675w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-tips-list-480x427.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 675px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>1. Spark real conversations</h3>
<p>While this list of tips isn’t in any specific order, this one is probably the most important of the bunch. Facebook’s algorithm prioritizes engagement. Make sure some of your posts ask questions, start conversations, and poll people for their opinions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-engagement.webp" alt="Facebook algorithm - Real estate Facebook post." width="483" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94113 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-engagement.webp 483w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-engagement-480x596.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 483px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1AeJ8YD736/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Bonus: Want a fast and free focus group? Share a few options of a new product or design and see what your followers prefer (plus juice the algorithm with all that engagement!).</p>
<h3>2. Post consistently, not constantly</h3>
<p>While content recency is a Facebook ranking factor, you don’t want to overwhelm your audience. So create a consistent<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/24/editorial-calendar"> publishing calendar</a> so the algorithm has something new to share, but avoid over-publishing so it looks like you’re spamming.</p>
<p>There’s no hard and fast rule about how often to post on Facebook. Instead, think about your audience and plan seasonally. If you sell sunscreen, ramp up posts at the beginning of summer.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="👋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Not sure what to post?</strong> Get <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/social-media-calendar-template?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Template_MonthlySocialMediaCalendar_Download">Your Copy &amp; Paste Social Media Calendar</a> for a year’s worth of content ideas.</p>
<h3>3. Lean into video and Reels</h3>
<p>Facebook is boosting short-form, native, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/31/facebook-live-guide">live video</a> in feeds, so now’s a good time to publish that type of content, especially on Facebook Reels.</p>
<p>Beauty brand ColourPop regularly posts popular videos in a variety of formats.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-skincare.webp" alt="Facebook algorithm - Facebook post from colourpop." width="354" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94114 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-skincare.webp 354w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-skincare-177x300.webp 177w" sizes="(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/r/16VLWvgDXk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Copy the brand’s<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-media-strategy"> strategy</a> by posting some quick tutorials and product videos. Or try a funny “Day in the Life” clip to show what it’s like behind the scenes at your business.</p>
<h3>4. Write scroll-stopping intro hooks</h3>
<p>Facebook truncates long captions. To stop those thumbs from scrolling past your content (and showing the algorithm it’s worth promoting), put something thought-provoking and provocative in the first lines of your post.</p>
<p>Check out this post from the beverage brand Innocent.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-innocent.webp" alt="Facebook algorithm - Facebook post from Innocent." width="937" height="571" class="aligncenter wp-image-94115 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-innocent.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-innocent-480x293.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1G1BFFSQVg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Readers will see the first three items and want to click for the rest of the list. The top comment is the icing on the engagement cake, as it lets you know there is some really good content further down the post.</p>
<h3>5. Mix up your formats</h3>
<p>Variety is the spice of life. Keep your feed fresh by posting text, videos, images, and carousels. Not only will you give your audience something new to view, you’ll be able to test which content types work best.</p>
<p>For a little inspiration, scroll through Hype’s Facebook account.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-hype.webp" alt="Facebook algorithm - Facebook post from Hype." width="504" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94116 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-hype.webp 504w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-hype-480x571.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 504px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1FNq9ysiv7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>You’ll see some shoppable posts, image collages, Reels, and other content types. It gives people a reason to spend more time rummaging around the brand’s Facebook page.</p>
<h3>6. Reply fast and often</h3>
<p>We’ve established that the algorithm loves to share content that gets comments. You can quickly amplify the discussions on your posts by simply replying when someone comments.</p>
<p>Look at how this physical therapy office nearly doubled the number of comments in its post by continuing the conversation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-rehab.webp" alt="Facebook algorithm - Facebook post with replies." width="576" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94117 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-rehab.webp 576w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-rehab-480x500.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 576px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1FJ63rVr7P/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Engagement with your followers like this will also help you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/27/trust-signals">build trust</a>, a key factor when they decide who to buy from.</p>
<h3>7. Avoid clickbait content</h3>
<p>Social media users have become savvy to the trick some less-scrupulous businesses use to generate inauthentic engagement.</p>
<p>Facebook’s algorithm has too. If you try to fudge your way into people’s feeds, the system will flag your content as engagement bait and throttle your chances of greater placement.</p>
<p>Here are several ways to keep your content from being tagged as clickbait:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deliver what your post promises: </strong>If you say you’ll share four unique, unheard of ideas, don’t just list things everyone already knows.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid clickbait titles:</strong> Don’t use captions like “You won’t believe what happened next!” or “#5 will shock you!”</li>
<li><strong>Stay consistent with your brand:</strong> Don’t post about a topic just because it&#8217;s popular if it has nothing to do with your business or typical content.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t beg for reactions:</strong> Stay away from copy like “Like if you love pizza.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>8. Post at the right time</h3>
<ol start="8"></ol>
<p>Get a little early engagement boost by posting content when your audience is most likely to be online.</p>
<p>If you look at studies into the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/06/best-time-to-post-on-facebook">best time to post on Facebook</a>, you’ll see they mostly don’t agree.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-best-times.webp" alt="Facebook algorithm - Graphic if best times to post research." width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94118 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-best-times.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-best-times-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Your best bet is to take an educated guess based on your audience, then home in on it through trial and error.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to reach professionals in their 30s, you might post after the typical workday. But if your audience is active retirees, you could try a little earlier in the day.</p>
<h3>9. Be active in groups</h3>
<p>Content shared in<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/16/create-facebook-group"> Facebook groups</a> gets prioritized in feeds because it’s considered meaningful interactions with people you’re connected to. As a brand, you can leverage this ranking factor by becoming a regular participant in a relevant Facebook group.</p>
<p>Sometimes, customers will create a Facebook group to talk about your brand. That’s what happened for this travel trailer manufacturer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-camper.webp" alt="Facebook algorithm - Facebook post from Scamp Travel Trailers group." width="937" height="413" class="aligncenter wp-image-94119 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-camper.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-camper-480x212.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But even if that hasn’t happened, you can look for groups that tie into what you sell. For example, this brand could search for camping, travel trailer, or off-road adventure communities.</p>
<p>A word of caution. Don’t be overly salesy on any <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reddit-marketing">online forum</a>. Go in to be helpful, answer questions, and participate. Your educational posts will get an algorithm boost and you’ll grow an engaged, targeted audience.</p>
<h3>10. Track your analytics</h3>
<p>Facebook offers a robust dashboard of analytics you can track that’ll help you understand how the algorithm works for your brand.</p>
<p>For example, you can see which content type gets the most views and engagements. Then, use that data to inform your next campaign.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-analytics-300x101.webp" alt="Facebook algorithm - analytics dashboard." width="300" height="101" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-94120" /></p>
<p>All this data will tell you when, what, and where to share on Facebook for maximum reach.</p>
<div id="facebook-algorithm-faqs"></div>
<h2>Facebook algorithm FAQs</h2>
<p>We’ve covered a lot of ground. Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about the Facebook algorithm.</p>
<h3>How does the Facebook algorithm decide what I see?</h3>
<p>To decide which posts end up in your feed, Facebook looks at who posted, the type of content, how likely you are to interact, and how recent it is.</p>
<h3>How often does the Facebook algorithm change?</h3>
<p>Constantly. Meta makes small tweaks to its algorithms all the time, with major updates a few times a year.</p>
<h3>How can businesses beat the Facebook algorithm?</h3>
<p>You can’t “beat” the Facebook algorithm, and you shouldn’t try. Instead, work with the algorithm by posting a variety of engaging, high-quality content that your audience will find educational and entertaining.</p>
<h3>How can I reset my Facebook algorithm?</h3>
<p>You can’t fully reset your Facebook algorithm, but you can influence it by adjusting your feed settings like prioritizing friends, unfollowing pages, hitting the “Snooze” button on content you don’t want to see, and so on.</p>
<h3>Is the Facebook algorithm the same as Instagram’s?</h3>
<p>Facebook and Instagram’s algorithms are similar, but not identical. Both emphasize engagement, but Instagram relies more heavily on visual discovery and trending audio.</p>
<h3>What’s the best time to post on Facebook?</h3>
<p>The best time to post on Facebook depends on when your audience is most active on the platform, which you can find in your Facebook analytics dashboard and by tracking your content success.</p>
<h2>Learn how the Facebook algorithm works</h2>
<p>Too often, social media algorithms are portrayed as some type of sophisticated lock that needs to be bested for success. You’ll do a lot better if you think of it like a suggestion engine you need to work with instead of against.</p>
<p>Remember that the algorithm’s biggest priority is fostering engagement. Let that knowledge guide what you post and when. Publish content that gets people commenting and sharing. And don’t hesitate to jump into the conversation.</p>

<h2>What is reputation management for small businesses?</h2>
<p>Reputation management is the ongoing process of shaping how customers perceive your business, both online and in your community, by monitoring reviews, responding to feedback, and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/27/trust-signals"> fostering trust</a> through positive interactions. For small businesses, it means making sure that when people search for you—or hear about you locally—they find honest, positive, and consistent stories about your brand.</p>
<p>Cultivating your reputation is both proactive and reactive. It includes actions like positioning yourself as an expert online, as well as responding to public feedback from customers.</p>
<p>Take a local HVAC repair shop, for example. It will get <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/07/22/yelp-reviews">Yelp reviews</a>, a Google Business Profile, and some word-of-mouth awareness, whether or not the team actively manages the business’s reputation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-review-example.webp" alt="Reputation management - Google review." width="937" height="605" class="aligncenter wp-image-93879 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-review-example.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-review-example-480x310.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If the business monitors its mentions, takes proactive steps to build a good standing, and responds to feedback, it’ll cultivate a much better reputation than its competitors.</p>

<h2>How does reputation management help your business?</h2>
<p>For small businesses, your reputation is a superpower that helps you compete with much larger competitors. Coupled with a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/17/increase-online-presence">strong online presence</a>, a stellar reputation makes you the obvious choice to anyone searching for what you sell.</p>

<h2>Small business reputation management challenges</h2>
<p>Small businesses have some unique hurdles to overcome when it comes to keeping their reputation squeaky clean. Here are several of the most common challenges and tips to overcome them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited time and resources:</strong> Focus on a few high-impact actions—like monitoring Google reviews weekly and replying promptly—rather than trying to do everything.</li>
<li><strong>Low social media engagement:</strong> Consistency beats all on social media. Publish<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/10/facebook-post-ideas"> new content regularly</a>, highlight customer stories, and ask questions that invite simple responses to spark interaction.</li>
<li><strong>Difficulty generating reviews:</strong> Build <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">review requests</a> into your sales or service process, such as sending a quick follow-up email or text with a direct review link.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of local positive press coverage:</strong> Create your own buzz by sponsoring small <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/04/25/event-marketing">community events</a>, sharing local success stories, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/04/how-to-write-a-press-release">pitching to neighborhood news outlets</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Too many negative reviews:</strong> <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-respond-to-negative-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Respond quickly and professionally</a>, fix issues where possible, and actively encourage happy customers to share their experiences to balance out the negativity.</li>
<li><strong>Competing with larger businesses:</strong> Lean into your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/unique-selling-proposition">unique selling proposition</a> and emphasize authenticity, local roots, and customer relationships that big brands can’t match.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to manage your business’s reputation (online and beyond)</h2>
<p>You don’t need a 100-page strategy to manage—and improve—your business’s reputation. You can build an effective and efficient reputation management strategy using these steps and the following tips.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/900x800-1-1.webp" alt="Reputation management - Checklist" width="739" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93916 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/900x800-1-1.webp 739w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/900x800-1-1-480x390.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 739px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>1. Establish a presence across all relevant listings</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/01/business-directory-listings">Business directories</a> are often the first place a potential customer will encounter your brand. That’s because platforms like Yelp, Google Business Profile, and Angi spend a lot of money to get in front of people searching for solutions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-yelp-google.webp" alt="Reputation management - Google result with Yelp in it." width="937" height="523" class="aligncenter wp-image-93880 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-yelp-google.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-yelp-google-480x268.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Business directories often sit at the top of Google results pages.</em></p>
<p>Here’s the tricky part: Some of these directories will automatically create a listing for your business, and it can be filled with incorrect or incomplete data.</p>
<p>We recently reviewed 100 home services business listings and found that <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/home-services-business-listings-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">85%</a> of them were completely missing, incomplete, or incorrect.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-pie-chart.webp" alt="Reputation management - chart from listings study." width="869" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93881 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-pie-chart.webp 869w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-pie-chart-480x331.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 869px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>So your first job is to claim your business listings on the directories that matter and review them for complete and correct information. Here’s how to claim your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-claim-a-business-on-google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Business Profile</a> and your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/angi-business-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angi listing</a>.</p>
<p>You can check each one individually. But it’ll be a lot easier and faster to use<a href="https://localiq.com/free-business-listings-grader/?cid=Web_WS_InContentTextLink_Freemium_Listings&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> LocaliQ’s Free Business Listing Grader</a>. Simply connect your Google Business Profile, and it’ll automatically review your presence across more than 20 top business directories.</p>
<h3>2. Actively monitor reviews</h3>
<p>Online reviews have a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-online-reviews-impact-your-business"> significant impact</a> on your ability to get new customers.<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/19/digital-marketing-statistics"> 93%</a> of people read online reviews before making a purchase, so it’s crucial to your business growth to understand what your reviews say.</p>
<p>Like listings, you can monitor the review platforms that matter (like Google, Facebook, etc.). Or you can <a href="https://localiq.com/products/listings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use a solution</a> that collects them in one place and displays them on a single dashboard.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/liq-free-tool-business-listings-grader-feature-section.webp" alt="" width="1000" height="1000" class="aligncenter wp-image-74471 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/liq-free-tool-business-listings-grader-feature-section.webp 1000w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/liq-free-tool-business-listings-grader-feature-section-980x980.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/liq-free-tool-business-listings-grader-feature-section-480x480.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1000px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Pro tip: Set an alert to notify you when new reviews come in so you can take the next step in this strategy and reply.</p>
<h3>3. Respond to every review</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.shoutaboutus.com/blog/over-half-of-consumers-wont-use-businesses-that-ignore-their-reviews-survey-finds?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Over half of consumers</a> won’t use a business that ignores reviews. Plus, people spend <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/19/digital-marketing-statistics">50%</a> more with businesses that respond to reviews. And 53% of customers expect a brand to respond to a negative review within seven days.</p>
<p>That’s compelling evidence showing why responding to reviews is a crucial step in successful reputation management.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-positive-review.webp" alt="Reputation management - a good reply to a positive review." width="673" height="448" class="aligncenter wp-image-93882 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-positive-review.webp 673w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-positive-review-480x320.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 673px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Keep in mind, the wrong response—especially to a bad review—can make things worse. Here are a few tips to win over current and future customers when you <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-respond-to-negative-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reply to a negative review</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set your goal: </strong>Before typing a response, imagine what outcome you want. If you want to win back the dissatisfied customer and demonstrate to others reading the review that you’re a trusted partner, then approach the response with that in mind.</li>
<li><strong>Personalize your response:</strong> This isn’t the time for a generic note. Confirm that you’ve taken the feedback to heart, reiterate the concern, and offer a specific solution.</li>
<li><strong>Apologize: </strong>A swift apology is a strong foundation for your response.</li>
<li><strong>Offer a resolution and take it offline:</strong> Give a brief synopsis of how you’ll make things right and offer to discuss details in DMs, by email, or on the phone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Encourage more customer reviews</h3>
<ol start="4"></ol>
<p>You can always ask for customer reviews as often and in as many ways as possible. That’s how you build up a solid foundation of great reviews that overwhelms any occasional negative ones.</p>
<p>This guide will show you dozens of ways to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">generate more reviews</a> from your best customers. At the very least, include a review link on your website and set up an automated text or email to request reviews after each purchase.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f31f.png" alt="🌟" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Good reviews solidify your reputation.</strong> Download <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/how-to-get-more-reviews?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_howtogetreviews_Download&amp;itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links">How to Get More Reviews: Tips to Boost Ranking, Reputation, &amp; Revenue </a></p>
<h3>5. Set up social listening</h3>
<p>The next item on our reputation management task list is to track the instances of people mentioning your brand online. And for that, we’ll use a tactic called <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/20/social-listening">social listening</a>.</p>
<p>Social listening is the practice of tracking what people say about your business on social media, in forums, and through other digital outlets. Here’s how to use social listening to spot those mentions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use a social media management tool:</strong> Enter your business name and other relevant keywords into a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/17/best-free-social-media-management-tools"> social media management tool</a> like Sprout Social or Crowdfire, and they’ll seek out places your brand is mentioned.</li>
<li><strong>Search the platforms:</strong> Type your business name or relevant hashtag into the query bar of a social media app or online forum (like Quora or Reddit) to see if it’s mentioned.</li>
<li><strong>Set up a Google Alert: </strong>Set up a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/04/10/google-alerts"> Google Alert</a> for your business or product name and receive notifications when it’s mentioned on the web.</li>
</ul>
<p>When those conversations pop up, be prepared to jump in and answer questions, add context, or just have fun with your customers.</p>

<h3>6. Create a crisis triage process</h3>
<p>Stay in business long enough and you’re bound to have some sort of reputation crisis. It could result from a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/28/marketing-fails">poorly timed ad</a> or an unfortunate customer experience. It may even be something completely out of your control, like a vindictive competitor review bombing your business on Google.</p>
<p>No matter the cause, if you have an action plan in place, you’ll respond more quickly and thoughtfully. Your specific crisis triage process will be unique to your business, but here are a few foundational actions to include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assess: </strong>Review the incident (who, what, where, when, why), including the potential impact.</li>
<li><strong>Assign:</strong> Designate a crisis response team and note who should be alerted, who needs to review, and who needs to approve actions.</li>
<li><strong>Respond:</strong> Set rules around employee communications, handling incoming messages, and creating an official response.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor:</strong> Ramp up your social listening for a while to see how your response fared and be prepared to pivot if future action is needed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Measure success</h3>
<ol start="7"></ol>
<p>The goal is to improve your business’s reputation. The best way to know if you’re succeeding is to set some benchmarks and measure the change over time. Here are three basic measurements to track:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Volume:</strong> Total number of reviews and number of brand mentions.</li>
<li><strong>Sentiment:</strong> The percentage of positive mentions versus negative ones.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback rate:</strong> How often you can reply to reviews and brand mentions, and how fast you do it.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s best to set regular review intervals and create a scorecard for easy reference.</p>

<h3>Crush local SEO</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-seo-in-2024">Local SEO</a> is how you get your website to rank on search engines when people in your area need you most. Getting more positive reviews and filling out your Google Business Profile will help a lot.</p>

<h3>Get involved in the community</h3>
<p>Seeing you out in the community will go a long way to establishing credibility. That could mean sponsoring a local baseball team or a 5k run. But it doesn’t have to cost money. Try showing up to share your expertise at running clubs, community service events, and how-to clinics.</p>

<h3>Encourage customer referrals</h3>
<p><a href="https://firework.com/blog/referral-marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">52%</a> of small businesses say that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/06/referral-marketing">referrals</a> are their top source of new customers. And those referred customers are <a href="https://cropink.com/referral-marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more profitable and loyal</a> compared with those acquired through other sources.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/14/referral-program-ideas">Referral programs</a> are how you motivate more current customers to recommend your business to their friends, coworkers, and family members.</p>
<p>Here’s how to create a high-performing referral program:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Offer a valuable incentive:</strong> Give discounts in exchange for new customer referrals.</li>
<li><strong>Keep it simple:</strong> Don’t add too many rules or steps to your program.</li>
<li><strong>Promote it everywhere:</strong> Share your referral program on social media, on your website, in emails, on invoices and receipts, and in person (referral cards are a great option).</li>
<li><strong>Run a referral contest:</strong> Let people enter a contest or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/giveaway-ideas">giveaway</a> by referring a friend.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-refer.webp" alt="Reputation management - referral program." width="479" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93886 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-refer.webp 479w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-refer-240x300.webp 240w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px" /></p>
<h3>Be a thought leader on social media</h3>
<p>A big part of reputation management is building trust. One way to do that is by sharing helpful, expert advice on social media.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-plumber.webp" alt="Reputation management - Post from a plumber." width="683" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93887 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-plumber.webp 683w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-plumber-480x422.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 683px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Are you a plumber? Post a video on how to clear a clogged sink. Do you teach yoga? Share the five poses everyone should do to warm up in the morning.</p>
<p>You can do the same thing in your blog. Building<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/topical-authority"> topic authority</a> in this way is also great for SEO. Search algorithms will recognize you as a trusted expert in your field and reward you with<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-rank-higher-on-google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> higher rankings</a>.</p>
<h3>Pay attention to Reddit</h3>
<p>If you’ve spent any time on<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reddit-marketing"> Reddit</a>, you know Redditors tell it like it is. So if you’re a topic of conversation there, you’ll want to know about it or risk a hidden hit to your reputation.</p>
<p>The great news is that Reddit recently launched a free way to track keyword trends called <a href="https://www.business.reddit.com/blog/reddit-pro-trends-launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reddit Pro Trends</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-reddit-trends.webp" alt="Reputation management - Reddit pro trends." width="937" height="568" class="aligncenter wp-image-93888 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-reddit-trends.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-reddit-trends-480x291.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Just enter the name of your business or product (or any other related keyword), and you can see how often and where it’s mentioned in Subreddits.</p>
<p>A word of caution. Tread lightly if people are talking about you on Reddit. A defensive reply to a negative comment could make things way worse. Instead, consider going in with a learning mindset and either offer a solution or take the feedback and improve what you do.</p>

<h2>Reputation management examples (successful and unsuccessful)</h2>
<p>There’s nothing better than seeing what solid reputation management looks like in the wild, except, perhaps, seeing where it has failed. We’ve got examples of both.</p>
<h3>Successful reputation management examples</h3>
<p>Let’s start off with a few businesses that know how to build an excellent reputation.</p>
<h4>Taking personal responsibility for a bad review</h4>
<p>Bad reviews happen. Here, a returning customer shares their frustration at a bad experience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-negative-review.webp" alt="Reputation management - reply to a negative review." width="937" height="435" class="aligncenter wp-image-93892 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-negative-review.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-negative-review-480x223.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The business owner did so many things right. They apologized immediately, showed they investigated the issue, provided a resolution, and even offered a personal conversation.</p>
<h4>Proving expertise</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/23/tiktok-marketing">TikTok</a> wasn’t traditionally a place people went to learn about dental hygiene. But this dentist has amassed a massive following on the platform by sharing tips to keep teeth strong and healthy.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-dentist.webp" alt="Reputation management - Dentist TikTok" width="308" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93893 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-dentist.webp 308w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-dentist-154x300.webp 154w" sizes="(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px" /></p>
<p>The takeaways here are to be creative in how you reach your audience and to show up with helpful content consistently.</p>
<h4>Owning your business listings</h4>
<p>There are many ways to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/03/google-my-business-optimization"> optimize your business listings</a> beyond verifying business hours and phone number (although that’s a great start).</p>
<p>This HVAC business does a lot to make sure its Google Business Profile gets found and stands out.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-hvac.webp" alt="Reputation management - HVAC Google Business Profile." width="389" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93894 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-hvac.webp 389w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-hvac-195x300.webp 195w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></p>
<p>Note the collection of images showing the team, their capabilities, and their completed projects. Then, scroll down and you’ll see an active Q&amp;A section. Those answered questions give the business additional opportunities to add keywords to their listing and show off the team’s knowledge.</p>
<h3>Unsuccessful reputation management examples</h3>
<p>Sometimes, businesses try to build up a reputation in ways that ultimately fail. Here are a few cautionary tales.</p>
<h4>Using fake reviews</h4>
<p>It takes time to build up a collection of positive reviews. But as important as they are, encouraging fake reviews will cost you a lot in the long run.</p>
<p>Yelp, for example, has <a href="https://www.fox26houston.com/news/yelp-publishes-list-of-5000-businesses-it-suspects-of-fake-or-compensated-reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cracked down</a> on businesses offering free products, cash, or raffle entries in exchange for five-star reviews. Businesses caught in the act are dropped from the popular site, losing out on a lot of future business.</p>
<h4>Offering an insincere apology</h4>
<p>Mistakes happen. And when they do, you have an opportunity to turn the mishap into a learning and building opportunity.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, one thing that will end any hope at redemption—and crush your reputation—is a cold, impersonal apology.</p>
<p>Take the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/21/business/kyte-baby-ceo-apology-marissa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyte Baby kerfuffle</a>. An employee was denied her request to work remotely so she could stay near her prematurely born adopted baby. The business’s CEO reversed the decision, but then gave what appeared to be a scripted, half-hearted apology.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-apology.webp" alt="Reputation management - Video still of Kitebaby CEO" width="937" height="676" class="aligncenter wp-image-93895 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-apology.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-apology-480x346.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2024/01/22/kyte-baby-ceo-issues-apologies-bernal-cnntm-vpx.cnn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>The social media backlash was swift, and the CEO posted a more personal response that helped soothe the situation.</p>
<h4>Missing opportunities</h4>
<p>Reddit is filled with people looking for help on everything from mowing their lawn to growing their social media following. What’s sad is how many times these questions go unanswered by brands that could help—and gain some solid reputation points in the process.</p>
<p>Consider this question from a small business seeking a solution to its social stagnation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-reddit-missed-opp.webp" alt="Reputation management - Reddit post." width="422" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93896 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-reddit-missed-opp.webp 422w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reputation-management-wordstream-reddit-missed-opp-211x300.webp 211w" sizes="(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px" /></p>
<p>The right <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/02/strategies-to-grow-your-digital-marketing-agency">agency</a>, social media freelancer, or social media software provider could step in and help sort out this small business. Sure, they may not get a customer directly, but they’ll show off their expertise and generate positive awareness for their brand.</p>
<div id="free-review-reply-templates"></div>
<h2>Review reply templates</h2>
<p>Replying to reviews is a tricky balance between remaining professional and making it personal. We’ve created two templates—one for positive reviews and one for negative—so you’re ready to reply no matter the situation.</p>
<h3>Positive review template</h3>
<p>Here’s a base template you can fill in to say, “Thanks for your amazing review.” Notice how it allows space to mention a new product or service.</p>
<p><em>Hi [Customer Name],</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you so much for sharing your experience with us! We’re glad to hear that you enjoyed [specific product/service mentioned in review]. Our team works hard to [insert brand value, e.g., “provide quick, friendly service” or “deliver quality you can count on”], so it’s wonderful to know it made a difference for you.</em></p>
<p><em>We’d love to welcome you back anytime, whether it’s to try [another product/service to suggest] or to enjoy [seasonal offer, event, or special]. Thanks again for your support!</em></p>
<h3>Negative review template</h3>
<p>This template is designed to bring an unhappy customer back and show other viewers that your business stands behind its products and services. It has plenty of empathy and accountability to make it extra effective.</p>
<p><em>Hi [Customer Name],</em></p>
<p><em>We’re genuinely sorry to hear about your experience with [specific product/service mentioned in review]. That’s not the level of [service/quality] we aim to provide, and we appreciate you taking the time to let us know.</em></p>
<p><em>Your feedback helps us improve, and we’d like the chance to make this right. Please reach out to us at [contact info] or stop by [location] so we can discuss how to resolve this for you. We value your business and hope you’ll give us the opportunity to provide the experience you deserve.</em></p>
<h2>Make reputation management your new growth hack</h2>
<p>Reputation management isn’t just about being on the defensive. It’s a growth strategy that helps you generate leads and sales from just about every marketing channel out there.</p>
<p>And as a small business, your unflappable reputation is a business moat that’ll keep even your biggest competitors at bay. It just takes a little strategy to make sure your rep stays solid.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve really gotten into marketing podcasts lately as my preferred mode of learning. They’re so convenient to listen to while walking the dog or taking a road trip.</p>
<p>The problem is choice overload. There are so many options that it&#8217;s hard to decide which show to cue up next.</p>
<p>So, I asked marketers to name their favorite marketing podcasts. The only rule is that they had to be shows from approachable, ground-level marketers (no big names).</p>
<p>To make it even easier to pick your next pod, I asked the hosts for a little background on their shows, the big takeaway they’ve learned from producing them, and which episode stands out as a must-listen. Enjoy!</p>

<h2>5 of the best marketing podcasts, according to the pros</h2>
<p>I’m impressed with the variety of podcasts people proposed. There are quick listens for bite-sized takeaways on specific tactics and deep dives into big topics that are shaping marketing right now.</p>
<div id="seo-office-hours"></div>
<h3>1. SEO office hours</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.goodsignals.com/seo-office-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO Office Hours</a> is a weekly, one-hour podcast that brings together some of the smartest <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">search engine optimization</a> pros in the business. But what’s really cool is that it’s a Q&amp;A format recorded live from Zoom, complete with an audience full of the questions we all have about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google">getting found through search</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-office-hours.webp" alt="Best marketing podcasts - SEO office hours." width="937" height="459" class="aligncenter wp-image-93769 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-office-hours.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-office-hours-480x235.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.goodsignals.com/seo-office-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>If a live Q&amp;A chat about SEO reminds you of John Mueller’s old Webmaster Hangouts, that’s intentional. “When John stopped, I didn’t want that resource to disappear,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelchidzey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Chidzey</a>, co-host of SEO Office Hours and CEO of <a href="https://www.goodsignals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Good Signals</a>. “I reached out and asked if he’d be okay with me giving it a go, and he’s been incredibly supportive ever since.”</p>
<p>Michael tuned into Mueller’s sessions religiously. “They weren’t just Q&amp;A sessions. They were a lifeline for anyone struggling with a traffic drop, wanting to sound out a new idea, or discussing some sort of change or update.”</p>
<p>With Mueller’s blessing, he worked to create a similarly supportive atmosphere, but with a collaborative mindset. “Of course, I’m not John Mueller from Google, so I built the show in my own way,” Michael told me. “I invited special guests to bring their perspectives. The first was a good friend of mine, Jo Juliana Turnbull. She was so good that I asked her to come back as a regular host. From there, we evolved into a panel format with me, Jo, and two rotating guests.”</p>
<p>For Michael’s co-host, Jo, it’s the lack of barriers that makes the show special. “We welcome first-time speakers, we answer all<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/2025-local-seo-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> SEO questions</a>, there is no such thing as a silly question,” she said. “People feel welcome, and we have a regular group of attendees from all over the world.”</p>
<p>The live format plays a big role in the podcast, since it lets the audience run the show. “As a host, I’m constantly watching the audience’s expressions: puzzled looks, nods of agreement, those moments of real engagement,” Michael said. “That dictates whether we dig deeper into a topic, clarify something, or swiftly move on to the next question.”</p>
<p>“Today, SEO Office Hours feels less like a podcast and more like a weekly gathering of some of the smartest, most generous people in the industry,” Michael added. “And honestly, even if I weren’t running it, I’d still be there every Friday.”</p>
<h4>One big takeaway</h4>
<p>The lesson for Michael is that consistency wins the day. “When we started SEO Office Hours, I set a target: every Friday for three months, no matter what,” he said. “Without that commitment, it would have been easy to stop after the first or second episode. But when giving up isn’t an option, you focus on making it better and better—and on optimizing your time to keep it going.”</p>
<p>“I think that mindset applies to everything in marketing: whether it’s launching a newsletter, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-media-strategy">building a social presence</a>, or implementing a content strategy. Consistency compounds. The longer you stick with it, the more valuable it becomes.”</p>
<h4>The past episode to have in your playlist</h4>
<p>Michael said they’ve begun rotating in occasional co-hosts, and that’s expanded the show’s ability to deliver diverse ideas. “One of my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4qHN3pqZtU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favorite episodes</a> was when I sat in the audience myself and Yordan Dimitrov co-hosted with Jo,” he said. “It was amazing to experience the show from the audience’s perspective and see just how valuable—and fun—it is when you’re on the other side.”</p>

<h3>2. Market Movers: Building Brands &amp; Links with Linkifi</h3>
<p>There’s nothing niche about <a href="https://www.marketmoverspod.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Market Movers: Building Brands &amp; Links</a>. Each week, the show’s co-hosts (and <a href="https://www.linkifi.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linkifi</a> co-founders) <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-panteli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christopher Panteli</a> and Nick Biggs invite guests with wildly different backgrounds and takes on the world of marketing.</p>
<p>That variety means we listeners get tips on<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-in-marketing"> making AI work for marketing</a> one week, and the next we learn how to keep overtly salesy “knobheads” out of our online community.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-market-movers.webp" alt="Best marketing podcasts - Market Movers Podcast" width="779" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93770 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-market-movers.webp 779w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-market-movers-480x370.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 779px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://marketmoverspod.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>“We’re broader than a lot of marketing shows,” Christopher explained. “We don’t stick to a narrow niche. We cover a wide range of topics and invite a variety of guests. A lot of them we’ve actually met in person, often at conferences. Having that prior connection really breaks down the third wall and makes the conversations more open.”</p>
<p>That open exchange of ideas that happens when professionals meet is exactly the vibe Christopher and Nick curate on their show. “We were doing a lot of networking at conferences and kept meeting interesting people with great stories and insights,” Christopher said. “You pick up so many useful tidbits at conferences that it almost feels like a waste not to share them.”</p>
<p>My favorite part of Market Movers is the enthusiasm Nick and Christopher bring to learning right along with the audience. “We don’t pretend to know everything, and we’re genuinely curious,” Christopher said. “When a guest talks about something we don’t fully understand, we’re not afraid to ask more questions and dig deeper.”</p>
<h4>One big takeaway</h4>
<p>If you find yourself stuck in the planning phase of projects for too long, you’re not alone. Running the Market Movers podcast has helped Christopher get past his analysis paralysis.</p>
<p>“One of the biggest mindset shifts I’ve had is that you just have to test things and get them out there,” Michael said. “You can plan forever, but real value comes from launching and learning in real-time. Whether it’s a new funnel, an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-nurturing-emails">email sequence</a>, or anything else, it’s better to put it live, get feedback, and make changes on the fly.”</p>
<p>“Some of the best results I’ve seen have come from launching something that flopped, tweaking it, relaunching it, and eventually figuring out what worked and why,” he continued. “That’s been the biggest shift for me, to stop waiting for perfect. Just launch, learn, and refine.”</p>
<h4>The past episode to have in your playlist</h4>
<p>“Personally, the solo <a href="https://www.marketmoverspod.com/e/the-7-figure-deal-tim-stoddart-s-risky-bet-on-copyblogger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview I did with Tim Stoddart</a> really stuck with me,” Christopher said. “His story is powerful. He’s overcome a lot and achieved a huge amount, and I think he’s in a really good place now. That episode definitely resonated with me, and I’d recommend giving it a listen.”</p>

<h3>3. The Marketing Mindset Podcast</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/colby-flood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colby Flood</a> prioritizes an “Education First” philosophy at his agency,<a href="https://www.brighterclick.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> BrighterClick</a>. That mantra drives<a href="https://www.brighterclick.com/marketing-mindset-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> The Marketing Mindset</a>—a podcast that gets in the weeds of ground-level marketing with people who live and breathe it every day.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-marketing-mindset.webp" alt="Best marketing podcasts - Marketing Mindset" width="835" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93771 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-marketing-mindset.webp 835w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-marketing-mindset-480x345.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 835px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfney7s8PpE8dHdI296ujqFIDv4Z4ydlO" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>“What I think sets Marketing Mindset apart is the intent behind it,” Colby said. “Everything we share is driven by a single priority, which is helping people grow and learn, both personally and in their business. That means keeping the content transparent, trustworthy, and free from hidden agendas.”</p>
<p>I love how they dig deep into a specific topic in each episode. Look over the list and you’ll see titles like “How to start <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/tiktok-marketing-for-small-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling on TikTok</a> Shops” and “Creating a Facebook Ads Creative Report Template.” There’s even a seven-part series dedicated to building a high-level creative strategy process.</p>
<p>“My vision for the podcast has evolved from being a place to communicate with people already well-known in the industry, to also finding the people working in the weeds to have them share their expertise, and help build their personal brands,” Colby said.</p>
<p>“Our goal is simple,” he added. “Keep the main priority the main priority, which is delivering honest, actionable insights that help people succeed.”</p>
<h4>One big takeaway</h4>
<p>I’m guilty of reading a marketing success story and forgetting all the background context that led to the result. Colby said that getting the full story from his guests reminds him of all the turbulence that happens before a smooth landing.</p>
<p>“One of the most refreshing things I have learned from hosting the show is that a lot of growth lessons come in hindsight,” he said. “Yes, there are people who can plan and execute exactly as intended, but more often the real breakthroughs are understood retrospectively.”</p>
<p>“On social media, it can seem like every success story was the result of a flawless plan,” Colby explained. “People share how they did X, Y, or Z, and it led to a big win, and it can give the impression that it was all intentional from the start. In reality, many of those wins become clear only when you look back and analyze what actually drove the results.”</p>
<p>“Through my own experience and countless guest conversations, I have realized the value of post-implementation reviews. Taking the time to reflect on what truly worked and why can turn everyday actions into long-term growth lessons.”</p>
<h4>The past episode to have in your playlist</h4>
<p>“One episode that really stands out to me was my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI9jscqQ1Qo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with Ben</a>, the CEO of True Classic,” Colby shared. “Before that conversation, I was a meticulous planner. I would map out the year, then the quarter, then the month, break that into weeks, and even down to daily tasks. Planning has value, but Ben really shifted my perspective on execution.”</p>
<p>“He emphasized the importance of focusing on what needs to be done today or this week, especially in a fast-moving business. Things change so quickly that planning too far ahead can sometimes work against you, particularly in a startup.”</p>
<p>“Looking back, I think my heavy focus on planning was a bit of a defense mechanism to avoid failure. But real growth comes from failing fast, learning quickly, and pivoting when needed. That episode helped me embrace the idea of spending less time perfecting a plan and more time acting on it.”</p>

<h3>4. The Marketing Chatroom</h3>
<p>If you’re looking for a little fresh air in the sometimes stuffy confines of digital marketing, I highly recommend giving <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9cBWyQM0Rb4_eMtKTsSPxBD1eOnYy0go" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Marketing Chatroom</a> a listen. Host <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kayla-bryant-sacramento/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kayla Bryant</a>, general manager of <a href="https://twotreesppc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Two Trees PPC</a>, brings a vibe that she describes as “upbeat, slightly silly, and that should feel like you’re talking to a friend.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-marketing-chatroom.webp" alt="Best marketing podcasts - The Marketing Chatroom" width="814" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93772 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-marketing-chatroom.webp 814w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-marketing-chatroom-480x354.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 814px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9cBWyQM0Rb4_eMtKTsSPxBD1eOnYy0go" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>“Based on what I hear from guests and listeners, my podcast is more approachable and casual,” she said. “I talk with marketers about their real challenges and unique approaches toward success in their careers.”</p>
<p>Kayla and her guests get into the tactical side of marketing often, but the best bits for me are the episodes that explore soft—but critical—<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/07/marketing-skills">marketing skills</a> like empathy and creativity. It’s interesting to learn how people in the field put those ideas into practice.</p>
<p>“I thought it would be cool to have a platform to highlight insights from marketing professionals in a variety of industries, roles, and places in their careers,” she said. “I&#8217;ve learned that as a host, I don&#8217;t have to be perfect or have a formal plan or specific questions prepared. As long as I have a guest with a story to tell and a general episode theme in mind- being open to a genuine conversation about something the guest is passionate about or expert at produces the best results.”</p>
<h4>One big takeaway</h4>
<p>Remote work has plenty of benefits, but sometimes it can feel a little isolating. Kayla said that listening to her guests confirms that a collaborative attitude is still critical for marketing success.</p>
<p>“Across the board, through my conversations, I&#8217;ve noticed that the most successful marketers (in my opinion) are those who have a true team mindset,” she explained. “They&#8217;ve become leaders in the space because they rise by lifting up others. They all started in the trenches doing the work, but they&#8217;ve found opportunities to improve upon their own work and taught others along the way. They aren&#8217;t afraid to share their knowledge alongside their challenges.”</p>
<h4>The past episode to have in your playlist</h4>
<p>“I struggle to not label every episode as my favorite, because each one is so interesting and unique,” Kayla told me. Fair enough, I’m not sure I can pick favorites from my work, either.</p>
<p>But if I were picking a place to start in the Marketing Chatroom, I’d say the<a href="https://youtu.be/mAZfQrUynoM?si=_wF4S936V0mkCJnp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> chat with David Young</a> on the power of storytelling. Storytelling has become almost cliché these days, but David does a great job of grounding it in results.</p>
<div id="fm"></div>
<h3>5. Plugin.fm</h3>
<p>Where many podcasts cover marketing broadly across every industry,<a href="http://plugin.fm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Plugin.fm</a> stays narrow and deep by helping practitioners build a software business to navigate various growth challenges.</p>
<p>“Most marketing podcasts are marketers talking to other marketers,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/goranmirkovic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goran Mirkovic</a>, the chief marketing officer at <a href="https://freemius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freemius</a>, who co-hosts the show with Patrick Rauland. “Ours is different because it speaks directly to indie software makers and encourages them to take bigger swings with their products.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-pluginfm.webp" alt="Best marketing podcasts - Plugin.fm" width="937" height="608" class="aligncenter wp-image-93773 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-pluginfm.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-pluginfm-480x311.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="http://plugin.fm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Originally, the show was a great way for the Freemius folks to learn about their <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-pain-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">target audience’s struggles</a> and to build relationships with industry leaders. “The podcast gave us a reason to sit down with them for an hour and ask the questions we genuinely cared about,” Goran said.</p>
<p>As they compiled more episodes, though, Goran said they noticed the library had a different purpose. “[It became] more about co-creating useful resources with industry experts for indie founders and small software teams who don’t have mentors or investors guiding them. What began as a learning tool has grown into a library of practical stories and strategies from real builders.”</p>
<p>While marketing is a core component of the show’s topics, it also seeks to solve other hurdles like pricing experiments, subscription headaches, and customer support struggles.“These are the challenges that actually keep small teams up at night,” Goran said. “Our goal is to inspire and educate, not to sell.”</p>
<h4>One big takeaway</h4>
<p>Software startups can get caught up in the race to grow fast. So can we marketers. Goran said the conversations on Plugin.fm have reminded him that having a strong foundation is more important than growing sky-high too fast.</p>
<p>“Stop chasing ‘scale’ too early,” he said. “A lot of our guests reinforced the idea that you don’t need 10,000 customers. What you need is 50 loyal ones who give feedback, renew, and tell others about you. That shift in mindset is freeing. Instead of obsessing over growth hacks, focus on building something so useful that a small group sticks with you. Scale comes later if you get that right.”</p>
<h4>The past episode to have in your playlist</h4>
<p>As a content marketer who’s always riding the tumultuous waves of SEO, Goran’s pick for one of his favorite episodes of Plugin.fm hit home for me.</p>
<p>“One that really stood out was our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2zgI2b6q44" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conversation with Rand Fishkin</a>,” Goran said. “He’s someone everyone associates with SEO, yet he told us that SparkToro gets fewer than 50 visits a month from Google. This is a guy whose work has been cited in Congress and even by the US president, but <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/03/organic-traffic">organic search</a> barely moves the needle for his business. That hit our audience hard because it showed how much the game has changed and why you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-marketing-pros-drive-traffic">can’t rely only on Google for growth</a>.”</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="👋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free resource!</strong> <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDL25LeadGenIdeas.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_LeadGenIdeas_Download">The Definitive Guide to Lead Generation: 25 Ideas (+Tips &amp; Examples)</a></p>

<h2>3 more marketing podcasts for your learning pleasure</h2>
<p>I got so many great recommendations for this list that I couldn’t expand on all of them. Here are a handful of additional marketing podcasts worthy of your next long drive.</p>
<div id="content-briefly"></div>
<h3>6. Content, Briefly</h3>
<p><a href="https://podcast.superpath.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Content, Briefly</a> is one of my personal favorite marketing podcasts, so I was glad when another marketer suggested it. It’s a weekly interview show that focuses on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/13/content-marketing-strategy">content marketing</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcast-wordstream-content-briefly.webp" alt="best marketing podcasts - Content, Briefly" width="702" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93784 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcast-wordstream-content-briefly.webp 702w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcast-wordstream-content-briefly-480x410.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 702px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://podcast.superpath.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></p>
<p>What I like about this one is that hosts Jimmy Daly and Eric Doty ask guests about the specific tactics and tools they use to do their jobs. So while there’s plenty of friendly chatting to enjoy, you also get some specific takeaways to apply.</p>
<div id="the-artificial-intelligence-show"></div>
<h3>7. The Artificial Intelligence Show</h3>
<p>For good and bad, AI is an absolute wrecking ball in<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-marketing-trends-2025"> marketing</a>. There are a few things it hasn’t changed significantly. That’s why I’m so grateful that hosts Paul Roetzer and Mike Kaput tackle these tumultuous topics in<a href="https://www.marketingaiinstitute.com/podcast-showcase" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> The Artificial Intelligence Show</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcast-wordstream-artificial-intelligence-show.webp" alt="best marketing podcasts - The Artificial Intelligence Show" width="937" height="391" class="aligncenter wp-image-93785 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcast-wordstream-artificial-intelligence-show.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcast-wordstream-artificial-intelligence-show-480x200.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.marketingaiinstitute.com/podcast-showcase" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>The show breaks down AI news, with a strong bent towards how it affects marketing. Even though it’s a current events format, there is a lot of actionable information you can use. For example, Paul and Mike often discuss the impacts of new AI tech that is useful in marketing.</p>
<div id="breaking-b2b"></div>
<h3>8. Breaking B2B</h3>
<p>I was lucky enough to gather some of<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samdunning/?originalSubdomain=uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Sam Dunning’s</a> wisdom in a past post on<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-trends-2025"> SEO trends</a>. His<a href="https://www.breakingb2b.com/blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Breaking B2B podcast</a> is a torrent of tactics and teardowns for technical SEOs, content marketers, and marketing generalists who need to drive more traffic from search engines.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-breaking-b2b.webp" alt="best marketing podcasts - Breaking B2B " width="853" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93786 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-breaking-b2b.webp 853w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/best-marketing-podcasts-wordstream-breaking-b2b-480x338.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 853px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.breakingb2b.com/blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Much of Sam’s content is geared towards B2B and SaaS SEO. But you can definitely glean loads of useful information, no matter what type of website you’re trying to rank.</p>
<h2>The best marketing podcasts in 2025</h2>
<p>I can’t say which podcast is best, but I can say which podcasts I think you should prioritize. It’s the ones that talk about the challenges you have. Scroll through their playlists, look up a few of the guests, and read some of the intros. You’ll get a sense of what they cover.</p>
<p>I also highly recommend reaching out to the podcasters. Ask about their show, share ideas, and suggest guests. We’re all communicators trying to make a connection, after all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m the first to admit that search engines are getting a little wonky these days (looking at you, Google AI Overviews). But they’re still the leading source of traffic (around <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-statistics">53%</a>) to websites. And that means SEO copywriting is still a critical skill to have in 2025.</p>
<p>Of course, AI and zero-click searches have changed the rules of writing for search engine exposure significantly. So while many of the SEO fundamentals still apply, you’ll need a new playbook to get found on search (and AI) results pages.</p>
<p>In this guide, you’ll learn how to find the exact words your audiences search for and write content that both Google and readers love. Plus, you’ll get a bunch of copywriting tips that’ll ramp up your rankings on all search platforms.</p>

<h2>What is SEO copywriting?</h2>
<p>SEO copywriting is the practice of writing content designed to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google">rank well on search engines</a> while providing value and clarity to readers.</p>
<p><span>SEO copywriting is basically the creation of </span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/01/17/seo-content-beginners-guide">SEO content</a><span>—but while content can refer to an infographic that you place into a blog post or a video you create and optimize for </span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/10/youtube-seo-tips">YouTube SEO</a><span>, copywriting refers to the actual words in the written parts of your content.</span></p>
<p>Many of the tactics I give in this guide are about structuring content in a way that helps algorithms crawl and index it. But Google has gotten pretty clever at sniffing out copy that’s not great for people. So SEO copywriting also means creating content that’s helpful and interesting to your audience.</p>
<p>If you want to see a classic example of SEO copywriting, look at a top-ranking recipe post.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-cake.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - recipe blog." width="532" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93493 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-cake.webp 532w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-cake-480x541.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 532px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>They’ve got keywords everywhere they need to be (maybe more than needed, sometimes). Their content is structured so it’s skimmable, crawlable, and easy to follow. And they confirm their expertise (“I’ve been baking versions of this cake for 30 years”), so algorithms and followers trust what they say.</p>
<p>These content creators have perfected the recipe for SEO copywriting.</p>
<h3>SEO vs. GEO copywriting</h3>
<p>I want to quickly define a related tactic called <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/generative-engine-optimization">generative engine optimization</a> (GEO), AKA AI engine optimization (AIO). GEO refers to optimizing content so it gets cited by AI search engines, like Perplexity and Google’s AI-powered features.</p>
<p>I’m focusing on what it takes to rank on search engine results pages in this guide. But if you haven’t dug into GEO yet, this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-referral-traffic">guide to getting traffic from AI search engines</a> is a great place to start.</p>

<div id="how-to-do-seo-copywriting-for-higher-rankings"></div>
<h2>The complete guide to SEO copywriting for higher rankings (+examples)</h2>
<p>The goal of SEO copywriting is to get found in search engine results <em>and </em>get people to click on your content. These steps and tips help make both happen more often.</p>
<div id="conduct-keyword-research"></div>
<h3>1. Conduct keyword research</h3>
<p>Keyword research is the task of finding the terms people use to look for things on search engines. Even though Google and its competitors are smart enough now to understand the meaning of web pages without <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/exact-match">exact keyword matches</a>, it’s still a good practice to start with the best terms in mind.</p>
<p>Here’s a simplified version of how I find keywords using an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-seo-tools">SEO tool</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start with a general topic:</strong> I think of a question my target audience has, like “how do I file state taxes,” or “what’s the best way to paint an exterior door.”</li>
<li><strong>Find ranking posts:</strong> Next, I type in whatever idea I have into Google and see which posts are on the search engine results page (SERP) already.</li>
<li><strong>Use a tool to find the right keyword:</strong> Finally, I paste the URL of a ranking post into a keyword tool like Ahrefs to see which exact key phrases it’s ranking for.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-keywords-paint.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - list of keywords." width="937" height="460" class="aligncenter wp-image-93494 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-keywords-paint.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-keywords-paint-480x236.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>I can then pick one of those or dig deeper into things like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/12/keyword-difficulty">how difficult</a> it will be to rank for that keyword and how many people search for it every month.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a paid subscription to something like Ahrefs, WordStream’s<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool"> Free Keyword Tool</a> will come in very handy.</p>
<p>That’s a simplified version of my process&#8211;and it&#8217;s just one option you can try. Use this<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide"> guide to keyword research</a> for a more in-depth explanation.</p>
<p><strong>Keyword tip:</strong> Stick with keywords and topics that are relevant to your website. Google will happily suppress an accountant’s website that’s posting about popular video games just to get clicks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-physical-therapy.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - physical therapy blog." width="937" height="436" class="aligncenter wp-image-93495 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-physical-therapy.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-physical-therapy-480x223.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Keep your keyword topics relevant to your overall website to avoid Google penalties.</em></p>
<div id="understand-and-match-keyword-intent"></div>
<h3>2. Understand and match keyword intent</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-intent">Keyword intent</a> refers to the <em>reason</em> people search for the keyword you’re thinking about targeting. Generally speaking, there are four broad types of keyword intent:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Informational:</strong> A user wants to learn more about something, like a topic, product, or industry. Example: “history of Valentine’s Day”</li>
<li><strong>Navigational:</strong> A user wants to visit a specific website or web page. Example: “1800 flowers”</li>
<li><strong>Commercial:</strong> A user is researching products or services and has the intent to make a purchase in the near future. Example: “Best flowers for a friend on Valentine’s Day”</li>
<li><strong>Transactional:</strong> A user is ready to make a purchase. Example: “buy a bouquet of flowers”</li>
</ul>

<p>Since it’s in Google’s best interest to deliver its users top-notch search results, it rewards marketers who closely match keyword intent.</p>
<p>If you tried to target the keyword “history of Valentine’s Day” with the pricing page for your flower delivery service, you wouldn’t perform very well in the organic search results. Why? Because you’d fail to match keyword intent.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-valentines.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - results page for Valentine's Day." width="937" height="623" class="aligncenter wp-image-93496 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-valentines.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-valentines-480x319.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The intent of the keyphrase “history of Valentine’s Day” is informational, so you won’t see many commercial pages in the organic results.</em></p>
<p><strong>Keyword intent tip: </strong>Align your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">calls to action</a> with keyword intent, too. If it’s an informational keyword, use CTAs like “Subscribe for the latest news” or “Download this guide.” For transactional intent keywords, try “Buy now” or “Get a free quote.”</p>
<div id="target-ancillary-keywords"></div>
<h3>3. Target ancillary keywords</h3>
<p>A single piece of content can rank for several keywords. Ideally, much of your content will rank for several keywords.</p>
<p>Once you’ve picked a primary keyword, look for complementary terms that keep within the overall theme of the topic but don’t overlap 100%.</p>
<p>Say you want to target the term “back pain.” There are a bunch of ancillary keywords you could also target in the same content, like “what causes back pain” and “how to relieve lower back pain.”</p>
<p>You can use your keyword tool to find ancillary keywords. Or you can look at two features of the Google search page: People also ask and People also search for.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-pas.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - people also search screen." width="937" height="426" class="aligncenter wp-image-93497 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-pas.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-pas-480x218.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Those two features tell you what people search for next after reviewing the main keyword’s results. So they’re the perfect additions to make your content comprehensive and rank for more keywords with one asset.</p>
<p><strong>Ancillary keyword tip: </strong>Google’s search bar autofill is another way to quickly find ancillary keywords. Just start typing your primary keyword in the search bar and see what it autofills. Oh, and try doing this in “private” or “incognito mode” so your search history doesn’t affect the results.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-autofill.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - Google autofill." width="620" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93498 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-autofill.webp 620w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-autofill-480x465.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 620px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="place-keywords-strategically-and-naturally"></div>
<h3>4. Place keywords strategically and naturally</h3>
<p>Using keywords strategically means using them where they can have the most influence on search engines without negatively affecting the experience for readers.</p>
<p>Where should you use keywords? Wherever they can act as a signal that a webpage has the information a searcher is looking for. Here are the most common keyword placements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The page title</li>
<li>In your URL</li>
<li>Meta title tag</li>
<li>Meta description</li>
<li>In the introduction</li>
<li>In subtitles like H2s and H3s</li>
<li>Organically in the body copy</li>
</ul>
<p>This post ranked for the search term “how to choose a daycare.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-daycare.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - Daycare blog post." width="596" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93499 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-daycare.webp 596w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-daycare-480x483.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 596px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It has the exact keyphrase match in the title, and a couple of variations in the introduction. The keyphrase is also in the page’s URL and title tag.</p>
<p>It’s easy to go overboard here, but whatever you do, do NOT try to stuff your page full of keywords. That tactic worked for about 10 minutes at the dawn of SEO. Not only will it not help you rank, it’ll provide a terrible experience for your visitor, which, in turn, will hurt your chances of ranking.</p>
<p>Instead, use related terms and synonyms—like “daycare choices,” “options for daycare,” and “where to look for daycares online.” The goal is to balance SEO goals with a positive reader experience.</p>
<p><strong>Keyword placement tip:</strong> Only use keywords in the body of your text organically. That means placing them if they flow with the rest of your writing and feel conversational, rather than repetitive or forced.</p>

<div id="create-a-clear-structure"></div>
<h3>5. Create a clear structure</h3>
<p>A well-structured, easy-to-read page keeps readers rolling through longer pieces of content and helps search engines understand what it’s all about.</p>
<p>Structuring content for SEO means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/04/internal-linking">internal links</a> to other relevant pages of your site.</li>
<li>Organizing content into smaller sections and labeling them with clear headlines and subheadlines.</li>
<li>Using bullet points to share information faster.</li>
<li>Placing images to break up walls of text.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bold type, subheadings by improvement type, internal links, attractive images&#8230;this post has it all! There’s a ton of information here, but it doesn’t ever feel exhausting to read.</p>
<p>Also, notice how concise the paragraphs are.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-short-paragraphs.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - house improvement blog post." width="647" height="266" class="aligncenter wp-image-93501 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-short-paragraphs.webp 647w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-short-paragraphs-480x197.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 647px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Remember, many people will read your content on a mobile phone. If they see a screen full of text for days, they’re going to hit the back button (which tells Google your content doesn’t deserve to rank).</p>
<p><strong>SEO structure tip:</strong> Look for ways to display chunks of information in more digestible ways. Charts, graphs, infographics, and tables are great options.</p>
<div id="get-to-the-point"></div>
<h3>6. Get to the point</h3>
<p>I’ll admit that I’ve been known to write a lengthy introduction every now and then. As valuable as that may be for those writing term papers or Dickensian novels, when we’re talking about SEO copywriting, we have to keep in mind the ultimate goal: to create <strong>relevant </strong>content. Relevant content, after all, is the stuff Google puts at the top of the organic results.</p>
<p>Though creating relevant content is largely about matching keyword intent, that’s not the <em>only </em>consideration; it’s also important to prove to Google that your content is pertinent. As I’ve learned first-hand, an effective way to prove the pertinence of your content is to <strong>target your main keyword early on in your copy.</strong></p>
<p>To see what I mean, take a look at the first two paragraphs of <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/improve-your-email-subject-line" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this HubSpot article</a> about writing email subject lines:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/seo-copywriting-get-to-the-point.jpg" alt="seo copywriting example from HubSpot" width="739" height="162" /></div>
<p>By 50 words in, the writer’s already targeted her main keyword three times. Is that the sole reason this post tops the organic results? No, but it’s certainly one of them. Take a page out of the HubSpot playbook and increase <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-density">keyword density</a> at the beginning of your next blog post.</p>
<div id="optimize-for-googles-e-e-a-t"></div>
<h3>7. Optimize for Google’s E-E-A-T</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/14/google-e-e-a-t">Google&#8217;s E-E-A-T</a> is a set of criteria Google uses to assess the quality of webpages and content. Although Google says they don’t use them as a ranking factor, following the guidelines of E-E-A-T can prove to search engines (AI and traditional) that your website deserves exposure.</p>
<p>Here’s what E-E-A-T stands for and how you can show it in your content:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Experience:</strong> Share personal experiences, first-hand knowledge, and your results.</li>
<li><strong>Expertise:</strong> Stay within the topical realm of your website, include credentials in author bios, and cite only credible sources.</li>
<li><strong>Authoritativeness:</strong> Get backlinks from credible websites and encourage mentions of your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Trustworthiness:</strong> Verify the information you share, nurture a solid online reputation, and be transparent.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key to all of this is remembering that trust isn’t just one of the criteria; it’s at the center of them all.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-eeat.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - EEAT graphic." width="881" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93502 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-eeat.webp 881w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-eeat-480x327.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 881px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As a bonus, AI search results ground some of their responses in the E-E-A-T principles. As you work to make your content more trustworthy to Google, you could land on more AI search results pages.</p>
<p><strong>E-E-A-T tip:</strong> Original data has always been a great addition to content. But now, with some brands leaning hard on AI-generated copy, those survey results or unique research studies will help you stand out even more.</p>
<div id="cover-the-topic-in-depth"></div>
<h3>8. Cover the topic in depth</h3>
<p>Many informational topics require a comprehensive answer covering several subtopics. Opening a business, for example, is a scary thing to do and has many facets to it.</p>
<p>The table of contents in a post from NerdWallet shows how exhaustive they’ve covered the topic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-business-toc.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - table of contents for a comprehensive blog post." width="596" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93507 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-business-toc.webp 596w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-business-toc-480x483.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 596px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is the kind of energy you’ll need to bring to big topics like this to rank.</p>
<p>And you can add even more value to your post by including internal links to more resources. That’ll also help Google know that your website is an authoritative resource on the topic.</p>
<p>Look at all the organized internal links just in the first section of that NerdWallet post.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-business-links.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - NerdWallet post." width="937" height="421" class="aligncenter wp-image-93508 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-business-links.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-business-links-480x216.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="think-hard-about-your-headline"></div>
<h3>9. Think hard about your headline</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon to spend hours writing a beautifully optimized 2,500-word blog post, only to dedicate 45 seconds to writing a mediocre headline (I&#8217;ve done it!). That’s like spending years on the interior design of a beautiful home and then throwing on a second-hand, unpainted door nobody wants to walk through.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll make your content way more competitive in the SERPs if you set aside a substantial amount of time for brainstorming headlines. It may feel like you&#8217;re overindexing on a few words. But trust me, when your organic CTR skyrockets and your pageviews go through the roof, you’ll be happy you did it.</p>
<p>There are entire books dedicated to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/07/17/headline-writing">writing great headlines</a>. These headline ideas will get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a sense of urgency</li>
<li>Ask questions</li>
<li>Keep it concise</li>
<li>Feature your keywords</li>
<li>Establish your authority</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/headline-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">headline example</a> that uses a question to create a curiosity gap that readers will want to fill (by clicking your link!).</p>

<p><strong>Headline tip:</strong> Keep your titles to around 50 to 60 characters max to increase your chances Google won&#8217;t shorten (or change it) in the SERP.</p>
<div id="get-more-clicks-with-optimized-meta-descriptions"></div>
<h3>10. Get more clicks with optimized meta descriptions</h3>
<p>I mentioned using keywords in meta tags. That’s part of optimizing these key SEO components.</p>
<p>Quick catch-up if you’re newer to SEO: <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/meta-description">Meta descriptions</a> are a brief description of your website for search engines.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-electric-serp.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - electrician search result." width="937" height="181" class="aligncenter wp-image-93503 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-electric-serp.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-electric-serp-480x93.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As you’re meta descriptions, remember that it’s prime real estate to teach a search engine about your site and convince people to click your link.</p>
<p>Here are some things to think about to optimize your meta description for SEO:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lead with search intent.</li>
<li>Include details and results.</li>
<li>Add a clear call to action.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-dentist-serp.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - Dentist search result." width="937" height="223" class="aligncenter wp-image-93504 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-dentist-serp.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-dentist-serp-480x114.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The title tag and meta description in this search result are well-optimized for the search term “best dentist for kids in Chicago.”</p>
<p><strong>Meta tag optimization tip:</strong> Use numbers and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/22/power-words">power words</a> in your meta copy. For example, say “save up to 70% off” instead of “get big discounts.”</p>

<div id="shoot-for-zero-click-searches"></div>
<h3>11. Shoot for zero-click searches (where applicable)</h3>
<p>Nearly <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-search-zero-click-study-2024-443869">60%</a> of Google searches resulted in a click in 2024. Meaning that now, most of the time, users leave the SERP without clicking a single hyperlink.</p>
</div>
<p>Before AI took over results pages, featured snippets were the main culprit for the zero-click trend. Featured snippets still exist. But now, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-overviews-impact-on-seo">AI Overviews</a> are delivering complete answers right in the SERP. So searchers don&#8217;t have to click a link to learn how to winterize their homes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-aio.webp" alt="SEO copywriting -" width="649" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93519 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-aio.webp 649w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-aio-480x444.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 649px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="examples-of-seo-copywriting">
<p>The good news is that Google also offers links, citations, images, and videos from the content it uses to create its AI Overviews. That means there&#8217;s at least a chance of some brand exposure, and maybe a click, in these AI answers. Here&#8217;s what that looks like for our home winterization result.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-aio-citations.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - AI Overview citations." width="937" height="416" class="aligncenter wp-image-93521 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-aio-citations.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-aio-citations-480x213.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The even better news is that you can shoot to show up in both a featured snippet and an AI Overview. They both tend to answer direct, informational queries. Make sure you answer the fundamental SEO questions in your content with concise answers in a few sentences or less. In our example, that means including a sentence that goes something like &#8220;To winterize your home, do [this], [this], and [this].&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>There&#8217;s more to this story, and we tell it all in the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/generative-engine-optimization">guide to GEO</a> I mentioned earlier.</p>

<div id="add-faqs"></div>
<h3>12. Add FAQs</h3>
<p>An <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/24/faq-page">FAQ section</a> in a blog post or sales page is a fantastic way to provide those concise answers that featured snippets and AI Overviews love to cite. They also let you quickly target secondary keywords.</p>
</div>
<p>This is an especially useful tactic for your most important keywords. Sprinklr offers a social listening tool. So it&#8217;d be big for them to rank for the keyphrase &#8220;best social listening tools.&#8221; They published a blog post on the topic, and then added an expandable FAQ section that covered the main and secondary keywords.</p>

<h3>13. Include real-life examples</h3>
<p>Notice how throughout this post I&#8217;ve included examples of real SEO copywriting. That&#8217;s a great SEO copywriting tip I hope everyone uses more often.</p>
<p>Real-life examples do a few things for your SEO and overall value of your content:</p>
<ul>
<li>They add credibility to your content since what you say is happening in the wild.</li>
<li>They give you something to &#8220;deconstruct&#8221; to help readers grasp the concepts you&#8217;re sharing.</li>
<li>They offer a reason to add visuals, which breaks up your long-form content.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real-life examples tip:</strong> Try adding the word &#8220;examples&#8221; to some of your most important keywords to see if those new keyphrases are worth targeting, too. So if you want to rank for &#8220;How to create a landing page,&#8221; look at &#8220;Best landing page examples&#8221; as an additional keyword to target.</p>

<h3>14. Bake in local SEO</h3>
<p>Even if someone doesn’t explicitly type the city they’re in, Google will still match searchers up to local businesses that are clearly near them. So it’s extra important for<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-seo-in-2024"> local SEO</a> to add geo-targeted keywords throughout their site.</p>
<p>Have a quick look at this Brooklyn plumber’s website.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-plumber.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - plumber website." width="871" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93506 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-plumber.webp 871w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-plumber-480x331.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 871px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The word Brooklyn appears five times in this section, and more than a dozen times total as you scroll through the page.</p>
<div id="prove-your-trustworthiness"></div>
<h3>15. Prove your trustworthiness</h3>
<p>Ideally, Google only ranks trustworthy sites. That isn’t always the reality, but it’s a good assumption to work from. And it is often true for sensitive topics like finances, health, and safety, which Google calls Your Money or Your Life (YMYL) topics.</p>
<p>BetterHelp demonstrates its credibility by featuring a review from a mental healthcare professional.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-betterhealth.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - BetterHelp blog post." width="937" height="496" class="aligncenter wp-image-93509 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-betterhealth.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-betterhealth-480x254.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>That should be a signal to Google that it’s a trustworthy post. And even better, readers can trust it more, too.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t publish content about YMYL topics, it’s still useful to share your authors’ expertise in their bios or in the posts themselves.</p>
