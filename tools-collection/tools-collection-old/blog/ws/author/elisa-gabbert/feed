<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2010/11/22/what-is-a-good-click-through-rate-for">What&#8217;s a Good Click-Through Rate For &#8230;</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is your <a href="/click-through-rate">click-through rate</a> good, or good enough?</p>
<p>This is a really common question, but unfortunately the answer to &#8220;What is a good click-through rate&#8221; will vary depending on a number of factors, including your industry and keywords. Additionally, in many situations your CTR is not nearly as important as your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/17/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate">conversion rate</a>.</p>
<p>Still, it’s helpful to have some general guidelines as to what qualifies as a good click-through rate. Keeping in mind that your mileage may vary, here are some benchmarks depending on the platform you&#8217;re using for marketing.</p>
<p><strong>What is a good click-through rate in 2022 for&#8230;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#Pay-per-click-ads">Pay-per-click ads</a></li>
<li><a href="#Facebook">Facebook</a></li>
<li><a href="#Banner-ads">Banner ads</a></li>
<li><a href="#Email-newsletters">Email newsletters</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a id="Pay-per-click-ads"></a></p>
<h2>What is a good CTR for a pay-per-click ad?</h2>
<p>What&#8217;s a good CTR for a PPC ad in a Google Ads campaign? Our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/18/search-advertising-benchmarks">benchmark data</a> shows that <strong>a good click-through rate is about 6-7% for search ads like Google Ads</strong>. This figure is not set in stone, but it&#8217;s a reasonable starting point. Plus, as you gain experience with managing a campaign, you should focus more on return on investment (ROI) than click-through rate.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also want to consider your industry competition. For example, someone looking for a pink vintage pinball machine is more likely to click on a relevant ad than someone looking for a printer.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a id="Facebook"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is a good CTR on Facebook?</h2>
<p>Click-through rates on Facebook ads will be much lower than those on Google Ads—advertisers have found that CTRs are higher on Google Ads because people often go to Google specifically looking to buy something. However, people generally go to Facebook to socialize, so they're not in a commercial frame of mind.</p>
<p>According to our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/12/facebook-ad-benchmarks#:~:text=The%20average%20Click%2DThrough%20Rate,is%200.89%25%20across%20all%20industries.">Facebook benchmarks</a>, <strong>a good click-through rate for Facebook ads is .89%</strong>.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/what-is-a-good-ctr-facebook.png" alt="what's a good CTR - facebook average click-through rate benchmarks" width="705" height="850" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62916" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/what-is-a-good-ctr-facebook.png 705w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/what-is-a-good-ctr-facebook-480x579.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 705px, 100vw" /><br />
<a id="Banner-ads"></a></p>
<h2>What is a good CTR for a banner ad?</h2>
<p>Average click-through rates for banner ads on the Google Display Network are often similar to CTR averages on Facebook as people are passively viewing ads. Across industries, we found tha<strong>t a good click-through rate for a banner ad is about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/29/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">0.46%</a></strong>.</p>
<p><a id="Email-newsletters"></a></p>
<h2>What is a good CTR for an email newsletter?</h2>
<p>Here, click-through rates will vary depending on the type of newsletter, among other factors. B2B newsletters (such as the <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSNewsletterWebPPCNewsletter.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogSidebar_PPC_Newsletter_Newsletter">WordStream Performance Tip</a>!) tend to have higher CTR than B2C newsletters. In either case,<strong> a good click-through rate for email is between 10% and 20%</strong>. However, highly targeted emails (personalized messages, behavior-based campaigns, etc.) can often attain click-through rates above 20%.</p>
<p>Whatever type of campaign you're managing, remember to track your progress. Steady improvement is more important than beating some industry benchmark.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Curious if your mobile ads are performing well? Check out these new benchmarks for mobile ads across Google's ad networks – average CTR, average cost per click (CPC), average conversion rate (CVR), and average cost per action (CPA) across 10 different mobile ad types from search ads to video.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month, when we released our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/13/google-ads-mobile-benchmarks">Google Ads mobile benchmarks</a> for 18 industries, one of our readers commented that it would be really helpful to know the average click-through rate, conversion rate and so on for each mobile ad <em>type</em>.</p>
<p>We thought, you know what? You’re absolutely right! (Our readers are so smart.)</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="b894da34-f00f-433f-a568-c14776a7ec85" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/benchmarks-by-mobile-ad-type-header.jpg" alt="Benchmarks by mobile ad type" width="993" height="508" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>So we dug back into that same data set (a sampling of mobile ads in over 20,000 of our US-based client accounts) and sliced the data up by ad type rather than industry. Today, we’re excited to share these new benchmarks with you – average <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/click-through-rate">CTR</a>, average cost per click (CPC), average conversion rate (CVR), and average cost per action (CPA) for the following ad types available on mobile:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Search Ads</strong>, including text ads, expanded text ads, and call-only ads</li>
<li><strong>Display Ads</strong>, including standard display ads, responsive display ads, and Gmail ads</li>
<li><strong>Shopping Ads</strong>, including standard shopping ads and showcase shopping ads</li>
<li><strong>Video Ads</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mobile App Install Ads</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The metrics for all these different mobile ad types available in Google Ads definitely vary a <em>lot</em>, so it’s important to be mindful of what counts as a good click-through rate or a good cost per click depending on what types of mobile campaigns you’re running. Let’s take a closer look!</p>
<h2>Google Mobile Search Ads</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="ee800ab5-6470-448b-bace-fbd0b552b287" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ad_type_mobile_benchmarks_search_ads-1.png" alt="Google mobile benchmarks by search ad type" width="1000" height="868" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Unsurprisingly, expanded text ads (which, as of August, are now <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/22/new-expanded-text-ads">even bigger than they used to be</a>) have a higher click-through rate, at almost 4%, than standard, smaller text ads at 2.27%. Generally, ads that take up more space and provide more information lead to more clicks. Those expanded ads also have a higher conversion rate (3.6% compared to 2.3%).</p>
<p>Call-only ads (and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/07/adwords-call-tracking-case-study">call tracking</a>) are super important in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/22/call-tracking-industries">industries that depend on calls to seal the deal</a>. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/11/google-local-service-ads">Local service-based businesses</a> like plumbers and locksmiths are a classic example, but people also generally want to talk to someone before they take on a big expense – think <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/01/murphy-law-firm-spotlight">choosing a lawyer</a> or purchasing enterprise software. If this sounds like your business, make it as easy as possible for people to reach you from your mobile ads – check out how high the conversion rate is for call-only ads (21%)!</p>
<p>That super high conversion rate keeps the cost per acquisition low even though the cost per click is more than twice that of a plain-flavor text ad.</p>
<h2>Google Mobile Display Ads</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="9d674dbf-3666-4d8f-b5c3-d6abe9383fdf" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ad_type_mobile_benchmarks_display_ads.png" alt="Google mobile benchmarks by display ad type" width="1000" height="868" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>When friend-of-WordStream Michelle Morgan wrote about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/23/responsive-display-ads">best practices for responsive display ads</a>, she shared some data indicating that responsive ads are getting more impressions, higher CTR and a lower CPC. Our data confirms that responsive ads are getting better performance metrics on mobile devices, too – about twice the CTR on average (0.70% for responsive compared to 0.35% for regular display).</p>
<p>Gmail ads have an incredibly high CTR of 20%, but that’s a little misleading if you don’t know that for Gmail ads, an open counts as a click. That’s still a really strong open rate for a paid promotion, though. Note that the CPA is a little higher than for other types of mobile display – if you’re looking to improve performance and lower costs for your Gmail ads, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/01/gmail-ads">check out these tips from Larry Kim</a>.</p>
<h2>Google Mobile Shopping Ads</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="17857c28-e26a-47dd-a57f-3e2133765099" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ad_type_benchmarks_shopping_ads.png" alt="Google mobile benchmarks by shopping ad type" width="1000" height="868" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Shopping ads and <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7325107?hl=en">showcase shopping ads</a> are pretty much neck and neck – though regular shopping ads have a higher CTR, showcase shopping ads have a higher CTR and slightly lower costs. As always, your mileage may vary.</p>
<h2>Other Mobile Ad Types</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="ef8cb980-90f3-467e-bc6c-3a5b253b6e04" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ad_type_benchmarks_other_ads.png" alt="Google mobile benchmarks by video and mobile app install type" width="1000" height="868" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>If you’ve got an app, mobile app install ads are a no-brainer – a high conversion rate and low cost per click mean that you’ll only be spending $5 on average for a new user. (OK, well, they’re a no-brainer if a new app user is worth more to your business than $5.)</p>
<p>Did you know that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/08/video-marketing-statistics">over half of all video content is watched on mobile</a>? Mobile video ads (such as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/23/youtube-advertising-tips">YouTube ads</a>) are comparable in cost to search ads, and can be amazing for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/05/brand-awareness-campaigns">raising brand awareness</a>.</p>
<p>Here are all the mobile ad type benchmarks together in one handy graphic:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="aa0e657b-7531-4df7-aed7-2d08732fff96" data-langcode="en">

<h3>Data Sources:</h3>
<p>This report is based on a sample of 20,297 US-based WordStream client accounts in all verticals (representing a little over $139 million in aggregate Google Ads spend) who were advertising on Google’s Search and Display networks in the 2017 calendar year.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year, we released our first-ever <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/05/15/state-of-the-internet-marketing-agency">State of the Agency report</a>, an inside look at how digital marketing agencies run their businesses. It was a big hit, so this year, we’re doing it again, with updated data and twice as many questions to reveal what makes agencies tick, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/03/07/common-agency-mistakes">their biggest challenges</a>, their pricing models, how they <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/27/agency-new-business-center">acquire new clients</a> and more.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>We gathered the data by sending a survey out to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/25/customer-spotlight-vizergy">our agency clients</a> (about a third of our customer base uses <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/agencies">WordStream Advisor for Agencies</a> to better serve their own clients’ advertising needs), and got back answers from hundreds of agencies all over the world.</p>
<p>Below you’ll find the results of our State of the Industry report – here’s how agencies are getting it done in 2018!</p>
<p><em><strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/05/state-of-the-digital-marketing-agency-2023">&gt;&gt; Looking for the most recent State of the Digital Marketing Agency report? We&#8217;ve got you covered!</a></strong></em></p>
<h2>1. How Does Your Agency Price Your Paid Search Services?</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="7876b23f-170a-48d0-be1e-130c195119b2" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/soa_2018_price_services.png" alt="digital agency service pricing" width="800" height="493" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Half of responders price their services using a flat fee or retainer fee model, while 25% charge based on a percentage of spend (we got similar responses last year). About 12% use billable hours – which, as we noted last year, <a href="http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/15/ppc-agency-pricing">may undersell the value you’re offering</a> if you use agency software to improve efficiency.</p>
<p>Of those who chose “other,” pricing models included charging by a percentage of profit or value per lead, a mixed pricing model (such as “Minimum Management Fee + Percentage of Spend”), or changing models depending on total spend. As one agency responded, “It depends on how high the media spend is. If it&#8217;s a certain threshold, we&#8217;ll do percentage of spend but if it&#8217;s a small campaign, we&#8217;ll do a management fee based on expected hours to manage it.”</p>
<h2>2. If Your Agency Prices By Percentage of Spend, What Do You Charge?</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="a8d1e982-d482-44ef-97f0-c1b4e1554b12" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/soa_2018_percentage_spend_charge.png" alt="agency percentage of spend pricing model" width="800" height="506" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Of those that charge based on a percentage of spend, most (about 18%) charge 15-20% of spend, with about 10% charging 10-15%.</p>
<h2>3. Does Your Agency Charge Additional Fees for Any of the Following?</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="26e09f4a-4924-4d22-9a56-3742703bc800" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>While 22% of respondents do not charge any additional fees at all, among those who do, services that typically accrue extra fees include <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/10/high-converting-landing-pages">landing page creation</a> and campaign creation. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/07/06/ppc-account-audit">Account audits</a> and implementing conversion tracking also made the list. Other services that warrant extra fees include remarketing and display ad creative.</p>
<h2>4. Does Your Agency Charge a Setup Fee for New Clients?</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="6bfe0e05-4a75-44ea-ac61-d005b95baaa4" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>64% of agencies surveyed do charge a set-up fee – same as last year.</p>
<h2>5. If Yes, How Much Does Your Agency Charge for a Setup Fee?</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="97148949-3529-48c1-b6a3-3558ce089e59" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/soa_2018_setup_fee_amount.png" alt="agency setup fee amounts" width="800" height="504" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>About 35% of agencies that charge a fee charge less than $1,000 for the service, with 25% charging over $1,000 but less than $2,500.</p>
<h2>6. Does Your Agency Have Full-Time Employees Dedicated to Paid Search?</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="7bf6538c-f8a4-4de2-b6f4-1ca6a2b431cc" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/soa_2018_full_time.png" alt="paid search agencies" width="800" height="481" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Almost a third of the marketing agencies we surveyed do not have a single full-time employee fully dedicated to paid search advertising, while almost 40% have one full-time dedicated paid search manager, and 28% have two to five.</p>
<h2>7. What Other Marketing Services Does Your Agency Offer?</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="3e752b73-92c0-461a-970f-ec1d48c7571f" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/soa_2018_other_services.png" alt="digital marketing agency services" width="800" height="488" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Other popular services that our agency clients offer include <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">social media marketing</a>, SEO, display marketing, web development, content marketing, email marketing, and creative services. Less common answers included public relations, sales enablement, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/10/account-based-marketing">account-based marketing</a>, event marketing, and reputation management.</p>
<h2>8. Approximately What Percentage of Time Does Your Agency Spend on Paid Search?</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="1d2375c3-c8a1-4926-819e-32321caef86a" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/soa_2018_time_spent_paid_search.png" alt="time spent on paid search" width="800" height="490" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Almost half of respondents said they spend less than 25% of their time on paid search advertising (not surprising, perhaps, considering all the other marketing services they offer!). About 12% spend more than half their time on paid search, with just under 5% spending most of their time on paid search.</p>
<h2>9. What Are the Biggest Challenges Your Agency Will Face This Year?</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="11a1f533-96e8-4cac-a56a-353f45654806" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Here’s one where the answers changed quite a bit. The single biggest challenge for the agencies we spoke with remains <a href="http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/01/16/get-more-clients">finding and acquiring new clients</a> – but we’re pleased to see that time management is less of an issue in 2018 than it was last year. Just 23% of this year’s respondents said managing their time is a struggle, whereas 40% of agencies were struggling with time last year. Better tools, perhaps?</p>
<p>We added a new answer this year – hiring and training new employees – and 15% of agencies said they struggle with this process. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/26/prospecting-strategies-ppc-agencies">As agencies grow</a>, it’s critical to bring on new talent and get them up to speed quickly so they can serve those new <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/02/client-communication">clients</a>.</p>
<h2>10. Does Your Agency Anticipate Growing the Amount of Paid Search Spend You Manage This Year?</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="70afe100-2b7d-4e1b-afa2-8cde6bb4ad17" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Always be growing! 95% of agencies we surveyed plan to add more paid search spend under management this year.</p>
<h2>11. In the Last Year, By How Much Has Your PPC Spend Under Management Grown?</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="1967c36d-0e6d-4ccd-abf6-8a61ea2dc7e1" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>We’re excited to see that almost half of agencies who responded have grown their PPC spend under management by more than 25%.</p>
<h2>12. What Industries Do Your Clients Work In?</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="6b1f9bfe-3df2-45c3-9306-a02d7a1a6846" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Marketing agencies using WordStream Advisor serve many <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/29/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks">different industries</a>, with some of the most popular including healthcare, home services, real estate, ecommerce, legal, travel, software, and auto – with 30% of agencies serving other industries not listed here.</p>
<h2>13. What Percentage of the Paid Search Accounts You Manage Were Not Created By Your Agency?</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="f4573571-ecd7-46cf-8fed-b7e63bf0e323" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>As we saw last year, the majority of agencies who responded say less than 25% of their accounts were <em>not</em> created by their agency. (In other words, most agencies are building most of their clients’ paid search accounts from scratch.)</p>
<h2>14. What Online Advertising Platforms Are You Currently Managing?</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="dc1eb170-b601-4392-9032-3c12bef98018" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/soa_2018_ad_platforms.png" alt="ad platforms managed by digital agencies" width="800" height="487" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>About 70% of the agencies we surveyed are managing client accounts on at least three major ad platforms: AdWords, Bing, and Facebook. A quarter of respondents focus their online ad services on AdWords. (Not surprisingly, no respondents manage <em>only</em> Bing.)</p>
<h2>15. How Much Time Do You Spend Every Week on PPC Management? (Per Client)</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="4ae6891e-b441-4e11-b187-b42e758d333c" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/soa_2018_time_ppc_management.png" alt="time management for marketing agencies" width="801" height="489" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>The most common response: one to five hours per client per week. However, there’s a lot of variation here, with about 15% of agencies spending more than 10 hours per week on each client’s PPC.</p>
<h2>16. How Much Time Do You Spend on Reporting? (Per Client)</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="247c9242-0bd5-4766-b43b-09cf536487d3" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/soa_2018_time_reporting.png" alt="time spend on reporting for agencies" width="800" height="487" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Another happy result: More than half of agencies are spending less than one hour per week, per client, on reporting. (Who wants to spend all their time <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/12/14/new-success-reports">reporting</a>?!)</p>
<h2>17. When Optimizing an Account, What Do Your Prioritize First?</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="2f225a02-3ab9-4625-b58b-dbc253e4594a" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Another new question this year: Where do you start when optimizing a new account? By far the most popular starting point was <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide">keyword research</a>. Makes sense to us – we always say you can’t get anywhere in search marketing without the right <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords">keywords</a>.</p>
<p>The second most popular starting point was negative keywords – <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/05/omega-learning">a common pain point</a> that came up in our last Grade and Get Paid contest, where entrants were asked to run two <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords">AdWords Grader</a> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/08/13/adwords-report">reports</a> and describe what they learned. (A failure to set the right negative keywords is a huge source of wasted spend.)</p>
<h2>18. Where Do You Do Most of Your Competitive Research?</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0820e22b-ff1c-4091-a9cf-89f76cecb6df" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>More than half of agencies conduct all competitive research in AdWords alone. But SEM Rush and SpyFu are pretty popular <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/09/competitor-keywords">competitive tools</a> too.</p>
<h2>19. What Is Your Main Source for Acquiring New Clients?</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e783a9b9-03c7-4452-a81c-d5e86957428f" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Far and away the most common source of new client acquisitions is client referrals. But 26% get the most leverage from upsells.</p>
<h2>20. What Resources Do You Turn to Learn More About Paid Search/Running An Agency?</h2>

</article>
</div>
<p>Agencies use a host of different learning resources, from blogs to seminars, to stay on top of trends and the changing world of online advertising. Commonly named resources include WordStream (thanks! We try!), Moz, Google documentation, YouTube videos, HubSpot, SEM Rush, Search Engine Land, Search Engine Watch, Udemy, Quicksprout, Clix Marketing, PPC Hero, Ahrefs, and the Agency Management Institute.</p>
<h2>State of the Agency In 2018: Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>What were the overarching trends this year? What’s top of mind?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growth, growth, growth</strong> – Digital marketing agencies were successful in growing their paid search management under spend last year – but they’re not stopping now! Most agencies are looking to drive further growth this year, whether through upsells or bringing on new clients.</li>
<li><strong>Quality of service is key</strong> – With word of mouth and client referrals as the #1 way to acquire new accounts, delivering stellar results to existing clients is absolutely crucial. Agencies need to strike the right balance when it comes to dividing resources between maintenance and growth activities.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-platform advertising</strong> – Most agencies we spoke to are managing online ad spend across at least three different platforms, and offering a number of different services aside from paid search. Agencies get that businesses need to run cross-channel campaigns and diversity their marketing channels to succeed in 2018.</li>
<li><strong>Hiring/education/training</strong> – You can’t <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/06/26/grow-my-agency">grow your agency</a> without adding more head count or adding new tools and software to make existing reps more efficient. With aggressive growth, both are needed – and either way, agencies need to set aside resources so they can hire and retain great talent and keep their staff trained on all platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over to you, agencies – how have your strategies changed in the past year? What changes are you looking to make in the future?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From time to time, people ask me what my #1 content marketing tip is. Often, these people are new to content marketing – they have a new site or business, or they just haven’t tried to build traffic and an audience with content marketing yet. They want to know the single biggest action they can take to start building their brand with content.</p>
<p>When I get this question, I always say the same thing: <strong>My #1 tip is to create a cornerstone content piece</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cornerstone-content-guide1.png" alt="cornerstone content" width="380" height="350" /></div>
<p>What the heck does this even mean? Why is cornerstone content so important? And how do you actually do it? These are questions you’ll get the answers to today!</p>
<h2>What is cornerstone content?</h2>
<p>Cornerstone content is a <strong>high-value, foundational piece of content</strong> that is intended to help you start building traffic and brand awareness by showing people what you can offer. Your cornerstone content should be highly relevant to your business goals – it helps you establish authority in your industry and will bring in a steady stream of site visitors who are likely to be interested, sooner or later, in the products or services you offer.</p>
<p>However, keep in mind that a cornerstone content piece is usually pretty top-of-funnel – that means it should be open and free (not locked behind a paywall or registration form), and you shouldn’t expect everyone who visits this content to buy something or otherwise convert. <strong>The real goal of cornerstone content is to create a positive first impression</strong>, so people get a warm, fuzzy feeling about your brand. That way, when they <em>are</em> ready to convert, they’re much more likely to turn to you.</p>
<p>The metaphor of the cornerstone comes to us from masonry. <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/cornerstone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As the folks at Dictionary.com define it</a>, a cornerstone is:</p>
<p>1. a stone uniting two masonry walls at an intersection.</p>
<p>2. a stone representing the nominal starting place in the construction of a monumental building, usually carved with the date and laid with appropriate ceremonies.</p>
<p>3. something that is essential, indispensable, or basic: <em>The cornerstone of democratic government is a free press.</em></p>
<p>4. the chief foundation on which something is constructed or developed: <em>The cornerstone of his argument was that all people are created equal.</em></p>
<p>This definition is handy because your cornerstone content should do these things too – it should support the rest of your content as you build out your website, and form an essential part of your traffic base. (You might also want to take a page from that “appropriate ceremonies” bit – more on that when we get to content promotion.)</p>
<h2>What are the benefits of a cornerstone content piece?</h2>
<p>Cornerstone content has a number of benefits for your business:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raises your brand awareness</li>
<li>Brings in relevant site visitors</li>
<li>Builds natural links (which help the rest of your site’s <a href="/blog/ws/2015/04/30/seo-basics">SEO</a>)</li>
<li>Establishes authority, trust, and positive brand sentiment</li>
<li>Feeds your funnel (helping you build an email list, for example)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re asking me for help with content marketing, then I know you’re interested in all of these outcomes! And a cornerstone content piece is the single best way to focus all your initial content marketing efforts and resources on something that will drive compounding, <a href="/blog/ws/2012/10/16/guide-to-evergreen-content-marketing">evergreen value</a> for your business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/evergreen-cornerstone-content.jpg" alt="evergreen cornerstone content" width="650" height="433" /></div>
<p><em>Evergreen content is news that stays news</em></p>
<h2>Examples of cornerstone content</h2>
<p>If you’re still not totally sure what I mean, here are a few examples.</p>
<p>Moz is an SEO software company, so it makes sense that their cornerstone content piece would be a <a href="https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beginner’s Guide to SEO</a>. This can also be considered a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/11/pillar-pages">pillar page</a>. It’s a big, authoritative resource that you can either read online or get as a PDF. I often recommend it to people who are trying to learn SEO. It’s a big source of traffic, links, and leads for Moz, so they put effort into keeping it up-to-date. You’ll also notice that they promote it right on their home page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/moz-example-cornerstone-content.jpg" alt="examples of great cornerstone content" width="800" height="265" /></div>
<p>That’s B2B, so what about a B2C example?</p>
<p>Paula’s Choice is a small skincare brand with a cult following – I’ve actually heard people say they belong to the “cult of Paula.” In addition to selling skincare, the site has as an <a href="https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ingredient dictionary</a> that breaks down what all those weird chemical names in your face wash really mean and whether they’re good or bad for you. They also have a whole separate site called <a href="https://www.beautypedia.com/skin-care-reviews/by-brand/paulas-choice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beautypedia</a> that posts expert and community reviews of products from other brands, breaking down which ingredients are legit vs. hype, products that are overpriced or potentially harmful and more. Genius!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cornerstone-content-example-paulas-choice.jpg" alt="cornerstone content examples" width="800" height="820" /></div>
<p>Here’s another one: My colleague Allen was recently looking to move money from Etrade, and found a free risk assessment calculator from <a href="https://www.wealthfront.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wealthfront</a>. He found the results so helpful that it sold him on their financial planning services. Nice work, Wealthfront! This is how giving something valuable away for free can pay off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/wealthfront-cornerstone-content.jpg" alt="cornerstone content free tool example" width="800" height="402" /></div>
<p>This also illustrates how a free tool can actually be a form of content. Take our own <a href="/keywords/?dt=1">Free Keyword Tool</a> – we launched it way back in the aughts, and today, it’s one of the top five most trafficked pages on our website (with over half a million visitors a year), as well as one of the most <a href="/blog/ws/2017/05/24/link-building-now">frequently linked</a>, and it drives a huge portion of our first actions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/free-tools-as-cornerstone-content.jpg" alt="how to create cornerstone content" width="800" height="288" /></div>
<p>So when planning out what your cornerstone content will be, consider other forms of content beyond just articles and guides.</p>
<p>Another example of what I’d consider our own cornerstone content: our <a href="/blog/ws/2016/02/29/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks">advertising benchmarks for Google AdWords</a> and <a href="/blog/ws/2017/02/28/facebook-advertising-benchmarks">Facebook advertising</a>. Since we sell software to help businesses manage their AdWords and Facebook campaigns, we tapped our wealth of customer data to provide some guidelines for advertisers on the averages they should be looking to beat when it comes to key metrics like click-through rate and conversion rate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ads-average-conversion-rate.png" alt="wordstream cornerstone content" width="800" height="792" /></div>
<p>Again, these two content pieces drive a huge amount of traffic, links, and leads for us, because <strong>our target audience truly finds them helpful, and this data isn’t easy to find anywhere else</strong>.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve established what cornerstone content is and why you need it, let’s walk through the seven steps you’ll need to follow, in detail, to create your own cornerstone content.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Choosing your content topic and format</h2>
<p>The first step in this process is extremely important – in fact, I’d say choosing the right topic for your cornerstone content piece is actually just as important as the execution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/target-customer-shoes.jpeg" alt="how to brainstorm cornerstone content topics" width="750" height="500" /></div>
<p>Start by putting yourself in your target audience’s shoes, since these are the people that you’re trying to reach with your content. Ask questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What big problems do my target customers have? What are the burning questions they need answers to?</li>
<li>Of those problems, which ones aren’t already solved by existing content on the web? Are there important questions that they’re not getting adequate answers to?</li>
<li>Of <em>those</em> problems, are there any that you’re uniquely positioned to address? Do you have special knowledge, insight, or data that could help people facing these problems?</li>
</ul>
<p>Give yourself plenty of time to think about these questions. Gather ideas from everyone in your business. <a href="/blog/ws/2014/09/11/voice-of-the-customer">Talk to your actual customers</a>! Your cornerstone content needs to be relevant to your audience.</p>
<p>When you find a meaty problem or question, do some competitive research to make sure you have something new to bring to the table. For example, you might think a mattress buying guide is a great idea for a cornerstone content piece – but that’s already a very crowded (and <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3065928/sleepopolis-casper-bloggers-lawsuits-underside-of-the-mattress-wars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprisingly controversial</a>!) space, and you might not be able to create something unique or <a href="https://moz.com/blog/how-to-create-10x-content-whiteboard-friday" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10X better</a> than what’s already available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/competitive-research-cornerstone-content.jpg" alt="competitive keyword research for content" width="500" height="654" /></div>
<p><em>It’s hard to rank for competitive queries if you can’t create something much better than what’s already ranking</em></p>
<p>What you’re looking for here is a hole, a point of entry.<strong> The ideal topic for a cornerstone content piece is something that people are commonly searching for, without getting satisfying results. </strong>This way, you can swoop in and be the hero.</p>
<p>Once you’ve settled on a topic idea, think about the format that would best deliver what people are looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li>A long-form how-to guide? (like that SEO guide for beginners mentioned above)</li>
<li>A video or series of videos? (like <a href="http://videos.homedepot.com/detail/videos/bath/video/5034083179001/how-to-install-a-bathroom-faucet?autoStart=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Depot’s DIY project series</a>)</li>
<li>Some kind of data visualization? (like a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/19/us/2015-year-in-weather-temperature-precipitation.html#new-york_ny" target="_blank" rel="noopener">timeline</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/04/19/us/elections/new-york-city-republican-primary-results.html#11/40.7100/-73.9800" target="_blank" rel="noopener">map</a>)</li>
<li>A searchable database of some type? (like that beauty review site)</li>
<li>A free tool or app? (like a mortgage calculator or a photo editor)</li>
</ul>
<p>Delivering super-helpful information or guidance in the right format is crucial to great cornerstone content.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Keyword research</h2>
<p>Once you’ve got your topic idea in mind, the next step is <a href="/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide">keyword research</a>. You want to be sure that there’s healthy <a href="/blog/ws/2017/01/23/keyword-search-volume">keyword search volume</a> related to your topic of choice, because keyword volume is a sign of interest and demand. If a lot of people are searching for something in Google or other search engines, there’s a big opportunity for you to capture that traffic and create that great first impression of your brand.</p>
<p>Let’s say we’re hoping to create a great cornerstone content piece for a boutique men’s grooming shop, selling vintage-y shaving supplies, beard oil, mustache wax, all that hipster nonsense. From a quick check in <a href="/keywords/?dt=1">WordStream’s Free Keyword Tool</a>, I can see that the keyword “how to grow a beard faster” is VERY popular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/wordstream-free-keyword-research-tools-for-content.jpg" alt="doing keyword research for cornerstone content" width="601" height="735" /></div>
<p><em>33K+ keyword searches a month is a LOT!</em></p>
<p>What happens if I google this keyword? Is the demand already being met? Let’s see:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cornerstone-content-featured-snippet.jpg" alt="featured snippet content marketing" width="664" height="344" /></div>
<p>Wikihow has the coveted <a href="/blog/ws/2015/10/13/google-answer-box">featured snippet</a>. (And a gross closeup of a hair follicle.) However, if you scroll down to where this guide is ranking, you’ll see that it’s got a pretty piss-poor rating from users (59% is a flunking grade):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-rating-cornerstone-content.jpg" alt="google ratings in serp results" width="662" height="464" /></div>
<p>That means people aren’t even satisfied with Wikihow’s answer. <a href="/blog/ws/2016/01/26/intent-marketing">The intent of the query isn’t being met</a>. Yet it’s still ranking in position zero.</p>
<p>You know what this smells like to me? <strong>OPPORTUNITY.</strong> If we can unseat Wikihow from that featured snippet, we could be getting tens of thousands of visits a month from prime potential customers. Pretty sweet, no?</p>
<p>Now let’s double-check that keyword in another keyword tool. <a href="https://www.semrush.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEM Rush</a> provides a ton of related variations on the base “how to grow a beard” keyword. All of these <a href="/blog/ws/2016/08/09/question-keywords">related questions</a> that wannabe beard-growers are asking can help us figure out what our cornerstone content piece should look like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/sem-rush-cornerstone-content-keyword-research.jpg" alt="cornerstone content research" width="700" height="869" /></div>
<p>Listen up because these keyword searches speak volumes (pun intended, sorry not sorry). Your customers, in this imaginary scenario, are screaming for help with growing fuller, thicker, sexier beards, and they want those beards fast! You’re the beard expert, so it’s your job to step up to the plate and help them out.</p>
<p>To tackle this content topic, let’s create a nice, detailed guide that explains how to grow a kick-ass beard in ten steps. We’ll need to create some visuals to show people how it’s done, and maybe a nice video for anyone who prefers that format. (Bonus: You could rank for the same keyword searches in YouTube.)</p>
<h2>Step 3: Content planning</h2>
<h3>DIY or outsource?</h3>
<p>First, figure out if you’re going to produce all the content in-house or outsource it. This is largely going to depend on your current staff and resources. If you’ve got an actual marketing team, you can probably pull it off in-house. If you’re a one- or two-man/woman affair, it might be tricky to devote the necessary time and effort while also keeping the rest of your business running.</p>
<p>If you decide to hire out, check our <a href="/blog/ws/2016/10/31/ultimate-guide-hiring-an-agency">3-Step Guide to Hiring an Agency or Any Third-Party Vendor</a>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you can also do it partially outsourced and partially in-house. For example, you could do all the research for your cornerstone content in-house, then hire a contractor to turn your research into a visual asset like an infographic, or a video.</p>
<h3>Put some milestones in place</h3>
<p>However you plan to create this thing, think like a project manager and put some milestones in place to keep the project moving. Remember, your cornerstone content piece needs to be truly awesome, so don’t expect it to come together in a matter of days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/program-management-tree.jpg" alt="content marketing project management" width="736" height="556" /></div>
<p><em>I was not told there would be biology</em></p>
<p>A solid guide could take up to a month to produce. Anything that requires designers and developers (like a free tool) will take considerably longer. Be realistic, but then get moving. (If you feel totally lost, here are some tips on <a href="https://plan.io/blog/post/128257508413/how-to-manage-a-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to manage a project</a>.)</p>
<h3>Gather your resources</h3>
<p>Estimate costs for your content piece and earmark that budget. These costs will vary pretty widely depending on what kind of content you’re trying to produce. Potential costs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fees for a freelance writer (don’t skimp here – a good freelance writer may charge up to a dollar per word)</li>
<li>Design costs</li>
<li>Development costs</li>
<li>Promotion budget (social media promotion can be quite cost-effective for <a href="/blog/ws/2016/08/31/content-amplification">content amplification</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t be afraid to spend some money on this! If you’re getting cold feet, go back and read that section on “benefits” again.</p>
<h2>Step 4: Content creation</h2>
<p>Now it’s finally time to roll up your sleeves (maybe use some sleeve braces, since you’re so dapper &amp; hip) and get into <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/13/content-creation">content creation</a>, AKA actually write your piece.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/top-bartenders.jpg" alt="bartenders" width="620" height="268" /></div>
<p><em>Bartenders sure do love to roll up their sleeves (<a href="http://www.sandiegomagazine.com/Blogs/SD-Food-News/Winter-Spring-2013/San-Diegos-Top-20-Bartenders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source</a>)</em></p>
<p>This process is going to look different depending on your topic and format, but whatever you decide on, here are some considerations to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quality really matters here.</strong> You want to stake your reputation as a brand on this content. It should be completely accurate, truly helpful, a real “Wow” experience for prospects. So hire the best talent you can afford to create it, and build in time for review and revision. Get an outside expert opinion before you launch it if you can.</li>
<li><strong>Quality encompasses a number of things.</strong> This content piece should be visually appealing as well as easy to use and navigate, no matter what device visitors are using.</li>
<li><strong>Keep your keyword research close at hand!</strong> Those keywords you surfaced earlier should be naturally occurring in the text of your content. Let them define the structure of what you create. For example, there should be a “chapter” or section in your beard guide about how long it takes to grow a beard.</li>
<li><strong>Intent, intent, intent.</strong> Matching intent is so crucial. Try to tackle a topic that you understand inside and out, and ensure that your content really and truly solves the problem and gets your visitor where they want to be. (You don’t want a 59% approval rating do you?)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/happy-testimonial-cornerstone-content.jpg" alt="testimonials for content" width="800" height="224" /></div>
<p><em>Now that’s a happy customer</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use your cornerstone content as an opportunity to display your brand voice.</strong> Show people <a href="/blog/ws/2017/09/20/ethical-marketing">what your values are</a>. Connect on a human level – be real.</li>
<li><strong>Cornerstone content shouldn’t be too pushy</strong> – if your mattress guide just says “buy my mattress, it’s the best” nobody’s going to trust you. Why should they? The goal is to solve a problem in a brand-neutral way. Cornerstone content is top-of-funnel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout this part of the process, you should keep your target audience top of mind, and work to create something those people are going to love and want to share.</p>
<h2>Step 5: Optimization</h2>
<p>One of the goals of cornerstone content is to bring in new visitors, making it their first experience of your brand. Ideally, it’s a bookmarkable resource that people want to return to, but since you’re trying to <em>grow</em>, you need to make sure your content is optimized to be found in organic search. It should also be optimized for shareability, so people will stumble upon it when checking Twitter, Facebook, etc.</p>
<h3>Optimizing your content for SEO</h3>
<p>Fingers crossed this isn’t the first time you’ve thought about SEO. Your content is more likely to succeed if your site architecture is already SEO-friendly. (Check out our <a href="/blog/ws/2015/04/30/seo-basics">SEO basics guide</a> if this isn’t ringing any bells.)</p>
<p>Today, we’ll mostly focus on how you can optimize your new content piece, in the hopes that the rest of your site is in order.</p>
<p>First, let’s put those keywords to work! The primary keyword – the one that has the highest volume while also being most relevant to the content as a whole – should appear in both the title of the piece and in the URL.</p>
<p>It’s important to optimize your title, or headline, for SEO, but it also needs to be appealing and clickable to humans. “How to Grow a Beard: Video” might do OK, but it’s not as exciting as “How to Grow a Full, Manly Beard in 4 Weeks.” Check out these tips on <a href="/blog/ws/2017/05/17/how-to-write-great-headlines">how to write a great headline</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-write-emotional-headlines.jpg" alt="content marketing headlines" width="744" height="700" /></div>
<p>Your keywords should also appear in the body of your content. I’m not talking about <a href="/blog/ws/2012/03/21/dangers-of-keyword-stuffing">keyword stuffing</a>, but don’t be so afraid of keyword stuffing that you don’t actually use your keywords. If you’re writing a long-form guide, they will fit right naturally into the headings that break up the sections. For example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/using-keywords-in-headings-content-optimization.jpg" alt="using keywords in cornerstone content" width="792" height="562" /></div>
<p>This way, both search engines and readers can clearly see that your content is relevant to their questions. It also helps them scan and skip around, which web readers are especially wont to do.</p>
<p>Don’t forget about <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/7412852-10-must-know-image-optimization-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image optimization</a> – use relevant keywords in your image file names, use alt text, and keep your images light and fast-loading. (Also, <a href="/blog/ws/2016/03/01/content-marketing-images">use plenty of images in your content</a> – one per every 100-200 words or so.)</p>
<p>If you’re creating a video or an infographic, <a href="/blog/ws/2017/06/02/video-seo">make sure you provide some supplementary text</a> that Google can “read” – like a transcript. Be wary of infographics in general – they don’t necessarily provide a great mobile experience. Consider responsive, even interactive forms of data visualization that aren’t just a giant image file.</p>
<p>In fact, whatever the content type, <strong>make sure it works just as well on mobile</strong>! The “<a href="https://searchengineland.com/faq-google-mobile-first-index-262751" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobile-first index</a>” is a reality we can’t ignore.</p>
<p>These on-page elements are really important, but don’t forget about off-page SEO, AKA links. Create some internal links to your new cornerstone content piece, ideally from high-value, high-engagement pages on your site, like your homepage. You’ll also want to get some external links pointing in – more on that in the promotion section below.</p>
<h3>Optimizing your content for social</h3>
<p>Part of what makes content shareable is the content itself: Is it truly helpful? Does it make people <em>feel</em> something?</p>
<p>But once you’ve got that down, you also need to make it really easy for people to share your content. Here are some tips to get more shares out of your cornerstone content:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get some social buttons on there so people can share it with one click.</strong> There are lots of plugins available to make this easy, and if you have the resources you can customize or develop your own. Keep the buttons visible.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li><strong>When creating your content, don’t just think about who might read it – think about who might <em>share</em> it.</strong> Consider quoting or referencing <a href="/blog/ws/2015/02/26/influencer-marketing">influencers in your industry</a> who might be inclined to share the content with their followers.</li>
<li><strong>Consider creating images or videos that encapsulate your content, optimized for different social platforms.</strong> For video, choose an appealing thumbnail image; smiling people tend to do well. An appealing featured image for Twitter, Facebook, etc. should be colorful and on-brand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, don’t just rely on organic social promotion – more on this in the next section.</p>
<h3>Optimizing for action</h3>
<p>Like I said above – your cornerstone content shouldn’t be sales-y. It’s OK if people visit your content and don’t immediately become customers. Don’t expect a bangin’ conversion rate at this stage of the funnel.</p>
<p>That said, don’t shut down the possibility of visitors becoming customers! There’s room in your content for some low-friction, next-step offers.</p>
<p>For example, you might want to implement an exit-banner campaign – don’t do it in a way that interrupts users, but when people are moving to leave your site, you can show them a pop-up that incents them to join your email list (maybe offering, say, 20% off their first order if they sign up).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/exit-offer-on-cornerstone-content.jpg" alt="exit popup example" width="355" height="521" /></div>
<p>Also, cookie your visitors so you can remarket to them later! Once you’ve used this awesome content to turn them into a fan of your brand, show them remarketing ads that will remind them you exist and force them to come back for more. You already know these people are trying to grow a beard – wouldn’t it be great if you could show them an ad for your best-selling shaving kit every time they log into Facebook?</p>
<p>To learn more about this tactic, read our guides to <a href="/blog/ws/2015/11/16/facebook-remarketing">remarketing on Facebook</a> and on the <a href="/blog/ws/2013/12/04/adwords-remarketing-best-practices-guide">Google Display Network</a>.</p>
<h2>Step 6: Promotion</h2>
<p>It would be crazy to put this much effort into a content piece and then fall down on promoting it. You want it to make a splash. It takes time for new content to rank in organic search (especially if you’re a new business!), so you’ll need to pursue other avenues to get your content in front of people in the meantime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/content-promotion-sky-dancers.gif" alt="content promotion" width="370" height="222" /></div>
<p>Buzzsumo recently published a <a href="http://buzzsumo.com/blog/went-viral-lessons-promoting-content-influencers-ads-pr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great case study</a> on how they got a blog post leveraging internal data to “go viral.” Check it out, and try the below strategies:</p>
<h3>Email promotion</h3>
<p>If you’ve got an email list, use it! Send out a dedicated email announcing your awesome new content piece to your database. Top-of-funnel emails like this often see great open and click-through rates.</p>
<p>But don’t stop there – do a little targeted email outreach, writing personalized emails for specific people that you believe would be especially interested in reading your new content, sharing it, or – best of all – linking to it.</p>
<p>Here are some great tips for <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/outreach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writing an awesome outreach email</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/outreach-email-for-cornerstone-content.jpg" alt="email outreach for content promotion" width="900" height="484" /></div>
<p><em>Making it personal always helps!</em></p>
<p>When thinking about how to target, look for those almighty influencers, but also look for related content that is already popular. If you run across a good list of resources for the well-dressed, well-groomed gentleman, reach out to the author and suggest they add a link to your great new beard-growing guide. (Try <a href="/blog/ws/2017/08/25/twitter-link-building">adding an incentive for them to link to you</a> – mention that you’ll promote their post to return the favor.)</p>
<h3>Social media promotion</h3>
<p>Organic social promotion is a no-brainer. Of course you should post your new content to all your social networks, but it’ll take a little more work than that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tailor your text, image, etc. for different social networks</strong>. Different content succeeds on different platforms. For example, videos tend to do well on Facebook, so you could make a video version of your content just for FB and then link to the full guide from there.</li>
<li><strong>Share more than once. WAY MORE THAN ONCE.</strong> Put your content into a rotation so it’s getting regular exposure to more, new, different people.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on the platforms that work best in your industry.</strong> If you’re in the grooming business, you’re going to want to create some beautiful images of bearded men (with the beards as the focal point, natch) for Instagram and Pinterest.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pinterest-beard-board.jpg" alt="social media content promotion" width="700" height="547" /></div>
<p><em>Sick beard content, bro</em></p>
<p>But hey. Hey. Organic social promotion might not be enough. Good news though – paid social promotion is pretty affordable! And it can really get the ball rolling, leading to more people reading and sharing your content for free.</p>
<p>Our founder Larry Kim is kind of the king of paid social promotion. Some of his <a href="/blog/ws/2016/06/30/social-media-advertising-tips">best tips for content marketers using paid social promotion</a> include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Promote to targeted audiences – don’t just broadcast.</strong> For example, on Facebook you could promote your new guide only to men between the ages of 18 and 29. On Twitter, you can promote your post to a certain hashtag.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/social-media-advertising-trump-tweet-engagement.jpg" alt="Social media advertising Trump tweet engagement" width="900" height="364" /></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimize for relevance.</strong> Most social platforms have some kind of relevancy algorithm – on Facebook, it’s called <a href="/blog/ws/2017/09/14/facebook-relevance-score">Relevance Score</a>. Basically, how it works is that higher engagement rates keep your ad in the rotation and lower the cost you pay per engagement. If you see that a certain headline or image is performing well with your audience, replicate it!</li>
</ul>
<p>Set aside some money to promote your posts on social and make sure targeted users see it. In that Buzzsumo case study I mentioned above, <a href="https://twitter.com/steverayson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Rayson</a> writes: “We spent $648.00 on Facebook ads that drove over 2,000 clicks and which also resulted in 3 new paying customers.” Not bad ROI there.</p>
<p>Notice his targeting strategy as well: “Our first ad targeted employees of big publishers like BuzzFeed, Refinery29, Quartz, and Mashable.” This got them some big links, which had a nice trickle-down effect, as more exposure tends to beget more links.</p>
<h2>Step 7: Maintenance</h2>
<p>The final ingredient in your cornerstone content is time – give your beautiful creation a few months to accrue attention, shares and links, while keeping an eye on performance. Most of the traffic will likely come from email and social sources at first, but over time, you want to see traffic coming in from organic search as well.</p>
<p>So let’s fast forward and say you’ve done everything right (is it hard being so perfect?) and you’re really happy with your content’s performance. Is it time to kick back and relax?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/relaxinman.jpg" alt="relaxing" width="500" height="308" /></div>
<p><em>Don’t get cocky, outline man</em></p>
<p>Not exaaactly. You want your cornerstone content to be <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/03/get-more-traffic-from-evergreen-content">evergreen</a>, so you should check in at least quarterly to make sure everything is working smoothly and look for opportunities to make it even better. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep it impeccably up to date.</strong> If there’s suddenly a big new trend in beard-growing, your content should include it. If you recommend specific products, make sure they’re still available, the prices are accurate, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>If your cornerstone content is an app or tool</strong>, can you add new features? Can you improve the UX or make it faster?</li>
<li><strong>Try running some CRO tests </strong>to see if you can get a little more business value out of it. Test a different exit offer, or a different first email to send out to people who join your list.</li>
<li><strong>If years go by and you’re still seeing return value</strong>, consider giving your content a style refresh now and then. You don’t want it to look outdated even if the content is still fresh. Fonts, images, and layouts may need to be revisited for the times.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Nobody puts baby in a corner</h2>
<p>4400 words later, I sincerely hope you are AMPED to create your site’s first cornerstone content piece. It’s going to be a lot of work, but man is it going to feel good when you’re finished.</p>
<p>Still have questions about how this works? Let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>I’ve been an editor for many years (don’t make me admit how many) and a writer for even longer. After even a few years in the game, every editor develops their own list of bugbears (translation: pet peeves) – the mistakes or missteps that really stick in one’s craw (translation: annoy the pants off one).</p>
<p>I work with many different writers, and since I share these tips privately all the time, I figured it was time to pull them from the shadows of Track Changes comments and make them a matter of public record.</p>
<p>Most of the people who read this blog are marketers and business owners, so I’ve written this post with you in mind. These self-editing tips will be particularly helpful for copywriters doing business writing (i.e. writing for corporate blogs and websites, lead generation magnets like white papers, etc.) – but truly, this advice can improve almost any type of writing.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking to <a href="/blog/ws/2014/08/07/improve-writing-skills">up your writing game</a> and get better at <a href="/blog/ws/2016/02/12/self-editing-checklist">self-editing</a>, read on. I’ll start with some common style problems I run into again and again.</p>
<h2>7 Lazy Writing Crutches &amp; Bad Habits to Avoid</h2>
<p>Inexperienced writers often make the mistake of thinking that “good writing” is <em>fancy</em> writing. They mistake clarity for dullness. If this is your attitude, what you usually end up with is <em>over</em>writing. It can come off as show-offy, and it’s uncomfortable to read.</p>
<p>These seven bad habits muck up your writing, slow your reader down, and obscure what you’re trying to communicate. Relentlessly search these out and destroy them in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/06/content-editing">content editing</a> phase.</p>
<h3>The so-called elegant variation</h3>
<p>“The elegant variation” is an old term (coined by usage expert <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Watson_Fowler">Henry Watson Fowler</a>) that refers to an overuse of rare or poetic synonyms for more common words. The term is meant to be ironic – the effect is not actually elegant. Instead, elegant variations usually feel overwrought (or as the kids say, “try-hard”).</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="02cc9c96-c5d7-46b9-ad35-c936d3e8f619" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elegance-is-refusal.jpg" alt="elegance is refusal" width="651" height="654" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Coco Chanel said that – but </em><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-exchange-coco-chanel-and-the-nazi-party"><em>she didn’t refuse to hobnob with Nazis</em></a></p>
<p>Here’s Fowler, in his <em>Dictionary of Modern English Usage </em>(first published in 1926):</p>
<blockquote><p>It is the second-rate writers, those intent rather on expressing themselves prettily than on conveying their meaning clearly, &amp; still more those whose notions of style are based on a few misleading rules of thumb, that are chiefly open to the allurements of elegant variation&#8230;. There are few literary faults so widely prevalent, &amp; this book will not have been written in vain if the present article should heal any sufferer of his infirmity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ouch, Fowler.</p>
<p>The elegant variation is common in journalistic writing, where writers often try to avoid repeating a noun – so you’ll see Google referred to as “the search giant” on second mention. But it crops up all over the place – when people say an author “penned a volume” versus writing a book, say. It’s cute to a point, but really easy to overdo.</p>
<p>A related bad habit is “<a href="http://nancyfriedman.typepad.com/away_with_words/2013/01/word-of-the-week-said-bookism.html">said-bookism</a>,” when writers feel the need to avoid the word “said,” so people are always “exclaiming” and “proclaiming” and “retorting” instead. There actually was a “said book” at one point, a kind of thesaurus of terms for speaking that writers could use to vary their dialogue tags. But as it turns out, most of the time, plain old “said” works better, and the repetition calls less attention to itself than the endless variations do.</p>
<h3>$10 words</h3>
<p>Ten-dollar words, AKA <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/lists/191545">SAT words</a>, tend to go hand in hand with elegant-variationism.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="3e3c1666-7e5c-4f54-979d-34b5eb1016e4" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/US_252410_obverse.jpg" alt="ten dollar bill" width="1200" height="509" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Any excuse to look at Hamilton’s noble brow</em></p>
<p>These are fancy-sounding words that crop up on vocabulary tests and in spelling bees and are rarely uttered in everyday speech. Two of my particular least favorites are “plethora” and “myriad” (protip: if you ever apply for a job at WordStream, <em>don’t </em>use these in your <a href="/blog/ws/2017/10/13/how-to-write-a-cover-letter">cover letter</a>).</p>
<p>A lot of writers have a favorite go-to ten-dollar word. My husband loves “proleptic” for some reason. When self-editing, look for words that you tend to overuse, especially if they’re above a high-school reading level. (We found that <a href="/blog/ws/2017/06/06/best-ads">top-performing ads, like most bestsellers, are written at a ninth-grade reading level</a>!)</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="b609e0b7-603f-4028-ac63-2f56410fec3c" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<h3>Latinate words</h3>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with Latinate words and you can’t avoid them entirely – but there are a lot of cases where choosing Latinate words over Anglo-Saxon or Germanic words can make your writing sound academic or clinical and therefore less friendly.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of Latinate words vs. their Germanic counterparts:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e495513f-d38c-4da1-9de6-f3ade6374e5f" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/latinate-vs-germanic-words.jpg" alt="latinate versus germanic" width="665" height="670" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>But truly, you don’t need to worry too much about the etymological roots or origins or your words; just try to write in everyday speech. For example, I rarely hear people say “utilize” but I see it in writing all the time. “Use” and “utilize” both ultimately come from French but “use” sounds much more natural and friendly.</p>
<h3>Commonly misused words</h3>
<p>Words that are misused all the time always sound kind of wrong – even when used correctly!</p>
<p>For example, people are constantly writing “hone in on,” as in “hone in on the problem.” The correct expression is “<em>home</em> in on” – like a homing pigeon or homing device. A lot of editors will correct this use of “hone” (which means to sharpen, as in honing your skills or honing a knife) to “home,” but I prefer to just rephrase. After all, both “home in on” and “hone your skills” are clichés.</p>
<p>Other <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-58-most-commonly-misused-words-and-phrases-a6754551.html">frequently misused words and terms</a> include <a href="http://snarkygrammarguide.blogspot.com/2012/10/commonly-misused-words-comprise.html">comprise</a>, <a href="http://grammarist.com/usage/nonplussed/">nonplussed</a>, <a href="https://afterdeadline.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/bemused-bewildering/?_r=0">bemused</a>, and <a href="http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/begs-the-question">beg the question</a>. If you use them incorrectly, you’re going to tick off persnickety types, and if you use them correctly, all the people who don’t know what the word means are going to think <em>you’re</em> in the wrong. Accordingly I think it’s best to avoid them entirely.</p>
<h3>Needless exaggeration</h3>
<p>This tic is especially common in business and marketing writing, where writers naturally want to sell the value of whatever product or service they’re talking about, but you run the risk of sounding like a phony or a snake oil salesman.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="d4641282-5204-4556-8d37-121eeb56230b" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/snake-oil-linament.jpg" alt="snake oil salesman" width="346" height="527" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>“The strongest and best linament known for pain and lameness”</em></p>
<p>An example would be saying something “couldn’t be easier” instead of just saying that it’s easy. Theoretically, it could always be marginally easier…</p>
<h3>Baseless assumptions &amp; received wisdom</h3>
<p>There’s a weird rumor that floats around the WordStream office – it’s that seltzer is bad for you. Specifically people seem to think bubbly water somehow leeches calcium from your bones (??). I don’t know where the myth came from, but there’s <a href="http://lifehacker.com/three-myths-about-sparkling-water-debunked-1759280798">no evidence</a> <a href="http://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/is-carbonated-water-bad-for-you">that it does this</a>.</p>
<p>An example from the world of marketing is the received idea that consumers hate remarketing ads, so you need to set strict frequency caps on your retargeted ads. But we’ve found that <a href="/blog/ws/2015/10/01/remarketing-facts">conversion rates on remarketing ads actually <em>increase</em> with more exposure</a>, not the other way around. It’s always good to question a “rule” and make sure it’s not just an old wives’ tale.</p>
<p>When reading over your writing, be on the lookout for claims that you can’t prove or back up with evidence. Just because you’ve heard something over and over doesn’t make it true.</p>
<h3>Belabored metaphors</h3>
<p>I don’t know any other way to say this: metaphors only make your writing better if they’re good. Clichéd metaphors add nothing (how many 80s rock songs use the simile “cuts like a knife”?). But even worse is the forced, overly belabored metaphor that doesn’t even really make sense. Like this example from a Harvard Business Review article called “<a href="https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-dark-side-of-efficient-markets">The Dark Side of Efficient Markets</a>”:</p>
<blockquote><p>Those are indeed positive features. But every good thing is like a face caressed by the sun. The rays that light and warm the face automatically cast a dark shadow behind it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmmm. Nope.</p>
<p>Related issue: the <a href="http://www.jimcarlton.com/my_favorite_mixed_metaphors.htm">mixed metaphor</a>, which is usually also a mixed cliché.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="b031f50a-da69-4700-b8c5-853a32dda152" data-langcode="en">

<p>You can dive into a project or get experience in the trenches, but try not to do both at once. (What is it about trenches that confuses bad writers? <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/6194031/The-Lost-Symbol-and-The-Da-Vinci-Code-author-Dan-Browns-20-worst-sentences.html">Dan Brown</a> once described a character as “learning the ropes in the trenches.”)</p>
<h2>3 Ways to Make a First Draft Stronger</h2>
<p>OK, we’ve talked about things to avoid and cut out of your writing. Now let’s talk about what you can <em>add</em> to make it better. First draft a little lackluster? Try one of these tactics when revising.</p>
<h3>Add data, stats, authority</h3>
<p>Remember when I said not to make baseless assertions? Here’s how you fix that – go looking for <a href="/blog/ws/2015/07/14/marketing-data">research and data</a> to back them up. Stats are also great in an introduction to remind people why they should care about whatever you’re writing about.</p>
<p>For example, this post about <a href="/blog/ws/2017/08/18/welcome-email">how to write a welcome email</a> begins with some stats on welcome email performance: Since they have on average 4x the open rate and 5x the click-through rate of a standard email marketing campaign, of course you want to get them right.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="3d907951-4c62-4ce3-a294-c726f07d1f6c" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/confirmation-bias-toon.jpg" alt="what is confirmation bias" width="840" height="300" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>However, if you can’t find recent and authoritative research, skip it. And be wary of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2010/07/confirmation-bias-how-to-avoid-it/">confirmation bias</a> – the tendency to seek out sources that confirm what we already believe. It’s good to challenge your own assumptions, so if you find evidence that contradicts your argument, consider revising your argument.</p>
<h3>Add INTERESTING details</h3>
<p>Details add texture to your writing. But don’t let yourself off the hook too easy with boring, obvious details, or details that have no relevance to what’s happening.</p>
<p>The classic example of a lazy, pointless detail in fiction is “<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2010/06/somewhere_a_dog_barked.html">A dog barked in the distance</a>.” A dog is always barking in the distance. Who cares? And sorry to drag Dan Brown again, but check out this passage from <em>Angels and Demons</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Vittoria closed her eyes and breathed. Then she breathed again. And again. And again …</p></blockquote>
<p>You don’t say.</p>
<p>Details matter in nonfiction too. For example, if you’re writing a profile of a woman, don’t describe what she’s wearing just because she’s a woman. We also don’t need to know what she ordered for lunch.</p>
<p>So how do you add <em>interesting</em> details? Work on your powers of observation. Look for what is unusual, then filter for what is relevant. That’s the Sherlock Holmes way: Notice first, then analyze. Holmes doesn’t tell people everything he notices, just the details that illuminate the case.</p>
<h3>Teach people something</h3>
<p>It seems so simple. The whole point of nonfiction is to teach people something, right? And yet – so much writing fails to do this, and therefore isn’t interesting.</p>
<p>If you want to be a great writer, make sure you are always learning yourself, so you have something to teach people. Read widely, try new things, and share what you learn. This can take the form of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Including interesting facts</strong> – I have an insatiable appetite for <a href="http://www.cracked.com/pictofacts-405-20-mind-blowing-facts-that-seem-like-bu2121shit-but-arent/">lists of mind-blowing facts</a>. Start collecting fascinating knowledge and then you can drop it in as it comes up.</li>
</ul>

</article>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pointing people to more comprehensive resources</strong> – If you’re only able to touch on something that you have in-depth knowledge of, recommend your favorite articles, books, or films on the topic so people who are interested can learn more. (Want to get better at learning?! I love this book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-We-Learn-Surprising-Happens/dp/0812984293">How We Learn</a>.)</li>
<li><strong>Sharing life wisdom</strong> – Obviously, you need to have some life wisdom before you can share it – but this doesn’t always come from age. I love when people teach me something only they could know. What have you learned from your unusual or difficult experiences? What’s it like to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTOlrN5-UGU">found a successful startup – and then watch it fail</a>? What’s it like to <a href="http://www.everup.com/2015/11/23/scrabble-roxane-gay/">play competitive Scrabble</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re teaching people stuff, your writing becomes 10 times more interesting. Great ideas trump big words every time.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years Google has been making it clear that mobile-first is the way forward. The whole idea behind the mobile-first ethos is that traffic is moving to mobile devices from desktop, so websites should be built for mobile <em>first</em>, not as an afterthought.</p>
<p>However, as <a href="https://twitter.com/randfish/status/870712507916197889">Rand Fishkin has pointed out</a> multiple times, “mobile didn’t kill desktop, it just killed all our free time.”</p>

</div>
<p>Yep: I still spend at least 8 hours a day, 5 days a week (some weeks, more than that) in front of a desktop computer. And you can add all my mobile hours on top of that.</p>
<p>In any case, Google is hyper-focused on innovating in the mobile space to keep both Google users and AdWords advertisers happy.</p>
<p>Here are all the recent changes Google has made to the mobile SERP, including new (and lost) features in both the organic and paid results.</p>
<h2>Goodbye, Google Instant</h2>
<p>Google introduced instant results <a href="/blog/ws/2010/09/10/google-instant-changes-everything">way back in 2010</a>, a feature that loaded results as you were typing, rather than waiting for you to finish typing the query and hit enter. It seemed crazy at the time, but we all got used to it.</p>
<p>Check out the video below for an illustration of how the feature worked (“you won’t see it till you actually believe it!”):</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="videos" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.embed_video" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="bd5f1e89-8b71-4920-b62a-dcfb736c2e2e" data-langcode="en">

<div class="video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video"><iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ANVT56wlmTo?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
</div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Seven years later, Google is dropping the instant feature, implying that that the instant experience is less that satisfactory on mobile. <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-dropped-google-instant-search-279674#.WXioH3vhSps.twitter">A spokesperson told Search Engine Land</a>:</p>
<p>Many more of our searches happen on mobile, with very different input and interaction and screen constraints. With this in mind, we have decided to remove Google Instant, so we can focus on ways to make Search even faster and more fluid on all devices.</p>
<p>Note that <a href="/blog/ws/2012/03/27/google-search-suggestions">Google suggestions</a> aren’t going anywhere.</p>
<h2>Sitelink carousels</h2>
<p>Google has started displaying sitelinks (in both organic and paid results) in a <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-rolling-out-carousel-based-sitelinks-24197.html">carousel format</a>, allowing users to scroll through the sitelinks from left to right. (Carousel all the things!)</p>
<p>Here’s how it looks for organic sitelinks:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="a83e8038-615c-4c63-b087-c4b7d76cd823" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>And here’s how it looks for sitelink extensions in a paid search ad:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="aed32694-c84c-41c7-8e22-6ae5b0962163" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-ad-sitelink-carousel-feature-mobile-serp.png" alt="sitelinks on mobile serp" width="475" height="845" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>(In the past, carousels picked up a reputation as bad, user-unfriendly design, but <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/02/carousel-usage-exploration-on-mobile-e-commerce-websites/">the data doesn’t necessarily support that view</a>.)</p>
<h2>Showcase shopping ads</h2>
<p>Google’s new <a href="/blog/ws/2017/07/17/showcase-shopping-ads">showcase shopping ads</a> are another example of the carousel format in action. These new shopping ads are only available in the <a href="/blog/ws/2017/05/25/new-adwords-experience-features">new AdWords UI</a> and are eligible to show for broad, non-branded, commercial searches (such as “<a href="https://wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/styles/simple_image/public/images/google-adwords-showcase-shopping-ad.gif?Am0gDnCyg_6_1atMEAvQKUPLIeQ4TVvb&amp;itok=vsWDXIce">summer dresses</a>” or “new laptops”) above the paid search ads and alongside <a href="/blog/ws/2017/03/23/shopping-campaign-optimization">product shopping ads</a> at the very top of the SERP.</p>
<h2>Purchases on Google</h2>
<p>Also available (in beta) in the new AdWords UI: <a href="/blog/ws/2017/06/08/purchases-on-google">Purchases on Google</a>, which allows users to buy your products right from the SERP. (Currently, however, only users with an Android device and Google Wallet will have the option.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="652dc14d-589d-4f17-aa95-cec7a3f77120" data-langcode="en">

<h2>Call and other advanced bid adjustments</h2>
<p>Yesterday, Google announced that it is rolling out <a href="https://adwords.googleblog.com/2017/07/ramp-up-your-calls-with-call-bid.html">call bid adjustments</a>, “which allow you to control how often the call option appears with your search ads.” Google recommends using these for ads where calls are more important to your business than clicks to a landing page:</p>
<p>For example, if you’re a travel advertiser, you may see higher order values from calls because it can be easier to cross-sell rental cars, group tours and other vacation add-ons during a live conversation. Raise your call bid adjustments to show call extensions more frequently and drive more of these high-value call conversions.</p>
<p>This is yet another enhancement available in the <a href="/blog/ws/2017/05/25/new-adwords-experience-features">new AdWords interface</a>; according to Mark Irvine, it greatly simplifies the management of your bid adjustments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="a1da173f-f8ac-433c-b213-a79018032771" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/new-adwords-experience-advanced-bid-adj.png" alt="advanced bid adjustments" width="365" height="322" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Google’s early testers of call bid adjustments have seen increases in call volume paired with decreases in costs.</p>
<h2>New mobile extensions: Promotion and Message</h2>
<p>Google has recently released two new ad extensions that are only available on mobile devices: promotion extensions and message extensions.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2017/05/24/adwords-promotion-extension">Promotion extensions</a>, currently in beta, will show a noticeable price tag icon beneath your ad and highlight a sale on your website. Additionally, you can specify details around your promotion, such as whether it’s for a special occasion or holiday, any minimum order values, if it requires any promo code at checkout, as well as when the sales ends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="c4670510-1c10-443c-aff3-181838448727" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Extensions are known for increasing ad CTR, but WordStream clients have found particularly awesome performance with this new extension type:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="dc098bec-f467-4e57-9d19-95fd3ec4a888" data-langcode="en">

<p>Addicted to texting? <a href="/blog/ws/2016/10/19/adwords-message-extensions">Message extensions</a> provide a way for your prospects to send you a text message right from the mobile SERP:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="4362e20e-0a31-41af-9d12-270459eee0f8" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Five WordStream clients using this feature in beta saw CTR improvements from message extensions, averaging 50% higher CTR than the mobile ad alone.</p>
<h2>AMP ads and landing pages</h2>
<p>AMP, short for accelerated mobile pages, was introduced in 2016 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/2/12349524/google-amp-instant-articles-search-results-mobile-web-fragmentation">as a competitor to Facebook instant articles</a>. <a href="/blog/ws/2017/05/23/google-marketing-next">At Google Marketing Next in May</a>, Google announced the introduction of AMP ads and landing pages, claiming that display ads on AMP load up to 5x faster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="3a21873d-8310-485f-84b2-0cf16c122ded" data-langcode="en">

<p>Good news for the extremely impatient among us.</p>
<h2>Vertical-focused ads (home service, spa/salon)</h2>
<p>In 2017 Google has introduced or expanded access to several new mobile ad types that are available for specific industry verticals. Home services ads are <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-home-services-expands-philadelphia-279042">now available in five metro areas</a>, and <a href="/blog/ws/2017/02/17/salon-marketing-ideas">salons and spas</a> can now allow users to <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-adds-booking-spas-salons-search-maps-278857">book an appointment</a> through the Reserve with Google feature and well as via search and <a href="/blog/ws/2016/06/01/google-maps-local-search-ads">maps</a>.</p>
<h2>AdMob revamp</h2>
<p>If we’re talking mobile, we can’t forget about apps, can we? Also in 2017, Google announced a complete rebuild and relaunch of <a href="https://www.google.com/admob/announcements.html">AdMob</a>, its in-app ad platform. According to G:</p>
<p>AdMob was built to support the app ecosystem. With over 1 million apps across iOS and Android, AdMob has paid over $3.5 billion in ads revenue to developers. But there’s more we can do to help you succeed.</p>
<p>Today, we’re introducing a completely redesigned AdMob. Rebuilt from the ground up, AdMob is now simpler to use and delivers richer insights about your users’ in-app experiences.</p>
<h2>Do you care about mobile yet?</h2>
<p>These are just the changes Google is committed to – plenty of users report seeing various tests in the Google mobile results, <a href="https://www.ithinkmedia.co.uk/blog/mobile-serp-changes-google-2017-tests/">such as display URLs appearing ABOVE the ad headlines</a> instead of below and new filters in mobile map results. Then there&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="/blog/ws/2017/07/21/google-feed">THE FEED</a>,&#8221; currently available in the Google app but coming to Google.com soon.</p>

<p>In the past few weeks, we’ve shared new data revealing the most expensive keywords in several English-speaking countries around the world, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2017/06/27/most-expensive-keywords">The Most Expensive Keywords in the U.S</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2017/06/28/most-expensive-keywords-uk-edition">The Most Expensive Keywords in the U.K.</a></li>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2017/07/03/most-expensive-keywords-australia-edition">The Most Expensive Keywords in Australia</a></li>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2017/07/07/most-expensive-keywords-south-africa">The Most Expensive Keywords in South Africa</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Today, we bring you the top 25 keywords with the highest <a href="/cost-per-click">costs per click</a> (CPC’s) in Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords) for our neighbors to the north, Canada (O Canada!):</p>
<p>The Canadian data set turned up some interesting keywords on the high end of CPC’s – let’s take a look!</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="1392a2cb-db27-4f4b-bd8f-4ee5f43bc92a" data-langcode="en">

<h2>Everybody wants to go to Canada</h2>
<p>We all know that <a href="/blog/ws/2017/06/20/insurance-marketing-tactics">insurance</a>-related keywords are expensive everywhere, but there was a specific pocket of keywords in our Canadian data set: insurance for super visas (with an average CPC of $21.17 in Canadian dollars).</p>
<p>What the heck is a <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/supervisa.asp">super visa</a>? It’s a special visa for the parents and grandparents of Canadian citizens that allows those relatives to visit Canada for up to two years without having to renew their visa status. To secure a super visa, you need proof of health insurance that’s valid in Canada.</p>
<p>In November 2016, <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2016/11/09/move-canada-google-searches-surge-canadian-immigration-website-crashes/f7Wc9NvOa58ePrywGsQKuJ/story.html">the Boston Globe reported</a> that a surge in Google searches for “move to Canada” actually forced the Canadian immigration website to go down.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>No wonder these keywords are so expensive!</p>
<h2>Business is booming</h2>
<p>Maybe all those new immigrants are starting small businesses? Many of the top 25 costliest keywords in Canada are related to products and services that businesses need to operate. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Point of sale device</strong> – This popular and competitive keyword category includes keywords like “restaurant pos system” and “toast pos” (a brand that offers POS systems for <a href="/blog/ws/2017/07/06/instagram-marketing-for-restaurants">restaurants</a>), enabling hungry Canadians and tourists to pay up for poutine and maple syrup pie.</li>
</ul>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="1ca8d4f6-9bbe-4a1d-a0fe-ae735dbee442" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Mm, curdy</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calling software </strong>– Another top 5 keyword category in Canada, including examples like “telemarketing software” and “cold calling software.” It must be tough to work around those strict <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/ca/en/pages/risk/articles/canada-anti-spam-law-casl-faq.html">Canadian anti-spam laws</a> – better make sure your calling software is compliant!</li>
<li><strong>Merchant account </strong>– This is a type of bank account that allows you to accept credit card payments. Again, useful if you’re running a business (and like to get paid).</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll see more business keywords peppered throughout the list – “payment services,” “voice of the customer technology,” “business software” … do Canadians ever go on vacation?</p>
<p>They’re also polishing up their websites with “<a href="/blog/ws/2017/04/14/google-site-search-retirement">site search</a>,” creating <a href="/blog/ws/2015/01/05/marketing-videos">marketing videos</a> that need “stock music,” and looking for help with their “<a href="/social-media-marketing">social media marketing management</a>.”</p>
<h2>Buying a new home in Canada? You might need help with the plumbing</h2>
<p>“Plumber” and “hot water tank” searches were both among the most expensive in our Canadian data set – since “plumber” tends to be an emergency, “fix it now!” kind of search, those keywords are expensive everywhere. And in <a href="https://www.currentresults.com/Weather-Extremes/Canada/coldest-cities-winter.php">often-frigid Canada</a> (the average daily high in Winnipeg in winter is 15 degrees) it’s not surprising that people often have to replace their water heaters.</p>

</div>
<p>“Moving services” also cracked the top 20 – again, could be a sign that a lot more people are moving to Canada these days.</p>
<p>What about the Canadian keywords stood out to you?</p>
<h2>About the data</h2>
<p>Here’s how we got the list: We pulled all the data collected from anonymous <a href="/google-adwords">AdWords Performance Grader</a> reports across all industries between June 1, 2016 and June 12, 2017, then looked at the top 1000 most expensive keywords seen during that time period and categorized them by core intent.</p>
<p>For example, we lumped the keywords “bail bonds” and “bail bonds los angeles” into a single category since the core intent is the same. Likewise, keywords involving different types of lawyers (such as “malpractice lawyer” and “injury lawyer”) or insurance were grouped together. We used a similar methodology last time so as to avoid featuring too many specific long-tail or local keywords that wouldn’t have broad applicability to a large number of businesses. We separated distinct services (pest control vs. termites) as much as possible.</p>
<p>We also filtered out keywords with less than 100 clicks from our data set. We only looked at advertisers bidding in USD, GBP, AUD, CAD, and ZAR, and analyzed different currencies separately. We also eliminated non-English ads and duplicates (where both the keyword and the CPC were exactly the same) from that set. The results you’re reading about in this article are in CAD.</p>
<p>Shout out to everyone who helped compile, analyze, and illustrate the data: our data analyst Josh Brackett, our web team leader Meg Lister, and our designer Kate Lindsay.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the coming weeks, in celebration of our revamped <a href="/keywords">Free Keyword Tool</a> (currently in beta), we’ll be releasing new infographics that reveal the most expensive keywords in five different currencies. Yesterday we saw the <a href="/blog/ws/2017/06/27/most-expensive-keywords">most expensive keywords for the U.S. dollar</a>, and today we’re looking at the top 25 highest-CPC keywords in terms of the British pound.</p>

<p>There is certainly some overlap in this dataset and the U.S. version – as is probably the case <a href="/blog/ws/2015/07/06/average-cost-per-click">all around the world</a>, finance-related keywords are among the priciest. You gotta spend money to make money, as they say!</p>
<p>Note: Spending money in casinos is not statistically the best way to make money. It is, however, very popular in Britain.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Bit of harmless fun</em></p>
<p>According to my buddy Dan Shewan, who grew up in England:</p>
<blockquote><p>Culturally, Brits are much more relaxed about gambling than Americans. You guys may have Las Vegas and Atlantic City, but generally speaking, gambling is a cultural taboo in many parts of America. Not so in the U.K., where we’ll “<a href="http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/have-a-flutter">have a flutter</a>” on almost anything – the UEFA Champions League Final, disastrous snap elections, <a href="https://www.betminded.com/celebrity-death-pool-betting-14085.html">“dead pools” of celebrity death predictions</a>, you name it.</p>
<p>My countrymen’s appetite for wagers of questionable taste notwithstanding, it doesn’t surprise me that the most expensive keywords in this list are focused on gambling and online casinos. Online gambling is an obscenely profitable industry in Great Britain. Between April 2015 and March 2016, <a href="http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news-action-and-statistics/news/2016/New-figures-show-online-gambling-is-largest-gambling-sector-in-Britain.aspx">online gambling contributed $5.7 billion</a> (£4.5 billion) to the British economy alone, so it makes sense that the competition for and costs of these keywords is so high. It’s also very interesting to see that three of the four keywords in the Casino category are branded terms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here are a few more pockets of keywords that are especially pricy in the U.K. but didn’t turn up on the U.S. or other lists:</p>
<h2>Real Estate</h2>
<p>Says Dan:</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.K. has been experiencing a severe housing crisis for several years. Home ownership is <a href="http://www.redfernreview.org/">completely out of reach</a> for many people (especially those poor <a href="/blog/ws/2016/02/02/marketing-to-millennials">Millennials</a>), and public concern about the nation’s housing crisis is <a href="http://www.housing.org.uk/resource-library/browse/lyons-housing-commission-members-update-report-november-2016/">the highest it’s been in my lifetime</a>.</p>
<p>What’s most interesting to me about this keyword data is the specific terms that we see above. The keyword “equity release” is included in the Finance category, but <a href="http://www.which.co.uk/money/pensions-and-retirement/youre-retired-working-on-benefits-equity-release/guides/equity-release/what-is-equity-release">equity release</a> refers to a British financial instrument that allows homeowners over the age of 55 to access the equity they have tied up in their property either as a lump-sum payment or via a series of installments in the form of a secured loan. After years of failed government austerity policies, it’s a little sad – but not at all surprising – to see more people searching for ways to access this equity as inflation has outpaced wage growth.</p>
<p>The “we buy any house” and “selling my house quickly” keywords are also very revealing. After years of rising house prices and skyrocketing rents, Britain’s housing market is finally beginning to stagnate, which could account for the popularity of these search terms. There’s a strong urgency to both these keywords; for property buyers hoping to turn a quick profit and capitalize on sellers’ desperation, and for beleaguered homeowners eager to minimize depreciation and cut their losses through a quick sale.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also tells me “real estate” is a “very American phrase” that Brits don’t use! Sorry about that…</p>
<p>Examples of expensive keywords related to property include “we buy any house” (this is the name of a property company in the UK) and “estate agents Edinburgh.”</p>
<h2>Elderly Care</h2>
<p>Variations on “live-in care” almost broke the top 10. We didn’t see this specific set of keywords in the data set for any of the other currencies we looked at.</p>
<h2>Vehicle Tracking</h2>
<p>This is a GPS technology that allows you to track the location of a car – as one Amazon bestseller in the category puts it, “Whether it’s your child coming home from school, a suspicious spouse, a teenage driver, or valuable company assets,” vehicle tracking “keeps you up to date in real time.” Good news for you paranoid types!</p>
<h2>Coffee!</h2>
<p>Feeling strongly about coffee or the Oxford comma is no substitute for a personality trait (I can’t believe how often these are mentioned in Twitter bios or online dating profiles) but let it be known: I like coffee, and so do citizens of the United Kingdom.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="70bfd4bb-07ad-4263-b062-3d9fe8ed6571" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Keywords like “coffee machine rental” and “commercial coffee machines” made the list of highest CPC keywords, so we can be sure that U.K. businesses are doing their part to keep workers productive.</p>
<p>What keywords on the list stood out to you?</p>
<h2>About the data</h2>
<p>Here’s how we got the list: We pulled all the data collected from anonymous <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">AdWords Performance Grader</a> reports across all industries between June 1, 2016 and June 12, 2017, then looked at the top 1000 most expensive keywords seen during that time period and categorized them by core intent.</p>

<p>Way, way back in 2011, when the world was young and fidget spinners weren’t yet a thing, there was lore floating around in the search marketing world that “mesothelioma” was the most expensive keyword to bid on in Google Ads (at the time, known as Google AdWords), costing upwards of $100 per click. But was it true?</p>
<p>I had a little idea: What if we used data from our <a href="/keywords">Free Keyword Tool</a> to determine which keywords had the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/07/18/adwords-cost-per-click-too-high">highest costs per click</a> (or CPC’s) in Google AdWords, driving up <a href="/blog/ws/2017/07/05/online-advertising-costs">online advertising costs</a>?</p>
<p><a href="/articles/most-expensive-keywords">The infographic we created</a> based on that data is still one of our most popular and most linked to pages ever, but people often ask us for updated data.</p>
<p>Those people, and curious people everywhere, are in luck! We’ve completed a new, comprehensive analysis of keyword data for five different currencies in English-speaking countries (check out for the data for <a href="/blog/ws/2017/06/28/most-expensive-keywords-uk-edition">GBP</a>, <a href="/blog/ws/2017/07/10/highest-cpc-keywords-canada">CAD</a>, <a href="/blog/ws/2017/07/03/most-expensive-keywords-australia-edition">AUS</a>, and <a href="/blog/ws/2017/07/07/most-expensive-keywords-south-africa">ZAR</a> too!).</p>
<p>This time around, we determined the top 25 most expensive keywords (meaning these niche markets are super-competitive) along with their average CPC – and six years later, the results are substantially different!</p>
<p>Ready to see what the most expensive keywords are in 2017? Here we go:</p>

<h2>What makes these keywords so expensive?</h2>
<p>Generally, <a href="/blog/ws/2015/05/21/how-much-does-adwords-cost">AdWords keyword costs</a> get driven up in particular niches for one of the following reasons:</p>
<h3>People have a bad problem they really need to fix <em>now</em></h3>
<p>When people are desperate for help, they’re willing to spend more on services or products to get that problem solved. That means the companies doing the advertising can charge more for those services, and they can often achieve strong ROI on their ad spend even with high costs per click.</p>
<p>These spaces are also highly competitive, because people don’t necessarily spend a long time deciding where they’re going to shop – they want help NOW! For example, one of the top keywords in the “medical services” category is “emergency room near me.” If the advertiser is in <a href="/blog/ws/2017/05/23/google-marketing-next">the right place at the right time</a>, they can profit big. (Not that I think private companies should be profiting off people who need emergency care…)</p>
<p>Examples of keywords related to urgent problems include:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Bail bonds” at #2</li>
<li>“Lawyer” at #4</li>
<li>“Cash services &amp; payday loans” at #7</li>
<li>“Rehab” at #11</li>
<li>“Plumber” at #18</li>
<li>“Termites” at #19</li>
<li>“Pest control” at #20</li>
</ul>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/termites-most-expensive-keywords.jpg" alt="adwords expensive costs per click" width="600" height="450" /></div>
<h3>High-priced items or services</h3>
<p>Last time around, insurance-related keywords were at the very top of the list. According to our data, insurance is no longer king of the hill. That’s good news for marketers trying to <a href="/blog/ws/2017/06/20/insurance-marketing-tactics">drive leads in the insurance industry</a>, right? (Sort of – they’re still almost $50 per click on average. And there are outliers, like “malpractice insurance,” that can cost over $300 per click!)</p>
<p>Now, the most expensive keywords are in the category “business services” – <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/popular-keywords/business-keywords">business keywords</a> includes stuff like “data room” and “network security monitoring” – most likely because these services tend to be costly. Companies offering business services are willing to bid more per keyword because there’s so much to gain when a prospect does convert, whether it’s a single big purchase or a service with a high customer lifetime value.</p>
<p>Our last infographic showed that finance-related keywords (like loans keywords and mortgage keywords) are some of the most costly. You can see similar trends this year – see “asset management” at #5 ($49.86 per click) and “banking” at #23.</p>
<p>Law keywords are still way up there, and on average keywords related to legal services are even more expensive ($54.86 per click compared to $42.51 in 2011). This is part of why <a href="/blog/ws/2015/06/29/law-firm-marketing">marketing for law firms can be a challenge</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in one of these expensive niches, consider expanding onto the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/18/google-display-network-tips">display network</a>. When leveraged in conjunction with engaging creative (like the kind you can make with our free <a href="/smart-ads-creator">Smart Ads Creator</a>), the display network is a great place to get affordable clicks and balance out your budget.</p>
<h3>Fulfilling your hopes and dreams (and addictions)</h3>
<p>People will pay a lot to have their dreams come true. For some, those dreams are about getting an education. Y’all love learning and “degree” remains a very expensive keyword (too bad for those of you marketing in the <a href="/blog/ws/2016/08/15/higher-education-marketing">higher education industry</a>).</p>
<p>Once you get a degree, you can get a higher-paying job, and then reward yourself with a big vacation. <a href="/blog/ws/2017/04/19/travel-marketing-tips">Travel-related keywords</a> like “Hilton timeshare reviews” make an appearance this year at #13 on the list.</p>

<p>But people clicking on ads haven’t kicked all their bad habits – “casino” is way up there at #3 ($55.48 per click) and “online gambling” makes an appearance too, at #22. Who needs a Vegas vacation when the fun’s right there in your laptop?</p>
<p>You’re also talking to psychics and getting hair transplants. #questionablechoices</p>
<h3>The 25th most expensive keyword in Google AdWords is … Google AdWords?</h3>
<p>We weren’t expecting this one.</p>
<p><a href="http://searchengineland.com/why-do-people-google-google-understanding-user-data-to-measure-searcher-intent-10091">Sometimes people google “google,”</a> and sometimes people bid on “google adwords” in Google AdWords. (OK, we admit it. You’re looking at some of those people right now.)</p>
<h2>Want to know what keywords are popular (and how much they’ll cost) in YOUR industry?</h2>
<p>We can help with that!</p>
<p>Our newly revamped Free Keyword Tool (currently in beta release) has a cool feature that lets you filter your results by industry.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you want to find keywords related to cars, but you’re in the finance industry and you’re only interested in terms that are relevant to your business. Type in “cars” and select “Finance &amp; Banking” as your industry, and you’ll see results like this:</p>

<p>Your results include terms like “new car lease” and “new car incentives.” However, if you chose “Arts &amp; Entertainment” as your industry, you’d see results like “cars film” and “pixar cars”:</p>

<p>This can really help you to zero in on <em>only</em> the keywords that are going to help you build out your search marketing campaigns, filtering out irrelevant terms so you don’t have to weed through them yourself. You can filter your results by 24 different industries.</p>
