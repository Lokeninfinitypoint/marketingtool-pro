<p>The majority of people in the United States feel underrepresented in media and marketing campaigns, and there is more interest in what brands are doing to address this issue given the social changes that are sweeping the nation. Because of this, diversity marketing is becoming a cornerstone through recognizing and actively including the many different groups of people that come into contact with ad campaigns.</p>

<p>Although the words ‘inclusion’ and ‘diversity’ create the image of an umbrella covering a wide audience, efforts to diversify marketing strategies must be fine-tuned to target very specific audiences and meet them in the places where they will come into contact with your brand. There are many ways to help your brand begin to effectively embrace the diversity that has gone unnoticed and underappreciated. In this post, we’ll cover three of them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Diversify your team</li>
<li>Perform market research</li>
<li>Let your customers’ voices be heard</li>
</ol>
<h2>3 ways to incorporate diversity into your marketing strategies</h2>
<p>It has become increasingly important that a company is <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/09/20/ethical-marketing">socially aware</a> and willing to include minorities and other groups of people that have, in the past, not typically been included in advertising. This is especially true as online <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business">marketing through social media</a> continues to become more streamlined in targeting specific (and potentially sensitive) demographics such as weight and marital status.</p>
<p>Creating visibility and representation not only has a major impact on how potential clients see a company when choosing where to invest their money, but it also is the key to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/19/conversion-rate-benchmarks">higher conversion rates</a>.</p>
<p>Here are three ways to create visibility and representation within your brand.</p>
<h3>1. Start by diversifying your team</h3>
<p>Before we get into how to diversify your team, let&#8217;s start out with some stats behind it.</p>
<p><strong>White males dominate the workforce</strong></p>
<p>Business in the United States is largely dominated by Caucasian males, which bars many women and people of color from making a comparable income.</p>

<p><strong>Female-owned businesses are taking longer to recover from the pandemic</strong></p>
<p>This has become even worse since the pandemic hit. According to Freshbooks’ most recent Women in the Independent Workforce survey, industries with predominantly female-owned businesses have been among the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/02/new-data-google-ads-benchmarks-during-covid-19">hardest hit by COVID-19</a>, to the point that businesses owned by women are <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/press/data-research/women-owned-businesses-in-the-u-s-facing-slower-recovery"><strong>taking three times as long</strong></a>, on average, to financially recover when compared to businesses owned by men.</p>

<div class="column">
<p>The best way to ensure that your audiences see themselves reflected in your brand is by hiring a team that represents your audience. In order to relate to and understand what consumers are looking for, you have to have a team that can take their own life experience and craft messaging and imagery that is meaningful to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/25/hyperlocal-marketing">hyper-specific demographics</a>. Your audience will naturally gravitate towards people who believe, think and look like them, thereby naturally diversifying your brand’s following.</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>A diverse team attracts a diverse following, and a diverse following can give you even more insights and ideas to strengthen your initiatives.</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Diversity is a win-win</strong></p>
<p>Having a diverse marketing team can help your brand gain valuable insight into the needs of those who you are trying to reach which would otherwise be non-existent. In addition, by having a more dynamic group of people working together, creativity and expansion can unfold in a manner that is not available when you have a team that conforms to similar backgrounds and experiences.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://blog.bonus.ly/diversity-inclusion-statistics">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>This also allows brands to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/28/resilient-digital-agencies-2020">build resilience and adaptability</a> in a global market that sometimes changes in the blink of an eye. The more perspectives you include in your marketing strategy, the more visibility you can achieve.</p>
<p>As you can see, diversifying your team is not only favored by customers but also strengthens various aspects of your business.</p>

<h3><span lang="EN">2. Gather your data (and listen to it!)</span></h3>
<p>Market research and data analytics allow you to observe positive, negative, and neutral responses to advertising and identify marketing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/03/07/common-agency-mistakes">pitfalls</a> so you can create a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/12/23/humanize-brand">relatable marketing campaign</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Study the data with an unbiased eye</strong></p>
<p>The importance of thorough market research is only increasing as <a href="/blog/ws/2020/12/21/how-brands-are-embracing-social-change">social awareness</a> spreads. If you intend to connect to people with specific beliefs and backgrounds, you must build <a href="/blog/ws/2021/01/04/best-marketing-strategies-2021">relevant marketing strategies</a>, and the only way to do this is to study the data with an unbiased eye.</p>

<p><strong>Get out of your comfort zone</strong></p>
<p>The pandemic has challenged the norm when it comes to not only how and where we do business, but it’s also given us a more global perspective and shown us how important it is to work together towards creating new solutions. There is really no business as usual for any marketing strategy.</p>
<p>Avoid ignoring new information in favor of conventional methods of marketing. This is your time to stand out. Many missteps can be averted simply by taking an honest <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-marketing-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">look at the right data</a> and asking questions about the types of people you intend to reach. You may need to adjust your<a href="/blog/ws/2015/09/23/buyer-personas"> customer personas</a> in some cases.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Do not ignore new information in favor of conventional methods of marketing—now is your time to stand out.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Approach your audience directly</strong></p>
<p>Not only should you be asking questions about your<a href="/blog/ws/2014/09/18/beginners-guide-to-target-markets"> target audience</a>, but you should also be asking them questions directly. Without conducting <a href="/blog/ws/2014/11/10/best-online-survey-tools">surveys</a>, focus groups, and field trials that include individuals from your diverse target market, <a href="/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">brand messaging </a>will fall short and may even be harmful. Brands have to go directly to the source of hyper-specific demographics in order to glean meaningful information from the data being collected.</p>
<h3><span lang="EN">3. Focus on your audience’s perception of your brand</span></h3>
<p>A brand could choose all the right <a href="/blog/ws/2015/02/26/influencer-marketing">influencers</a> and imagery and still lose credibility with audiences by choosing inauthentic and exclusive messaging. The art of incorporating <a href="/blog/ws/2020/11/5/accessibility-inclusivity-advertising">inclusivity</a> into your brand requires confronting your own traditional messaging by actively creating a foothold for minority groups.</p>
<p>Instead of adapting current brand messaging, marketing agencies should choose <a href="https://www.twine.net/blog/freelance-portfolios-effective-graphic-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organic messaging and imagery</a> that is created to be welcoming, target-specific, and attractive.</p>

<p>Consumers are no longer fooled by claims to be transparent or diverse. Major industries such as tech, healthcare, and fintech still <a href="https://tokenist.com/fintech-is-sorely-behind-in-female-participation-but-for-how-long/">struggle with creating inclusive atmospheres</a> in their workplaces and this shows through <a href="/blog/ws/2017/10/24/subliminal-advertising">subliminally</a> in their marketing assets. A brand must also be perceived as inclusive by its audience.</p>
<p>To be perceived as authentic, you must actually be authentic, and the truth is agencies may have to do some soul searching and redefine what diversity means from a very basic standpoint.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Claiming to be diverse and inclusive does not mean your brand will be perceived as such by your audience.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Practices to become more authentic and inclusive start with the hiring process, flow into the work environment and business policies, are squeezed out through branding, and perceived by audiences through marketing and ad campaigns.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, let the voices of your potential and existing customers be heard. Let their language be infused into yours, so you can truly represent them and <a href="/blog/ws/2021/03/22/stand-out-from-competitors-on-google">stand apart from your competitors</a>. Making space for diversity means not just listening, but also building an awareness based on their feedback that can help your brand produce messaging that is relatable and authentic.</p>
<h2>Diversity in marketing is more important than ever</h2>
<p>The problems with gender and racial income disparity have only been magnified by the economic and social impact of the pandemic. Potential customers are becoming increasingly aware of the social challenges that people of all sorts of backgrounds, philosophies, and ethnicities are facing.</p>

<p>It is valuable to people that they not only recognize themselves represented in advertising, but also that they see a variety of people groups reflected as well. Embracing the diversity of consumers will impact marketing from now on, and staying on the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/30/social-media-advertising-tips">cutting edge of advertising</a> with this in mind will allow audiences to see how brands are leading the way toward awareness and inclusivity.</p>

<p>Rapid cultural shifts and the propagation of media technologies have rendered many tried-and-true marketing strategies obsolete. These shifts are constant and picking up speed drastically. The global village (or the interconnection of the globe through telecommunications) has made us all much more aware of people and cultures distant from our own, and have also shone a spotlight on the elements of our own society that have been virtually invisible for much of history.</p>

<p>These advancements have made marketing inseparable from technology, which is itself closely knit with modern culture. Facebook has, over the years, made its algorithm more culture-based by prioritizing content and ads that create positive interaction, discussion, direct sharing, and so on. Therefore, selling ideas has become more important in marketing than selling an actual product, which has given the advertising industry more power to influence culture and create cultural change.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll discuss how your business can honor and implement cultural shifts in your marketing through social responsibility, social listening, segmentation, and more.</p>
<h2>1. Advocate for inclusivity, accessibility, and social responsibility</h2>
<p>Making the distant and the sidelined more visible and integrated is a particular culture shift that has made <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/5/accessibility-inclusivity-advertising">implementing accessibility and inclusivity</a> into advertising incredibly important. Not only does aligning with<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/22/cause-based-marketing"> this cause</a> it increase your reach by giving you visibility among people living with various disabilities—and help your brand stand out among traditionally underrepresented groups—it’s also a significant part of the modern culture that values acceptance. Additionally, it is often simply considered the right thing to do.</p>

<p>As more millennials enter the business world and stock markets, socially responsible investing has been rapidly rising in the US since the mid-nineties with <a href="https://tokenist.com/investing/what-is-socially-responsible-investing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one out of every four dollars invested</a>— approximately $12 trillion—has been allocated to sustainable strategies. This number continues to gain traction as socially responsible investors gain more power and authority to demand more transparency, and more socially responsible choices being made within companies when it comes to making marketing and advertising decisions.</p>

<h3>2. Practice social listening to understand your audiences</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">A major shift that we have all been subjected to this year was brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Its impact has been immediate and damaging, and believing that it will not have a lasting impact <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/voices/covid-19-will-leave-lasting-economic-scars-around-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would be foolish</a>.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Apart from the huge move online, it has also fundamentally changed the way we communicate as collective teams, which has had a major impact on developing post-pandemic marketing strategies to adjust and navigate our businesses through a post-COVID world. This new reality will require a <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/18/post-covid-19-customers">full understanding of your post-COVID target audience</a>.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">One of the silver linings of the pandemic is that because of the massive move online, the opportunities for turning a <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/07/agency-profitability-metrics">higher profit</a> with your site are higher than it ever has been before. A whopping <a href="https://zyro.com/blog/profitable-website-ideas/">65% of internet users</a> have been fully reliant on online purchases this year, and that number is only expected to grow next year. Data collected through social media and customer surveys are extensive and reliable methods of gaining a better understanding of these customers. </span></p>
<p>But on the other hand, raw data can only tell you so much. This is where <a href="/blog/ws/2021/03/25/social-listening-boolean-search">social listening</a> can play a crucial role. Simply put, <a href="/blog/ws/2018/07/20/social-listening">social listening</a> represents monitoring what people are saying about your brand online. It helps you gauge the customers’ sentiment towards it, identify and prevent a crisis before it fully forms, and jump on opportunities as soon as they arise.</p>
<p>Netflix UK used social listening to figure out how the <a href="https://resources.audiense.com/blog/understanding-cultural-shifts-by-enriching-social-listening-with-audience-intelligence-netflix-uk-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener">segmentation of their customer base has changed</a> in 2020—which is something that has immense ramifications on existing marketing strategies. Social media marketing is now considered best used to engage audiences and nurture their trust and connection while the actual sales are best achieved through other means. This however presents the problem of your marketing teams acting too swiftly and overzealously.</p>

</div>
<p><span lang="EN">While a quick reaction to a rising trend or problem is usually beneficial, it can also compromise the brand image. Social listening should not be utilized without thought and plan. This goes hand-in-hand with the fact that culture can’t be thought of only as German, Canadian, Ethiopian, and Chinese. Cultures can differ wildly within the same region between professions, confessions, and hobbies—all of them merit consideration when coming up with a culturally conscious marketing strategy.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Remember, a culture that deeply connects to your brand image reflects your own corporate culture. Getting cross-cultural management right from the start can <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/04/build-a-culture-that-aligns-with-peoples-values">translate to sales and overall success</a> later down the line. This doesn’t mean that it should never be altered based on information collected, however, it should always be a carefully considered move and not a knee-jerk reaction.</span></p>

<h3>2. Personalize content through customer segmentation</h3>
<p>We have already established that social media campaigns should mostly be directed at <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/tips-to-help-your-business-build-a-sense-of-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community-building </a>rather than actual sales. On the other hand, <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/21/promotional-email-examples">email advertising</a> presents itself as an excellent channel for just that while offering a similar community vibe.</p>
<p>Email marketing can net immense returns for a relatively small investment especially when paired with the ability to personalize the message using information gained through social listening. However, this can easily turn from simple to tricky, depending on the size of your organization.</p>
<p>It is reasonable to assume that for most businesses this is another area in which <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/01/automated-email-marketing">automation</a> is necessary. This might appear daunting as the idea of automation seems to defeat the idea of personalized marketing, but it’s possible that the two strategies can marry together to create seamless, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">personal email marketing experiences</a> for customers.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="2b7378e8-ca48-47e9-80fd-d2f24e95ea95" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adjust20to20social20change20in20markteing20personalized20automated20newsletters-1.png" alt="adjust to social change in markteing personalized automated newsletters" width="800" height="370" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>An automated, yet personalized email from the Nir &amp; Far email newsletter.</em></p>
<p>Another thing to touch upon is the importance of audience <a href="/blog/ws/2016/05/13/targeted-email-marketing-strategies">segmentation</a>. In the simplest terms, there is very little point in sending a snowmobile ad to someone living in the tropics—<a href="/blog/ws/2017/08/28/behavioral-segmentation">segmenting</a> your customers between those that could be interested in this product, and those that almost certainly aren’t is key to retaining subscribers and targeting the right audience.</p>
<p><span lang="EN"><a href="/blog/ws/2017/06/29/email-marketing-statistics">Email marketing</a> services can be an excellent tool for direct marketing of this type, offering a wide range of free and paid features including customer segmentation so different emails can be sent based on specific factors like culture. However, email segmentation can come with a hefty investment, with Mailchimp in particular <a href="https://hostingdata.co.uk/best-email-marketing-service/#footable_2762:~:text=This%20starts%20at%20%C2%A3250%2Fmonth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charging $250 per month</a> for this feature to be unlocked and other services charging similar prices. </span></p>
<p>The combination of <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business">social media marketing</a> and<a href="/blog/ws/2019/01/03/email-marketing-best-practices"> email marketin</a>g is a form of <a href="/blog/ws/2013/10/15/multi-channel-marketing">cross-channel marketing</a>, which enables you to <a href="https://www.jotform.com/blog/implementing-cross-channel-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connect with audiences across multiple channels</a> and deliver relevant and personalized content. This marketing strategy, when used with social listening data, can create staggering results such as customer retention, increased sales, and brand loyalty.</p>
<h2>Stay on top of cultural trends so you can market appropriately</h2>
<p>At its core, social listening is about staying ahead of the curve and improving customer relations. Both of these things, while providing a great deal of value, require data-juggling that can prove difficult. While smaller operations could handle this with relative ease, things can get out of hand quickly.</p>
<p>Customer relationship management (CRM) software can be a solution for businesses <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/09/crm-for-small-business">with multiple tools</a> to support them in handling and managing interactions with different audiences. Social listening isn’t just about collecting information, it is about organizing it in such a way that helps you better understand, react, and plan for your future marketing campaigns.</p>

<p>Beginning any startup business is daunting, exhausting, and overwhelming—even if you feel like you have the best product in its respective market and have already secured funding. Complicating things is the high new number of startups that are created each year, which means more noise and fluff on the market.</p>
<p>Indeed, statistics show that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/01/12/startup-marketing">90% of startups fail</a> within the first year and only 50% of startups actually make it to their fifth year. Standing out in a saturated market is essential for achieving startup success.</p>

<p>Luckily, there are several simple and yet effective strategies you can implement to make sure your startup can stand out above the rest, attract ideal clients, and build authority. To help you out, we’ve compiled six different ways you can follow to ensure your startup is cutting through the noise and is being seen and heard:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide quick and easy delivery methods</li>
<li>Build an effective content strategy</li>
<li>Always keep track of your KPIs</li>
<li>Be socially responsible</li>
<li>Enhance website performance</li>
<li>Identify gaps in your performance</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to stand apart from the noisy startup crowd</h2>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2021/03/22/stand-out-from-competitors-on-google">Standing out</a> in a saturated market isn&#8217;t about being the loudest or brightest business in the crowd. To stand apart from the rest, everything you do needs to stand apart, even your work behind the scenes. These six tips to follow will show you that it&#8217;s not just about customer service, but also about your partnerships, website performance, internal goal setting and measuring, adherence to your values, relationship to your competitors, and more.</p>
<h3>1. Provide quick &amp; easy delivery methods</h3>
<p>Every major company and big brands started from somewhere, including giants such as Google and Amazon. Amazon started as a small startup back in 1994 but made an impression to spring themselves to the forefront of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/04/02/retail-marketing">online retailers</a>.</p>
<p>How? One of the many strategies they employed was their promise of delivery within two days through Amazon Prime. Amazon has also made future promises to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/20/tech/amazon-robots-shipping/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deliver products to its customers in 30 minutes</a> using drones in the near future.</p>
<p>Consumers love speed and reliability—especially when they have ordered online. Applying this to your own delivery strategy can make the difference between a <a href="/blog/ws/2017/04/04/nurture-marketing">potential lead choosing your brand </a>over one that doesn’t offer quick and reliable delivery.</p>
<h3>2. Build an effective content marketing strategy</h3>
<p>One of the most important pages on your website will be your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/01/27/increase-blog-traffic">blog</a>. Not only does content <a href="/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">drive organic traffic to your website</a>, but it also helps you build trust and connection with your target audience and gives you an opportunity to be a ‘thought leader’ in your industry, which assists you when developing and building relationships with networks.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/12/28/content-marketing-advice">content marketing</a> isn’t just about writing content. You need to develop an effective content marketing strategy that is less about writing. A successful content marketing strategy for startups has to <a href="https://getcodeless.com/content-marketing-for-startups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">include a number of processes</a> that are focused on customer acquisition, SEO rankings, forming partnerships and <a href="/blog/ws/2020/12/10/link-building-secrets">building high-quality backlinks</a>.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>When it comes to creating content, originality and creativity stands out against boring and fluffy stories that are being told over and over again. Consider marketing to be more of an art than a science. Using your <a href="/blog/ws/2015/12/23/humanize-brand">unique voice</a>, sense of humor to communicate who you are and what you do can sculpt the foundations of your brand and allow your audience to get to know you and remember you.</p>
<h3>3. Always keep track of your KPIs</h3>
<p>Even the best thought-out <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/24/best-instagram-marketing-campaigns">marketing campaign</a> can fail. If this happens, it can be devastating, especially if mass amounts of time, energy, and money were invested. But the key is to not give up, learn from the mistakes, and to keep trying new and improved ideas.</p>
<p>Keeping a close watch on <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/why-is-it-important-companies-have-competitors/">your competitors</a> and their successes and failures can not only provide you with some much-needed reassurance but also offer an opportunity for you to notice and learn about the industry you are targeting, what works for them and what doesn’t.</p>
<p>As well as keeping a close eye on your competitors, measuring the performance of campaigns by <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/17/content-marketing-kpis">tracking certain KPIs can also be a crucial indicator</a> of what is going right and where you are going wrong. Measuring KPIs (like those from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-for-startups">Google Ads</a>) and responding to them effectively can support increased future engagement, brand awareness, conversations, and generate more leads in the long run.</p>

<h3>4. Be socially responsible</h3>
<p>The modern cultural climate <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191002005697/en/Consumers-Expect-the-Brands-they-Support-to-be-Socially-Responsible" target="_blank" rel="noopener">values social responsibility</a>. Many people turn to startups and small businesses because they are weary of big brands that have numerous stains on their sustainability track records &#8211; a lack of environmental awareness, poor working conditions, cruel testing on animals, and abusing human rights in developing nations are some of the issues eco-conscious consumers want to eradicate.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">Informing ideal audiences that your small startup is socially responsible and aware can help you gain trust, connection, and authenticity with ideal clients who are actively looking for these elements when choosing to buy from a brand.</span></p>

</article>
</div>
<h3>5. Enhance website performance</h3>
<p>In the age of speed and reliability, it’s not just delivery times that consumers want immediately. Gone are the days where we had to wait for our computers to connect and load the internet.</p>
<p>We now have extremely high expectations for website loading speeds (and more—<a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/19/core-web-vitals-google-page-experience-update">learn about Core Web Vitals here</a>—and most people are not willing to wait around. These high expectations have resulted in users feeling frustrated if there is even a minimal connection speed delay. As an example, a delay of just one second <a href="https://bestwebhostingaustralia.org/how-to-reduce-loading-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leads to a 7% decrease</a> in website engagement on average. Remember that with visitors, page <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/22/google-page-speed">loading speed</a> is their first experience with your brand so expecting them to wait for the website to load is a sure way of losing them as readers and customers.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2020/12/08/lazy-loading-seo">Lazy loading</a> is a page speed optimization technique that <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-lazy-loading/">enhances website performance</a> and can make a huge difference to your website’s bounce rates. It ensures that the most important parts of your website are loaded quickly, while the non-critical pages that require more time to load are loaded while the viewer is exploring the essential parts.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="71bc232f-411b-472d-9f9a-3fe1e18751a9" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/what-is-lazy-loading-conversion-rate-vs-page-speed_0-1.png" alt="What is lazy loading Conversion Rates drop as page speed increases" width="593" height="413" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Not all websites need to employ lazy loading as there are many other ways to make your website faster, but they are all worth considering as keeping the attention of customers, especially early on, is paramount.</p>
<h3>6. Identify gaps in your industry</h3>
<p>Despite the fact that the <a href="/blog/ws/2019/12/18/ecommerce-marketing-strategies">ecommerce</a> market is both bustling and saturated, there are often cohorts of consumers that still don’t feel like their needs or wants are being met. Identifying these gaps in the market and meeting the specific needs of these cohorts is an excellent way of representing a <a href="/blog/ws/2014/10/28/niche-marketing">niche market</a> and boosting your revenue significantly.</p>
<p>Learning how to identify a starving crowd and the problems they face is the first step in creating a business that serves them. Another strategy is to identify the shortcomings of your competitors and their products and see where your brand and products can meet these gaps in the market.</p>
<h2>Stay unique and seek out opportunities to stand out</h2>
<p>When it comes to standing out in a saturated crowd, it’s about being unique enough for overwhelmed consumers to find and remember you. We have mentioned only but a few strategies to help you achieve this. They include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide quick and easy delivery methods</li>
<li>Build an effective content strategy</li>
<li>Always keep track of your KPIs</li>
<li>Be socially responsible</li>
<li>Enhance website performance</li>
<li>Identify gaps in your performance</li>
</ol>
<p>When positioning and launching your startup, it&#8217;s essential to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/14/top-digital-marketing-stories-2020">stay on top of news and trends</a> that are important to know when running a business and always be open to learning and growing from your competitors and industry as a whole.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The pandemic has disproportionately affected Black-owned businesses in the U.S. Here are four concrete ways to help support Black businesses in your community, plus why it matters.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By now, everyone knows that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/13/covid-19-response" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Covid-19 is decimating small businesses</a> across the country; fewer are aware that the negative impact of the pandemic has fallen disproportionately on Black businesses. If you’re a Black business owner, that might not come as news, but for many, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/18/us/coronavirus-black-owned-small-business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the recent New York Times analysis</a> of the impact of Covid-19 on Black businesses came as a real shock.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="align-center" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/black-owned-businesses-pandmic-impact.png" alt="Everyone knows that Covid-19 is decimating small businesses across the country; fewer are aware that the negative impact of the pandemic has fallen disproportionately on Black businesses." data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="7d2771de-99ad-4e01-9021-fa84ec485d32" /></p>
<p>That analysis also acted as something of a wake-up call. Look just a little deeper than the headline figures, as we&#8217;ll do in this article, and you&#8217;ll see that the analysis reveals some troubling aspects of the way that we in America do business. Specifically, it shows that the kind of community-based commerce that our country was founded on is in danger of disappearing; instead of buying goods from community stores, shoppers now increasingly buy them online, often from giant corporations like Amazon.</p>
<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll take a closer look at why Black-owned businesses have been hit so hard by the pandemic, how they can survive, and what we can do to help. And, if you’re a business owner yourself, we’ll share some resources for how you can bring more attention to your business and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/10/boost-holiday-sales-and-revenue"><u>drive more sales this holiday season</u></a>.</p>
<h2>Unbalanced effects</h2>
<p>First, let&#8217;s take a look at how the pandemic has affected Black business owners. The figures make for sobering reading. In research reported in the NYT, more than 40%of Black business owners reported they weren’t working in April – that is, during the time when businesses were feeling the worst of the pandemic’s economic consequences. Only 17% of white small business owners said the same. These figures come from <a href="https://siepr.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/20-022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an analysis</a> of government data by Robert Fairlie of the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="align-center" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/support20black20owned20businesses.jpg" alt="Black-owned businesses have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus pandemic, making it even more important to support them." data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="59b9a859-0011-4a92-a56a-8b7cbffaa3bb" /></p>
<p>The Times article goes on to sum up the ways in which Covid-19 has disproportionately affected Black businesses, and how this builds on discrimination that these same businesses already face. For example, Black people are <a href="https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than twice as likely</a> as other Americans to die of the coronavirus, and they are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/03/us/minneapolis-police-use-of-force.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much more likely</a> to be victims of police violence.</p>
<p>From the perspective of someone who works in tech, however, there are also some very interesting implications of these data. <a href="https://www.vendasta.com/blog/the-impact-of-covid-19-on-the-digital-advertising-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Look a little deeper</a>, and you&#8217;ll see that the primary way in which struggling Black businesses are seeking to weather this storm is through cutting back on their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">social media marketing</a> and their budgets for other digital marketing efforts. This makes their businesses <strong>less visible</strong> and <strong>less competitive</strong> online.</p>
<h2>The shift to digital retail</h2>
<p>Take even a quick look at the way that people in America shop now, and you&#8217;ll immediately see that technology has transformed the very basis of retail in our country. Voice search accounted for <a href="https://brainstation.io/career-guides/how-to-become-an-seo-specialist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one in five searches</a> as long ago as 2016 according to Google, and most people will visit one of the huge online marketplaces (Amazon, mainly) to look for items to purchase.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="align-center" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/amazon-searches-vs-google-searches.png" alt="Voice search accounted for one in five searches as long ago as 2016 according to Google, and most people will visit one of the huge online marketplaces (Amazon, mainly) to look for items to purchase." data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="4e85fb97-80e0-4b61-be6f-7c6991f1c1ea" /></p>
<p>This means that businesses with less technological expertise or smaller budgets are falling further behind those that can afford to spend big on digital advertising. And this, in turn, means that some Black businesses are falling behind their white-owned counterparts in an environment where consumers are moving all their spending online.</p>
<p>In 2020, white-owned businesses <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/03/facebook-ad-discrimination/518718/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still dominate online advertising</a>, and even in niche areas like payment systems, Black-owned businesses tend to offer fewer options than their white-owned counterparts.</p>
<p>All of these factors affect Black business owners disproportionately. But what is to be done?</p>
<h2>4 ways to support Black-owned businesses (or promote your own)</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s get one thing out of the way first. Many of the recent guides that purport to tell people how they <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-support-black-owned-businesses-according-to-black-entrepreneurs-2020-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can support their local Black-owned businesses</a> start by telling them to look online for Black-owned versions of their favorite stores. In my opinion, this doesn’t go far enough. Which brings me to my first point…</p>
<h3>1. Embrace a radical shift in the way you shop</h3>
<p>The fact is that many Black businesses, and especially the small, community-focused businesses that are most at risk from the current economic storm, do not have websites. This is, in fact, a large part of the reason why they are so vulnerable: <a href="https://hostingcanada.org/best-ecommerce-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research shows that 48% of people</a> start to search for a product on online marketplaces before looking for it on their street.</p>
<p>In practice, this means that supporting your local, Black-owned businesses means a more radical shift than trying to find a Black-owned Amazon. It requires taking responsibility for all of your purchases and viewing each as a political act.</p>
<p>In other words: to keep these businesses solvent, we will have to change the way we shop. Instead of relying on Amazon searches, we&#8217;re going to have to take the time to search for small businesses within our own communities, and consciously choose to make purchases from them instead.</p>

<h3>2. Set goals and track your purchases from Black-owned stores</h3>
<p>There are plenty of tools that can help you make this shift. The <a href="https://myblackreceipt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My Black Receipt</a> campaign became popular because people were tired of the lack of support for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/where-to-find-black-owned-b2b-business-partners-vendors-contractors-2020-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black-owned businesses</a>. You can use it to keep track of how many of your purchases are made in Black-owned stores.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="align-center" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/my-black-receipt.png" alt="The My Black Receipt campaign became popular because people were tired of the lack of support for Black-owned businesses.

<p>There are also sites that will help you to make a spending commitment: You can check out <a href="https://blog.helloalice.com/black-owned-business-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HelloAlice&#8217;s database of Black-owned businesses</a> across the US or <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=2133" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charity Navigator&#8217;s list of vetted charities and nonprofits</a> dedicated to women&#8217;s health, education, and social services.</p>
<h3>3. Spread the word about your favorite Black-owned brands</h3>
<p>If you are making purchases from these businesses, you should also take a moment to help them out where you can make a difference: Build up their <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/why-good-online-reputation-is-important/"><u>online reputation</u></a> by sharing your experience on social media, leaving a review, and generally drawing people&#8217;s attention to a store that might have little (or no) online presence. Word of mouth will bring them more business and sales and help them <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/17/businesses-likely-to-thrive-post-covid">thrive</a>.</p>
<h3>4. Participate in #BlackOwnedFriday</h3>
<p>In May of 2020, there was a huge surge in search interest for Black-owned businesses, and this interest has remained elevated in the following months.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="align-center" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/black-owned-business-search-volume.png" alt="In May of 2020, there was a huge surge in search interest for Black-owned businesses, and this interest has remained elevated in the following months. " data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="e54f0200-5ffb-4e6c-8bef-62fd63a398f6" /></p>
<p>Google took notice. #BlackOwnedFriday is a Google-led initiative, in partnership with the <a href="https://usblackchambers.org/">US Black Chambers, Inc.</a>, to encourage American consumers to support Black businesses during the 2020 holiday shopping season. Here’s how you can get involved:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you’re a shopper,</strong> check out <a href="https://smallbusiness.withgoogle.com/blackowned#!">these resources from Google</a> and find a new favorite business to support. Tell your friends about these resources and encourage them to get involved. Use the hashtag to promote the effort on your social media accounts.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="align-center" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/support-black-owned-businesses-badge.png" alt="If you're a Black business owner, add Google's Black Business Owner badge to your Google My Business listing and your website." data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="042385a4-0bbd-4b26-8d2b-2cf204ba5f41" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you’re a Black business owner yourself, </strong><a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/black-owned.pdf">f</a><a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/black-owned.pdf">ollow these simple steps to add the Black-owned business badge to your website</a>. Google is also offering <a href="https://smallbusiness.withgoogle.com/holiday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free resources for small businesses</a> who want to improve their <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/digital-marketing/how-to-get-noticed-with-a-stand-out-online-presence/">online presence</a> ahead of the holiday shopping rush.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The bottom line</h2>
<p>If we are all willing to take responsibility for our actions, we might yet save the local, Black-owned community store from destruction. Let’s all do our part this year and commit to changing the way we shop forever. In sum, here are the top four ways you can support the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/22/cause-based-marketing">cause</a> of Black-owned businesses in your community:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shift your mindset when it comes to where and how you buy</li>
<li>Use tools to track your purchases from Black-owned businesses</li>
<li>Support your favorite Black businesses with reviews and word of mouth</li>
<li>Participate in the #BlackOwnedFriday initiative</li>

<p><span lang="EN">In particular, our first instinct is to start questioning the worth of our marketing budget. However, what we fail to realize is that companies who curtail their marketing efforts during an economic downturn will actually end up jeopardizing their long-term market share. In this post, I&#8217;m going to break down why spending on marketing is oftentimes one of the best tactics you can employ to make your business recession-proof.</span></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>The importance and benefits of marketing during a recession.</li>
<li>Strategies to get more out of your existing budget.</li>
<li>Changes to make to accommodate a lower budget.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ll also provide real examples of businesses that not only came out on top of a recession because they continued marketing, but are still at the top of their industry today.</p>
<h2>Why should you continue marketing during a recession?</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Most of us are surprised to learn that increasing marketing during a recession can lead to growth.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">You see, companies that continue to market themselves during a recession <a href="https://www.microdinc.com/blog/keeping-your-brand-fresh/">stay on the forefront of the minds of consumers</a>, so when consumers gain back the money to spend, they instinctively turn towards these brands.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Also, when you <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing/marketing-during-slow-economy-recession/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue your marketing efforts despite an economic downturn</a>, the message you are putting out there to your audience is one of strength, leadership, and big-picture mindedness—all of which consumers are looking for during such uncertain times.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Even if you are not at your strongest, your clients and prospects will be attracted to whatever amount of stability you can provide.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Cutting down on marketing during a financial downturn, on the other hand, will reduce your online and offline presence, leaving the door wide open for competitors to take advantage and fill in the gaps.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>When consumers do gain back the money to spend, they will instinctively turn towards brands that have stayed top of mind. </strong></p></blockquote>
<h2>Strategies to make the most of your marketing budget during a recession</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">While you may not be able to market to your fullest capacity during a recession, pulling the plug completely just isn’t a viable option. Let&#8217;s talk about some ways to continue marketing while keeping your business well within its budget.</span></p>
<h3>1. Market to existing clients</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Having a <a href="/blog/ws/2016/11/10/customer-loyalty">loyal customer base</a> is your one true asset during a recession. It’s cheaper, simpler, and definitely more effective to market your products to your existing clientele rather than focusing your efforts to win new ones—and when we say cheaper, we mean a discrepancy of about <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5-25 times</a>.</span></p>

<blockquote><p><strong><span lang="EN">A loyal customer base is one of your best assets during a recession. </span></strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>2. Lean on consistent branding</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">There is no doubt that more effort needs to be put in during a recession. <span lang="EN">In the case of marketing, though, you may not actually need less effort, as there&#8217;s less “marketing noise“ for your marketing message to have to break through. </span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">What you do need to do is be consistent with <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/14/use-branding-to-improve-advertising">your branding</a> and keep <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/22/free-marketing-during-covid-19">engaging with your audience</a>. Developing a monthly plan of marketing strategies is essential for this, which may include any combination of blog posts, emails, PR content, newsletters, and advertisements.</span></p>

<h3>3. Empower and encourage your audience</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Your company&#8217;s marketing plan should always be up to date, but more so when the <a href="/blog/ws/2020/03/18/covid-19-google-ads-data">market and economic conditions change</a>.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">A crucial step here is to ensure that your brand is sending a positive message—one that is <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/02/marketing-during-covid-19">fine-tuned to the sensitive mood of your clients </a>and prospects and avoids any resentment. Your messaging should encourage and empower your audience, which wil help to build a strong emotional bond.</span></p>

<h2>What to change when marketing during a recession</h2>
<p>Given that<span lang="EN"> <a href="https://thetokenist.io/financial-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19% of people</a> pre-COVID already reported having more expenses than their income, you can imagine the changes needed as consumer incomes diminish even further. These limited budgets, shifts in priorities, and changes in <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/18/post-covid-19-customers">customer shopping patterns</a> <span lang="EN">require that you not only continue marketing, but that you <span lang="EN">change the way you <a href="https://hbr.org/2009/04/how-to-market-in-a-downturn-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market your business during a recession</a>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">The following are a few techniques to help you adapt to the unique circumstances created by a recession without compromising your marketing quality or market reach:</span></p>
<h3>1. Your offerings</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Recession can have a dual effect. While some businesses suffer, some <a href="https://blog.visitorqueue.com/what-types-of-businesses-do-well-in-a-recession/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can actually thrive</a> in it! The main difference between these two categories is the type of goods or services they deal with.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Businesses that sell necessities will always have takers, irrespective of  <a href="/blog/ws/2020/06/23/managing-cash-flow">their financial situation</a>. So if your company is selling goods or services that aren’t considered “must-haves,&#8221; it will do you well to reconsider your offering and shift to or at least add in essential services.</span></p>
<h3>2. Your online presence</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Make sure all your online profiles make it explicitly clear to customers and prospects that you&#8217;re still open for business. Update your hours, advertise your latest offers, and keep engaging with your consumers. <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/10/covid-19-resources">This guide </a>has some tips on communicating updates and information to your customers during turbulent times.</span></p>
<h3>3. Your budget allocation</h3>
<p>Regardless of whether your marketing and/or advertising budget stays the same or gets reduced during a recession, you may still need to make some changes as to how much money goes where. Pay attention to channels that are performing well and reallocate accordingly.</p>

<h3><span lang="EN">4. Your tone</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">A recession is a period marked by heightened emotions, so you may have to change your tone to attract the audience with whom you want to have <a href="/blog/ws/2019/07/18/loyalty-marketing">continued business and customer loyalty</a>.

<p><span lang="EN">You always want to be <a href="/blog/ws/2016/02/17/online-audiences">targeting the right audience </a>with your markting and advertising, but during an economic downturn, laser-focused targeting becomes essential for survivival— especially when the marketing budget is tight beacuse it prevents wasted spend on irrelevant clicks on your add.
