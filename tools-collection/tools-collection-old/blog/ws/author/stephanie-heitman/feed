<p>LocaliQ has the answer to all these questions and more in our second-annual Small Business Marketing Trends Report for 2026, including tons of data and insights from over 300 small businesses!</p>
<p>If you want to see the full report, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-marketing-trends-report-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jump on over to LocaliQ</a> or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/smb-marketing-trends-report?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2026SmallBusinessMarketingTrendsReport_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links">download it here</a>. And keep reading for 10 key takeaways from the report you need to know to inform your 2026 planning.</p>
<h2>10 biggest takeaways from LocaliQ’s 2026 Small Business Marketing Trends Report</h2>
<p>We rounded up 10 fast facts from the report to help you understand the small business marketing landscape and make the most of your 2026 planning.</p>
<h3>1. Most SMBs <em>still</em> aren’t investing in paid search</h3>
<p>According to the report, only 45% of SMBs are investing in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/search-advertising">search advertising</a>—up from 40% last year, which means the majority of small businesses are still not running ads on top search engines like Google and Bing.</p>
<p>But, more SMBs are investing in SEO than last year—53% compared to 39% in 2024, which means small businesses are primed to capture high-intent, local searchers.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-channels.webp" alt="smb marketing channels 2025 vs 2024" width="1500" height="1688" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95196" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-channels.webp 1500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-channels-1280x1440.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-channels-980x1103.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-channels-480x540.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Running Google Ads already and worried you&#8217;re wasting spend?</strong> Find out with a free, instant audit &gt;&gt; <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Google Ads Performance Grader</a></p>
<h3>2. But SMBs running paid search are satisfied with results</h3>
<p>When it comes to how satisfied small businesses are with their marketing investments, search advertising was one of the top tactics they were pleased with—behind video marketing and advertising and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reputation-management">reputation management</a>.</p>
<p>Search advertising is effective at <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/12/how-to-generate-leads">driving leads</a> and can be pretty easy to measure and tie back to ROI, so it’s not a surprise to see it so high on the list.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-results-satisfaction.webp" alt="smb marketing channel satisfaction 2025" width="1500" height="1398" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95198" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-results-satisfaction.webp 1500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-results-satisfaction-1280x1193.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-results-satisfaction-980x913.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-results-satisfaction-480x447.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1500px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>3. Low-cost strategies have grown in importance</h3>
<p>Last year, low-cost marketing strategies like listings, reputation management, and content marketing were fairly low on the list of channels small businesses were investing in. But, in 2025, more SMBs are investing here.</p>
<p>As more small businesses reel in spending while keeping an eye on the economy (more on this later), it makes sense that low-cost or basically free strategies would become more important. Small businesses are looking for ways to stretch their budgets, and listings, reputation management, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-marketing">content marketing</a>—along with SEO—can help them get in front of local searchers looking to make a purchase.</p>
<p>One low-cost strategy small businesses still aren’t investing in, though, is website chat. This could be an opportunity for small businesses to provide a contact method that <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-08-27-gartner-survey-finds-self-service-and-live-chat-will-surpass-traditional-channels-as-top-customer-service-technologies-by-2027" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most consumers actually prefer</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Looking for more low-cost ways to promote your business?</strong> Download now &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite30BestWaysToPromote.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Marketing_The30BestWaysToPromoteYourBusiness_Download">30+ Ways to Promote Your Business (On Any Budget!)</a></p>
<h3>4. Facebook continues to be the most popular social platform SMBs are using for marketing</h3>
<p>Social media marketing and advertising are, unsurprisingly, still big hits for businesses, with 66% investing in social media marketing and 56% investing in social ads.</p>
<p>Facebook was the most popular social platform for SMBs to use for marketing for the second year in a row.</p>
<p>Of those businesses investing in social media marketing or social ads, a whopping 91% (up from 80% last year) were doing so on Facebook, followed by Instagram and LinkedIn.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-social-media-channels.webp" alt="smb social media platforms used 2025 vs 2024" width="1500" height="1722" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95199" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-social-media-channels.webp 1500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-social-media-channels-1280x1469.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-social-media-channels-980x1125.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-social-media-channels-480x551.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">Social media marketing</a> and advertising continues to be a winning strategy for small businesses—it’s a great place to engage and grow an audience while ads make it easy to expand and find similar prospects.</p>
<h3>5. Smaller businesses have small budgets (unsurprisingly)</h3>
<p>I mean, this is kind of obvious. But understanding the typical <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing budget</a> for your SMB competitors is really handy. LocaliQ found that less than 10% of SMBs had no budget and 52% (up from 38% in 2024) had monthly budgets under $2,500.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-budget.webp" alt="2025 smb marketing budgets by monthly spend" width="1500" height="1748" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95200" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-budget.webp 1500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-budget-1280x1492.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-budget-980x1142.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-marketing-budget-480x559.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And because the report was able to break down marketing budgets by business size, we were able to see a clear correlation between business size and budget. Which, again, isn’t necessarily a surprise, but it should be validating to small businesses who are doing so much with not a lot.</p>
<p>This just shows the importance of adopting those low-cost strategies we mentioned earlier and taking advantage of creative marketing ideas to get in front of potential customers.</p>

<h3>6. They’re also less likely to have dedicated marketing support</h3>
<p>The smaller the business, the less likely they are to have staff dedicated to marketing. Which does make mastering marketing strategies a challenge—those often take some kind of time commitment.</p>
<p>What’s also interesting is that this year’s report found that fewer SMBs were working with a marketing partner (only 34% in 2025 compared to 60% in 2024!)—meaning these businesses are taking on the majority of the marketing work themselves, even if they have no or few employees dedicated to marketing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-agency-partner.webp" alt="2025 smbs working with marketing partner" width="1500" height="1331" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95201" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-agency-partner.webp 1500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-agency-partner-1280x1136.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-agency-partner-980x870.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-agency-partner-480x426.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This may explain why low-cost strategies like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/01/business-directory-listings">listings</a> and reputation management were so well-represented; they’re often quicker to get off the ground (even if they may require more back-end work later) and don’t require a lot of time or budget to start driving results.</p>
<h3>7. Most SMBs are using AI</h3>
<p>Most small businesses are fully on board the AI train. 56% of SMBs are using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-uses-in-marketing">AI for some part of their marketing</a>! Most are using it to save time and generate ideas for activities like content creation, design, social media management, and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-ai.webp" alt="smb ai use 2025" width="1500" height="1296" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95202" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-ai.webp 1500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-ai-1280x1106.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-ai-980x847.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-ai-480x415.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1500px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>8. The economy continues to be a concern</h3>
<p>66% of SMBs noted that economic uncertainty will be their biggest challenge in 2026, up from 48% in 2025.</p>
<p>This isn’t shocking as the economy has remained unstable over the last few years and the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-businesses-and-tariffs-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduction of tariffs in 2025</a> has had many SMBs hesitant to make changes to their budgets or spending behaviors.</p>
<p>Not only was the economy the biggest challenge SMBs noted, but it was also the main reason they were planning to decrease their budgets in 2026.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-challenges.webp" alt="smb biggest challenges for businesses 2026" width="1500" height="1393" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95203" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-challenges.webp 1500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-challenges-1280x1189.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-challenges-980x910.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-challenges-480x446.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1500px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>9. But small businesses aren’t planning to cut budgets in 2026</h3>
<p>While the economy is the main factor behind SMBs decreasing budgets in 2026, only 8% are planning to do so. 54% of SMBs are planning to keep their budgets the same and 39% plan to increase in 2026.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-budget-investment.webp" alt="marketing budget planning for 2026" width="1500" height="2058" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95204" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-budget-investment.webp 1500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-budget-investment-1280x1756.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-budget-investment-980x1345.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-budget-investment-480x659.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is promising, despite economic concerns—with SMBs planning to either maintain or increase budgets, they have a better chance at driving results and investing in the right marketing strategies to grow their businesses.</p>
<h3>10. Customer referrals remains the greatest source for new leads (but getting new leads is still challenging)</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/get-more-customers-like-best-customer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getting new customers</a> continues to be a top challenge for small businesses, with 59% saying it will be one of their top challenges for 2026, up from 45% in 2025. This is something we hear time and time again—generating leads and getting new customers is hard, especially with limited budget and resources.</p>
<p>But when it comes to getting new customers, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/14/referral-program-ideas">referrals</a> continues to lead the pack, followed by organic and direct website traffic, and digital marketing and online advertising.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-new-lead-sources.webp" alt="sources for new leads in 2025 by smbs" width="1500" height="1466" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95205" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-new-lead-sources.webp 1500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-new-lead-sources-1280x1251.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-new-lead-sources-980x958.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-small-business-marketing-trends-report-new-lead-sources-480x469.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This speaks to the importance of investing in the right strategy to continue bringing in loyal customers and reaching new audiences where they’re spending time online.</p>

<h2>Creative and meaningful January marketing ideas</h2>
<p>Here are some ways to use the awareness themes, holidays, and national days of January to connect with your audience.</p>
<ul></ul>
<h3>Share holiday recaps and roundups</h3>
<p>The holidays might be over, but don’t miss out on the opportunity to squeeze every last drop of cheer you can out of the last month! You can still make the holidays part of your January marketing by creating and publishing holiday roundup posts on your blog or on your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/january-social-media-holidays-and-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media</a> sites.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did your catering company work a holiday party? Post pictures or recipes!</li>
<li>You can also take advantage of #tbt (Throwback Thursday) on Twitter and Instagram and post pictures from just a couple of weeks ago to share with your followers.</li>
<li>Cleaning services or home goods shops can provide post-holiday cleaning or Christmas tree disposal tips.</li>
</ul>
<p>The holidays are busy, and customers might have missed all you had going on, so this is an easy way to create content for your business while making sure they’re in the loop.</p>

<h3>Honor Martin Luther King, Jr. Day with a day of service</h3>
<p>MLK Day, observed on the third Monday of January every year, celebrates Martin Luther King, Jr.’s birthday and commemorates his Nobel Peace Prize for Civil Rights leadership. Don&#8217;t use this holiday to promote your business. Make it a day of service, celebration, and education around this civil rights legend.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many communities create a <a href="https://www.nationalservice.gov/serve-your-community/mlk-day-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">day of service</a> you or your team can participate in.</li>
<li>Post quotes, photos, and facts about Martin Luther King, Jr. on social media.</li>
<li>Post stats and raise awareness about civil rights on social media.</li>
<li>Run your own day of service, whether for your community or in your company.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Get involved during Blood Donor Month</h3>
<p>January is National Blood Donor Month, so get involved!<em><a href="https://www.redcross.org/give-blood.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.redcrossblood.org/give.html/find-drive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Participate in a local blood drive</a> or <a href="https://www.redcrossblood.org/hosting-a-blood-drive/learn-about-hosting/how-hosting-a-blood-drive-works.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">host one</a> of your own.</li>

<h3>Dish em&#8217; out on National Compliment Day</h3>
<p>Who doesn’t love a nice compliment? National Compliment Day occurs every January 24—here are some ways to celebrate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show another business some love on social media or by writing a review (they may even return the favor!)</li>
<li>Start a compliment train. Ask your followers to tag someone in your post and give them a compliment. The tagged person then tags another friend and gives them a compliment and so on.</li>
<li>Give your employees hand-written compliments to show them you appreciate them.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/january-marketing-ideas-compliment-day.png" alt="january marketing ideas - national compliment day" width="650" height="413" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10362" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/january-marketing-ideas-compliment-day.png 650w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/january-marketing-ideas-compliment-day-480x305.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Run fun weather-based promotions</h3>
<p>Much of the United States is covered in snow in January. Love it or hate it, you can’t stop it, so use it to your advantage! Make the snowy weather a little less gray with content, promotions, and posts celebrating the cold.</p>
<ul>
<li>Daycares can share safety tips for playing or dressing children in the snow.</li>
<li>Contractors, construction, and snow removal companies can write about winter hazards in the home—carbon monoxide detectors, salt versus sand for ice and snow, or how to winterize drafty windows.</li>
<li>Give a snow-day discount. Anytime your city gets snow, offer a discount based on the number of inches you’ve received, like 20% off for 20 inches of snow!</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>You can also keep your customers up to date on the latest snow closures on your social media pages.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Take part in National Clean Off Your Desk Day</h3>
<p>With so many people working from home (and becoming obsessed with cleaning and organization shows), this holiday just may resonate with your audience. Here are some ways to take part:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tidy up your desk and share a before and after picture on social. Ask your audience to do the same.</li>
<li>Give organization tips and ideas</li>
<li>Run a contest or a poll. The person with the cleanest (or messiest) desk wins a prize!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Share and encourage New Year&#8217;s resolutions</h3>
<p>No explanation needed for this annual favorite. Here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold yourself accountable and share them with your audience. Then create content around them!</li>
<li>Fitness centers can have a weekly accountability post to create a support community.</li>
<li>Restaurants and catering services can write blog or Facebook posts with healthy recipes.</li>
<li>Daycares can blog about toy organization ideas for playrooms and toy areas.</li>
<li>Ask followers on social media what theirs are—you could even run a poll and then write a blog post providing tips and advice for the most common resolutions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Start a customer loyalty or referral program</h3>
<p>Loyal customers not only bring you ongoing business, but they are also more likely to refer other customers to you. Providing the best customer service is the first and foremost<a href="/blog/ws/2019/07/18/loyalty-marketing"> loyalty marketing strategy</a>, followed by intentional loyalty or referral programs. And with people feeling enthusiastic and motivated for the new year, this is the perfect time to start one.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas for your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-run-customer-loyalty-programs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer loyalty program</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create and print a simple stamp card for customers. Each purchase or service equals one stamp. After 10 stamps, customers can receive a free product, a discounted service, or a swag item.</li>
<li>Offer current customers a discount for each new customer they refer.</li>
<li>Create a tiered loyalty program so customers can move up in tiers based on their purchase history – the higher the tier, the better discounts.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Blame Someone Else Day</h3>
<p>This holiday changes every year. It&#8217;s the first Friday the 13th of the year, and in 2023, it falls in January! Toss the <a href="/blog/ws/2021/06/09/company-core-values">core values</a> aside today and letterrip. Don’t actually do that. But you can have fun with this one.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&#8220;When working in a book store you learn that sometimes books are just going to fall over. Usually on their own or sometimes because of&#8230;other reasons (*cough*Ryan*cough).<br />
Happy National Blame Someone Else Day!<br />
(No books were harmed in the making of this post).&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;Friday the 13th: Me-ow.</em><br />
<em>National Blame Someone Else Day: You-ow&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay to indulge, you can blame us!&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Or get serious&#8230;</p>

<p>Or use it as a creative way to celebrate a company milestone and thank your customers. Write a customer appreciation email, blaming them for your having to bring on more employees to keep up with the demand, and for your having to move to a bigger office, and your having to choose the signature drink to serve at your party celebrating your 1000th customer&#8230;and so on.</p>

<h2>Essential but not-so-creative January marketing ideas</h2>
<p>These aren&#8217;t the most fun marketing ideas, but they are essential if you want running your business to stay fun, through the month and year-round.</p>
<h3>Start with a clean inbox</h3>
<p>There’s nothing less exciting than seeing the number of new <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/january-email-subject-lines/">emails</a> in your inbox when you get back from the holidays.</p>
<p>Actually, I lied because there is: It&#8217;s going through them. Did you know January 25-29 is actually Clean Out Your Inbox Week? Use it as motivation to get organized and start with a clean slate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go through those old emails you “starred” and never followed up on&#8230;</li>
<li>If you don’t already use folders for your emails, create some to help you keep your inbox organized.</li>
<li>Go through the settings your email platform has to offer. There are integrations, color coding, rules, and more that can make your life a whole lot easier. That half hour could translate into hours saved this year.</li>
<li>Create an ideas folder where you save marketing emails you&#8217;ve received that you like or find effective. You never know, you might just find your next great idea buried in your own inbox!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Solidify your yearly goals or marketing plan</h3>
<p>Whether you’re an agency, business owner, or freelancer, it’s important to have both personal and professional goals for the year. Take some time at the beginning of the month to make sure your goals and your marketing plan are solidified.</p>
<p>As we know, things can change quickly, but having a documented plan or a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/28/growth-strategy">growth strategy</a> in place can make the difference between hitting your revenue goals for the year and missing them.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f331.png" alt="🌱" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Download our <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite7StepstoGrowthStrategy.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_GrowthStrategy_Download">free, editable growth strategy template</a></strong> to walk through seven simple steps for creating the right plan to grow your business.</p>
<h3>Revisit what worked last year (and what didn’t)</h3>
<p>Now that you have a full year of data available, take some time to see what worked in your marketing last year and what didn’t.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas of what to look at:</p>
<ul>
<li>What content or web pages performed best for you?</li>
<li>What resonated with your audiences on social media – top posts, most engaging posts, etc.?</li>
<li>What <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/03/email-marketing-best-practices">email subject lines</a> got the best open rates?</li>
<li>What marketing strategies, campaigns, or channels drove the most leads?</li>
<li>What didn’t perform as well as you thought it would – and how could it be improved?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Read up on the latest marketing trends and predictions</h3>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/12/07/happy-new-year-wishes">new year</a> comes a ton of new content around what to expect in the world of marketing and business in general. Find some articles or blog posts that will get you up to speed on what the experts expect to be big this year in your own industry—and jot down some ideas or trends that you might want to try out!</p>
<h3>Announce your events for the year or coming months</h3>
<p>Market your business both online and offline by highlighting upcoming events for the year. Some upcoming holidays include President’s Day, Valentine’s Day, Mardi Gras, and St. Patrick’s Day.</p>
<p>If you have anything planned for these events, like upcoming <a href="/blog/ws/2021/01/25/valentines-day-marketing-ideas">Valentine’s Day deals</a> at your spa or a special Valentine’s menu at your restaurant, let customers know! A calendar of promotions is a great way to keep customers informed about upcoming promotions or events your business is sponsoring or hosting.</p>

<li>Make sure to respond to all reviews.</li>

<li>Populate the Q&amp;A section of your profile with frequently asked questions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>December marketing ideas around monthly awareness</h2>
<p>Alright, now onto a deeper dive into December marketing ideas!</p>
<h3>National Safe Toys and Gifts Month</h3>
<p>The holiday season is the perfect time to give back to those in your community. Host or participate in a toy drive and encourage your customers to do the same.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas for your toy drive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set out a large box for customers and community members to drop toys in.</li>
<li>Offer a promotion for customers who donate to your toy drive—you can give them a coupon for their next visit, a percent off a purchase, or a stamp on their customer loyalty card.</li>
<li>Partner with other local businesses in your area to get the word out about your toy drive and encourage them to leave a box out at their business.</li>
<li>Share photos of your participation on <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/december-social-media-holidays-and-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media</a> and tag the charity you’re working with.</li>
<li>For a list of toy drives, <a href="https://www.toysfortots.org/find-your-local-chapter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re looking to participate in a toy drive as a business rather than host one, you can still take pictures to share on social so you’re getting the word out about how to help children this holiday season.</p>

<h3>National Write a Business Plan Month</h3>
<p>Once the holidays are over, January will come quick—make sure your marketing is prepared by taking a look at your own business plan for the next year, or at least for January. Outline any <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-plan-goals-objectives-for-small-businesses/">business goals and objectives</a> you want to accomplish next year and determine what’s needed to help you reach those goals.</p>
<p>Here are some questions to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>What <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/18/best-marketing-strategies">marketing strategies</a> do you absolutely need to run throughout the year to help you maintain business or grow? Think: your website, SEO, <a href="/blog/ws/2021/11/09/holiday-ppc-mistakes">PPC</a>, and more.</li>
<li>What marketing strategies do you want to try to reach new audiences or engage with your current audience?</li>
<li>Are there any gaps in your marketing plan that you need to fill—like a channel your audience frequents that your business isn’t marketing on?</li>
<li>How will you measure success for your marketing next year?</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions will help you solidify your business plan, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/28/small-business-budget">business budget</a>, and marketing plan as you look ahead to the next year.</p>

<p>The gift guide can include some of your products, but the best way to <a href="/blog/ws/2021/04/29/hold-or-sell-your-small-business">sell your business</a> is not to sell it at all. Instead, showcase items that are related to your industry:</p>
<ul>

<li>Gift Guide for the Home Decorator (Christmas pillow covers, gold candlesticks, electric candles)</li>

<h3>Share 12 days of tips or products</h3>
<p>Take inspiration from the 12 Days of Christmas and feature a tip or product of the day on your blog or social media feed.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas to get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fitness-related businesses like personal trainers or health centers can give an exercise of the day to fight off gaining holiday weight.</li>
<li>Flower shops can feature a wreath or bouquet of the day featuring different holiday colors or flowers.</li>
<li>Restaurants and bars can showcase a cocktail of the day for the holidays.</li>
</ul>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="a1d44c20-c86a-4829-b5ff-2d44cfefe432" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">

</article>
</div>
<p>You could also run a different deal or offer for each of the 12 days. This will keep people coming back to your social sites each day, which can increase engagement on your pages.</p>
<h3>Decorate your location for the holidays</h3>
<p>Nothing gets people in the holiday spirit like some festive décor. Take some time to string some lights inside and outside of your location, hang some garland, and out up a tree and menorah. If your location is in an area with a lot of foot traffic, you can also create an eye-catching holiday window display to get people to slow down and check out your location or come inside.</p>
<p>Now is the time to have a little fun and make your business a welcoming place during the busy holiday season.</p>
<h3>Take customers behind the scenes</h3>
<p>Show customers what your business is like during the holidays with video marketing! Are you a busy baker who is making cakes and cookies? Take customers into the kitchen with a video of preparations for the holidays.</p>

<h3>Send a year-in-review email</h3>
<p>These types of emails are excellent opportunities to give those marketing goals one last push. Celebrate your growth to reassure customers that they&#8217;ve made the right decision to choose you.

<p>Take some time to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">ask your customers for reviews</a>, respond to all your reviews, and make sure you’re managing the most relevant places where customers are reviewing your business—including Yelp, Google My Business, and Facebook.</p>
<h3>Update your Google Business Profile</h3>
<p>Holiday shoppers are going to be turning to Google for all of their holiday needs, whether for gift ideas, home cleaning, appliance repair, travel, safety, and more. Make sure your business information is up to date so you can get found on search.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Understanding the small business marketing landscape can be a challenge, but it’s important to know if you want to be competitive and stand out.</p>
<p>What are your competitors doing? How are they investing their marketing budgets? What are they planning for 2025?</p>
<p>LocaliQ wanted to answer all these questions and more, so we created <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-marketing-trends-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Small Business Marketing Trends Report for 2025</a> with data and insights from over 730 small businesses!</p>
<p>If you want to see the full report, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-marketing-trends-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jump on over to LocaliQ</a> or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/smb-marketing-trends-report?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2025SmallBusinessMarketingTrendsReport_Download">download it here</a>. And keep reading for 10 key takeaways from the report you need to know to inform your 2025 planning.</p>
<h2>10 biggest takeaways from LocaliQ’s 2025 Small Business Marketing Trends Report</h2>
<p>We rounded up 10 fast facts from the report to help you understand the small business marketing landscape and start your 2025 planning.</p>
<h3>1. Most SMBs aren’t investing in paid search</h3>
<p>According to the report, only 40% of SMBs are investing in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/search-advertising">search advertising</a>, which means the majority of small businesses are not running ads on top search engines like Google and Bing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-current-marketing-channels.webp" alt="marketing channels smbs are investing in according to localiq 2025 marketing trends report" width="1501" height="1594" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86955" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-current-marketing-channels.webp 1501w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-current-marketing-channels-1280x1359.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-current-marketing-channels-980x1041.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-current-marketing-channels-480x510.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1501px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Plus, only 39% of SMBs are investing in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO</a>. This means that small businesses are largely missing out on the opportunity to capture high-intent, local searchers.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/first-page-of-google?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_10WaysFirstPageGoogle_Download">10 Tangible &amp; Free Ways to Get on the First Page of Google</a></p>
<h3>2. Less than half of SMBs are investing in social ads</h3>
<p>We were surprised to find that less than half of small businesses are investing in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-ads-101">social media ads</a> on platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, and more.</p>
<p>These platforms are important because customers spend so much time on social media and are increasingly relying on them to discover new businesses. In fact, TikTok is now the <a href="https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/blog/is-tiktok-a-search-engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fourth most popular search engine</a>, with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/do-gen-z-use-tiktok-search-more-than-google-thomas-haynes-idnye/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one in 10</a> Gen Zers more likely to use it than Google.</p>
<p>By not running ads on popular social media sites, SMBs are missing out on ways to engage and convert customers where they’re spending (a lot!) of time online.</p>
<h3>3. But SMBs running paid search are satisfied with results</h3>
<p>When it comes to how satisfied small businesses are with their marketing investments, search advertising topped the list as the tactic they are most satisfied with.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-channels-satisfaction.webp" alt="how satisfied smbs are with their marketing channel investments according to localiq 2025 marketing trends report" width="1501" height="1399" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86956" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-channels-satisfaction.webp 1501w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-channels-satisfaction-1280x1193.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-channels-satisfaction-980x913.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-channels-satisfaction-480x447.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1501px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This makes sense to us! It’s pretty easy to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-reports">measure results for search advertising</a> compared to tactics like reputation management or social media marketing, so this could definitely be a factor. But we also know that search ads are effective for small businesses at <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/17/website-visibility">driving website visits and conversions</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>How are your Google Ads <em>really</em> performing?</strong> Find out with a free, instant audit &gt;&gt; <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Google Ads Performance Grader</a></p>
<h3>4. SMBs are also not taking advantage of low-cost online presence strategies</h3>
<p>Back to the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/26/marketing-channels">marketing channels</a> and tactics SMBs are investing in—we would be remiss if we didn’t mention the lack of investment in strategies like reputation management, listings, and website chat.</p>
<p>These strategies contribute to a strong web presence—<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/01/business-directory-listings">listings and reputation management</a> can help you capture and draw in potential customers on search engines and map apps while chat can help you capture website leads and convert them quicker.</p>
<p>Many listings, reputation management, and <a href="https://localiq.com/products/chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website chat tools</a> or strategies are also fairly low-cost, making them a strong fit for small businesses.</p>
<h3>5. Facebook is the most popular social platform SMBs are using for marketing</h3>
<p>Facebook is not only the most popular social media platform for users—it was also the most popular social platform for SMBs to use for marketing.</p>
<p>Of those businesses investing in social media marketing or social ads, nearly 80% were doing so on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/02/facebook-marketing-for-small-business">Facebook</a>, followed by Instagram and LinkedIn.</p>

<h3>6. Smaller businesses have small budgets (unsurprisingly)</h3>
<p>Okay…duh? But understanding the typical <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing budget</a> for your SMB competitors is really handy. LocaliQ found that only 5% of SMBs had no budget and 38% had monthly budgets under $2,500.</p>
<p>And because the report was able to break down marketing budgets by business size, we were able to see a clear correlation between business size and budget. Which, again, isn’t necessarily a surprise, but it should be validating to small businesses who are doing so much with not a lot.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-budget-breakdown.webp" alt="monthly marketing budget breakdown for smbs according to localiq 2025 marketing trends report" width="1501" height="1749" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86958" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-budget-breakdown.webp 1501w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-budget-breakdown-1280x1491.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-budget-breakdown-980x1142.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-budget-breakdown-480x559.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1501px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This just shows the importance of adopting those <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-marketing-strategies">low-cost strategies</a> we mentioned earlier and take advantage of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/12/marketing-ideas">creative marketing ideas</a> to get in front of potential customers.</p>

<h3>7. They&#8217;re also less likely to have dedicated marketing support</h3>
<p>The smaller the business, the less likely they are to have staff dedicated to marketing. Which does make trying any new or additional marketing strategies a challenge—those often take some kind of time commitment.</p>
<p>But, the report also found that many SMBs aren’t taking advantage of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/wordstream-graders">free tools</a> that could simplify some of these strategies for businesses strapped for time and resources.</p>
<h3>8. Most SMBs are already using AI</h3>
<p>Even though our team has been dabbling in AI, and our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/category/artificial-intelligence">AI-related articles</a> tend to be popular, we weren&#8217;t sure how much smaller businesses have embraced this new tech. But nearly 60% of SMBs are using AI for some part of their marketing! Most are using it to save time on activities like content creation, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-for-social-media">social media management</a>, and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-ai-use-for-smbs.webp" alt="percentage of small businesses using ai and how and why they use it according to localiq 2025 marketing trends report" width="1501" height="1392" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86959" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-ai-use-for-smbs.webp 1501w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-ai-use-for-smbs-1280x1187.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-ai-use-for-smbs-980x909.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-ai-use-for-smbs-480x445.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1501px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>9. The economy continues to be a challenge</h3>
<p>After a tough few years for businesses—from the COVID-19 pandemic to record-high inflation and supply chain issues—SMBs are still concerned about the economy. Nearly half of businesses indicated it will be their biggest challenge in 2025, with 18% noting it will be very challenging.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-biggest-smb-challenges.webp" alt="biggest challenges for small businesses in 2025 according to localiq 2025 marketing trends report" width="1501" height="1329" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86960" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-biggest-smb-challenges.webp 1501w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-biggest-smb-challenges-1280x1133.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-biggest-smb-challenges-980x868.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/marketing-trends-report-2025-biggest-smb-challenges-480x425.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1501px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Plus, of those decreasing their marketing budgets in 2025, 56% noted it was due to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economic conditions and uncertainty</a>.</p>
<h3>10. Getting new customers is also a top challenge</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-get-more-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getting new customers</a> continues to be a top challenge for small businesses, with 45% saying it will be one of their top challenges for 2025. This is something we hear time and time again—<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-generation-ideas">generating leads</a> and getting new customers is hard, especially with limited budget and resources.</p>
<p>Investing in the right marketing strategy can help drive leads and capture customers, which could simplify this challenge for SMBs.</p>
<h2>Create the right marketing strategy for big results in 2025</h2>
<p>Small businesses have big <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-plan">plans</a> for 2025, and this round-up covers just a few of them. To see all the data and insights we gathered from over 730 SMBs, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/smb-marketing-trends-report?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2025SmallBusinessMarketingTrendsReport_Download">download the full report</a>. And <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/marketing-services?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Demo_Blog_Demo">reach out to schedule a demo</a> if you need help crafting the right marketing strategy to stand out from the competition.</p>
<p>Here’s a recap of the top takeaways from The Small Business Marketing Trends Report for 2025:</p>
<ol>
<li>Most SMBs aren’t investing in paid search</li>
<li>…or social ads</li>
<li>But SMBs running paid search are satisfied with results</li>
<li>SMBs are also not taking advantage of low-cost online presence strategies</li>
<li>Facebook is the most popular social platform SMBs are using for marketing</li>
<li>Smaller businesses have small budgets (unsurprisingly)</li>
<li>…and are less likely to have dedicated marketing support</li>
<li>Most SMBs are already using AI</li>
<li>The economy continues to be a challenge</li>
<li>…And so does getting new customers</li>

<h2>Quick tips for your happy Father’s Day messages</h2>
<p>Before we share some messages you can copy and paste (and customize!), here are some tips to keep in mind for your Father’s Day greetings.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be sensitive.</strong> Father’s Day can be a complicated or sad time for some. Keep that in mind as you plan your marketing campaigns around Father’s Day and schedule your messages.</li>
<li><strong>Use inclusive language.</strong> Many people can act as a father figure—stepfathers, uncles, brothers, fathers-in-law, and other trusted adults. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/27/diversity-inclusion-marketing-statistics">use inclusive language</a> where appropriate in your Father’s Day messages.</li>
<li><strong>Adjust your message.</strong> Depending on where and how you’re using your Father’s Day greeting, you may need to make tweaks to what we’re sharing. Customize these ideas and examples for your needs and the specific channel you&#8217;re sharing it on so it’s most effective for you.</li>
<li><strong>Stay on brand.</strong> It’s always important to keep your brand guidelines and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">brand personality</a> in mind when selecting or creating marketing messages for your business. And Father’s Day is no exception.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some Canva templates you can customize for social media to stay on brand:</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Customer data is extremely valuable for many reasons, and one of the biggest is to make your marketing more effective. Customer data can act as the foundation for your marketing strategy, help you optimize and refine your campaigns, and influence the marketing messages you create.</p>
<p>But as privacy becomes even more important and customers pay more attention to how businesses are collecting, storing, and using their information, this is turning into a pretty big challenge for businesses—especially smaller, local businesses. So in this guide, we’ll cover everything you need to know about collecting and using customer data the right way to keep your marketing and targeting super effective.</p>

<h2>What is customer data?</h2>
<p>Customer data is any information about your customers or potential customers. It includes demographic information, contact information, and more (we’ll get into the types of customer data in a minute!).</p>
<p>It’s important to collect <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/05/customer-data-designing-for-transparency-and-trust" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer data</a> so you can refine your campaign targeting, build segmented email lists, learn more about your audience, and more.</p>
<p>Before we dive into the types of customer data, let’s talk about the different sources of data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Zero-party data:</strong> Data customers give to businesses willingly.</li>
<li><strong>First-party data:</strong> Data businesses source directly from their customers.</li>
<li><strong>Second-party data:</strong> Data businesses have access to that they didn’t collect and don’t own. This data can come from a partner sharing data or insights.</li>
<li><strong>Third-party data:</strong> Data businesses use that have no ties to the business. This is typically collected from multiple sources and can be purchased by businesses for specific campaigns or research.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/types-of-customer-data-collection.webp" alt="types of customer data collection" width="936" height="563" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81603" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/types-of-customer-data-collection.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/types-of-customer-data-collection-480x289.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Zero- and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/12/first-party-data" rel="noopener">first-party data</a> are the best types of data collection sources to use when sourcing customer data. Why? Because they are the most transparent, least likely to infringe on privacy policies, and lead to more engaged customers and campaigns. Second- and third-party data are still helpful to inform your marketing strategies and help boost the effectiveness of other campaigns.</p>
<div id="types-of-customer-data"></div>
<h2>Types of customer data</h2>
<p>There are four main <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/customer-data-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">types of customer data</a> that you can collect—and they can help your business’s marketing efforts in different ways.</p>
<h3>Basic data</h3>
<p>Basic data is pretty self-explanatory. It’s the basic information about your customers, including their:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Email address</li>
<li>Phone number</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Income</li>
<li>Industry</li>
<li>And more</li>
</ul>
<p>This is essentially demographic data. Basic data is fairly easy to collect as many people are used to providing their names, email addresses, phone numbers, and addresses when placing an online order, downloading a piece of content, or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/11/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups">signing up for a newsletter</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/customer-data-collection-basic-data.webp" alt="example of customer data collection source from sat prep site" width="936" height="579" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82029" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/customer-data-collection-basic-data.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/customer-data-collection-basic-data-480x297.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.c2educate.com/locations/boca-raton-fl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>This information can provide the basis for your campaign targeting, can help you assess <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-channels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which marketing channels to use</a>, and can inform several marketing strategies.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4da.png" alt="📚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide download &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download">135 of the Best Words &amp; Phrases for Marketing with Emotion</a></p>
<h3>Engagement data</h3>
<p>Engagement data is information about how your customers engage with your business across various touchpoints. This could include their engagement with your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">social media sites</a>, how they click through your website, or whether or not they click on your search ad.</p>
<p>Typically, businesses collect this data at a higher level rather than an individual level. Although some tools can help you see this information at a user level.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/engagement-customer-data-example.webp" alt="example of engagement data from business facebook page" width="936" height="248" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82030" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/engagement-customer-data-example.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/engagement-customer-data-example-480x127.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An example of engagement data for a business&#8217;s Facebook page. </em></p>
<p>This customer data can be used to assess the effectiveness of your marketing efforts, identify specific campaigns or messages that are resonating with your brand, and inform areas for improvement in your marketing strategy.</p>
<h3>Attitudinal data</h3>
<p>Attitudinal data is information about how customers feel about your business and your products or services. This customer data is extremely useful but is more difficult to collect.</p>
<p>Because this type of data comes straight from your customers, it’s usually collected as a survey or <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/get-google-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/attitudinal-data-review-example.webp" alt="business review example of attitudinal data" width="877" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82031" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/attitudinal-data-review-example.webp 877w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/attitudinal-data-review-example-480x328.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 877px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Attitudinal data can help you improve your marketing campaigns, your products and services, and your overall business operations.</p>
<h3>Behavioral data</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/28/behavioral-segmentation">Behavioral data</a> is information about how customers engage directly with your products or services. This includes past purchases, appointments scheduled, items added to a cart, and more.</p>
<p>This information can be collected through a variety of sources, such as a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/09/crm-for-small-business">lead management platform</a>, a POS system, and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/behavioral-data-use-email-example.webp" alt="cart abandonment email example from behavioral data" width="304" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82032" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/behavioral-data-use-email-example.webp 304w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/behavioral-data-use-email-example-152x300.webp 152w" sizes="(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px" /></p>
<p>Behavioral data can impact your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/email-nurture-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nurture campaigns</a>, promotions, and more.</p>
<div id="how-to-collect-customer-data"></div>
<h2>How to collect customer data</h2>
<p>There are many different ways to collect customer data without infringing on your customers’ rights or violating their privacy. We’re going to focus on some zero- and first-party customer data collection methods.</p>
<p>Here are some options for collecting customer data.</p>
<h3>1. Build an email list</h3>
<p>Building an email list is one of the best ways to collect customer data. You can build an email list in many different ways, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having people sign up for your newsletter</li>
<li>Adding a contact form to your website</li>
<li>Adding a contact form to your landing pages</li>
<li>Creating a quiz where customers get their results in exchange for an email address</li>
<li>And a few other options we’ll talk about shortly</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/build-email-list-opt-in.webp" alt="example of opt in to build email list" width="771" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82033" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/build-email-list-opt-in.webp 771w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/build-email-list-opt-in-480x374.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 771px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>2. Send a survey</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to learn more about your customers and prospects is to ask them! You can do this through surveys, which can be sent via email, added as a link on your website, or included as a link on your invoicing or receipts.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/collect-customer-data-survey-example.webp" alt="example of survey to collect customer data" width="709" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82034" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/collect-customer-data-survey-example.webp 709w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/collect-customer-data-survey-example-480x406.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 709px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.thekeg.com/en/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-feedback-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">questions in your survey</a> will depend on the type of customer data you’re hoping to collect.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to collect basic data, your survey will likely read more like a lead collection form that includes spaces for your customer’s name, phone, number address, and occupation.</p>
<p>If you want to collect the ever-elusive attitudinal data, your survey will focus more on how customers perceive your business, your products, and your services.</p>
<p>You can also <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/10/best-online-survey-tools">survey your customers</a> to find out information that may influence behavioral data, such as what social media sites they’re active on, where they’ve seen your business online, and what types of content they’re interested in seeing from your business.</p>
<h3>3. Run a contest</h3>
<p>Whether you’re looking to build your email list or see a change in engagement data, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-run-a-facebook-giveaway-or-contest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running a contest</a> is a great customer data collection method.</p>
<p>In exchange for the valuable information you’re collecting from your customers, you’ll want to make sure the prize is compelling and that you promote your contest on the channels your customers are most likely to engage—probably social media, through email, and on your website.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/contest-giveaway-example-goodreads.webp" alt="example of customer giveaway contest on goodreads" width="916" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82035" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/contest-giveaway-example-goodreads.webp 916w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/contest-giveaway-example-goodreads-480x314.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 916px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>4. Use a lead management system</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to collect customer data and learn more about your customers is by using a lead management system. A lead management system tracks where your leads are coming from, how they’ve engaged with your business online, and their behavior with your products or services.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://localiq.com/products/customer-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lead management system</a> that uses a single lead inbox can also aggregate your customer data and help you identify interesting trends that can impact your overall marketing strategy and how you spend your budget.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/collect-customer-data-lead-management-inbox.webp" alt="example of automated lead management system" width="936" height="545" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82037" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/collect-customer-data-lead-management-inbox.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/collect-customer-data-lead-management-inbox-480x279.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This data customer collection method can also help you learn more about your specific customers’ journey—including how many touchpoints it takes a lead to convert or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics">what marketing channels convert at the highest rate</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Offer a free downloadable resource</h3>
<p>Another great way to build your email list and collect customer data is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/15/lead-magnet-ideas" rel="noopener">provide a free downloadable resource</a> that relates to your business.</p>
<p>While this is a popular tactic in the B2B world, it can also work really well for B2C businesses. For example, a cleaning business can provide a downloadable spring cleaning checklist or a dentist can provide a downloadable guide on the foods to avoid for healthy teeth.</p>
<p>The goal is to make your resource compelling enough for a prospect or customer to provide their information in exchange for what you’re offering.</p>

<div id="how-to-use-customer-data"></div>
<h2>How to use customer data for marketing</h2>
<p>We’ve touched a little on how the types of customer data can impact your marketing, but let’s dive a little deeper now that you have some ideas on how to collect it.</p>
<h3>Identify the right marketing channels</h3>
<p>When you understand more about your customers, including their demographic information and where they spend time online, you can choose the right marketing channels that will make the biggest impact on your business.</p>
<p>For example, if you know that most of your customers are Gen Zers, then you can assume that TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram will be big drivers for your business.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/gen-z-tiktok-instagram-snapchat-use-chart.webp" alt="chart that shows social media usage for gen z on tiktok, instagram, and snapchat" width="734" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82039" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/gen-z-tiktok-instagram-snapchat-use-chart.webp 734w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/gen-z-tiktok-instagram-snapchat-use-chart-480x392.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 734px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/more-us-gen-zers-now-use-tiktok-than-instagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Source</i></a></p>
<p>Or, if through a survey, you find that most of your current customers found your business on Google, then you might consider focusing more of your marketing efforts on <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/seo-vs-ppc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search ads and SEO</a> so you can capture more customers there.</p>
<p>Through collecting customer data, you may also identify some new channels that you hadn’t considered—which can help you test new strategies and make your marketing even more effective.</p>
<h3>Refine marketing messages</h3>
<p>When you understand how your customers engage with your business, what drives them to make a purchase with you, and their top pain points, you can better refine your marketing messages. This helps you personalize your marketing strategy to your most likely customers, which can drive better results.</p>
<p>For example, after sending a survey to your plumbing customers, you may have found that most of them value your quick response time to emergency jobs. You can then use this information in your ad copy, on your website, and in your social media posts to influence potential new customers to give you a call or think of you when they have an emergency.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/plumbing-ad-example-using-customer-data.webp" alt="plumbing ad copy using customer data " width="936" height="299" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82040" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/plumbing-ad-example-using-customer-data.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/plumbing-ad-example-using-customer-data-480x153.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Optimize campaigns</h3>
<p>Better understanding your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/target-market-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">target market</a> through customer data is extremely helpful for optimizing your campaigns and overall marketing strategy.</p>
<p>And even the most basic data about your customers can help. For example, location data makes up the foundation of many paid advertising campaigns, so by understanding that most of your customers are in a specific suburb, you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/15/audience-targeting" rel="noopener">optimize your ad targeting</a> to reach them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/facebook-ad-set-up.webp" alt="example of facebook targeting set up" width="706" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82041" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/facebook-ad-set-up.webp 706w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/facebook-ad-set-up-480x408.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 706px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You can also <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/14/ppc-ad-copywriting" rel="noopener">optimize your ad copy</a> using feedback from your refined marketing messages and identify specific searches that drove customers to your website or to click on your ad.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f3af.png" alt="🎯" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Need targeting help?

<h3>Personalize your marketing</h3>
<p>Personalization is no longer a “nice to have” when it comes to effective marketing. It’s a necessity. And you can’t <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing" rel="noopener">personalize your marketing</a> without access to customer data.</p>
<p>Customer data can help you segment your audiences, which leads to better-targeted ad campaigns or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/30/business-email-templates">email marketing messages</a>.</p>
<p>For example, within your lead management system, you could tag customers who previously purchased your teeth whitening package and then send them emails about teeth whitening specials or content on how to keep your teeth clean, since this is likely a topic they’re interested in. These targeted messages can help customers feel like they’re getting a personalized experience and lead them to take action.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/personalized-email-madewell-example.webp" alt="example of personalized marketing email from madewell" width="426" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82042" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/personalized-email-madewell-example.webp 426w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/personalized-email-madewell-example-213x300.webp 213w" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" /></p>
<p>Customer data can also help influence the type of content you create, which helps create a more personalized experience for your customers. This <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-distribution">content can be distributed</a> across social media, your website, your newsletter, and more, which leads to more engagement on your marketing channels.</p>
<h3>Influence nurture sequences</h3>
<p>When you collect customer data that helps you understand your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-the-buyers-journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buyer’s journey</a>, you can create nurture sequences meant to increase conversions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/11/03/lead-nurturing" rel="noopener">Email nurturing</a> is when you send a series of emails meant to drive prospects through the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/sales-funnel-template/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales funnel</a> until they convert into a customer.</p>
<p>By collecting customer data about how your customers engage with your business throughout the funnel, you can optimize your nurture sequences to identify the right path for segments of potential customers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/lead-nurture-automation-template-examples.webp" alt="example of lead nurturing sequences in localiq dashboard" width="800" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82043" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/lead-nurture-automation-template-examples.webp 800w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/lead-nurture-automation-template-examples-480x360.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For example, say you’re an SAT prep center. You might find that an email with tips for helping your child study for the SATs followed by an email from a parent and student testimonial who received stellar scores after preparing with your SAT prep center drove a high volume of calls or classes scheduled. That would then be a compelling nurture sequence to continue testing for better results.</p>

<h2>Tips for ethical customer data collection and storage</h2>
<p>We can’t end this post without touching on some important tips for collecting and storing customer data.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Include unsubscribe buttons:</strong> Every email you send to your email list should include an unsubscribe button so people can opt out at any time.</li>
<li><strong>Create a privacy policy—and publish it on your website:</strong> A <a href="https://www.privacypolicies.com/blog/how-write-privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacy policy</a> that outlines how you collect, use, and store customer data is essential. Make sure to publish it on your website and include it any time customers are providing their data or opting into your email list.</li>
<li><strong>Protect customer data:</strong> Any business that collects customer data is at risk for a security breach. Take extra steps to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/22/customer-data-privacy" rel="noopener">protect your customers and their data</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Be transparent:</strong> Communicate with your customers or prospects if a breach happens, if you update your privacy policy, or if there’s any threat to their data.</li>
<li><strong>Try a double opt-in:</strong> A <a href="https://mailchimp.com/help/single-opt-in-vs-double-opt-in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">double opt-in</a> is becoming more standard as it ensures customers know what information they’re providing to businesses. It can also lead to a more engaged email list!</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/double-opt-in-email-example.webp" alt="example of double opt-in email from olivia palermo" width="936" height="565" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82044" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/double-opt-in-email-example.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/double-opt-in-email-example-480x290.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Example of a double opt-in email.</em></p>
<h2>Collect and use customer data the right way</h2>
<p>Collecting and using customer data can be tricky—if you don’t do it right. By using these zero- and first-party collection methods, you can get access to valuable customer data without infringing on your customers’ rights or making customers feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>As second- and third-party data collection become murkier, these methods will help you find customer data and use it right.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Memorial Day isn’t just the unofficial start of summer, the day many public pools open, and a time to gather around the BBQ with your loved ones. It’s most importantly a time to remember those who lost their lives while serving in the US military.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a way to honor the day while also connecting with your audience, look no further. I’m sharing Memorial Day messages and greetings you can share on social media, in your emails, and more with customers, employees, and anyone who engages with your business online.</p>

<h2>Quick tips for your Memorial Day messages</h2>
<p>Before we get into it, here are a few tips to keep in mind as you choose or customize your Memorial Day greeting.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep it simple.</strong> You don’t have to get real fancy with your Memorial Day messages. A simple greeting that lets your audience know you’re thinking about them, pays homage to the reason behind the observance, or communicates what you need to communicate will work great.</li>
<li><strong>Be sensitive.</strong> Memorial Day may be a sensitive day for some as it honors those who died while serving in the US military, so keep that in mind as you prepare your message.</li>
<li><strong>Tailor it for your needs.</strong> Your Memorial Day message may vary based on where you&#8217;re sharing it. An email may need a little extra content, whereas a social media post or SMS message will be more concise.</li>
<li><strong>Keep it on brand.</strong> Connect with your audience by communicating your Memorial Day message in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">brand voice</a> and using assets that align with your brand colors. This will help you stand out from the other Memorial Day messages and posts people will see.</li>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a brief hiatus, WordStream’s State of the Digital Marketing Agency report is back—and this time, it’s bigger than ever!</p>
<p>We surveyed over 300 agencies in the US and Canada on everything from the services they offer, how they price those services, their size and structure, their biggest business challenges, and so much more.</p>
<p>To give you a little peek at some of the data, we’re featuring 10 of the biggest takeaways and what they mean for your agency. Let’s dive in!</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f5dd.png" alt="🗝" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong><a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite2023AgencyIndustryReport.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_StateoftheAgency2023_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incontent_links&amp;utm_content=2023SOTA">Download the full State of the Digital Marketing Agency industry report</a></strong> <strong>for 25 charts and data points that will guide your 2024 planning!</strong></p>
<h2>1. More agencies are pricing using a hybrid model</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-pricing.webp" alt="wordstream state of the digital marketing agency 2023 - agency pricing models" width="933" height="815" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76332" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-pricing.webp 933w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-pricing-480x419.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 933px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Our data shows that the hybrid billing model has grown in popularity over the last few years. In our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/20/state-of-the-internet-marketing-agency-report-2020">2020 report</a>, flat fee and hybrid billing models were about equally common, but this year, almost half of all agencies we surveyed are using a hybrid billing model.</p>
<p>“There are lots of options for how agencies can price their services. We’ve seen hybrid billing models grow in popularity because they provide the flexibility for agencies to price their services in a way that benefits both their clients and their own bottom line.” said Erin Rose, Sr. Director of Partner Development for LocaliQ.</p>
<p><a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite2023AgencyIndustryReport.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_StateoftheAgency2023_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incontent_links&amp;utm_content=2023SOTA"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-ad-spend-download-banner.png" alt="state of the agency chart download banner" width="936" height="192" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76291" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-ad-spend-download-banner.png 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-ad-spend-download-banner-480x98.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<h2>2. Agencies are charging extra fees for creative services</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-additional-fees-pricing.webp" alt="wordstream state of the digital marketing agency 2023 - agencies charging additional fees" width="933" height="858" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76333" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-additional-fees-pricing.webp 933w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-additional-fees-pricing-480x441.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 933px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Curious what services and add-ons agencies are charging additional fees for? <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">Landing page creation</a> was the most popular, followed by image ad creation and display creative.</p>
<p>This makes sense because these are time-consuming marketing activities that require expertise and creativity. Plus, effective landing pages and strong creative are crucial to the success of digital marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>Aside from creative services, reporting and tracking were valuable services agencies charged additional fees for.</p>
<p>By offering these services in-house, even for an additional fee, you can add value to your existing services while increasing revenue for your agency.</p>
<h2>3. Social ads is the most widely offered service by these agencies</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-services-offered.webp" alt="wordstream state of the digital marketing agency 2023 - agency services offered" width="933" height="869" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76335" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-services-offered.webp 933w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-services-offered-480x447.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 933px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It’s interesting to see the mix of services the agencies we surveyed offer—with social ads, content, and creative services leading the pack, followed by SEO, <a href="https://localiq.com/products/search-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search advertising</a>, and email marketing.</p>
<p>These strategies continue to be accessible and cost-effective for all types of businesses—making them a reliable option for agencies offering digital marketing services.</p>
<p>This data also shows that most agencies are offering multiple services for their clients. (We dive deeper into that data <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite2023AgencyIndustryReport.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_StateoftheAgency2023_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incontent_links&amp;utm_content=2023SOTA">in the report</a>.)</p>
<h2>4. Most clients run multiple services with one agency</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-products-services-running.webp" alt="wordstream state of the digital marketing agency 2023 - number of services running with agency partners" width="933" height="851" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76336" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-products-services-running.webp 933w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-products-services-running-480x438.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 933px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Of those surveyed, 93% said their clients are running two or more services with them—with 34% saying their clients run an average of 4 or more services with their agency.</p>
<p>This is good news because if your clients are running more services with you, there’s a good chance you’ll be able to retain and potentially upsell them.</p>
<p>This also means your agency should consider ways to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/05/maximize-agency-profitability">offer more services to clients</a>. Running one or just a couple of services decreases your revenue potential—and keeps you from providing a better experience for clients who will have to work across agencies for all their digital marketing needs.</p>
<h2>5. Agencies are spending a lot of time managing paid search for their clients</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-time-spend-ppc-management.webp" alt="wordstream state of the digital marketing agency 2023 - time spent managing ppc per client" width="933" height="849" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76337" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-time-spend-ppc-management.webp 933w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-time-spend-ppc-management-480x437.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 933px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>41% of agencies offering search advertising services are spending 2-4 hours per week managing PPC per client—and 16% are spending 5 or more! This time can add up quickly and hinder your agency from onboarding new clients and adding more services to help retain existing clients.</p>
<p>If you’re spending more than a couple hours per week managing search per client, consider outsourcing or researching automated tools that can cut down on your PPC management without sacrificing results.</p>
<h2>6. Smaller agencies have fewer employees performing multiple job duties</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-fulltime-employees.webp" alt="wordstream state of the digital marketing agency 2023 - agency employee size" width="933" height="845" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76338" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-fulltime-employees.webp 933w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-fulltime-employees-480x435.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 933px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>53% of those surveyed have fewer than 25 employees and 23% are sole practitioners. Meaning most of these agencies’ employees are wearing multiple hats, from account management, sales, reporting, and more.</p>
<p>For example, over half of agencies surveyed don’t have any employees fully dedicated to sales. 18% have employees partially dedicated to sales, and 43% have at least one employee fully dedicated to sales.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a tip, though. Many smaller agencies are using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency">marketing AI tools</a> to swing above their weight.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite2023AgencyIndustryReport.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_StateoftheAgency2023_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incontent_links&amp;utm_content=2023SOTA">Download the report</a> to find out what percentage of agencies have employees dedicated to account management.</p>
<h2>7. Agencies have a varied tech stack (that now includes AI tools)</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-tech-stack-chart.webp" alt="wordstream state of the digital marketing agency 2023 - tools in tech stack for agencies" width="932" height="850" class="aligncenter wp-image-76325 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-tech-stack-chart.webp 932w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-tech-stack-chart-480x438.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 932px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>A good tech stack is essential for agencies—especially smaller agencies doing more with fewer people and resources. Tools for marketing automation and email marketing like HubSpot and MailChimp continue to be important for agencies.</p>
<p>Agencies are also commonly using tools and software for reporting and analytics, project management, content management, and ecommerce/payments.</p>
<p>But one new addition is the prominence of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/21/chatgpt-impact-on-marketing">ChatGPT</a>. This AI tool has become an important resource for agencies and marketers looking to automate tasks that were more time intensive. We’ll be curious how the use of AI tools will evolve and impact agencies in the future.</p>
<h2>8. Managed spend has grown (but at a slower rate than in 2018-2020)</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-managed-spend-growth.webp" alt="wordstream state of the digital marketing agency 2023 - managed spend growth" width="933" height="775" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76339" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-managed-spend-growth.webp 933w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-managed-spend-growth-480x399.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 933px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>34% of those surveyed said their spend under management has stayed the same in the last year. 53% said their spend under management has grown in the last year—26% by more than 25% and 27% by less than 25%.</p>
<p>Between the stressors of the economy and coming out of the pandemic, it’s encouraging to see that agencies have been able to grow their managed spend, although the rate of growth is lower than we saw in our 2018-2020 reports.</p>
<h2>9. Referrals remains the top source for getting new clients</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-client-acquisition.webp" alt="wordstream state of the digital marketing agency 2023 - how agencies get new clients" width="933" height="843" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76340" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-client-acquisition.webp 933w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-client-acquisition-480x434.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 933px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As we found in previous reports, client referrals were by far the top source for acquiring new clients, followed (not closely) by content and digital marketing.</p>
<p>Referrals are amazing, but if your challenge is finding new clients you should switch it up. Use these tips to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/02/strategies-to-grow-your-digital-marketing-agency">get new clients</a> if your referral well is running dry.</p>
<h2>10. Economic conditions and uncertainty is the biggest challenge for agencies for 2024</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-challenges.webp" alt="wordstream state of the digital marketing agency 2023 - biggest challenges" width="932" height="1150" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76341" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-challenges.webp 932w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-challenges-480x592.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 932px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Getting new clients has been a consistent top challenge for the agencies we’ve surveyed since 2018. The agencies we surveyed this year still anticipate getting new clients will be a big challenge, but <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/recession-proof-small-business-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economic conditions and uncertainty</a> is the top challenge they’re worried about for 2024.</p>
<p>This answer wasn’t even an option in previous reports, and agencies were reporting higher rates of growth. For example, in 2018, nearly half of agencies surveyed saw their managed spend increase by more than 25%, compared to only 26% this year.</p>
<p>We included some tips for how to address this challenge <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite2023AgencyIndustryReport.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_StateoftheAgency2023_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incontent_links&amp;utm_content=2023SOTA">in our report</a>!</p>
<h2>Get prepared for agency growth in 2024</h2>

<p>Running real estate ads in 2021 and wondering what your results should look like? It can be difficult to tell whether or not your campaigns are hitting the mark—or missing them entirely.</p>
<p>One way to be sure your real estate advertising is on track is to look at available industry benchmarks to determine the answers to questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s a good conversion rate for real estate advertising?</li>
<li>What’s the average click-through rate for real estate ads?</li>
<li>What’s a good cost per lead for real estate advertising?</li>
</ul>

<p>To provide some context around your real estate advertising results, WordStream and LOCALiQ have partnered to share some benchmarks based on new data for the real estate industry.</p>

<ul>
<li>Average click-through rate</li>

<p>With a high average click-through rate across all subcategories and a low average cost per lead, the data shows that paid search is a winning advertising strategy for the real estate industry.</p>
<p>Apartments and rentals see an exceptional average cost per lead at just $35.52. Even homes for sale by agent campaigns see a low cost per lead under $100, which can yield a high return on investment when you consider the average home cost is just over <a href="https://www.zillow.com=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$293k with an average commission of </a><a href="https://www.redfin.com/guides/how-much-is-real-estate-agent-commission-buyer-seller">5-6%</a> (amounting to a whopping $14,650-17,580 per home sale).</p>
<p>The average cost per click across all real estate subcategories is also promising at less than $1.70. To compare, the industry average cost per click for real estate is <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/29/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks">$2.37</a>.</p>

<p>Display advertising is a natural fit for real estate industry businesses looking to increase awareness with potential buyers or renters in their areas. Because display advertising is a top-of-funnel strategy focused on getting your business in front of people across the web and less about driving leads, it doesn’t typically have the highest conversion rates or click-through rates.</p>
<p>However, these display advertising benchmarks are still promising when you, again, look at the average value of a new lead for these subcategories.</p>
<p>While average cost per lead and average cost per click is higher for real estate display ads than for real estate search ads, one of the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/benefits-of-display-advertising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benefits of display advertising</a> is that it can improve your search ad results. In fact, there’s a <a href="https://blog.reachlocal.com/display-advertising-lifts-search-advertising-conversions-by-59-infographic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly 60%</a> increase in conversions when a search is conducted for a business after seeing a display ad.</p>
<p>So while these display ads averages may not seem as impressive in comparison to the search ad benchmarks, display advertising is still a worthwhile and effective real estate advertising strategy.</p>

<p>The data shows that our clients are getting excellent results with social media advertising with a high average click-through rate between 2.01% to 3.02%.
