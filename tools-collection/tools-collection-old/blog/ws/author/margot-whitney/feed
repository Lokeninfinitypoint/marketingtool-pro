<h2>Why is your Google Ads account structure so important?</h2>
<p>Let’s take a step back–what is even meant by account structure, and why is it so important?</p>
<p>I’m glad you asked. Put simply, the way you structure your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-not-working">Google Ads</a> account allows you to control how you want your ads to be triggered and when and where you want them to appear. Not having a well-structured account is like attempting to drive a car that’s not properly built&#8211;accidents are bound to happen.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that having a well-structured account will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the searches triggering your ads are relevant to your audience.</li>
<li>Result in better Quality Scores, which, in turn, brings better results and lower prices. Quality score is essentially the scale of how much Google likes you (and trust me, you want Google to love you!).</li>
<li>Keep you organized and able to optimize. If your account is a mess, then you’re likely to get lost in the mess, your results will plummet (or never arrive), and optimizing to get better results will be out of the question. So keep in mind organization (and your own sanity) when structuring your account.</li>
</ul>

<div id="overview"></div>
<h2>Google Ads account overview</h2>
<p>A Google Ads account is more than just one account with a bunch of ads. So let&#8217;s start with a big-picture overview of its key components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account:</strong> This is the outer shell, with your business and payment information that houses everything.</li>
<li><strong>Campaigns:</strong> Campaigns house your ad groups. You can only have one <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/05/types-of-google-ads">ad type</a> (Search vs. Display, for example) per campaign, but you can (and should) have multiple ad groups within a campaign, and you can (and should) have multiple campaigns per account.</li>
<li><strong>Ad groups:</strong> These contain your ads and keywords and are grouped by theme.</li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>These are the terms that you want to trigger your ads to show in the search engine results page (SERP).</li>
<li><strong>Ads: </strong>This is the actual copy and creative that appears on the SERP.</li>
<li><strong>Landing page:</strong> The page viewers land on once they click your ad. You will have only one landing page per ad group. Given<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/15/landing-page-best-practices"> landing page best practices</a>—namely, how specific it should be to the offering and the ad promoting it—you can get a feel for how ad groups are organized.</li>
</ul>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-account-structure.webp" alt="google ads account structure chart" width="818" height="613" class="aligncenter wp-image-91558 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-account-structure.webp 818w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-account-structure-480x360.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 818px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There are different groupings and levels, and certain features and settings are only available at certain levels within your account.</p>
<p>At first, this may feel confusing, but in the end, it&#8217;s designed this way to help you streamline things as much as possible and customize where necessary.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s dive into each layer within your account so you can see what I mean.</p>
<div id="account"></div>
<h2>The account level</h2>
<p>The shell of your Google Ads account is the first layer of PPC management that is often referred to as the “account level.” This is where big-picture portions of your Google Ads get taken care of, like your billing, user permissions, and more.</p>
<h3>How do I create a Google Ads account?</h3>
<p>To <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-run-google-ads">create a Google Ads account</a>, go to <a href="https://ads.google.com/home/#!/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ads.google.com</a> and have an email address handy. It doesn’t necessarily have to be a Gmail account.<a href="https://ads.google.com/home/#!/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em></em></a><em> </em></p>
<h3>What is a Google Ads Manager account? Do I need one?</h3>
<p>Google Ads Manager accounts were designed with agencies in mind, as they have <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/19/agencies-sell-more-ppc">multiple clients using PPC</a>. This acts as an umbrella account where you can manage multiple accounts in one place.</p>
<p>However, you don’t have to be an agency to have a Manager account. You may be an independent consultant, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/06/small-business-ideas">own multiple businesses</a> or brands, or just have different needs in your PPC plan that require totally separate setups.</p>
<p>In short, if you manage more than one account, you’ll want to follow the prompts to create a Manager account. If you’re just working in one individual account, though, a Manager account is not needed.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f926-200d-2640-fe0f.png" alt="🤦‍♀️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Are you making mistakes in Google Ads?</strong> Find out with the <strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Free Google Ads Performance Grader</a></strong>!</p>
<h3>Account-level settings</h3>
<p>Here are a few of the highlights within the settings found at the account level. Changes to any of these settings will apply to every campaign, ad group, and ad in your account.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account name: </strong>Usually your business name. Just keep it simple and easy to reference in case technical support ever needs to hop in.</li>
<li><strong>Account status: </strong>Enabled, disabled, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Data protection contacts:</strong> Who you’d want to be notified by Google regarding data and privacy terms.</li>
<li><strong>Time zone: </strong>Your ad scheduling will automatically set to this.</li>
<li><strong>Auto-tagging: </strong>A required setup that will add a GCLID (Google click identifier) to your URLs.</li>
<li><strong>Tracking template:</strong> Any parameters you want included in your URLs for all of the ads in your account.</li>
<li><strong>Third-party measurement:</strong> Where you can link your CRM for data integration.</li>
<li><strong>Call reporting: </strong>How you’ll track calls (if you’re running call extensions, location extensions, or call ads).</li>
<li><strong>Negative keywords: </strong>Terms you negate at the account level (we’ll cover more on negative keywords later).</li>
<li><strong>Auto-apply:</strong> Where you select which optimizations you want Google to apply across your account’s campaigns automatically.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Account-level tips</h3>
<p>As you poke around the account level, here are three general <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/losing-money-in-google-ads">Google Ads tips</a> to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decide how you want your account to be structured: </strong>This question arises constantly: <em>What is the perfect account structure</em><em>? </em>I hate to break it to ya, but there is, truthfully, no magic recipe for structuring your account, and more than one strategy can prove successful. Luckily, there are a few different methods that work well:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Based on the structure of your website:</strong> How is your website structured? Do you have different tabs or pages for different products or offerings? Do you value different product pages over others? If your website is well-structured (which it should be), then it makes sense to structure your Google Ads account in a similar fashion.</li>
<li><strong>By products/services offered: </strong>This is likely the same as the structure of your website, but think about your different services or products offered and structure your account in a similar fashion. For example, let’s say you sell tennis gear; you would want to create a campaign for tennis rackets, tennis balls, tennis clothing, etc. Then, under the tennis rackets campaign, you might create separate ad groups for the brands you sell or perhaps for the size or gender the racket is for. Take a look at your various offerings and decide which ones are most valuable. Is there a very large demand for tennis bags online? Then you might want to run a campaign for tennis bags with a higher budget. Spend some time mapping out your products and deciding how you want to divvy up your budget between campaigns.</li>
<li><strong>Based on locations: </strong>Is location important to your business? Maybe you’re a law office that has <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing/opening-new-location-7-ways-promote-it/">multiple locations</a> across New England, or perhaps you sell development courses in major cities ranging from London to Tokyo. If location targeting is important, then structure it based on this. For example, create a London campaign to sell your development course to only those in a particular radius of the city.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there are many other tactics to structuring your account, but it’s all about taking the time to come up with a rational structure that will be easy to manage, track, and <a href="/blog/ws/2014/04/24/ppc-performance">optimize</a> to get the best results over time. So take the time to ponder various structuring techniques, and decide on the one that works best for your business. Once you’ve decided, I’d recommend actually mapping out the structure on a piece of paper or in an Excel doc to get a full visual of the campaigns and ad groups you’ll be creating. Now, onto a couple more Google Ads account structure tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perform regular audits: </strong>Like with anything in small business marketing, you need to check in on your Google Ads performance regularly. When you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/15/google-ads-account-audit-post-covid">audit your Google Ads account</a> on a scheduled basis, you’re able to find areas for optimization before they turn into headaches.</li>
<li><strong>Be wary of auto-apply recommendations: </strong>Advice from Google Ads is like advice from a stranger—take it with a grain of salt. Google’s auto-applied ads and other optimization recommendations can be helpful at times where you’re short of ideas, but at the end of the day, you will know what’s best for your account.</li>
</ul>
<div id="campaigns">
<h2>The campaign level</h2>
<p>In general, a marketing campaign can mean anything, but in Google Ads, the term “campaign” is the bucket that houses your ad groups. You&#8217;ll set your budget, targeting, the type of ad you want to run, and more at the campaign level. As mentioned above, you can only have one ad <em>type</em> per campaign, but you&#8217;ll have multiple ad <em>groups</em> per campaign and multiple campaigns per account.</p>
<h3>What are the different campaign types in Google Ads?</h3>
<p>Here are the seven different campaign types in Google Ads to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Search: </strong>Text ads that appear on Google Search<span>.</span></li>
<li><strong> Display:</strong> Image ads that appear on websites in the Google Display Network<span>.</span></li>
<li><strong> Shopping: </strong>Product ads on Google Search and the Shopping tab<span>.</span></li>
<li><strong> Video: </strong>Animated ads on YouTube and the Display Network<span>.</span></li>
<li><strong> Demand Gen:</strong> Immersive ads that appear on multiple Google networks<span>.</span></li>
<li><strong> App: </strong>Ads for your app across multiple Google networks<span>.</span></li>
<li><strong>Performance Max: </strong>Ads created from various assets shown across all of Google’s eligible networks.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Another note: </strong>For this post, our anatomy will follow that of an advertiser using Search, Display, and/or Video campaigns. Some components may vary by campaign type, which will be noted throughout. For help with Google Shopping campaign structure, check out <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/25/google-shopping-ads-priority-bidding-structure">post on the Google Shopping priority bidding structure. </a></p>
<h3>Which campaign type should I use?<strong> </strong></h3>
<p>It’s a best practice to run a few different campaign types within your Google Ads account to maximize your performance across Google’s advertising networks. Different campaign types can help you hit different<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/19/ppc-metrics"> PPC metrics</a>, so it’s in your best interest to try at least one or two when starting out.</p>
<p>For example, you may want to run a search campaign to catch folks while they&#8217;re searching on Google, as well as a display campaign for when they&#8217;re browsing other sites across the web. Some campaigns are industry-specific and may not be needed, like Shopping (for ecommerce businesses) or App campaigns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-account-structure-example.jpg" alt="google ads account structure - example account layout" width="935" height="558" class="aligncenter wp-image-94410 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-account-structure-example.jpg 935w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-account-structure-example-480x286.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 935px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>How many campaigns should I have?</h3>
<p>This will all depend on your business size, business model, budget, and more. There’s no right or wrong answer when it comes to what campaign types you should have or how many of them, but it’s a best practice to keep it as manageable as possible.</p>
<p>So, for example, if you’re a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/19/google-ads-for-small-businesses">small business running Google Ads</a> and don’t have the overall budget or bandwidth to realistically stretch across 10 or 20 campaigns, it’s better to start small with one or two for effective advertising rather than be overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you might not always have all your campaigns running at once. You might have seasonal offers, for example, or campaigns that you only run when you have the inventory or budget.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s the best Google Ads campaign structure?</h3>
<p>This is all going to depend on your business size, type, model, and more. There isn&#8217;t a one-size-fits-all formula, but there are some options to consider. Similar to how you&#8217;d approach your overall account structure, take a look at how you group your offerings on your website to inspire your campaign makeup. What do you have unique pages for? Which pages are most popular or of the highest value? If your website is well-structured, you might want to adopt the same system for your campaigns. For <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/franchise-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-location businesses</a>, it might make sense to run campaigns by location since location targeting is set at the campaign level.</p>
<h3>Campaign-level settings</h3>
<p>There’s a lot to play around with at the campaign level, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Campaign name:</strong> Similar to account name, this is how you’ll refer to your campaign and has no impact on performance.</li>
<li><strong>Status:</strong> Paused, enabled, or removed.</li>
<li><strong>Conversion goal:</strong> What you want your campaign to achieve in relation to your conversion actions.</li>
<li><strong>Budget:</strong> Roughly how much your campaign will spend per day.</li>
<li><strong>Bid strategy:</strong> How aggressively you want to bid, based on your goals. See our complete guide to bidding strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Locations:</strong> Where in the world you choose for your campaign’s ads to show, also known as geotargeting.</li>
<li><strong>Languages:</strong> This is not the language of your ad, but what languages you want your ad to show for.</li>
<li><strong>Networks:</strong> In some campaign types, like Google Search, you can opt to show your campaign solely on the Google SERP or also on Google’s subsidiary search engines within its Search Partner Network.</li>
<li><strong>Start and end dates:</strong> If you don’t want to worry about enabling or pausing your campaign, start and end dates can sometimes come in handy.</li>
<li><strong>IP exclusions:</strong> Any specific IP addresses you’d rather not show to.</li>
<li><strong>AI Max for Search campaigns:</strong> For Search campaigns, advertisers have the option to opt into AI automation for asset optimization and more.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Campaign-level tips</h3>
<p>When it comes to running Google Ads, there are a few campaign tips to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Run a variety of campaign types. </strong>This will help you hit different business goals. Plus, they often work synergistically. For example, display campaigns can build brand awareness and improve your search ad performance. Of course, some campaign types are industry-specific and may not apply to your business.</li>
<li><strong>Keep them organized. </strong>Break out your campaigns so they map to your business <span>goals</span>, such as by product or service type, conversion action type, sales funnel stages, or locations. And establish a naming convention that makes sense to anyone managing the account.</li>
<li><strong>Separate out branded campaigns. </strong>These campaigns behave and perform differently from <span>non-branded</span> campaigns, so it’ll be best to budget for, strategize, and report on these separately.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </strong><strong>Is your Google Ads account structure in need of a refresh?</strong> Find out, and get an instant account report, using our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Free Google Ads Grader</a>!</p>
<div id="ad-groups"></div>
<h2>The ad group level</h2>
<p>Going down one tier under campaigns, we have ad groups. Each ad group contains a group of related keywords, their associated ads, and a landing page. One sidenote, though, for PMax campaigns, these are known as asset groups.</p>
<h3>I only want to create one ad&#8211;why do I need an ad group?</h3>
<p>You’ll notice when creating an ad that you’re prompted to create an ad group. This is a required part of the process, even if you just want one ad. But as we’ll talk about later, it’s best to<strong> have at least two different versions of your ad</strong> so you can test and see what performs best.</p>
<p>In most cases, you won’t have just one ad in your Google Ads account.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s an example to explain why: </strong>Let’s say you’re a home service business and you want to advertise two main offers: installations and repairs. Installations are of higher value to you than repairs, so you separate these into two different campaigns.</p>
<p>That way, you can allocate more budget toward installations (because, as we just learned, budget is set at the campaign level, not the ad level). But you have different types of installations, like windows, gutters, and more.</p>
<p>You want to keep the same location, network, and device targeting for each of these offers—so it works to keep them in the same campaign—but the targeted keywords and ad copy for your window installation ad will, of course, be totally different from your gutter installation ad.</p>
<p>The same goes for your different types of repairs. So, you’ll want to have a separate ad group for each type of installation. Not only will this keep your account organized, but it will also keep your costs low.</p>
<h3>How do thematic ad groups lower my ad costs?</h3>
<p>The higher your Quality Score, the lower your cost per click, and you achieve high Quality Scores by keeping your ads and landing pages super relevant to their keywords. So, if you put all of your installation ads in one ad group, you’ll have window installation ads connected to gutter installation keywords—not very relevant.</p>
<p>Plus, you can only have one landing page per ad group, so you’d need to make it general enough to cover everything—once again, not very relevant.</p>
<p><strong>If you separate your ad groups out, you can ensure tight alignment between your keywords, ad, and landing page for a better play in the Google Ads auction.</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-cost-google-ads-auction-formula.jpg" alt="google ads cost - google ads auction formula" width="935" height="326" class="aligncenter wp-image-91781 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-cost-google-ads-auction-formula.jpg 935w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-cost-google-ads-auction-formula-480x167.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 935px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>How many ad groups should I have per campaign?</h3>
<p><strong>You should have no more than roughly 7-10 ad groups per campaign. </strong>You’ll most likely need even less than that. The more centralized to your main goals or offerings, the better. If you have a ton of ad groups, that’s a sign you need another campaign!</p>
<h3>How many keywords should I have per ad group?</h3>
<p>You should have only one keyword theme per ad group (as we established), so you may only need to start with 10-20 keywords max. With all the keyword matching updates, we don’t need as many as we once did, so stick to your core terms and avoid muddying up the waters with a ton of variations.</p>
<h3>How many ads should I have per ad group?</h3>
<p>You should aim to have two or three ads per ad group. This is a little confusing since responsive search ads themselves rotate through different copy combinations within the same ad, but you should still always be testing more than one overall approach or tone at a time, such as an RSA with a set of positively-framed headlines and descriptions vs one with those that are negatively framed.</p>
<p>Note that<strong> you can only have three enabled RSAs per ad group</strong>, or otherwise you’ll get a flag that looks like this when you try to create another ad:</p>

<h3>Ad group-level settings</h3>
<p>Here is a quick preview of what you can adjust at the ad group level:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ad group name:</strong> Same as campaign and account levels, name your ad groups what would make the most sense to you. Again, the names of your assets are not a performance factor.</li>
<li><strong>Ad group status:</strong> Whether your ad group is paused, enabled, or removed.</li>
<li><strong>Ad group settings for AI Max: </strong>How you choose to leverage AI to optimize your brand lists, keywords, location targets, and more.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ad group-level tips</h3>
<p>Recommended best practices for ad groups are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Do organize your ad groups systematically.</strong> Stick to core <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/29/single-theme-ad-groups">ad group themes</a> and break them out in a way that makes the most sense for you. Themed ad groups will help to keep your ad relevance high, which is essential if you want to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/24/how-to-compete-in-google-ads">compete in Google Ads without having to hike up your bids</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t use too many or too few ad groups. </strong>While you don’t want to stuff everything into one ad group, you also don’t want to break them out too much into a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/03/the-case-against-skags">SKAG (single keyword ad group) </a>structure as either option can equally be a pain to manage.</li>
<li><strong>Do get ready to change these regularly</strong>. As a PPC expert, pausing, adjusting, and moving around ad groups and their components is the bulk of my optimization work.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t add in ad group components just to hit our recommended numbers above.</strong> Those are guidelines, so don’t break your back squeezing in an unnecessary keyword or ad group to hit an ideal number.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div id="keywords"></div>
<h2>The keyword level</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/ppc-keyword">Keywords</a> act as your “north star” within your Google Ads account. For Search, they indicate to Google which types of queries you want your ads to show for.</p>
<p>Note: PMax campaigns use <span>s</span>earch <span>t</span>hemes instead of keywords.</p>
<h3>What are Google Ads keyword match types?</h3>
<p>When you select or edit your keywords, you’ll also have to assign them a <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7478529?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">match type</a>. There are three match types to choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul></ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong> Broad match:</strong> Least restrictive; matches your ad to any queries related to that keyword.</li>
<li><strong> Phrase match: </strong>Matches your ad to any queries that include your keyword or include anything that means the same thing as the keyword.</li>
<li><strong>Exact match: </strong>Most restrictive; matches your ad to queries that are your keyword or are of the same meaning as the keyword.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/keyword-match-type-chart-e1758567069313.webp" alt="keyword match types in google ads" width="680" height="432" class="aligncenter wp-image-87112 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/keyword-match-type-chart-e1758567069313.webp 680w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/keyword-match-type-chart-e1758567069313-480x270.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 680px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Keyword-level settings</h3>
<p>As you add keywords, these are the settings you will apply:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Keyword bid:</strong> Only necessary if you’re using manual bidding.</li>
<li><strong> Match type: </strong>This will depend on your strategy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Keyword-level tips</h3>
<p>Check out these quick Google Ads keyword tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do your PPC keyword research.</strong> This is non-negotiable! Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">keyword research tools</a> to identify the most relevant keywords for your offerings and make sure you’re capturing transactional or commercial intent.</li>
<li><strong>Mix up your match types.</strong> This will give you flexibility to see which match type works best for your core terms.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain your keyword lists. </strong>Adding your keywords to your ad group is just the first step in the process. You need to be regularly mining your search terms report to find new keywords to add, negative keywords to negate, and low-performing keywords to remove, pause, or separate out.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t just go for the lowest CPC keywords. </strong>Some keywords are going to have a higher average cost per click than others, but these will typically bring in higher value clicks and conversions.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t ignore other targeting options in favor of keywords. </strong>These may be the building blocks of Google Ads, but you still need to pay attention to your location, device, and audience targeting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The ad level</h2>
<p>We’re now down to the most granular part of your Google Ads account anatomy: the ad level. This is where we get to the good stuff: your ads! These, of course, are what your targeted users see. Who knew that for the one ad you see on a website or SERP, there are so many doors to open to get there?! When building out a campaign, the ad level is where you input text and upload or generate creative assets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-benchmarks-example-ads-on-serp.webp" alt="google ads benchmarks - example ad serp" width="800" height="379" class="aligncenter wp-image-91526 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-benchmarks-example-ads-on-serp.webp 800w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-benchmarks-example-ads-on-serp-480x227.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An example of what ads look like on the SERP. </em></p>
<p>If you’re creating a search ad, it’s important to stick to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/10/responsive-search-ads">responsive search ad copy best practices</a>, like pinning headlines and descriptions sparingly, and using keywords carefully, rather than excessively.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/responsive-search-ads-wordstream.webp" alt="how responsive search ads work" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92499 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/responsive-search-ads-wordstream.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/responsive-search-ads-wordstream-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Ad-level settings</h3>
<p>There are a couple of components you can change within the ad creation portal:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ad components:</strong> Assets like your headlines, descriptions, videos, or images.</li>
<li><strong>Landing page URL: </strong>Where you’ll be pointing your ad to. All ads within the same ad group have to point to the same landing page URL. All ads within a campaign have to point to the same domain.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-account-structure-ad-creation-portal.webp" alt="google ads account structure - ad creation portal" width="750" height="576" class="aligncenter wp-image-94407 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-account-structure-ad-creation-portal.webp 750w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-account-structure-ad-creation-portal-480x369.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Ad-level tips</h3>
<p>Remember the following when creating your Google Ads:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be strategic with your ad copy. </strong>A great ad includes the right mix of features, benefits, differentiators, and CTAs. Use these tips for writing exceptional ads.</li>
<li><strong>Always be testing. </strong>Until mind-reading becomes widely available, this is the only way you’ll know what type of ad best appeals to your customers. Try swapping different keywords to go along with your ads, different images on Display ads, video lengths on Video ads, or include different language that speaks to a specific product price or service offering.</li>
</ul>

<p>Paying attention to each aspect of your Google Ads account can pay off in the long run, as you’ll have a fully customized strategy.

<h3>1. Create seasonal Google Ads search campaigns</h3>
<p>Whether you’re in retail, B2B, finance, or insurance, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/performance-max-holiday-strategies">Google Ads</a> is a great place to get seasonal! How can one do this? Create a campaign targeting holiday shoppers!</p>
<p>For instance, if you sell women’s apparel, you can target keywords like “gifts for mother” or “holiday sweaters.” Then create specific ads and landing pages offering incentives to shop with your store during the holiday season.</p>
<p>Perhaps you give free shipping if they purchase over $100 worth of clothing? Or let’s say you gift wrap for free? Maybe you offer $20 off if the gift is ordered before a certain date? Highlight these benefits and make sure your landing pages capture the spirit of the holidays.</p>
<p>Not in B2C? Not to worry! There are still ways to get creative with your Google Ads campaigns during the holidays. As holiday shopping goes underway everyone is looking for ways to cut costs, so promote some special seasonal discounts on AdWords. Take advantage of ad extensions to take up more space in the results, get a higher chance of site visits, and highlight the special things your company is doing for the season.</p>
<p>Here are a few quick Google Ads holiday marketing tips to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use seasonal ad copy.</strong> Include words and phrases like “holiday” and “&#8217;tis the season.”</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t use cliches. </strong>Use these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/01/holiday-copywriting">ideas for cliche-free holiday copywriting</a> instead.</li>
<li><strong>Ad assets are your friends.</strong> Enhancing your ads with additional ad assets will help you eat up more real estate on the SERP during this competitive time.</li>
<li><strong>Highlight special offers.</strong> Be sure to capitalize on any seasonal deals you may be running.</li>
<li><strong>Instill a sense of urgency. </strong>Use copy like “40% off if you order before Dec 15!” or “Take Advantage Before It’s Too Late!”</li>
<li><strong>Make sure you’re relevant. </strong>Conduct holiday-related <a href="/keywords">keyword research</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Set up ad scheduling.</strong> That way, you can bid on the times when your shoppers are searching.</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind that everyone is looking for a deal during the holiday season! Pairing this with <a href="/blog/ws/2017/04/05/how-to-increase-urgency">a sense of urgency</a> in your ad copy is a way is a great way to win over hectic seasonal shoppers.</p>

<h3>2. Gift yourself with Google Shopping Ads</h3>

These are the perfect treat for your busy online holiday shoppers because they’re extremely convenient and can lead to purchases happening almost instantaneously.</p>
<p>Of course, the challenge will be standing out next to your competition in such a visual manner, but as long as your images are enticing and your campaign is set up properly, these babies can work wonders on converting shoppers during the holiday season.

<h3>3. Step up your Instagram ad game</h3>
<p>Instagram is the perfect place to make your holiday game shine! Users are already there posting family selfies and pictures of their decorations, so why not break through the clutter with a fun holiday ad? While posting organically to your account is great as well, to really stand out it’s worth throwing some money behind your very best holiday pics.</p>
<p>Whether it be your team dressed in ugly sweaters or your office dog with a monster mask on, get creative and cheery and bring in those <a href="/blog/ws/2017/05/22/best-instagram-ads">Instagram hearts</a>! Check out this example from a restaurant in my neighborhood. Not only did they get seasonal with a new drink recipe (pumpkin margarita, yum!), but they placed it near a carved pumpkin and used some seasonal emojis in their ad copy.</p>

<div id="holiday-marketing-ideas-social-media-giveaway"></div>
<h3>4. Run a holiday giveaway on social media</h3>
<p>Speaking of Instagram, another great way to utilize the platform is by running a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/social-media-holidays/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social holiday</a> giveaway. I’d recommend running a social campaign across all the major platforms your business uses (Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, etc.) to get more and more eyes on your business.</p>
<p>And who doesn’t like free stuff, especially during the holidays (hello, re-gifting!)? Whether it be a big discount, a free add-on with an order or just something completely for free, get into the holiday spirit of giving. Typically, asking followers to comment, share, like, etc. are great tactics to get even more engagement on your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/holiday-giveaways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">giveaway</a>.</p>

<h3>5. Get seasonal in email</h3>
<p>If you’re not incorporating the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/12/01/holiday-email-templates">holidays into your email marketing campaigns</a>, you’re making a big mistake! Holidays instill powerful memories into your shoppers’ minds, so enticing them with fun seasonal emails is a great way to connect in their inboxes.</p>
<p>For instance, this marketing email from Rent the Runway instantly caught my eye. I may not have ended up renting for Halloween specifically, but it did remind me that I could use their service for an upcoming wedding.</p>

<p>Pay close attention to your <a href="/blog/ws/2014/03/31/email-subject-lines">email subject lines</a> when marketing for the holidays. Similar to ad copy in your seasonal Google Ads campaigns, it’s important to give them an incentive to shop with you, and instilling urgency is a great strategy for your subject lines.</p>
<div id="holiday-marketing-ideas-remarketing"></div>
<h3>6. Rev up your remarketing strategy</h3>
<p>Remember that time you almost bought that dress, and then you saw it again and took that as a sign, so you went ahead and bought it? Sadly, that was not fate, that was remarketing! <a href="/google-remarketing">Remarketing</a> is when you cookie your audience to later remind them what they’re missing out on.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you’re already remarketing, but if you aren’t you need to be! Remarketing gives you a chance to remind potential customers that they abandoned their shopping cart or landing page. The holiday season is what I like to call a <strong>mandatory remarketing season</strong> because people are busy and making decisions fast. Therefore, if they dropped off your website or <a href="/blog/ws/2016/03/17/shopping-cart-abandonment">left their cart half full</a>, they might just need a quick reminder.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="fec949f4-ef66-47c2-a802-71a8e3ee4687" data-langcode="en">

</div>
<p>This is where remarketing comes into play. When configuring your remarking lists for the holidays, ensure your membership duration is shorter than normal. For instance, if you typically allow users to be added to your remarking list for 30 days, reduce that to 15 days. That will increase the chances of the individual seeing your ads more frequently closer to the holiday.</p>
<p>And make sure you’re remarketing on all the channels you’re running <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/08/holiday-advertising-best-practices-2020">holiday advertising </a>on (Facebook, Google, Instagram, Bing, etc.)</p>
<div id="holiday-marketing-ideas-audience-segmentation"></div>
<h3>7. Reimagine your audience segmentation strategy</h3>
<p>As a digital marketer, you and I both know that you’re sitting on piles of user data that you can use to your benefit for future campaigns. The question is, are you actually using this data?</p>
<p>If not, there is no better time to get crafty with your <a href="/blog/ws/2017/08/28/behavioral-segmentation">segmentation</a> messaging than the holiday season! Personalizing your messaging is a proven strategy to connect with consumers on a deeper level. If you have a large segment of mothers who express interest in your products or services, create content that shows how your business empathizes with how stressful the holidays can be with a full house of kids. Target a segment of leads with similar hobbies with ad copy relevant to those interests.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>Utilizing the data you’ve collected through platforms like Facebook, GA4, and Google Ads is a great place to start. Also, take advantage of lookalike audiences on these platforms to go after a new segment of leads similar to a high-converting audience.</p>
<div id="holiday-marketing-ideas-webinar"></div>
<h3>8. Conduct a holiday-themed webinar</h3>
<p>Does your company hold a weekly, monthly, or even quarterly webinar for customers or prospects? Webinars are a great way to teach your audience in a more personalized manner, which can in-turn lead to a natural sale or upsell.</p>
<p>However, webinars are common. I probably get about 20-60 webinar invites in my inbox every month from various companies I’ve come across over the years, but the problem is those webinar invites often go unnoticed. This is where holidays can really help add a fun element to an otherwise rudimentary webinar invite.</p>

<h3>9. Make your holiday marketing pull at the heartstrings</h3>
<p>When I picture the holidays I see Christmas lights, cookies, Santa Claus, and reindeer, but what I feel is that warm fuzzy feeling of enjoying time with family. While holidays may not be loved by all, most people have an emotional tie to them. And we all know that <a href="/blog/ws/2017/06/01/high-converting-landing-page-images">emotions drive action</a>, so now is the time to get emotional with your marketing.</p>
<p>Emotional doesn’t mean you need to make every one of your audience members cry – even using humor in your messaging can go a long way during the holiday season. If you need some inspiration, check out these resources:</p>

<h3>10. Get creative with holiday video marketing</h3>
<p>There is no better way to communicate a holiday message than with video. Whether it’s a festive webinar invite video that you send via email, a video added to your customer page to wish all of your customers holiday cheer, or a wacky video that you post on social media of your CEO dressed as a reindeer, get creative, and have fun with video to spread the cheer throughout your marketing campaigns.</p>

<h3>11. Throw a holiday party</h3>
<p>Throw a holiday party? Ho-ho-hold up! That sounds expensive… Well, it can be, but you can be strategic as to who you invite. For instance, you may decide to focus your invitations on a select group of your hottest local leads, and simply have them come to the office for some holiday drinks, appetizers, and games. There’s no better way to build strong relationship with prospects and customers then giving them actual face time, so why not use the holidays as an excuse to do just that. Create a festive e-invite, and get the eggnog cooking!</p>

<h3>12. Advertise on Amazon</h3>
<p>If you’re in the retail business, you need to be putting some money into your Amazon ads.</p>

</div>
<p>James Thomson, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/holiday-marketing-campaigns/#cmtoc_anchor_id_6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President of Prosper Show</a>, has some advice for Amazon advertisers to abide by during the holidays. “If you sell on Amazon, be sure to get your FBA inventory to Amazon by November 10, at the latest,” says Thomson. “If you expect to sell through most inventory, calculate the cost of a stock-out vs. holding more inventory…. It’s usually better to have more inventory in FBA. And don’t forget to plan for inventory you expect to sell in January…so many companies run out of inventory in early January when suppliers are slow to replenish.”</p>

<h3>13. Create festive and entertaining display ads</h3>
<p>Do you have an in-house designer? Perfect! If not, you might want to start thinking about your needs from outside resources soon to plan for your holiday display campaigns.</p>
<p>Festive <a href="/blog/ws/2017/09/26/how-to-create-facebook-ads">images on Facebook</a> and the Google Display Network can really help create a cheerful connection between your brand and your leads. The example ad below from Hotel Tonight’s holiday campaign last year really hit the nail on the head. The image pops out and immediately grabs you in, and makes you laugh because who doesn’t have the one (or more than one) crazy relative? This ad is relatable, entertaining, and festive all at once.</p>

<h3>14. Build customer loyalty with personalized gifts</h3>
<p>Last, but definitely not least, don’t forget about <a href="/blog/ws/2016/04/19/customer-marketing-strategies">marketing to your customers</a>.</p>
<p>Last year, in my previous role managing a large set of high-paying and strategic customers, I spent several weeks planning the physical gifts I wanted to mail out to people. I also ordered a huge set of family-style holiday postcards with festive pictures of my colleagues on them and organized a card-writing party.</p>
<p>Small acts of personalized kindness towards your customers make a huge impact and can strengthen the relationship, turning a happy customer into a <a href="/blog/ws/2017/02/24/brand-advocacy-paid-social">brand advocate</a>.</p>
<div id="holiday-marketing-ideas-appreciation-email"></div>
<h3>15. Send out a (good!) customer appreciation email</h3>
<p>This is the time of year to reach out to your customers, thank them for their loyalty, and wish them a happy holiday season. Though a short piece of content, there are a lot of dos and don&#8217;ts here.

<div id="holiday-marketing-ideas-year-in-review-email"></div>
<h3>16. Try a year-in-review email</h3>
<p>This email is different from a holiday greeting. Instead, it gives a more specific wrap-up from the year and can take a few different forms. When done right, it can engage your readers, attract new customers, and encourage existing ones to stay on board with you in the coming year.

<div id="holiday-marketing-ideas-playlist"></div>
<h3>17. Create a shareable holiday playlist</h3>
<p>The holidays are an unquestionably upbeat time of year. Many of your customers are likely taking time off to relax and listen to the sweet sounds of the season. Connect with them through music by creating a shareable holiday playlist on a public streaming platform, like<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/13/spotify-advertising" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Spotify</a> or Pandora.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/video-marketing-for-small-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holiday marketing idea</a> like this can provide you with engaging content for social media, where you might promote your playlist by sharing individual songs or spreading the word in your posts or stories. Ask your followers to comment with their favorite holiday tunes. You could even create an Instagram Story poll that asks your audience what songs they might want to have added. As a bonus, you could play the playlist in your store or office all winter! Just be sure to include your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/08/business-name-ideas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business name</a> or logo in the playlist name or on your streaming profile. That way, you’ll stay top-of-mind to your customers as they listen along with you.</p>

<p>Why in the world is Snapchat so popular, especially amongst Millennials? Well, one of the biggest reasons is the ability to apply fun and creative filters showing your audience the cool park you’re visiting or the Sunday Funday adventures you’ve embarked on. Even more than a fun way to use the platform, the Snapchat filter is an extremely useful marketing tool for businesses. How so?</p>
<p>In this guide, you’ll learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>What Snapchat filter is</li>
<li>How to create a customer Snapchat filter</li>
<li>How to use a Snapchat filter for your brand</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is a Snapchat filter?</h2>
<p>A Snapchat filter is an overlay for photographs that you can create and purchase to advertise your brand. Also called a Snapchat Geofilter, is essentially the tool in the app that allows businesses (and personal accounts) to create your very own custom Snapchat filters promoting your brand or message.</p>
<p>You can make filters available for lengths of time, as well as in specific locations. A Snapchat filter that targets a particular location is a Geofilter.</p>
<p>“A Geofilter is a location-based overlay you can find by swiping right on your Snapchat photo,” says <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/snapchat-geofilter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HubSpot</a>. “It’s a particularly useful tool for promoting your business… A Geofilter can help you alert foot traffic to your business’s nearby proximity, and spread awareness to users both in and outside your chosen location.”</p>
<h2>Why businesses should use Snapchat filters</h2>
<p>Snapchat filters are one of the main ways Snapchat was able to successfully grow their popularity. Before Snapchat introduced the world to these swipeable filters, <strong>the app was download 600,000 times each day worldwide</strong>; <strong>once Snapchat filters were added to the platform the daily download rate DOUBLED</strong>.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>A Snapchat filter, left, is overlay, as opposed to a VR lens, right.</em></p>
<p>One <a href="https://forbusiness.snapchat.com/blog/apposphere-how-the-apps-you-use-impact-your-daily-life-and-emotions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> found that one of the <strong>main reasons users spend time on Snapchat is because of the filter feature</strong>. Realizing this, Snapchat has made it possible for businesses to grow their brands by creating their own branded Snapchat filters.</p>
<p>Geofilters also have been found to get a wide amount of visibility with <strong>40 to 60% of the daily Snapchat audience seeing them</strong>, according to <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/snapchat-geofilter">HubSpot</a>. In fact, a Geofilter run by Bell Media for students at the University of Alabama reached <strong>19,000 people in just five hours</strong>!</p>
<p>Now that you understand how valuable these babies are, here is how you can go about creating your very own Snapchat filters to draw even more eyes onto your brand.</p>
<h2>How to create customer Snapchat filters</h2>
<p>When it comes to using Snapchat filters for business there are a few different routes you can go. You can choose to design and purchase a filter from within the Snapchat app without making a Snapchat Business Account or you can first create a business account (if you do not already have one) and buy and create filters for multiple locations with more precise demographic targeting capabilities.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a quick and easy route to make a business filter, then creating one as a guest may be the way to go. However, creating a business account will give you a higher level of control, and also provide you with more <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/snapchat-advertising-for-small-businesses/">Snapchat advertising</a> capabilities. Here is how to go about <a href="https://businesshelp.snapchat.com/en-US/article/get-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creating your own</a> business account.</p>
<p>Now that that is out of the way, here are the super simple steps to create your very own custom Snapchat filters:</p>
<p><strong>Step #1</strong>: Go to the “<a href="https://create.snapchat.com/org/guest/purchase/choose-product" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Create Your Own” website</a> to start and click “Create Filter.”</p>

<p><strong>Step #2: </strong>Upload your custom-made design or choose to use Snapchat’s one of existing templates and add any unique text, images, or emoji of your choosing. Pro tip: Include your business logo to build your brand recognition. Once things are looking fabulous, hit “Next.”</p>
<p><strong>Step #3</strong>: Customize your start and end time for when your filter will be available for use. This window is adjustable and can be set as a “repeating event,” as well. You can even choose to run your filter during specific times of the day or week.</p>
<p><strong>Step #4</strong>: Give your filter a home by setting up a “Geofence.” The “Geofence” allows you to target a precise location where your filter will be available.</p>
<p><strong>Step #5:</strong> Choose if your filter is for personal or business use, submit your order, and wait for Snapchat confirmation. It really is that easy!</p>
<h2>How to make your brand&#8217;s Snapchat filters successful</h2>
<p>Now that you know how to set-up your very own Snapchat filter, you need to make sure you’re using them effectively for your business. Well, we have done some digging and these five tips that will ensure your filters are not only acceptable, but phenomenal at engaging your target audience!</p>
<h3>1. Set a plan with specific goals</h3>
<p>Just blindly creating Snapchat filters for your businesses radius is likely not going to be super effective at engaging your audience. And, worse, it could feel random or even obnoxious to Snappers. This is why having a specific plan in place as to what the goal of your filter is and why you want people to use it will be most effective.</p>
<p>For instance, are you a floral shop running campaigns around Mother’s Day flower arrangements? Then a couple weeks pre-Mother’s Day when folks are starting to think about sending out deliveries may be a good time to sponsor a Mother’s Day related Snapchat filter with this reminder.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0c8fd62c-c7f2-429b-a625-04f00168632c" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>The bottom line is that having a goal set and purpose for your filter will ensure it will actually spark interest and benefit your bottom line.</p>
<h3>2. Put yourself your customer’s shoes</h3>
<p>Would you, as a potential customer, use this Snapchat filter? This is the question you should always ask as you are creating your Snapchat Geofilter. If it does not feel like something your audience members would actually use, then what is the point?</p>
<p>Making it fun, entertaining, and timely are some ways to ensure your customers will use it. Perhaps playing off a recent SNL skit or incorporating some holiday related content that gets your audience members to feel warm and fuzzy inside. Always thinking about how to relate most to your audience members, and getting into their mindset will ensure your business Snapchat filters resonate.</p>
<h3>3. Follow the specs outlined by Snapchat</h3>
<p>While this one might sound obvious, it can be easy to overlook. Why waste time and money designing your beautiful Snapchat filter to have it disapproved by the platform? Here are the artwork guidelines <a href="https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/article/odg-howto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outlined by Snapchat</a> that you need to follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>File dimensions: 1080px wide by 2340x high</li>
<li>Max file size: 300 KB</li>
<li>DPI: 72 (*error message is DPI too high)</li>
<li>File type: PNG with a transparent background</li>
<li>Ensure your filter only takes up roughly 25% of either the top or bottom of the screen (Snapchatters want to see themselves!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Snapchat also provides are longer list of submission guidelines and tips <a href="https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/submission-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h3>4. Simplicity is best</h3>
<p>You’ll notice the last bit of advice in Snapchat’s list of guidelines for filter approval includes ensuring your filter takes up no more then 25% of the frame at the top or bottom. This is for a reason! Your audience members are using Snapchat primarily for selfie-taking and do not want a huge logo of your brand draping across their face.</p>
<p>Stick to simple designs that are relevant and do not take up tons of space. If you really want your target audience to use your filter, you need to ensure they are not overly salesy. Remember, the main reason people use filters is not to promote your business.  Here’s a great example from The Detroit Zoo.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="cc17fc5d-1c7c-4378-9480-412e4add4c76" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<h3>5. Evaluate and improve as time goes on</h3>
<p>Just like with all of your marketing campaigns, you should be evaluating the effectiveness of your Snapchat filters. Luckily, Snapchat has a built-in analytics tool to gain insight into how your filters were used and viewed by Snappers. To take a look at your metrics click on the three-line icon on the top left-hand corner, select “My Orders,” chose your filter, and view the metrics. You’ll be able to evaluate filter metrics like swipes, uses, views, and overall usage. These analytics can also be downloaded to a CSV.</p>
<h2>Set up your Snapchat filters today!</h2>
<p>Now that you have all the information handy, it is time to conquer the world of Snapchat filters. Your audience could use some new and fun filters in this new normal we are all living in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is something I find so soothing about taking a “mind break” to scroll through my Instagram feed of beautiful, high-quality images. And many of these professional-like photos are taken by your average iPhone owner who has simply become a master of Instagram filters.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-filters-examples.jpg" alt="Instagram feed with filters" width="760" height="508" /></div>
<p>Whether you’re just starting to dip your feet in the world of filtering your photographs or trying to up your game in 2020, you have come to the right place! In this guide we’re going to get you up to speed on everything you thought you already knew about Instagram filters, plus so much more. You’ll learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why Instagram filters are important.</li>
<li>The essential guidelines for using an Instagram filter.</li>
<li>Which Instagram filter is the most popular.</li>
<li>How to use Instagram filters like top brands on insta.</li>
</ul>
<p>But first, let’s review the basics …</p>
<h2>What is an Instagram filter?</h2>
<p>An Instagram filter is a feature within the social platform that allows you to edit your photo with one click, by simply applying pre-set edits to the image that Instagram has created for you.</p>
<p>The good old Instagram filter was first launched in 2011 with some simple options to filter your photograph with a higher resolution, an optional border, or some nice tilt-shift effects. While these options may seem basic now, it was a whole new world for individuals lacking photo-editing chops.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Instagram allows you to choose from a whopping 25 filters! Here’s an example of a cake I made but photographed in pretty terrible lighting. The first un-filtered photograph is on the left. The middle is filtered with Instagram’s “Gingham” filter, and the right provides a vintage black-and-white feel with the “Inkwell” filter.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-filters.jpg" alt="one photo of a cake with three different Instagram filters" width="739" height="414" /></div>
<p>As you can see, simply clicking a button and applying a filter allows you to drastically change the look and feel of the original photograph, which brings me to my next point.</p>
<h2>3 essential rules for Instagram filters</h2>
<p>While Instagram filtering may seem easy and fun, it is important to not get carried away with it, especially for marketers using their feed to convert followers into customers. To ensure your filter game stays in check with your business goals, keep the below three guidelines top of mind.</p>
<h3>Be consistent</h3>
<p>Your feed needs to feel consistent so users are not put-off by mixed messages from your business. Consistency has also statistically proven to be successful for marketers. In fact, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/20/instagram-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60% of the top brands</a><strong> use the same filter for every post</strong>!</p>
<h3>Do not “over-filter” your photographs</h3>
<p>Okay, here it goes: Please, please, please do not over-filter your photographs! While exploring the filter world, you will notice that Instagram gives you more editing options even after applying a filter, like increasing the saturation or adding a “tilt shift” (essentially some blur to certain areas of the image). These features are really cool, fun to play with, and can lead to some beautiful results. Unless you get carried away—which is easy to do!</p>
<p>Take this example below of the middle image of my cake with a bunch more edits make to it.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-filters-cake-example.jpg" alt="the same cake photo &quot;over-filtered&quot;" width="278" height="497" /></div>
<p>While it might not look awful upon first glance, once you look at it more you will notice how harsh the colors became due to over-saturating the image. You will also notice so much of the detail was lost in the white rosettes with too much exposure. There are many other issues with these edits, but the takeaway is <strong>do not</strong> get carried away, and always do your best to enhance the beauty of your original image rather than dampen it.</p>
<h3>Ensure your Instagram filter choices stay &#8220;on brand”</h3>
<p>Lastly, make sure the filters you chose stay “on brand.” This is not just with your feeds look, but with your entire company brand. For example, if you are selling party supplies and your filters are all black and white and grim, this does not give off your brand’s bright and celebratory vibe. Make sure to observe your other marketing images and ensure new ones take on a similar look so leads do not feel confused when seeing you outside of Instagram.</p>
<h2>What Instagram filters are most popular?</h2>
<p>Now perhaps you are not feeling risky enough to choose your own filter, and hope for the best. Luckily, <a href="https://www.canva.com/learn/popular-instagram-filters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canva</a> recently analyzed filter popularity over one million Instagram photographs around the globe and ranked them according to popularity. Here are the top three most popular:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Clarendon:</strong> Clarendon is helpful for brightening, highlighting, and enhancing your photos to make then glisten amongst their peers. We are not surprised Clarendon topped the list!</li>
<li><strong>Gingham:</strong> This is the filter I used in the middle cake photo above. It has a very nice vintage feel.</li>
<li><strong>Juno:</strong> This lovely filter adds saturation and warmth.</li>
</ol>
<p>While it is always safe to go with popular filters, every photo is unique so make sure to choose the filter that gives your photograph the best possible makeover and aligns with your brands vibe.</p>
<h2>5 Examples of Brands that Filter Effectively</h2>
<p>Need further inspiration? Here are some brands who filter like pros.</p>
<h3>1. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lululemon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">luluemon</a></h3>
<p>The pricey fitness line is known not just for its higher end yoga wear but also for its effective marketing and brand campaigns. Lululemon’s Instagram presence is no exception. Scrolling through lulu’s feed it is easy to see that their filter game is top notch. Every photo has a consistently clean, crisp, and motivational feel to it.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-filters-lululemon-example.jpg" alt="lululemon Instagram profile" width="496" height="627" /></div>
<p>As you can see below, the filters are basically the same in all of these photographs, providing sharp visuals focusing in on the shine of each photograph. This type of filtering consistency works really well, and lululemon is one successful clothing brand that proves this to be true.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-filters-lululemon-example-feed.jpg" alt="lululemon Instagram feed" width="503" height="664" /></div>
<h3>2.  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/westelm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">West Elm</a></h3>
<p>West Elm is known for its modern furniture that focuses on clean and calming colors like greens, blues, natural woods, and whites. The Instagram filters they use on their beautiful rooms reflect the look of their furniture and brand.</p>
<p>As you can see below, the photographs all have a very clean, bright, and natural filter applied to them giving a very desirable and consistent look to all of their photos.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-filters-examples-west-elm.jpg" alt="West Elm Instagram feed" width="507" height="507" /></div>
<p>Doesn’t it just make you want to go furniture shopping? (Which, I’m sure, means that West Elm is accomplishing its goal!).</p>
<h3>3. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jetblue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JetBlue</a></h3>
<p>Another brand that has a great Instagram is JetBlue, and filtering is a big part of that. I love how JetBlue has taken its name and applied it to the way the team filters their photographs: These Instagram filters focus on enhancing the blue tones in each and every image. Just take a look at the consistency of their feed.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-filters-examples-jet-blue.jpg" alt="JetBlue Instagram feed" width="504" height="506" /></div>
<p>Even this photograph below that captures the inside of a JetBlue plane is shining blue across my feed.  Having such a consistent filter game that ties so closely to your brand is a huge takeaway from JetBlue’s Instagram strategy.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-filters-examples-jet-blue-photo.jpg" alt="JetBlue Instagram photo" width="591" height="589" /></div>
<h3>4. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sephora/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sephora</a></h3>
<p>Okay, Sephora, I see you! And I am not a big makeup person, but Sephora has the Instagram filtering game down. The makeup store’s Instagram photos all feel fierce, bright, and energizing, leaving the audience wanting more. Yes, Sephora is another big brand name that can afford a very talented social media marketer, and it definitely shows!</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-filters-examples-sephora.jpg" alt="Sephora Instagram" width="677" height="669" /></div>
<p>But that doesn’t mean you can’t do something similar if you’re working with a smaller marketing budget. So go ahead and scroll through their feed for some filtering inspo.</p>
<h3><strong>5. </strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/hubspot/"><strong>HubSpot</strong></a></h3>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, I wanted to give a shout out to a non-glam brand for being on top of its Instagram filtering game. HubSpot is a marketing software company that clearly knows a thing or two about its audience. HubSpot’s Instagram posts feel informative and educational, without being overwhelming. Most importantly, they are filtered in a consistent way that makes them super readable and aligns with the HubSpot brand.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-filters-examples-hubspot.jpg" alt="HubSpot Instagram" width="673" height="448" /></div>
<p>The biggest takeaway here is that Instagram filtering should definitely not be put on the backburner. While it might seem like one of the easier components of your job, it is also one that needs to be thought through to ensure your posts are beautifully on-brand and grab the attention of your target audience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With 1 billion people using the social platform each month and <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 200 million Instagrammers</a><strong> visiting at least one business profile daily</strong>, Instagram is a must for businesses. The question really is why <em>wouldn’t</em> you want to grow your brand on this platform?</p>
<p>Especially now, when social distancing is mandated and more people than ever staying home, the time we all spend online is growing. Instagram is becoming both a social home and a welcomed distraction.</p>

<p>Whether users are watching videos of the very trendy Dalgona coffee being whipped together, seeking out an escape from their couch, or just using the platform to kill time between meals, your business has a real opportunity to reach them on Instagram—and an opportunity to grow while doing so. However, this growth is not just going to happen. Here are 10 strategies for Instagram growth that you can start working on now.</p>
<h2>1. Post frequently and consistently</h2>
<p>Without consistent posting, your audience’s expectations and interests are going to subside. If you post every day for a while but then you don’t post again for a month, your followers are either going to be confused or have forgotten about your completely. In fact, they may no longer be following you when you finally decide to post again.</p>
<p>“Keeping a consistent schedule makes sure you maximize engagement without hitting any lulls or stretches without updates,” according to <a href="https://buffer.com/library/schedule-social-media-content-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buffer</a>. “Any Instagram strategy should clearly outline a target post frequency to help keep you on track.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="f7850146-8eac-4019-8462-d7f9df379dbe" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-growth-mflynn.jpg" alt="MFlynn Instagram" width="714" height="473" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>M. Flynn is a local Boston jewelry store that posts almost daily on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mflynnjewelry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a>!</em></p>
<p>So create a schedule and then make sure you can stick to it. Which bring me to my next tip.</p>
<h2>2. Use a scheduling tool</h2>
<p>Posting on a consistent schedule is critical for growth, but that’s easier said than done. This is why for massive growth on Instagram, planning ahead and using a scheduling tool is the best way to go. Not only is scheduling your Instagram posts ahead going to save you time, but it is also going to reduce stress and chance for error.</p>
<p>Luckily, Instagram makes this simple for all of you social media marketers out there. Instagram has a scheduling feature withinthe Facebook Ads Manager, and there are several other posting tools available, many of which come with other helpful growth features. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/17/best-free-social-media-management-tools">Check out this </a>list if you are interested in using a third party social scheduling tool to keep your followers engaged.</p>
<p>And schedule your posts at the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/01/best-time-to-post-on-instagram">right time</a>!</p>
<h2>3. Try out Instagram Live</h2>
<p>Did you know that <a href="https://livestream.com/blog/live-video-statistics-livestream" target="_blank" rel="noopener">82% of people</a><strong> would rather watch a live video than see a social media post</strong>?</p>
<p>Lucky for you, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/30/instagram-live">Instagram Live</a> makes this possible, and there are plenty of reasons why you should give it a try.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="3b7190b7-4795-4dab-b5ec-50e8247d1114" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-live-q26a.jpg" alt="Instagram Live Q&amp;A example" width="414" height="791" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>For one, Instagram Live videos give you the top spot on your followers’ story feeds. Instagram Live videos also automatically send push notifications to your followers to let them know you are live. Last, but certainly not least, Instagram’s algorithm appears to be favoring business accounts that use this feature by boosting their organic engagement and making their profiles easier to discover.</p>
<h2>4. Partner with other brands</h2>
<p>What better way to fast-track your Instagram growth than partner with a brand that already has a large following? This is like two-for-one marketing because not only are you going to expose your content to your current audience, but an entirely new audience as well through a mutually beneficial partnership.</p>
<p>To acquire successful, business growing partnerships, ensure the companies you seek to partner with align well with your business objectives. Their audience needs to be relevant to your own. It is also important to come up with a game plan when proposing partnerships. How will this relationship benefit your proposed partner? What will a joint Instagram marketing campaign look like?</p>
<p>Take the example below from Outdoor Voices, a women’s active wear brand, and a dance class company, Melody Dance Fit. This match is perfect as the product and service here are a natural fit: activewear and exercise classes. The companies also worked together to build a campaign called “Virtual Recess,” where the participants wear Outdoor Voice clothing while providing an Instagram Live dance class. Genius!</p>

</div>
<h3>5. Run contests</h3>
<p>An Instagram contest is another way to drive even more exposure to your page to grow your account. Why? For one, people love free stuff! If you are giving ANYTHING away people are likely to enter. Contests and giveaways work so well on Instagram because there are several ways you can require folks to enter that can help up your follower and engagement numbers grow. For instance, you can ask people to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repost photos</li>
<li>Comment and tag friends</li>
<li>Like your posts</li>
<li>Share your posts or stories</li>
</ul>
<p>The other nice thing is that these contests or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/05/11/instagram-giveaways">giveaways</a> do not always need to be overly planned or complicated to run.</p>
<p>Here’s a great example of a contest I saw recently run by a wellness blogger I follow.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="5ea86375-2608-4600-833d-70e9145c83c3" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>As you can see the concept for her contest was really simple, and the entry required liking a few of her posts and tagging a friend. In return, she entered folks into a raffle to win two books from her book club.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="89691625-b884-48c2-8794-cf1cba7a843f" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>This is great because the entry to the contest not only increases her post engagement, but it also helps expose her brand to more potential followers as users are tagging new people who may not follow her yet.</p>
<h2>6. Become an Instagram Story regular</h2>
<p>Just like Instagram Live, Instagram Stories should be your friend! Why? Well for one, <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">500 million people</a><strong> use Instagram Stories every day</strong> with <strong>one-third of</strong><strong> the most viewed stories coming from businesses. </strong>Stories have continued growing in popularity, and showing your brand off in them gives your audience another way to engage with your business. You can also run <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/04/instagram-story-hacks">Instagram Story</a> ads to promote your business to an even larger audience.</p>
<p>The other thing that is great about stories is that they are easy to do. Creating an Instagram Story simply requires a quick photo or video to be shared with low risk, as it only lives there for 24 hours. You can also save older stories to display on your page under relevant groupings if you would like to prolong their life like the example below.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0ee9e633-55d1-45dd-8593-252935124985" data-langcode="en">

<h3>7. Make your Instagram page cohesive</h3>
<p>This tip is key for Instagram growth: You need to ensure your page feels wonderfully consistent and relevant to your brand. People like consistency.</p>
<p>The first way to do this is by ensuring your photo backgrounds and lighting remain consistent during the shooting/filming process. For instance,if you are in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/03/fashion-marketing">fashion marketing</a>, do not photograph your clothing items against a different background for every post. Perhaps you’re going for a natural vibe. In this case, you may want to photograph your models in the same forest or field, or on the same streets, to share new styles. Lighter backgrounds typically work well, and if you are using natural light you want to ensure you’re taking your photos either outside or close to a window, but not in direct sunlight as the glare will likely be too harsh.</p>
<p>Take the example below from J.Crew. This feed clearly gives off a nautical vibe with the stripes, blues and whites, and frequent beach and waterfront backgrounds.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="ab9c5b7f-1e34-4e2e-9b52-aa1b58cd8302" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram20growth20jcrew.png" alt="instagram growth jcrew" width="497" height="929" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Step two to giving a consistent feel to your feed is using the same Instagram filter or editing techniques for each post. This will ensure your images appear cohesive. Figure out what filters work best on the look you’re going for, and even play around with your own editing capabilities. I typically love doing my own edits by brightening up the photo, adding some saturation to bring out the colors, and some tilt-shift to focus on the main subject of the photograph.</p>
<h2>8. Use hashtags</h2>
<p>The other quick and effective (and free) way to grow your Instagram account is using hashtags strategically. In fact, <strong>Instagram </strong><strong>posts that use hashtags gain a </strong><strong><a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/instagram-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12.6% </a>increase</strong><strong> in engagement </strong>when compared those without.</p>
<p>“Not only do hashtags help social media users organize and categorize content, but they’re also one of the driving forces behind some of today’s best marketing campaigns,” says Maddy Osman on <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/instagram-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sprout Social</a>.</p>
<p>Hashtagging is so effective because it helps categorize similar content, which makes yours even more discoverable. This is likely why hashtagged posts get so much more engagement than those without.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="66728de7-74f0-4193-968e-f1a75fd8629f" data-langcode="en">

<h2>9. Pay to play</h2>
<p>I know, I know, you were looking for growth opportunities that did not involve opening your wallet, right? While it is definitely possible to grow your Instagram account organically, investing even a small amount can have a potentially huge ROI. How so? Well, first of all, Instagram allows you to control your budget, target your ads towards a very specific audience, and select from a wide variety of ad formats (story ads, video ads, photo ads, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/23/instagram-carousel-ads">carousel ads</a>, etc.). Sponsoring just one post can drive a significantly higher amount of exposure.</p>
<p>With so many options and flexibility in the way you can advertise it may seem overwhelming. Therefore, start small by promoting one of your most popular organic posts in your feed to a relevant audience, track the performance, and re-evaluate. Even if your budget is small, the ROI has the potential to be large, so experiment with some paid content to increase your growth rate on Instagram.</p>
<h2>10. Give back</h2>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, a great way to grow is your Instagram presence is to show the genuine and caring side of your business, especially now. If your company is able to help others then, in even just a small way, then why not help? Whether it’s making masks for healthcare workers, donating to your local food bank, or providing meals for busy nurses, there are so many ways to give back to your community. And if you are doing so, why not share what you are doing with your audience? Not only will it show them the caring spirit behind your business, it could even inspire them to give back as well!</p>
<p>Here is a lovely example from Boston-based restaurant and café owner Joanne Chang who is doing so much to help feed our hospital workers during a time when her business is definitely suffering. Showing this kind of a generous spirit is truly inspiring.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="8d35c42e-31cc-4cb4-a8b2-28be1183ff93" data-langcode="en">

<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/30/instagram-live">8 Tips for Making Incredible Instagram Live Videos</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One recent study found a <strong>76% increase in daily accumulated likes on Instagram ad posts during the COVID-19 quarantine</strong>. “Coronavirus means isolation and isolation means social media,” says <a href="https://www.campaignlive.com/article/coronavirus-sparks-huge-jump-social-media-use-study-finds/1677276" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olivier McAteer</a>. This increased engagement makes sense, especially considering that Instagram usage in general <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/style/viral-challenges-coronavirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has increased</a>.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-live-intro.jpg" alt="Instagram Live image" width="788" height="525" /></div>
<p>If you&#8217;re a marketer looking to reach your audience, this means there&#8217;s at least one place you&#8217;ll definitely find them: Instagram. Here, we&#8217;re sharing eight tips for creating unmissable Instagram Live content.</p>
<p>But first, let&#8217;s talk about what Instagram Live is and why it&#8217;s a useful platform.</p>
<h2>What is Instagram Live?</h2>
<p>Instagram Live is essentially an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/04/instagram-story-hacks">Instagram story</a>, like you see at the top of your feed, but recorded and streamed in real-time. On the Instagram feed, these live stories will show at the very front of your story circle icons to let you know that a business or individual is currently live and then Instagrammers can watch along in real-time.</p>
<h2>Why you should use Instagram Live</h2>
<p>Well, why not? If you&#8217;re looking for something more concrete, here are a few reason to give Instagram Live a try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instagram Live gives you the number one position on the story feed, increasing visibility.</li>
<li>Instagram Live automatically sends <strong>push notifications to your followers</strong> alerting them you are live.</li>
<li>Instagram’s algorithm gives organic engagement boosts to users who embrace this feature. This will make your videos more likely to appear in Instagram’s discovery section so new people will find you!</li>
<li>Instagram Live videos are<strong> more engaging and discoverable</strong> for the reasons stated above.</li>
<li>Instagram Live videos allow you to create a stronger connection and<strong> bond with your followers</strong>.</li>
<li>Instagram Live humanizes your brand by showing a face behind your business.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the reasons Instagram Live is a feature you need to embrace ASAP. There is also data that shows <a href="https://livestream.com/blog/live-video-statistics-livestream" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>82% of people</strong></a><strong> would rather watch a live video then see a social media post</strong>. Now let’s explore some tips to help you hop on the Instagram Live trend effectively:</p>
<h2>How to create engaging content for Instagram Live</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve covered what Instagram Live is and why it could be a powerful tool for your marketing, we need to talk about how create high-quality content so that you’re ready to go live <em>and</em> engage your audience.</p>
<h3>1. Be authentic (and professional)</h3>
<p>Rule number one of Instagram Live is that you need to be as genuine and authentic as possible. What do I mean by that? This is not the time to read from a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/12/video-scripts">video script </a>or turn into a salesperson; rather, the reason people want to see you live is to see a genuine human. Especially in times like these, when we’re social distancing, people need that real, authentic human connective even it needs to be obtained through their iPhone screen.</p>
<p>So how can you be your most authentic self to your audience?</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a lesson from <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_the_power_of_vulnerability?language=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brene Brown</a> and do not fear vulnerability.</li>
<li>Allow yourself to show emotion.</li>
<li>Communicate as you would with a friendly coworker.</li>
</ul>
<p>To clarify, I am not recommending that you start sobbing to the camera or talk about that doctor’s appointment you finally had last week. Rather, allow your personality to shine through as you connect with your audience over<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/20/instagram-advertising"> Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>For instance, it’s okay to talk about how COVID-19 is affecting your small business and show emotion along with that. However, going into an over-dramatized tangent may make users drop off. Be authentic while maintaining your professionalism.</p>
<h3>2. Take time to plan</h3>
<p>While it can be tempting to just hop on Instagram Live and talk to your followers about how amazing your business is, this may not go as well as pictured in your head. Instagram Live definitely has a more casual, less pre-planned feel, yet those who do it well actually plan out their live sessions in advance and set specific goals.</p>
<p>“Knowing how to set good goals is crucial for social media success,” says Tony Tran from <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-live-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hootsuite</a>, “And your goals for Instagram Live are no exception. Hootsuite recommends setting <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/12/15/adwords-smart-goals">“SMART” goals</a> that are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and timely.</p>
<p>Aside from having objectives in place, your format needs to be well-planned and scheduled out. For instance, is your livestream going to involve a Q&amp;A? Perhaps a product launch or “behind the scenes”? A few other Instagram Live approaches could be to livestream an event, product preview, educational session, or an office tour. While there are endless formats you can aim for, it is important to also know what you are going to talk about to keep viewers engaged.</p>
<p>Below is great example below from Nutritious Life where the founder did a Q&amp;A where she was clearly prepared, even with text to make it easy for viewers to get an idea of what the session is about before turning their volume up.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-live-q26a-1.jpg" alt="Instagram Live Q&amp;A example" width="414" height="791" /></div>
<h3>3. Stay consistent with an ongoing series</h3>
<p>People like consistency, especially in times of uncertainty. Whether it&#8217;s daily, weekly, or monthly, a consistent livestream series that your followers are excited about will boost your chances of Instagram Live success. For instance, if you are a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/16/real-estate-marketing">real estate marketer</a>, try a “New on the Market!” series where you show off some of your newest properties. Or perhaps you could do a customer story every week. Whatever your series idea may be, leaning towards education content that your audience members typically seek out is likely the best option for something like this.</p>
<p>Check out the example below for the co-founder of Sift Bake Shop in Mystic, Connecticut, where he does a re-occurring series called “Ask Adam.” In the videos, Adam answers popular baking questions. A simple, yet very effective method to keep followers coming back.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-live-series.jpg" alt="Instagram Live series" width="414" height="896" /></div>
<h3>4. Promote your live sessions beforehand</h3>
<p>In addition to having a plan and consistent series, you also need to communicate this plan to your followers and leads. Instagram Live campaigns should be treated just like other in-person events, where you market them to your audience to ensure they know the when, what, where, why, of your going live plan.</p>
<p>Market your live event on your other social channels and emails, and then target these promotions to relevant audiences. For instance, if your live event might be most appealing to a specific segment of leads, create an email campaign reaching out to this group to build their interest.</p>
<p>Take the example below from an influential trainer who promoted his live session by simply notifying his following with an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/04/instagram-videos">Instagram video post</a> a day before his live event with the details and giving his following a little sneak peak. Genius!</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-live-promotion-1.jpg" alt="Instagram Live promotion example" width="373" height="807" /></div>
<h3>5. Engage with your attendees</h3>
<p>The other very cool feature about Instagram Live is that it allows attendees to comment in real time! While this can be great for attendees, it can be overwhelming to presenters. The thing is you that you are not expected to engage with every comment—of course—and you should do your best to stay on track with your plan we discussed in Tip #2 above.</p>
<p>Still, you should also envision this as an opportunity to really connect with your followers. Whether it’s a question that flows with the content of your session or acknowledging a kind comment made, giving your users real-time attention will make them feel special and connected to your brand. One helpful way to do this could be using another co-worker to track the comments and star ones to reply to for the presenter. You could also do a Q&amp;A at the end of your live session if you would prefer to answer questions at the end.</p>
<h3>6. Conclude with a CTA</h3>
<p>How in the world do you end an Instagram Live? Conclude the Q&amp;A session, thank your co-host, and say “bye!” Nope! You should always end your Instagram Live with a CTA that ties directly back to your objectives planned out. Whether it be something as simple as following your account or more involved, like filling out a form, it is critical to get your main goal accomplished and get your live attendees to complete a desirable action.</p>
<p>Make sure when mentioning your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/29/great-cta">CTA</a> that it does not come off as overly salesly or pushy and is focused on a realistic action that you actually see attendees taking.</p>
<h3>7. Have fun with your Instagram Live session!</h3>
<p>Remember, Instagram Live is not a serious <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/06/18/marketing-channels">marketing channel</a> that involves a monotone plug for your business. Rather Instagram is a place where people go for some fun so ensure you are having fun as well! If you’re not, your viewers will be able to tell. Allow your personality to shine through, make fun of yourself, and do not get anxious about mispronouncing a word or making a mistake. Instead, acknowledge it, laugh at yourself, and move on. Your followers with appreciate the authenticity.</p>
<p>So let lose, connect, have fun, and don’t take yourself too seriously because if you are enjoying yourself your followers will too!</p>
<h3>8. Don’t forget to save and share your live video</h3>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, save your session at the end! This is a great tip that many new livestreamers do not know they can do. Yes, we all hate watching ourselves on video, but it is a great way to continuously improve for future live sessions. Also, if the session was a success, this will allow you to re-share it on your feed or on other social channels.</p>
<p>To save your video simply hit “save” in the upper corner, and then instantly share it on your story for 24 hours. Speaking of stories, you may find our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/06/instagram-story-highlights">post on using Instagram Story Highlights</a> to be helpful.</p>

<p>While there are many uncertainties in life, especially nowadays, one thing that is clear is that Instagram Live is currently an effective platform to strengthen your marketing efforts. So dive in, and let us know about your experiences!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With a lot more time inside the home due to COVID-19, you may also be finding yourself spending a lot more time on social media sites like Twitter. Whether you’re tracking the news or looking for a distraction from your home office (or your couch), <strong>Twitter continues to be one of the </strong>top five <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">most popular</a><strong> social networks in the US</strong> with over 20% of US internet users accessing Twitter on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Whether or not you personally use Twitter, I would be willing to wager that your company has a Twitter account to promote your business. Perhaps your company even has multiple Twitter accounts—one for your main business promotions, one for helping customers, and another for building a community. Regardless, if you are not currently maintaining an active Twitter presence, you certainly should be.</p>
<p>“Twitter gives businesses a cost-effective method of engaging with their customer base,” says <a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/top-reasons-why-your-small-business-should-use-twitter-2948523" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Susan Ward</a>, owner of an IT consulting firm. “Twitter is a brand builder and marketing multiplier for businesses when used correctly.”</p>

<h2>Twitter popularity statistics</h2>

<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
<p>Twitter is POPULAR! Okay, I do realize you likely already knew this fact, but understanding exactly how popular is critical as well. Not only are there millions of people logging onto Twitter each month, but there are millions logging on every single day! People are also using the platform specifically to discover new things, whether it’s news stories, products, or experiences. And while 3.39 minutes daily spent on the platform may not seem like a lot, it is definitely plenty of time to be one of the new things that your target audience member discovers during their daily Twitter check.</p>

<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
<p>Twitter is a very diverse environment made up of a variety of cultures, ethnicities, genders, races, ages, and political positions. Yet, there are some conclusions we can make about the mass in that the majority of Twitter users fall into the “affluent millennial” category. Twitter is most commonly used in the US, Japan, and the UK. Twitter is also clearly a platform more popular amount younger age groups, but has been growing in popularity amongst adults.</p>
<p>However, the main takeaway from all of these demographic statistics is that whoever your target audience is there is more then likely a large segment of them actively using Twitter. Lucky for you, like Facebook and Instagram, Twitter allows marketers to target ads based on a variety of demographic characteristics. Take advantage of the huge audience Twitter has and drill down to find your future customers on the platform.</p>

<p>It is also critical to ensure all of your content is culturally inclusive. Ensure that your messages never come across in a negative way, taking into considerations a variety of beliefs and demographics.</p>
<p>Lastly, use hashtags and emojis! Posts with both of these get more engagement so why wouldn’t you use them?

<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
<p>Investing in Twitter mobile ads is highly recommended. This is where your users are more than likely accessing the platform so ensuring your ads look top notch on mobile should be a key part of your Twitter strategy. The other thing you need to ensure is that your website and the content you are directing your users to from your tweets is mobile optimized as well. There is nothing worse than landing on a funky landing page that is not built for the mobile web.</p>

<p>As a marketer, keywords are a critical part of your day-to-day. Whether it’s finding the right hashtag for your YouTube or Facebook campaigns, discovering a new keyword opportunity for your seasonal Google search campaign, or just building upon existing campaigns to expand reach or narrow your focus, keywords are a key part in your online marketing efforts. But just blindly coming up with keyword ideas is not an effective strategy … This is why I always recommend finding the right cross-platform keyword research tool for your needs.</p>
<h2>Why use a cross-platform keyword research tool?</h2>
<p>Why not use a cross-platform keyword research tool? It’s going to save you time and money. Cross-platform keyword research tools are helpful to find you keywords to use for social media campaigns, search campaigns, display campaigns, website SEO efforts, video SEO, and more.</p>
<p>The keywords that have growth potential for your industry are likely not going to vary much between platforms, so it makes sense to use one robust tool to discover all of the keyword opportunities that you should be taking advantage of.</p>
<p>But, with so many tools out there, how can you possibly decide which cross-platform keyword research tool is right for you? Luckily, we’ve broken down some of our favorites so you can evaluate the pros and cons of each to start finding the right keywords for your marketing campaigns.</p>
<h2>1. Rank Tracker</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.link-assistant.com/rank-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rank Tracker</a> from Link-Assist.com is a keyword tool that provides research across 400+ search engines. I did not even know there were that many search engines!</p>
<p>Here are some cool features that rank tracker provides.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="16c8dc58-ed69-45f2-a302-4543e97ee397" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keyword position tracker:</strong> Figure out where your keywords or competitor keywords rank, check positions for your site globally or locally across the 400+ search engines available.</li>

<li><strong>Competitive intelligence features:</strong> Who doesn’t like to spy you their competitors? Track their keywords and how they are ranking organically</li>

<li>It is FREE!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is definitely a learning curve for getting familiar with the interface.</li>
<li>The platform is a desktop software (not a huge fan of this, but it may not bother everyone).</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Google’s Keyword Planner</h2>
<p>You may or may not know that Google provides users with their very own <a href="https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Keyword Planner</a>. What better place to do keyword research then with the king of search engines, GOOGLE. Google accounts for the majority of searches worldwide, <strong>processing </strong><a href="https://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/#targetText=Google%20now%20processes%20over%2040%2C000,trillion%20searches%20per%20year%20worldwide." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>40,000 search queries</strong></a><strong> every second on average</strong>. To say they have a lot of data on keyword research is a vast understatement.</p>

</ul>

</ul>
<h2>6. SEMrush Keyword Research Tool</h2>
<p>Another keyword tool worth checking out is SEMrush&#8217;s <a href="https://www.semrush.com/features/keyword-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keyword Research too</a>l.

<p>Here are a few highlights and, um, lowlights of the tool below:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="6d32790c-f4bc-43cd-adb4-498cf9fb76cc" data-langcode="en">

</ul>
<h2>7. AuthorityLabs Keyword Rank Checker &amp; Keyword Grouper</h2>
<p>AuthorityLabs offers a couple of keyword research for free, including the <a href="https://www.authoritylabs.com/free-tools/rank-checker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keywork Rank Tracker and the Keyword Grouper</a>. The Keywork Rank Checker is a bit different than the others in that it allows you quickly check keyword rankings in bulk.

<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="068c14ba-6810-483e-9031-0c450cc72d0e" data-langcode="en">

<ul>
<li>These tools can be super helpful for organizing long lists of keywords.</li>
<li>With the Keyword Rank Checker, you can download data into a spreadsheet and generate charts and reports.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The functionality with these features is limited in terms of the data and in-depth information you can get.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that we’ve entered a new decade, it is hard to imagine a time pre-Instagram. And with <strong>over </strong><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/253577/number-of-monthly-active-instagram-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>1 billion</strong></a><strong> users, </strong>it is pretty clear that Instagram plans to stay.</p>
<p>I would spend time introducing this post with more stats about Instagram usage for business—but I believe all of you are likely already aware that your business needs to be on Instagram (in fact, I’m guessing the majority of you are already advertising on the ’gram). If you haven’t started advertising on Instagram yet, check out <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/20/instagram-advertising">The Complete Guide to Advertising on Instagram</a> for more tips to get started. Today, I’m going to focus on one of my favorite ad types, Instagram carousel ads!</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-advertising-ad.png" alt="instagram advertising example of carousel ad" width="463" height="390" /></div>
<p>In this guide, I’m going to cover what Instagram carousel ads are, the guidelines for Instagram carousel ads, and six strategies to create Instagram carousel ads get your viewers clicking:</p>
<ol>
<li>Target each unique audience strategically</li>
<li>Prioritize copy just as much as imagery</li>
<li>Don’t feel the need to use all 10 image slots</li>
<li>Intrigue viewers with deals!</li>
<li>Choose your CTA carefully</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to incorporate video content</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h2>What are Instagram carousel ads?</h2>
<p>Instagram carousel ads are slide shows in ad format, which allows instagrammers to slide through multiple images or videos in one single post. Instagram carousel ads also allow the advertisers to add in clickable calls to action, change the text below for each image, and link to various web pages. They are perfect for any industry that has beautiful imagery and is looking to show different angles or multiple related products in one advertisement.</p>
<p>Why are Instagram carousel ads so wonderful?</p>
<blockquote><p>“With more creative space within an ad, you can highlight different products, showcase specific details about one produce, service or promotion, or tell a story about your brand that develops across each carousel card,” says Instagram’s parent company, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/carousel/instagram-feed/traffic">Facebook</a>.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Instagram carousel ad guidelines</h2>
<p>Now that you understand what these ads are, it is critical to be aware of the guidelines around crafting your ad to ensure it won’t get rejected by the platform.</p>
<p>Here are a few things to keep in mind regarding the design and technical requirements before crafting your ad.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximum number of photos/videos: 10</li>
<li>Minimum number of photos/videos: 2</li>
<li>Image file formats: jpg and png</li>
<li>Maximum video size/length: 4GB for up to 60 seconds</li>
<li>Text in images: 20% or less of image</li>
<li>Text below image: ≤2,200 in up to 2 rows of text</li>
<li>Maximum hashtags in text: 30</li>
<li>Supported objectives: Reach, Conversions, Traffic, Lead Generation, Brand Awareness, Catalog Sales, Store Traffic, App Installs, Messages</li>
<li>Supported CTA buttons: Shop Now, Book Now, Learn More, Get Showtimes, Sign Up, Download, Watch More, Contract Us, Apply Now, Donate Now, Get Quote, Request Time, See Menu, Send Message, Listen Now, Get Offer, Subscribe, Book Test Drive, Check Availability</li>
<li>Ad Placement Options: Instagram Stories, Instagram Feed</li>
</ul>
<h2>6 ways to win at Instagram carousel ads</h2>
<p>Those design and technical requirements will make sure your ads are approved by the platform—but, as an advertiser, you know that doesn’t mean your done with ad strategy. Now, let’s dive into the fun stuff to make sure your Instagram carousel ads are successful! Here are <strong>six strategies to make some crush-worthy Instagram carousel ads.</strong></p>
<h3>1. Target each unique audience strategically</h3>
<p>Everyone who has advertised on Facebook and Instagram knows how ridiculously amazing their targeting is. Whether you are targeting a soccer mom who lives on the Maine coast and enjoys reading fiction novels and eating seafood or a teenager in Texas with a passion for online furniture shopping, you can get in front of your audience. You can get as detailed as your heart desires, but please just do not get lazy.</p>
<p>Use Instagram’s robust targeting options to segment your audiences and target them with carousel ads that fit their unique needs, wants, and stage in your buying cycle. Breaking up each unique audience for your various campaigns will ensure you are spending your budget as wisely as possible. Considering how many people are on Instagram this tip is especially important for Instagram carousel ads—since these babies take time and money to put together, making sure you are showing them to the right people at the right time is key.</p>
<h3>2. Prioritize copy just as much as imagery</h3>
<p>Instagram is all about the imagery, right? Well, yes, but when crafting an Instagram carousel ad, it is critical to put just as much thought into your copy. You’re spending money to accomplish a set goal, so you need to use all the persuasive tools in your toolbox.</p>
<p>Without context to go along with your imagery, it can be quite hard to communicate properly to visitors, so spend time on engaging, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/13/persuasive-ads">persuasive ad copy</a> that resides below your images. Your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/23/instagram-captions">Instagram captions</a> should be direct, actionable, and persuasive.</p>
<p>Take the great example below from Budget Bytes. Image if you saw just the images of food and CTA saying, “Learn More.” You’d be left dumbfounded thinking, <em>learn more about what?</em></p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-carousel-ads-copy-1.jpg" alt="Instagram carousel ad with bowl of food" width="327" height="432" /></div>
<p>Luckily, this company provided context to the images of food in the carousel ad. What I love about the copy included below is that it uses different fonts to put emphasis on different areas. This also uses checkbox emojis to clearly outline what the offer is. And there are little barriers to enter since the meal plan offered is free and provided within the CTA of the ad, as well as by the link at the end of the text.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-carousel-ads-copy-caption.jpg" alt="Instagram carousel ad caption" width="381" height="258" /></div>
<h3>3. Don’t feel the need to use all 10 image slots</h3>
<p>Sometimes less is more, my friends. Think about how much content is already on Instagram. Do you really think that every person who swipes through your ad is going to have the attention span to view all 10 images? Perhaps they will if you tell a compelling enough story, but if you’re able to get you point across in just a couple quality images then why not go for it?</p>
<p>Take this great example below from LL Bean. Rather than showing off their entire new line for 2020, LL Bean makes the point loud and clear with an initial picture, including a small amount of relevant text.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-carousel-ads-llbean.jpg" alt="LL Bean Instagram carousel ad" width="260" height="428" /></div>
<p>And then the second image shows exactly where their store front location is to compel me to stop by.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-carousel-ads-llbean-location.jpg" alt="LL Bean Instagram carousel ad with map image" width="262" height="432" /></div>
<p>Sometimes a simple and direct carousel ad is the most effective</p>
<h3>4. Intrigue viewers with deals!</h3>
<p>Let’s face it: Instagrammers are going to need an incentive to leave Instagram! The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/03/social-media-networks">social network</a> is like a blackhole. Who hasn’t caught themselves going to bed an hour later because Instagram that has sucked you in? The platform can be very addictive! Therefore, to break the addiction and get your grammers to leave Instagram there needs to be some incentive…</p>
<p>What better way to incentivize Instagrammers to leave than a limited-time deal! Whether it’s free shipping, a percentage discount, or a BOGO offer, carousel ads are great for these types of promotions. With this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/09/instagram-marketing-strategy">Instagram ad format</a>, you can promote multiple deals in one ad. Take the example below from the clothing brand, joie. The company uses the carousal ad format to show off the fabulous discounted clothing items offered as part of joie’s winter sale.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-carousel-ads-joie-deals.jpg" alt="Joie Instagram carousel ad example" width="324" height="495" /></div>
<h3>5. Choose your CTA carefully</h3>
<p>With so many CTAs to choose from for the carousel ad format, it can feel a bit tempting to just pick the first one that makes some type of sense. Yet, this is not the best way to win folks over. Spend time really thinking about your offer and ensuring the CTA makes sense. There is nothing worse than clicking on a CTA and then feeling misled when the offer is different than expected (for instance, if you wanted to purchase something but were then led to an ebook landing page or vice versa).</p>
<p>The Food Network’s offer below is a great example of one well done. The ad uses the “Download” CTA since the carousel images are showing various drool-worthy recipes from their downloadable app. The CTA perfectly aligns with the offer to download the app and sign up, and the text below the CTA further enforces it</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-carousel-ads-food-network-cta.jpg" alt="Food Network Instagram carousel ad example" width="291" height="458" /></div>
<h3>6. Don&#8217;t be afraid to incorporate video content</h3>
<p>We all know how effective video ads are, but making a video Instagram carousel ad sounds like a LOT of hard and time-consuming work, doesn’t it? It actually doesn’t have to be!</p>
<p>Nowadays, our iPhones can take pretty quality videos so do not feel like you need to hire a fancy video production team to incorporate some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/03/28/instagram-video-ads">fun and interesting videos</a> into your carousel ads. Fitness mogul, Kayla Itsines, does a great job at making easy, quick, and low-production workout videos that she turns into Instagram carousel ads.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-carousel-ads-video.jpg" alt="Example video Instagram carousel ad" width="311" height="588" /></div>
<p>See, it’s possible to create high-quality ads without being overly nit-picky on video production perfection.</p>
<h2>Get rolling with Instagram carousel ads</h2>
<p>Now, you’ve got everything you need to get started making Instagram carousel ads and making sure they’re super effective for your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/01/06/instagram-marketing">Instagram marketing strategy</a>! Get rolling!</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are in the construction industry marketing may be the furthest thing from your mind—well, unless you are having trouble booking jobs. Then marketing your business is likely the top thing on your mind.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a single-person operation or you have a dedicated construction marketing team, the industry comes with unique challenges. From the dangers of the job to competing for larger projects with other companies, it is important to not let your marketing strategy sit on the back burner while your competitors capture all the local jobs. So what can your construction company do to stand out? Here are <strong>11 construction marketing tips</strong> to out-book and out-build your competitors.</p>
<h2>1. Ensure your number is super easy to find everywhere</h2>
<p>There are a few industries where <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/01/google-call-only-ads">phone calls</a> are critical, construction being one of them. Whether it’s a local homeowner looking for help remodeling their kitchen or a big development company looking for a construction firm to take on some larger projects, your leads won’t get in contact with you if there are too many barriers.</p>
<p>To get as many calls as possible, your well-managed phone number should be tied directly to the name of your company, whether your ad is appearing on a Google search, a billboard on the street, or a flyer at the local supermarket.</p>
<p>I did a search for “construction companies in Boston,” and these three listings showed up immediately. While all three had numbers tied to their <a href="https://localiq.com/products/listings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listings</a>, only Sula Valley had a number that was super easy to find at the top left-hand corner of their website.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/construction-marketing-boston-results.png" alt="Google SERP results for construction in Boston" width="630" height="321" class="aligncenter" /><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/construction-marketing-sula-valley.jpg" alt="Sula Valley homepage with phone number" width="589" height="316" class="aligncenter" /><br />
Then, as I clicked along to their Facebook page, I immediately spotted their number in the “About” section.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/construction-marketing-sula-valley-facebook.jpg" alt="Sula Valley Facebook" width="303" height="264" class="aligncenter" /><br />
This is a great example of a company doing this well. To ensure you’re also making it as easy as possible for your leads to contact you, make sure your number is above the fold on your website, tied to all branded material on other sites and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business">social media</a> platforms, and, of course, ensure there is someone responsible for answering and following up with incoming calls to maximize the potential business.</p>
<p>Check how your directory listings with this <a href="https://localiq.com/free-business-listings-grader/?cid=Web_WS_InContentTextLink_Freemium_Listings&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free business listings grader</a> from LocaliQ.</p>
<h2>2. Set up Google Local Services Ads</h2>
<p>While I would definitely recommend running your standard Google Search and Display ads, for construction marketing, you should take advantage of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/11/google-local-service-ads">Google’s Local Services Ads.</a> Why? Because this ad type is made for your industry! When these ads are configured properly and someone searches for “construction company near me” your service ad with a “<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-guarantee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Guaranteed Badge</a>” will appear alongside a direct link to your phone number.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/construction-marketing-google-local-service-ads.jpg" alt="Google local service ad" width="696" height="303" class="aligncenter" /><br />
“One of the really cool things about this is that you only pay for leads, rather than per click,” says <a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/construction-marketing-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Bermudez</a>, marketing manager at Yael Consulting.</p>
<p>An endorsement from Google, the top spot on the SERPs, breaking down barriers to allow your leads to easily call you, and only paying for leads. What could be better than that?</p>
<h2>3. Make your website helpful for customers</h2>
<p>Did you know that<strong> 63% of customers primarily use a contract companies website to find and engage with them</strong>, and <strong>30% do not consider a business that does not have a website</strong>, according to <a href="https://www.bluecorona.com/blog/contractor-digital-marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Corona</a>.</p>
<p>Having an attractive, simple, and easy-to-navigate website that helps your leads get the information they need without feeling overwhelmed or turned off is critical for construction marketing success.</p>
<p>I love the example below from <a href="http://www.killco.com/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Killian Construction Co.</a> The entire website experience is pleasant, with a simple and visual homepage, as well as easy-to-navigate tabs with all the critical information a lead would be looking for. There is also a clear contact us section in the top left corner.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/construction-marketing-website.jpg" alt="construction marketing website example" width="756" height="366" class="aligncenter" /><br />
Another thing Killian’s website does well is including slideshow highlights from their portfolio to help leads get an idea of projects they have completed in the past.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/construction-marketing-website-example.jpg" alt="construction marketing website example with portfolio" width="758" height="320" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<h2>4. Get super niche with your audience targeting on social media</h2>
<p>The popularity and widespread use of social media is no secret. In fact, <strong>75% of construction companies now promote their businesses on social media</strong>, according to <a href="https://jbknowledge.com/2018-construction-technology-report-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JBK</a>. This is a good and bad thing for construction companies. The great news is that there are now even more places and opportunities to promote your construction business, but with such a crowded space it can be challenging to stand out.</p>
<p>The great thing about social platforms like Facebook and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/20/instagram-advertising">Instagram</a> is that you can get super specific with your targeting. The first thing you should do on these platforms is specify the location you are targeting.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/construction-marketing-social-media-targeting.jpg" alt="social media targeting for construction marketing" width="571" height="397" class="aligncenter" /><br />
Next, consider your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a>. What do they look like in terms of income? How about interests and behaviors? Perhaps you have a few target audiences and creating specific campaigns to align your content with each makes the most sense. Whatever you decide, the options are plentiful so explore what works and soon enough you’ll be speaking directly to your target audience and gaining even more jobs through social media.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/construction-marketing-social-media-detailed-targeting.jpg" alt="detailed targeting for construction marketing example" width="604" height="305" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<h2>5. Follow up with past customers</h2>
<p>A big part of building your audience is keeping the one you already have—yup, I mean encouraging your past customers to keep coming back. Whether it’s a smaller job you completed for a family last year or a commercial project that you completed several years ago, if your customer&#8217;s experience was positive, then it might be worth seeing if they have any upcoming needs that they haven’t yet had time to address.</p>
<p>“You should be following up with your existing customers a few months after completing a job, just to check in to see if you can help them with anything else,” says <a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/construction-marketing-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jonathan Weinberg</a>, founder and CEO of Builder Prime. “The customer will be impressed that you called and it could lead to more business.”</p>
<p>Maintaining these positive relationships is a great construction marketing strategy—not only does it help you work with happy customers, but it can also lead to new business through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/06/referral-marketing">referrals</a>!</p>
<h2>6. Create compelling video content</h2>
<p>With <strong>one-third of internet activity being spent watching video</strong> and <strong>video leading to a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/08/video-marketing-statistics">157% increase</a> in organic SERP traffic for businesses</strong>, it is clear that video is a marketing strategy that cannot be ignored! This is especially true in such a visual industry like construction. Often, many beautiful things result from construction projects so why not show them off with engaging video content?</p>
<p>Video is also a great way to give your brand personality. A video showing off your projects, a timelapse video of the construction process, or a fun company culture video showing off the unique personalities of your team could all help make your company more personable and help build your audience.</p>
<p>I love the quick Facebook video below from S+H Construction, where one of the co-founders shows off her pride for being a part of the company’s growth over the last 40 years. Very cool!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/construction-marketing-video.jpg" alt="construction marketing video exmaple" width="727" height="542" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<h2>7. Feature your employees</h2>
<p>The truth about construction marketing is that it is challenging not only because of the high level of competition but also the fact that you need to gain the trust of your leads in order to have any chance of converting them into future customers. We have all heard of the construction horror stories that make the trust threshold higher for this industry.</p>
<p>That’s why showing off the human side of your business is so important. By featuring your staff in your marketing campaigns, your leads can see the smiling human faces behind your business—and they can feel as though they are getting to know you and your business in a way. This is one small step in increasing their trust in your offerings.</p>
<p>Try inserting a human element into every one of your marketing campaigns. This can be as simple as having some your staff on the homepage, like McCormick Home Solutions does in the example below.</p>

Grogan Building Supply, on the other hand, frequently posts photographs of their employees on Instagram to celebrate a work-related success or a birthday. People like to see the human side because it makes them feel more connected to your business, in turn increasing their level of trust.</p>

<h2>8. Prioritize reviews and customer testimonials ALWAYS</h2>
<p>Bouncing off of my last rant about building customer trust, there is no better way to do this than by allowing your happy customers to speak for you. In the construction industry, you absolutely need good reviews in multiple places to instill trust in your leads. This is likely the first thing new leads are going to seek out when researching your business.</p>
<p>So how can you make sure you&#8217;re covering your bases in terms of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">reviews</a>? Here are a few starting points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include customer case studies and testimonials on your website.</li>
<li>Ensure your Google and paid search campaigns have reviews configured.</li>
<li>Check the status of your Yelp page, Google Reviews, Ang, etc.</li>
<li>Encourage your happy customers to write reviews on all major review sites (incentivize them with a reward or raffle).</li>
<li>Produce customer testimonial videos to promote across your social channels.</li>
</ul>

And once you have these reviews, make sure to direct your lead to them!</p>
<h2>9. Build a super informative blog</h2>
<p>Construction marketers might hear the word “blog” and think of food bloggers, fashion bloggers, or even business blogs—but “construction blog” cannot possibly be a thing, can it? The answer is not only is it “a thing,” but it is a super smart and compelling way to build trust and bring in more customers.</p>
<p>“In this industry, people do a great deal of research,” says <a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/construction-marketing-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jorge Fontan</a>, owner of Fortan Architecture. “Having a website that is a resource for people can lead to potential clients who want to work specifically with you after getting help from the information you post.”</p>
<p>Blogging on construction-related topics can not only build your knowledge credibility, but it can also help you strengthen your website quality, leading to more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/03/organic-traffic">organic traffic</a> and better SEO. Really, the benefits of a strong educational blog are endless for construction marketers!</p>
<h2>10. Try some guerilla marketing tactics</h2>
<p>We’ve been talking a lot about the online space for construction marketing, but what about stepping outside into your community to do some real in-person marketing experiences?</p>
<p>Guerilla marketing is not only a fun way to step away from your computer; it also allows you to let your creative juices flow and can often be the most compelling way to get new customers in the door. Try an old stand-by like signs on your current jobsite or something outside of the box like a flash mob to “Brick House” at a local hardware store. Whether you’d rather play it safe or experiment, the options are endless when it comes to guerilla marketing.

<h2>11. Partner with similar businesses for co-marketing campaigns</h2>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, a great way to take your construction marketing efforts to the next level is by partnering with a business similar to yours to do some cross-promotion and expose your construction company to an entirely new market.</p>
<p>“Co-marketing campaigns will take on different forms for B2B vs. B2C, for products vs. services, for new startups vs. established brands,” says <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/195109129-co-marketing-strategic-partnerships" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Braveen Kumar</a> from Shopify. “However, with a little creativity, you can connect the dots between you and a partner brand to expand the impact of both of your marketing efforts.”</p>
<p>So what are the best brands to co-market with? Well, think about your target audience. Where else do they shop? What other needs do they have? A few rules for building strong partnerships that can lead to impactful co-marketing campaigns include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building these relationships with similar brands, but not direct competitors.</li>
<li>Ensuring the brand you partner with has a reasonable (if not large) audience.</li>
<li>Partnering with a company that you can help in some way in return.</li>
</ul>
<p>Teamwork makes the dream work!</p>
