<h2>SEO checklist for blog posts that rank</h2>
<p>Follow this fairly simple SEO checklist to give your content the best chance of ranking for relevant queries.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/seo-checklist-wordstream.webp" alt="seo checklist" width="900" height="770" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94797" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/seo-checklist-wordstream.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/seo-checklist-wordstream-480x411.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="check-your-target-keywords"></div>
<h3>1. Check your target keywords</h3>
<p>If you’re even interested in a checklist for blog posts that rank, you probably know to incorporate <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide">keyword research</a> into the process. Making sure your content is targeting the right keywords is obviously an important first step&#8211;with traditional considerations still being relevant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keywords with search volume</li>
<li>Keywords that are likely to be relevant to your audience</li>
<li>Keywords that your site is able to compete for</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/09/18/best-keyword-research-tools">Keyword tools</a> can help you get to this data, but now there are additional considerations for the terms you’re targeting. We’ll cover those next.</p>
<h4>Ensure topical alignment and authority</h4>
<p>Let’s say we have a website dedicated to a chain of medspas. We want to write an article about how long Botox lasts, and it looks like there’s enough search volume and low enough competition that targeting the term makes sense.</p>
<p>An initial check will be whether this term fits in with the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/topical-authority">topical authority</a> of our site.</p>
<p>What other kinds of terms does our site rank for?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ranking-search-terms-medspa.webp" alt="ranking terms for medspa in ahrefs" width="900" height="453" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94721" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ranking-search-terms-medspa.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ranking-search-terms-medspa-480x242.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It’s not uncommon that the top terms on the site will be branded or for a broad term the site ranks for. Still, you can also filter and dig down to see if you have terms of a similar competition level to the one you’re targeting that are semantically similar that you’re ranking for:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ranking-terms-botox-ahrefs.webp" alt="how often terms including botox are ranking for site in ahrefs" width="850" height="554" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94722" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ranking-terms-botox-ahrefs.webp 850w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ranking-terms-botox-ahrefs-480x313.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 850px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is a great sign for this site&#8211;they have related keywords that they’re already ranking for that are at a similar level of competition to our target term here.</p>
<p>We could also look at the number of pages on the site targeting these terms&#8211;if there’s already a cluster of 10+ pages on this topic, plus the site is ranking for related terms, that’s a great indication that we’re on the right track and will be able to create a blog post that ranks.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f50e.png" alt="🔎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Need help finding the right keywords?</strong> Try our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">Free Keyword Tool</a>!</p>
<h4>Check what’s in the SERP</h4>
<p>The next step is to check the actual search results to make sure that you’ll be able to get prominent placement (so that you both rank and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drive traffic</a>):</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/serp-for-botox-search.webp" alt="google serp for query about botox" width="399" height="1000" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94723" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/serp-for-botox-search.webp 399w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/serp-for-botox-search-120x300.webp 120w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /></p>
<p>This is a pretty common SERP, and a couple of things are concerning here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Overview</strong>: Multiple <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-ai-overviews-hurt-click-through-rates-454428" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies</a> (and even <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-explains-the-great-decoupling-39609.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admissions from Google</a>) have indicated that click-through rates on search results with an AI Overview are down. That doesn’t mean you can’t rank and drive clicks in this search result, but it complicates things somewhat.</li>
<li><strong>Medical sites:</strong> The presence of the Cleveland Clinic and The American Society of Plastic Surgeons at the top of the search results indicates that there may be a bias towards medical and authority sites in this SERP, but down the search result, we do see a medspa site and a couple of local-focused services sites ranking, so there’s some “hope” there.</li>
</ul>
<div id="give-google-what-they-want"></div>
<h3>2. Give Google what they want</h3>
<p>Next, you want to make sure that your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-write-a-blog-post">blog post</a> is a content type that Google “wants” to rank or has identified as an answer that searchers want.</p>
<p>This is more difficult than just copying the content type of the first result:</p>
<ol>
<li>Google will frequently list different content formats in the same SERP if some searchers are looking for a quick answer to the question, and others may be looking for a listicle or tool.</li>
<li>The “rules” are different for different types of sites. A highly authoritative site (like the Cleveland Clinic) may be able to rank first with a content type that your less authoritative medspa site can’t rank with.</li>
</ol>
<p>So you want to look at what’s ranking and build a better version of the asset type that sites with similar profiles (site type and level of authority) to yours are ranking with.</p>
<p>In the example above, you see the Cleveland Clinic has a general Botox guide ranking, but the medspa and services sites all have more specific answers to the question:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/types-of-content-ranking.webp" alt="types of content ranking in google for search" width="694" height="425" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94724" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/types-of-content-ranking.webp 694w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/types-of-content-ranking-480x294.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 694px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="demonstrate-eeat"></div>
<h3>3. Demonstrate EEAT</h3>
<p>There’s debate about the importance of “expertise, experience, authority, and trust” (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/14/google-e-e-a-t">EEAT</a>) in rankings for individual blog posts, but it’s a good idea to run through checks around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear author bios with additional information about authors, relevant video/social content, etc.</li>
<li>Information about the company, why readers should trust you, etc. (e.g., information about years of experience and expertise, development hours going into creating the product or service, number of customers/patients/clients).</li>
<li>Trust images and icons like major companies you work with, awards won, partners, testimonials, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Healthline ranks for the example query we used here&#8211;they rank well for many “Your Money or Your Life” queries and go above and beyond in this regard, with information on the medical reviewer on the post, as well as the author:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/your-money-your-life-medical-reviewer.webp" alt="reviewer bio for your money your life content" width="368" height="395" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94725" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/your-money-your-life-medical-reviewer.webp 368w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/your-money-your-life-medical-reviewer-279x300.webp 279w" sizes="(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px" /></p>
<p>And the article’s review history at the end of the post:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/content-review-transparency.webp" alt="content review transparency for EEAT" width="760" height="527" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94726" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/content-review-transparency.webp 760w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/content-review-transparency-480x333.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 760px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Including elements like this at the start of the post, in the right sidebar, or at the end of the post, and weaving in trust elements in the introduction of your post can help satisfy EEAT.</p>
<p>With best practices like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-increase-website-speed">improving page speed load times</a> and getting more branded mentions and searches, incorporating EEAT into your blog posts helps not only with SEO but also with conversion and visitor trust.</p>
<p>You don’t necessarily need to go to the lengths Healthline does if you’re a local business creating blog content in a less competitive non-YMYL niche, but baking EEAT elements into blog content helps that content rank and perform better.</p>
<div id="breakup-and-intelligently-format-content"></div>
<h3>4. Breakup and intelligently format content</h3>
<p>How you format your content is important for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ranking well in search engines (having the right content quickly and easily accessible to search engines).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/04/seo-content-readability">Readability</a> and ensuring your readers consume your content (which also impacts your engagement metrics and search engine rankings).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/generative-engine-optimization">Ranking well in AI tools</a> or LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure that your post is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Answering the core question quickly and succinctly. Look at the SERP again here&#8211;don’t just copy and paste an answer from an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-overviews-statistics">AI Overview</a> or featured snippet, but use the type of result (length, tone, etc.) that Google is returning as guidance for your own content.</li>
<li>Offering multiple formatting options where it makes sense (e.g., include an ordered list as well as the items as subheads within the post in a listicle).</li>
<li>Breaking up long blocks of text with numbered and bulleted lists, images, videos, social media posts, etc.</li>
</ul>
<div id="include-multiple-types-of-media"></div>
<h3>5. Include multiple types of media</h3>
<p>Along those lines, sourcing relevant images, videos, and social media posts can help with the engagement of your post, making it a more comprehensive resource, and allowing you to rank in different search results, like image search.</p>
<p>Set a word count (e.g., every 500 words) and make sure you include a piece of multimedia at that cadence through the article.</p>
<p>You can also look for opportunities to embed relevant video, or even create a relevant video based on your article (much easier now with AI voice and video generators).</p>
<div id="optimize-title-tags-and-meta-descriptions"></div>
<h3>6. Optimize title tags and meta descriptions</h3>
<p>If you’re focused on optimizing your blog post for SEO at all, you’re likely making sure you create a custom meta title tag and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/meta-description">meta description</a> as part of your process.</p>
<p>To optimize here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Think about the intent of the searcher&#8211;<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/06/irresistible-blog-post-titles">create a compelling title</a> and description that creates curiosity and makes a promise that searchers will want fulfilled.</li>
<li>Look at the search result&#8211;what types of titles and descriptions are present? Strike a balance between using any language you think will entice a click and differentiating your result (and remember to avoid “stealing” from larger sites that may just be there because of their authority).</li>
<li>Use tools like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/05/chatgpt-seo">ChatGPT</a> or similar to get ideas for optimized titles</li>
</ul>
<p>In our example result, there are a lot of title tags with variations of “how long does Botox last.” As you’re looking for language to include in your meta description or additional items to include in a title tag, the discussions and forums subsection can help:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/title-tag-sourcing-from-google-search-results.webp" alt="title tag and description ideas from google search results and forums" width="870" height="529" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94727" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/title-tag-sourcing-from-google-search-results.webp 870w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/title-tag-sourcing-from-google-search-results-480x292.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 870px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Some items to consider including based on the result:</p>
<ul>
<li>When will you be “back to normal”</li>
<li>Is it safe?</li>
<li>Factors that impact how long they last</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f50e.png" alt="🔎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Need help understanding the modern rules for SEO?</strong> Download our free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/how-to-do-seo-right?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SEOstrategies_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links/">How to Do SEO Right—Right Now!</a></p>
<div id="use-clean-simple-keyword-optimized-urls"></div>
<h3>7. Use clean, simple, keyword-optimized URLs</h3>
<p>Make sure that the URL of the post you’re publishing is clean, descriptive, and includes keywords (without being unnaturally crammed in).</p>
<div id="add-internal-links-to-relevant-pages"></div>
<h3>8. Add internal links to relevant pages</h3>
<p>Your writers should be looking for opportunities to link to relevant pages as they write, but before publishing, you also want to make sure there are internal links added where appropriate&#8211;e.g., if the article about Botox talks about facelifts and you have a page or post about it, make sure the link is included.</p>
<p>You can also look at your top-performing pages as well as pages on your site that are on the topic of the article, and include links to those. 5-10 is typically a good number to shoot for here.</p>
<div id="add-internal-links-from-relevant-pages"></div>
<h3>9. Add internal links from relevant pages</h3>
<p>Similarly, you want to find relevant pages on your site and include them in your new post. A quick site search operator is a good way to do this, and shows you which articles Google deems relevant for the topic of your post:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/find-internal-link-opportunities-google.webp" alt="how to find internal link opportunities" width="844" height="606" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94728" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/find-internal-link-opportunities-google.webp 844w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/find-internal-link-opportunities-google-480x345.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 844px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="implement-schema"></div>
<h3>10. Implement Schema</h3>
<p>Schema is a great opportunity to optimize for AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, etc.</p>
<p>Two types showing up frequently in those tools, and that will help Google better understand your blog content as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/faqpage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAQ schema</a></li>
<li><a href="https://schema.org/HowTo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HowTo schema</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re not sure about how your schema has been implemented, you can use Google’s <a href="https://search.google.com/test/rich-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rich results test</a>.</p>
<div id="check-that-post-is-ready-to-publish"></div>
<h3>11. Check that the post is indexable, images are optimized, etc.</h3>
<p>You can’t <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-ranking-factors-2025">rank in search results</a> if search engines aren’t indexing your content. Make sure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your page doesn’t have a noindex meta tag or a robots directive blocking it.</li>
<li>Items within the post (e.g., images) aren’t making your page unusually slow.</li>
<li>You actually published the page (and didn’t leave it as a draft, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>This is obviously an important round of checks to run as part of your publishing process.</p>
<div id="seo-checklist-template"></div>
<h2>SEO checklist template</h2>
<p>We pulled all of these items into an editable Google Sheets template&#8211;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/188_BkdsIt6ikpLG1UGhA5Jgv9_wxiT4fe0MEYrvzRA0/copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make a copy of it here</a>. Reference it as you brainstorm, write, and publish your content to give your posts the best chances for ranking in SERPs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/seo-checklist-template-wordstream-by-localiq.webp" alt="seo checklist template" width="900" height="667" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94729" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/seo-checklist-template-wordstream-by-localiq.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/seo-checklist-template-wordstream-by-localiq-480x356.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/188_BkdsIt6ikpLG1UGhA5Jgv9_wxiT4fe0MEYrvzRA0/copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click to copy</a></em></p>
<h2>Check all these items off your list for better SEO results</h2>
<p>If you run through these checks, you can continue to create blog content that ranks and drives traffic, leads, and sales through Google updates and the growth of AI tools.</p>

<h2>Top SEO trends and predictions for the rest of 2025</h2>
<p>Let’s break down what each of these trends and predictions is and what they mean for you and your strategy.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-predictions-2025.webp" alt="seo trends and predictions for the rest of 2025" width="900" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93394" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-predictions-2025.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-predictions-2025-480x427.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="seo-plus-geo"></div>
<h3>1. SEO now means “SEO” and “GEO”</h3>
<p>Whatever you want to call it, there’s been a lot of talk about SEO versus what I’ll call “GEO” (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/generative-engine-optimization">Generative Engine Optimization</a>)—the optimization of a site or business for visibility and placement within <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-ai-tools">AI tools</a> like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-geo-google-trends-searches.webp" alt="google trends result for searches for seo and geo" width="900" height="506" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93397" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-geo-google-trends-searches.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-geo-google-trends-searches-480x270.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There are several challenges in thinking about SEO and GEO right now:</p>
<ol>
<li>For most sites, SEO (or search traffic that comes primarily from Google or Bing) drives much more traffic than <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-referral-traffic">referrals from sites like ChatGPT, Claude, etc</a>. Even for sites that have lost traffic from Google.</li>
<li>It seems likely that that gap will close quickly in the coming months, but it’s difficult to tell how quickly and how much share will be directly “stolen” by AI tools or LLMs.</li>
<li>Many tactics that are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO best practices</a> are also best practices for gaining visibility in LLMs.</li>
<li>Some tactics will be much more valuable for placement in LLMs or won’t matter at all in SEO results, and some more aggressive GEO tactics could even get sites penalized in traditional <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-ranking-factors-2025">search rankings</a>.</li>
<li>SEO results are increasingly becoming a hybrid of traditional search results and AI-generated search results, with the increasing presence of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-overviews-impact-on-seo">AI Overviews in Google search results</a>.</li>
<li>Agentic search, or users using specific AI agents to perform specific tasks or answer specific questions, is in its infancy, and optimizing for placement in AI agents will likely require different tactics than either SEO or GEO.</li>
</ol>
<p>My prediction for the rest of 2025 is that for most businesses, the responsibility of “SEO” will encapsulate both optimizing for search placement on Google and placement in LLMs. Marketing teams or agencies will be expected to work on tasks that aid with both of these things. And, as the numbers for referrals from LLMs get more and more interesting, businesses will want to understand the optimization process and be willing to focus more resources on getting placement and visibility there. I also believe that in many cases, where <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/03/organic-traffic">SEO traffic</a> is less accessible for some sites, they’ll look to shift focus and investment from traditional SEO to GEO.</p>

<div id="schema-markup"></div>
<h3>2. Schema will be a focal point</h3>
<p>As Martha van Berkel <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/factors-to-consider-when-implementing-schema-markup-at-scale/543935/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently pointed out</a>:</p>
<p><em>“In March 2025, Fabrice Canel, principal program manager at Bing, confirmed that Microsoft uses structured data to support how its large language models (LLMs) interpret web content.</em></p>
<p><em>Just a day later, at Google’s Search Central Live event in New York, Google structured data engineer Ryan Levering shared that schema markup plays a critical role in grounding and scaling Google’s own generative AI systems. ‘A lot of our systems run much better with structured data,’ he noted, adding that ‘it’s computationally cheaper than extracting it.’”</em></p>
<p>As businesses become more interested in GEO in the remainder of 2025, the use of schema will become more of a focus.</p>
<p>The specific form of schema you’d use will vary from niche to niche, but a few that I predict will be more commonly used:</p>
<ul>
<li>FAQ</li>
<li>Carousel</li>
<li>Data Set</li>
<li>Q&amp;A and Forums</li>
<li>How-To</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-schema-detected.webp" alt="google search console showing structured data aka schema detected on site" width="834" height="340" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93398" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-schema-detected.webp 834w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-schema-detected-480x196.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 834px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And sites will continue to use schema like organization, product or software, recipe, etc. (but may be even more diligent in implementing these kinds of schema).</p>
<div id="brand-mentions-on-listicles"></div>
<h3>3. Brand mentions on listicles will be a big goal for many businesses</h3>
<p>As LLMs gain more and more traction through the rest of 2025, businesses will be looking for tactics that have characteristics like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving SEO traffic, particularly with mid to lower funnel terms.</li>
<li>Improving GEO visibility and rankings/traffic.</li>
<li>Helping with general marketing.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.siegemedia.com/conversation/aeo-playbook-how-to-optimize-for-ai-w-profounds-josh-blyskal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data suggests</a> that listicles get cited more than any other content type by LLMs currently. Additionally, GEOs are looking at <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/ai-overview-brand-correlation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how frequently your brand is mentioned</a> in conjunction with specific terms.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-search-for-inventory-management-software.webp" alt="chatgpt result for inventory management software search" width="900" height="501" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93399" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-search-for-inventory-management-software.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-search-for-inventory-management-software-480x267.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here’s an example of the power of listicles—a search for “email outreach software:”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/email-outreach-software-search-results-ai-overview-listing.webp" alt="email outreach software search result and ai over overview listing" width="900" height="479" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93400" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/email-outreach-software-search-results-ai-overview-listing.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/email-outreach-software-search-results-ai-overview-listing-480x255.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The results show a best of list from Saleshady. On the list itself, they rank themselves first, and list competitors:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-listicle-with-brand-names-saleshandy.webp" alt="listicle with brand names example from saleshandy" width="900" height="408" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93401" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-listicle-with-brand-names-saleshandy.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-listicle-with-brand-names-saleshandy-480x218.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Focusing on creating and getting listed on listicles and having your brand mentioned alongside the categories you want to show up for will be an increasingly emphasized and executed tactic as 2025 wears on.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Looking for more ways to drive people to your site?</strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website</a></p>
<div id="ai-overview-optimization"></div>
<h3>4. We’ll see more emphasis on AI Overview optimization<a href="http://rankhouse.pl"></a></h3>
<p>The image below is an example of “The Great Decoupling” in SEO, where many sites with AI Overviews in their highest traffic search results are seeing an increase in impressions from search but a drop in actual clicks or visits.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/great-decoupling-ai-overviews-plus-organic-traffic.webp" alt="picture of person presenting great decoupling in web traffic and impressions due to ai overviews" width="600" height="633" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93402" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/great-decoupling-ai-overviews-plus-organic-traffic.webp 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/great-decoupling-ai-overviews-plus-organic-traffic-480x506.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="http://rankhouse.pl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>This is because their site is getting featured in AI Overviews, but their listing in traditional search results is getting pushed down, resulting in less traffic.</p>
<p>As AI Overviews show up in an increasing number of search results in 2025, I predict there will be an increase in advice and emphasis on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-overviews-optimization">AI Overview optimization</a>.</p>
<p>Even though the click-through rate on those placements is much lower than traditional search, finding ways to get featured in and extract clicks from those listings will be the only available traffic in many SERPs, so businesses will turn to optimizing for that real estate (even if the traffic feels like crumbs compared to top rankings previously).</p>
<div id="mid-to-lower-funnel-content"></div>
<h3>5. We’ll see a shift toward mid-to-lower funnel content</h3>
<p>Along those same lines, as it becomes obvious that traffic from some top funnel, informational search queries “isn’t coming back,” sites will shift focus within their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/keyword-mapping">keyword targeting</a>.</p>
<p>While many search results may not be safe from AI Overviews, certain content types will perform better in a “post AI world,” and those will be more of a focus for websites and publishers looking to get traffic from SEO and GEO.</p>
<p>Let’s say you had an inventory management software company that had been generating a lot of top-funnel traffic from &#8220;what is X&#8221; types of queries, and traffic to glossary-style pages has dropped due to AI Overviews:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/inventory-management-ai-overview-result.webp" alt="ai overview result for search for what is inventory management" width="900" height="411" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93404" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/inventory-management-ai-overview-result.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/inventory-management-ai-overview-result-480x219.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The software category itself—while a competitive query—does allow for real estate for a software company:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/inventory-management-software-search-result.webp" alt="inventory management software search result" width="879" height="606" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93405" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/inventory-management-software-search-result.webp 879w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/inventory-management-software-search-result-480x331.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 879px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Similarly, the software category + the industries you serve, while not driving as much top-line traffic as what is X queries, could offer traffic and much stronger conversion rates:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hvac-inventory-management-software-search-results.webp" alt="hvac inventory management software search result" width="854" height="609" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93406" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hvac-inventory-management-software-search-results.webp 854w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hvac-inventory-management-software-search-results-480x342.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 854px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And you see here, by building comparison pages, this company is jumping ahead of the AIO (on desktop at the time of searching, anyway):</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-comparison-pages.webp" alt="example of comparison content pages" width="877" height="606" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93407" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-comparison-pages.webp 877w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-comparison-pages-480x332.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 877px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As the traffic opportunity for top-funnel, informational pages dries up, emphasis on these types of lower to mid-funnel content types will be even greater for the rest of 2025.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/first-page-of-google?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_10WaysFirstPageGoogle_Download">10 Tangible &amp; Free Ways to Get on the First Page of Google</a></p>
<div id="businesses-release-ai-tools"></div>
<h3>6. More businesses will release AI tools</h3>
<p>With the rapid improvement of AI coding tools (and the introduction of AI into various types of tools), creating simple, useful, free tools is easier than ever, but most sites and companies still aren’t taking advantage of it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-tool-website-speed-test-gtmetrix.webp" alt="example of an ai tool for a website speed test" width="900" height="399" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93408" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-tool-website-speed-test-gtmetrix.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-tool-website-speed-test-gtmetrix-480x213.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Additionally, while many affiliate sites have been wiped from search results after the <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-march-2024-core-update-rollout-is-now-complete-438713" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helpful Content Update</a>, many sites built around a core tool or set of tools are still thriving.</p>
<p>I predict the second half of 2025 will see more sites recognize this opportunity, and tools like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calculators</li>
<li>Interactive checklists or planners</li>
<li>Document generators (templates)</li>
<li>Niche-specific tools like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">The Free Keyword Tool</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And other tool types will be introduced to both answer search queries as a page and even serve as more and more businesses&#8217; homepage or above-the-fold experience.</p>
<p>Think about the types of problems your prospects have that can be solved with things like templates:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-ai-tools-research.webp" alt="example of ai tools opportunity research" width="900" height="511" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93409" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-ai-tools-research.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-ai-tools-research-480x273.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And whether those templates can be turned into tools and calculators. A template could be transformed into empty fields for a visitor to input a project plan, or questions that imply a calculation. “How big should my dog crate be?” could be a dog crate chart and/or calculator. “What size TV should I get?” could be a TV size calculator.</p>
<p>These assets can help your SEO focused page rank, can generate links from other sites, and can be referenced in LLM results.</p>
<div id="link-building"></div>
<h3>7. Link building will become even more valuable</h3>
<p>If the above predictions are correct and more sites are attempting to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimize for both SEO and GEO</li>
<li>Focus more on mid to lower funnel topics for SEO</li>
<li>Increase brand mentions and placement on listicles</li>
</ul>
<p>Then “<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/link-building">link building</a>” as a tactic will become even more valuable and get more investment as the year goes on.</p>
<p>Specifically, the link-building tactics that best fit these three priorities include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Digital PR</strong>: High-quality links from major publications where thought leaders within a company and the industry itself is mentioned in conjunction with category terms help both SEO and GEO. Things like quotes in relevant articles, data-rich articles with specific insights for journalists, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Deep links</strong>: Deep links from tactics like guest posting into specific pages that are mid to lower funnel help support that strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Listicle placements</strong>: Again, with listicle placements, the links from these types of posts help SEO, and placement on these types of assets seems to disproportionately help with GEO placement and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/11/29/referral-traffic">referral traffic</a>. As a tactic, this can be either reaching out to existing assets for placement or creating an asset to be placed on a third-party site.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stay ahead of the changing SEO landscape throughout 2025</h2>
<p>For the remainder of 2025 (and into 2026), the overarching theme for businesses and websites looking to drive traffic from SEO will be to <strong>identify and exploit the opportunities that help drive both SEO and GEO traffic and leads</strong>.</p>
<p>Which specific tactics you focus on will vary depending on your site and your niche and will include a mix of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Link building</li>
<li>Brand mentions</li>
<li>Mid to lower funnel content</li>
<li>Tools</li>
<li>Schema</li>
</ul>
<p>Identifying the right mix of tactics for your business will help with both SEO and GEO growth for most sites.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2025 has been a crazy year in search engine optimization.

<h2>7 SEO ranking factors you need to optimize for in 2025</h2>
<p>Let’s get into the most important ranking factors to keep an eye on if you want your SEO strategy to excel this year.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/seo-ranking-factors-2025.webp" alt="seo ranking factors 2025" width="900" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93316" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/seo-ranking-factors-2025.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/seo-ranking-factors-2025-480x427.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="authority-and-links"></div>
<h3>1. Authority and links</h3>
<p>Domain authority, external links to specific pages, and internal links still matter a lot in Google searches.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/seo-ranking-factor-domain-authority.webp" alt="domain authority measurement from ahrefs" width="907" height="308" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93254" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/seo-ranking-factor-domain-authority.webp 907w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/seo-ranking-factor-domain-authority-480x163.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 907px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Semrush found <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/ai-mode-comparison-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a recent study</a> that AI Overviews showed significant overlap—around 86% domain and 67% URL—with traditional Google search results.</p>
<p>So whether your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-overviews-impact-on-seo">search results are being impacted by AI Overviews</a> or not, authority and links to your site (which have a massive impact on traditional organic rankings) are still important.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/link-building">Link building</a> can be done via a number of different methods. Some that “still work” to help impact this basket of ranking factors include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Links from profiles and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-citations">local citations</a> pointing to your domain and helping Google understand more about your business.</li>
<li>Digital PR links and general public relations links.</li>
<li>Guest posting.</li>
<li>Traditional link outreach.</li>
</ol>
<p>Within even those broad tactics, there are many more specific approaches (studies, data-focused articles, city-specific or localized content, etc.), but regardless of your approach, the volume and quality of links to your domain and to your site’s individual pages is a very important basket of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/09/google-ranking-factors">ranking factors</a> to keep in mind in 2025.</p>

<div id="engagement-metrics"></div>
<h3>2. Engagement metrics</h3>
<p>Google has <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long said</a> that factors like how quickly pages load and their mobile-friendliness are ranking factors. In recent years, through leaked documents and testimony, Google has <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/an-anonymous-source-shared-thousands-of-leaked-google-search-api-documents-with-me-everyone-in-seo-should-see-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted </a>that metrics like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/10/13/organic-seo-ctr-infographic">click-through rate</a> and how a searcher interacts with a search results page are ranking factors for Google.</p>
<p>This means that it’s still important to optimize for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pages that load quickly and are mobile-friendly.</li>
<li>Title tags and headlines that generate high click-through rates and deliver on the promises of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/meta-description">meta titles and descriptions</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/seo-meta-description-optimization.png" alt="seo meta description optimization" width="720" height="308" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63402" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/seo-meta-description-optimization.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/seo-meta-description-optimization-480x205.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="page-speed-and-page-experience"></div>
<h3>3. Page speed and page experience</h3>
<p>You can use free tools like <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s PageSpeed tool</a> or the <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GT Metrix testing tool</a> to get quick suggestions about tasks to clean up to help your pages load more quickly:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ranking-factors-page-speed-insights.webp" alt="google pagespeed tool recommendations" width="900" height="418" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93255" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ranking-factors-page-speed-insights.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ranking-factors-page-speed-insights-480x223.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you’re a small business owner, these insights may not mean much to you, but a web developer should be able to review these and address the highest impact, simplest items. Most often, we see sites with issues like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legacy JavaScript:</strong> This may be from a tool you no longer use, or some code that a developer added to your site previously that the site no longer needs—this is a great opportunity because it “costs” you nothing in terms of the site’s performance and helps speed things up.</li>
<li><strong>Render blocking:</strong> Often, your site may have a specific tool (like tracking tools or some specific code) that isn’t needed for the visitor to see your site immediately, but that you want to load eventually. You can load those elements later in the process and create a much better experience for visitors.</li>
</ul>
<p>These opportunities vary from site to site, but for most small businesses, there will be some opportunities like this.</p>
<p>Improving load times is especially valuable because it can also help your site’s conversion rates.</p>
<div id="click-through-rate-improvements"></div>
<h3>4. Click-through rate improvements</h3>
<p>Having pages—particularly your most popular pages—that are frequently clicked on when visitors see them in search results will have a major impact on your rankings.</p>
<p>The percentage of times searchers click on your website listings is your click-through rate, and you want to optimize this for key pages and for all of your pages. Your main opportunities here are a page’s meta title tag, and its meta description:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ranking-factors-click-through-rates.webp" alt="seo ranking factors - meta description example to increase ctr" width="900" height="308" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93256" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ranking-factors-click-through-rates.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ranking-factors-click-through-rates-480x164.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>How do you know what to include in the page title and meta description? Think of it like you would ad text in a pay-per-click ad:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understand basic marketing</strong>: Does your title and description satisfy the search queries that <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drive the most traffic</a> to the relevant page? What is the searcher really looking for? Try to find a way to:
<ol>
<li>Promise that thing.</li>
<li>Do it in a way that’s differentiated from other sites.</li>
<li>Make sure you deliver on that on the page.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Look at the SERP</strong>: A good place to look for ideas is in the search result itself. What is the title tag of sites ranking higher than yours? There may be multiple reasons those sites rank, so don’t just copy their titles and descriptions blindly, but it may give you some food for thought.</li>
<li><strong>Use AI tools</strong>: Title tags and meta descriptions are an area where tools like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/08/chatgpt-prompts">ChatGPT</a> or Perplexity are very good at ideation and giving you possible formats you can use. Give the tool as much information as you can (your title tag, the title tags of other pages that rank, the search terms your page shows up for, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Include your own data:</strong> Look in Google Search Console at your own pages. If there are specific pages that get a particularly high click-through rate (outside of your homepage, which likely does well because of branded traffic to your site), the title tag you use there may be a strong one to consider for other, similar pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Along those lines, if you have a site that’s getting a few hundred or even a few thousand visitors a month, you don’t need to spend a lot of time optimizing title tags and meta descriptions throughout your site. Focus on the few pages getting the most traffic from search, and the formula for collections of pages.</p>
<p>For instance, if you have a music lessons site with a series of local pages targeting terms like piano lessons in Kalamazoo, piano lessons in Portage, etc., look at the click-through rates for those pages, look at the ideas you have for the most highly trafficked pages there, and make changes across those pages and measure accordingly. You can do this periodically as well—probably every six months or so.</p>
<p>The more traffic your site and individual pages have, the more it makes sense to spend more time optimizing CTR and titles and descriptions.</p>

<div id="branded-search"></div>
<h3>5. Branded search</h3>
<p>Google has <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/googles-branded-search-patent-for-ranking-search-results/524083/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patents</a> for using branded search traffic as a proxy for how trusted a site should be. This can be a difficult thing to “optimize” for, but some ways to think about this include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PR.</strong> Traditional PR and getting featured in the publications your prospects read most often is a great way to get people to search for your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Signage, trucks, etc.</strong> Having signage for your business, wrapping trucks if you have a business where those are in the wild, etc., is another way to drive branded search.</li>
<li><strong>Partnerships.</strong> Partnering with relevant businesses (in the case of a local business, this could be other businesses in your area, particularly those that your best prospects would be likely to use—e.g., if you offer music lessons, a local musical instrument store, or even different companies offering kids’ activities).</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/branded-search-ranking-factor.webp" alt="example of a branded search" width="872" height="607" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93257" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/branded-search-ranking-factor.webp 872w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/branded-search-ranking-factor-480x334.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 872px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There are similar advantages to increasing branded search to improving page speed, in that you’re getting more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">brand awareness</a> generally and helping your business, not just your search rankings.</p>
<p>One note here: While Google has explicitly <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/unlinked-citations-google-rankings-29490.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that branded mentions that aren’t links are not a ranking factor, there is evidence that these help power your visibility in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-ai-tools">AI tools</a> like ChatGPT, Claude, etc., and that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-citations">citations</a> help with local rankings if you have a business focused on local SEO.</p>
<div id="content-relevance"></div>
<h3>6. Content relevance</h3>
<p>The idea that you would need to have a page be relevant to a search query is obvious, but becoming a “<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/topical-authority">topical authority</a>” and creating “<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/topic-clusters-for-local-seo">topic clusters</a>” for SEO is an additional factor that Google and Google patents have referenced many times.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topic-clusters-png.webp" alt="topic clusters how they work" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89790" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topic-clusters-png.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topic-clusters-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here are some of the things Google has said about topic clusters and building authority:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google prioritizes topic clusters</strong>: Google’s patents explicitly use the notion of “topical clusters” when weighting links. For example, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US7716225B1/en#:~:text=higher%20probability%20of%20being%20selected,or%20combinations%20of%20feature%20data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Google patent on ranking documents</a> notes that “<em>when a topical cluster associated with the source document is related to a topical cluster associated with the target document, the link has a higher probability of being selected.</em>” In other words, links between pages on the same topic (same topical cluster) are considered more likely (and thus more valuable) than links between unrelated pages.</li>
<li><strong>Internal links are important:</strong> In another Google patent on onsite ranking, Google describes how links from pages within the same site signal importance. It <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US8843477B1/en#:~:text=computers,include%20the%20number%20of%20keywords" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explains</a> that if “<em>numerous other web pages associated with the same domain contain links to that particular web page, the web page may be of greater importance within the domain compared to other web pages.</em>” This underscores that pages heavily linked by other pages on the same site (often topically related pages) are treated as more central within that site.</li>
<li><strong>It helps to merge related pages:</strong> Google’s John Mueller has <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/combining-web-pages/276633/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoken about</a> combining related pages to improve relevance. He explained that if you merge several weaker pages on a common topic into one, the resulting page becomes “<strong>a stronger page</strong>” because <em>“more parts of the site are referring to this one single piece of content, so it’s probably more relevant than those individual small pieces you had before.” </em>This reflects that internally linking and consolidating semantically related content boosts that content’s perceived relevance.</li>
<li><strong>A topic focus is essential:</strong> Mueller also <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/combining-web-pages/276633/#:~:text=,topic%20of%20this%20page%3F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cautioned against combining unrelated content</a>. He noted that merging “two completely separate pages” on different topics forces Google to ask <em>“What’s the primary topic of this page?”</em> This implies Google expects a clear, focused topic per page (and by extension per site section), suggesting a site should group similar topics rather than mix them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f698.png" alt="🚘" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Looking for more ways to drive people to your site?</strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website</a></p>
<div id="content-accessibility"></div>
<h3>7. Content accessibility</h3>
<p>Making pages and content accessible to search engines is the most fundamental way you can give your content a chance to rank.</p>
<p>If your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/no-website-traffic">site currently isn’t getting traffic</a>, you can run diagnostics and make sure that you don’t have issues with things like noindex tags, robots.txt directives, or other technical issues keeping your content from being crawled, indexed, and then returned in search results.</p>
<p>Google Search Console has helpful tools to identify whether pages have been discovered, crawled, or indexed:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indexation-ranking-factor.webp" alt="report for why pages aren't indexed in google search console" width="813" height="511" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93258" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indexation-ranking-factor.webp 813w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indexation-ranking-factor-480x302.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 813px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="ranking-for-search-everywhere-optimization"></div>
<h2>Bonus: Search “everywhere” optimization ranking factors</h2>
<p>While there’s a lot of back and forth about what to call getting visibility in tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc., some have argued that this kind of visibility <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/its-still-seo-search-everywhere-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is still SEO</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-overviews-optimization">AI Overviews</a> and placement in LLMs have their own set of ranking factors, and a lot of overlap with traditional SEO ranking factors (which still drive the majority of referred traffic from search for most sites).</p>
<p>Beyond these factors, specific things like using schema formatting, showing up prominently in listicles with brand mentions, and other factors can help your site show up in AI search results as well as traditional SERPs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your Google Business Profile (formerly called Google My Business profile) can be one of your most important marketing (and even business) assets. For some businesses, more calls will come through the company&#8217;s GBP than the company website.</p>

<h2>10 Google Business Profile features to use</h2>
<p>Let’s walk through each option you should take advantage of in your Google Business Profile.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-features.webp" alt="google business profile features homescreen" width="691" height="244" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91901" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-features.webp 691w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-features-480x169.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 691px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="business-information"></div>
<h3>Business information</h3>
<p>Obviously, as you <a href="https://business.google.com/create/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set up your GBP</a>, you want to make sure you have the most important “blocking and tackling” items taken care of on your profile:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use your legal business name (don’t try to cram keywords into your business name that aren’t consistent with your actual business name).</li>
<li>Make sure that the information you provide for your business name, address, and phone number is consistent with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-citations">any citations you have built or will build</a>.</li>
<li>Provide as much detail as you can within your profile, including hours, amenities, etc.</li>
<li>Pay particular attention here to your service areas, these will be the surrounding areas where your ideal customers can be found. Make sure that you’re including any city or town where you’d find an ideal prospect or customer, but not towns where you’d be reluctant to service an account (even if you may have in the past).</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-business-information.webp" alt="google business profile business information" width="678" height="421" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91902" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-business-information.webp 678w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-business-information-480x298.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 678px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As a general approach here, you want to be comprehensive and accurate—make sure the information in your profile matches information about your business elsewhere on the internet, and fill out every form you possibly can here.</p>
<div id="services"></div>
<h3>Services</h3>
<p>You want to take control of the services you offer on your profile: if you don’t, Google can make adjustments to your profile based on user feedback or other sources.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-services.webp" alt="google business profile services" width="676" height="124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91903" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-services.webp 676w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-services-480x88.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 676px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Generally, you want to be as aggressive as you can with adding services that you offer, while making sure that your primary category is your core service offering.</p>
<p>For instance, if you are a roofing company that also does roof cleaning, gutter cleaning, and skylight installations, you’d want to use roofing as your primary category and add the rest as services. If you don’t see a specific service you offer, you can create a custom service:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-custom-service.webp" alt="google business profile custom services" width="679" height="184" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91904" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-custom-service.webp 679w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-custom-service-480x130.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 679px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You don’t want to add things you don’t offer, however. For example, if you don’t offer gutter cleaning, don’t list it.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure which services to list here, a few options include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at your top competitors&#8211;particularly the competitors ranking well for the search queries you want to rank for&#8211;and see which services they have listed.</li>
<li>Do <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide">keyword research</a> and think about the services you offer to customers.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-ai-tools">AI tools</a> like ChatGPT to generate ideas for possible services based on your business and competitor profiles.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do choose to use an AI tool, make sure to review its output before adding any inaccurate services to your Google Business Profile.</p>

<h3>Reviews, reviews, reviews</h3>
<p>Reviews are the lifeblood of your GBP. In the same way that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/10/link-building-secrets">acquiring external links</a> to your website helps indicate to Google that your site should be trusted and should show in response to key search results, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-online-reviews-impact-your-business">positive reviews</a> help suggest to Google that your GBP should be trusted to show in response to your target keywords.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-reviews.webp" alt="google business profile reviews" width="672" height="159" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91905" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-reviews.webp 672w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-reviews-480x114.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 672px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Reviews are a massively important part of driving rankings, traffic, calls, leads, and sales through your GBP.</p>
<p>Every business with a focus on driving growth from its GBP should have a strategy for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/16/get-more-google-reviews">getting more Google reviews</a> and should be responding as quickly as possible to every individual review.</p>
<p>A member of your team with the bandwidth to respond quickly should be getting emails for every new review. You can see if you have a new review in your Google profile by looking for the notification icon in your GBP:</p>
<p>Google also gives businesses an “ask for reviews” tool, which you can use to request reviews from your customers:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-get-reviews.webp" alt="google business profile request reviews feature" width="644" height="431" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91906" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-get-reviews.webp 644w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-get-reviews-480x321.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 644px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>A few specific tips for using this feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to get a device into the hands of a service provider on your team and ask for feedback on the service immediately after completion.</li>
<li>Ask for feedback and ensure that the customer is happy before requesting a review&#8211;this way, if they have any lingering issues or questions, you can address them before asking for the review, ensuring that the review will be as positive as possible.</li>
<li>Offering money or services in exchange for a positive review is against Google’s guidelines, but you can mention that positive reviews help your business. And, if you have an incentive program for the service provider based on positive reviews, you can also mention that to help encourage the customer to leave a positive review. Again, asking on-site, in person, with a device ready to go to make it as easy as possible will greatly increase your odds of receiving a positive review.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve been in business a long time and have a database of customer information, you can also put together a strategy for going back through your existing and previous customer lists and asking for reviews.</p>

<div id="posts-photos-and-qna-sections"></div>
<h3>Posts, photos, and Q&amp;A sections</h3>
<p>Having specific elements of your profile frequently updated and making those updates specific to your target services and service areas can improve your GBP rankings for specific phrases in specific areas. Two major opportunities here are photos and posts:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-photos-updates.webp" alt="google business profile photos and updates or posts" width="699" height="153" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91907" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-photos-updates.webp 699w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-photos-updates-480x105.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 699px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Regardless of your business, you can find new opportunities to create updates (daily is frequently a good cadence) and add new photos to your profile, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>For service-based businesses, jobs you’ve completed, including information about the location of the job.</li>
<li>For a restaurant, photos of your restaurant, food you’re making, patrons enjoying your food (with permission of course).</li>
<li>For a dentist’s office, photos of your facility, equipment, before and after photos, happy customers, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also post updates about local businesses you partner with, updates on your business, jobs you’re completing, customer profiles, profiles of your employees, etc.</p>
<p>Similarly, building out and periodically updating your Q&amp;A section of your profile with relevant questions and answers is another means of keeping your profile fresh and comprehensive.</p>
<p>Consistently updating your photos and posts and making sure that you’re mentioning the services you offer, along with the areas you’re servicing, helps you show up in response to relevant searches.</p>
<div id="offers-and-events"></div>
<h3>Offers and events</h3>
<p>Similarly, adding information about events you’re having and special offers you’re running helps you get specific search results real estate for your business.</p>
<p>You don’t want to “fake” offers, and this may not be applicable to every small business, but if you run specials and host events, it’s smart to make sure those are represented consistently on your GBP profile.</p>
<div id="performance-metrics"></div>
<h3>Performance metrics</h3>
<p>You should be using multiple tools (Google Analytics 4, Search Console, and call and lead tracking software) to track your overall <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-seo-in-2024">local SEO efforts</a>, but the performance report in GBP gives you specific access to data about your profile, like interactions, calls, etc.</p>
<p>Some of this data can be found in other tools, but it’s helpful to understand how visitors are interacting with your profile and to make sure your optimization efforts are growing desired actions (particularly calls, bookings, and website clicks).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-performance-metrics.webp" alt="google business profile performance metrics example" width="900" height="335" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91908" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-performance-metrics.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-performance-metrics-480x179.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="specialized-gbp-features"></div>
<h3>Specialized GBP features</h3>
<p>Many of the features above apply to several or even all locally focused businesses, but several GBP features are specific to certain types of businesses.</p>
<p>It’s important to be aware of these if you’re a business owner or marketing professional in one of those categories.</p>
<div id="booking"></div>
<h4>Booking</h4>
<p>Bookings allow your customers to book directly from your GBP&#8211;if you’re showing up prominently and getting views of your profile, this could be a great way to get customers who don’t want to engage via phone or your website to book an appointment with you right online.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-booking.webp" alt="google business profile booking feature" width="640" height="417" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91909" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-booking.webp 640w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-business-profile-booking-480x313.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 640px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It’s important to understand, however, that you need to be able to accommodate and respond to booking inquiries. If you’re using a third-party system to manage your bookings, you can find out if they integrate with GBP by looking at Google’s <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/reserve/partners?ihs=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Reserve with Google” integration list</a> to see if your provider is listed (and can even request an addition if they’re not yet).</p>
<div id="products"></div>
<h4>Products</h4>
<p>You can also list products on your GBP&#8211;even if you’re a service provider (e.g., if you’re a salon that also sells select hair care or beauty products).</p>
<p>When adding products, you want to optimize them as you would any product listing: have compelling photos and product descriptions, include deep links to the place on your site where they can purchase the product, and keep information on your GBP accurate and up to date (pricing, availability, etc).</p>
<div id="api-and-multi-location-tools"></div>
<h4>API and multi-location tools</h4>
<p>If you have multiple locations, you can use tools like adding a store code or a label to your profile. You can also access the <a href="https://developers.google.com/my-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">API</a> if you have specialized needs and access to a developer.</p>
<p>Google also offers integration with other tools&#8211;such as Google Ads&#8211;which can be valuable if you’re running ads or want the data from your GBP piped into a reporting tool you’re using.</p>
<div id="menu-updates"></div>
<h4>Menu updates</h4>
<p>In addition to bookings and products, GBP allows restaurants to make menu updates. That’s not relevant if you’re not a restaurant. Still, it’s a great opportunity to both show in response to specific searches (e.g., “the best cheeseburger near me”) and give potential customers more information about pricing and what you offer.</p>
<h2>How to think about Google Business Profile features</h2>
<p>Google offers a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfK7mx2knZUBZYE9iGB4AN6uRKawYfMP5NbGFhGU4PX3QONRg/viewform?visit_id=638826603544046897-2053364266&amp;p=subscribe&amp;rd=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monthly newsletter</a> that includes feature updates <a href="https://support.google.com/business/thread/343006067/what-s-new-in-google-business-profile-may-2025?hl=en-GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like these</a> each month and has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/googlebusinessprofile/featured" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube channel</a> dedicated to Google Business Profile updates and tutorials.</p>
<p>As Google introduces new features and tools like AI writing assistants, it’s useful to keep in mind a few things as you determine which makes the most sense for your business:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Be fresh and comprehensive</strong>. Generally, having your information updated frequently and filling out your profile as completely as possible is the best way to show up more frequently. So as niche-specific features are rolled out, it’s usually worthwhile to take the time to complete them.</li>
<li><strong>Remember that tools aren’t features</strong>. While it’s generally a good idea to make sure your information is accurate, to use features like posts or niche-specific features like menus when they’re relevant to you, you don’t need to make use of every AI tool Google rolls out. Often, those tools are made available for businesses who wouldn’t complete their profiles otherwise, and you or someone on your team may be able to write better descriptions, fill in information more accurately, etc. Just because Google offers a specific tool doesn’t mean you have to leverage it.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor news, filter noise</strong>. It’s great to stay on top of features and push relevant, localized information about your business to those features, but you also don’t need to keep track of every minute update Google makes that doesn’t apply specifically to your business.</li>
</ol>
<p>And generally, approach your Google Business Profile like your website or even your storefront: it’s an asset that can help introduce and connect you with customers and potential customers.</p>

<h2>5 reasons you’re not getting website traffic (+what to do about it!)</h2>
<p>Here, we’ll walk through each of the top reasons you’re <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/offset-lower-website-traffic">not seeing traffic</a> to your site and what you can do to fix it.</p>
<div id="your-reporting-is-messed-up"></div>
<h3>1. You’re having reporting issues</h3>
<p>The first question to ask yourself is whether the tool you’re using to report on organic traffic is accurate (and if you’re using it right).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what to do about it.</p>
<h4>Check Google Analytics 4</h4>
<p>A lot of people <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/75-are-not-happy-with-google-analytics-4-ga4-35843.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t like GA4</a>, and if you’re not used to using that tool, you may be using filters incorrectly.</p>
<p>You can quickly check for the existence of organic traffic from search engines by going to reports &gt; acquisition &gt; user acquisition and looking at the First user primary channel group:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-analytics-user-acquisition-organic.webp" alt="google analytics 4 acquisition report for organic search" width="1235" height="438" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91767" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-analytics-user-acquisition-organic.webp 1235w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-analytics-user-acquisition-organic-980x348.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-analytics-user-acquisition-organic-480x170.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1235px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In any view where you’re expecting to see organic search traffic but aren’t, make sure it’s not being filtered out:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-analytics-user-acquisition-all-users.webp" alt="google analytics 4 acquisition report check for all users" width="836" height="253" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91768" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-analytics-user-acquisition-all-users.webp 836w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-analytics-user-acquisition-all-users-480x145.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 836px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you’re looking at an exploration in GA4, the same principles would apply: make sure you understand the way the report is set up and are aware of any filters being applied.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Looking for ways to drive people to your site?</strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website</a></p>
<h4>Check Google Search Console</h4>
<p>If you’re not seeing traffic in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/16/how-to-use-google-search-console">Google Search Console</a>, the filtering issue won’t be traffic source (as it’s showing you only Google-specific traffic), but could be another issue:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-brand-filter.webp" alt="google search console filters" width="1061" height="326" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91769" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-brand-filter.webp 1061w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-brand-filter-980x301.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-brand-filter-480x147.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1061px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Make sure you’re not filtering by queries, page, etc.</p>
<div id="your-website-isnt-getting-indexed"></div>
<h3>2. Your website isn’t getting indexed</h3>
<p>Assuming you’ve checked the tools with which you’re measuring traffic and have confirmed that you are legitimately not getting traffic from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/outdated-seo-tactics">SEO</a>, the first thing to confirm is that your pages are actually getting indexed.</p>
<p>Here’s what to do about it.</p>
<h4>Confirm your site is (or isn’t) getting indexed</h4>
<p>First, check to see if your site is getting indexed. You can do that in two ways:</p>
<p><strong>1. Site search operator:</strong> You can quickly see if your site has pages indexed by using a site search operator. Go to Google and type in site:yoursite dot com and see what results are showing. You should see results like this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/site-search-site-indexed-example.webp" alt="example of google site search for indexed website" width="833" height="396" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91770" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/site-search-site-indexed-example.webp 833w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/site-search-site-indexed-example-480x228.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 833px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And not results like this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/example-site-search-site-not-indexed.webp" alt="example of site not indexed in google search results" width="836" height="605" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91771" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/example-site-search-site-not-indexed.webp 836w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/example-site-search-site-not-indexed-480x347.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 836px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you have Google Search Console set up, you can receive even more robust reporting on which pages on your site are indexed and their current status.</p>
<p><strong>2. Google Search Console:</strong> Once you see the breakdown of not only the pages on your site that aren’t indexed, but also the reason, you can start to address issues:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-pages-report.webp" alt="google search console pages report" width="1222" height="444" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91772" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-pages-report.webp 1222w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-pages-report-980x356.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-pages-report-480x174.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1222px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In this screenshot, we see a few different problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broken links (a page may have been deleted or have another issue) and server errors.</li>
<li>Pages that have been redirected or excluded by a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/meta-tags#:~:text=index/-,noindex,-%E2%80%93%20This%20tells%20the">noindex tag</a> (more on this shortly).</li>
<li>Pages have been crawled, but are not indexed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pages that have been crawled and not indexed or “discovered but not crawled” are often the result of Google not deeming your site sufficiently authoritative and/or not deeming those pages valuable and unique (more on addressing these issues later as well).</p>
<h4>Check for technical issues</h4>
<p>If you’ve found that your site isn’t getting indexed, there are a few particularly common issues that could lead to pages on a site not being indexed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meta noindex tags</strong><strong>: </strong>Often times when a developer is building a staging version of your site they’ll add <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/block-indexing">meta noindex tags</a> to the entire site, to keep Google from crawling and indexing the site before it’s pushed live. It’s also not uncommon for the dev team to fail to remove those tags. If you see a large volume or spike of pages not indexed for this reason in Search Console, this is something to investigate.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You can look at the source code of a page and search for the noindex tag.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You can also use a tool like Screaming Frog to crawl your site and identify pages that are noindexed.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Robots directives: </strong>Your site’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/intro#:~:text=A%20robots.txt%20file%20tells,web%20page%20out%20of%20Google." target="_blank" rel="noopener">robots.txt file</a> could also be blocking search engines from crawling (and ultimately indexing) your site. You can check the file itself (yoursite dot com/robots.txt) or look for more information in Google Search Console:</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-robots.webp" alt="google search console robots directives" width="1240" height="434" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91775" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-robots.webp 1240w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-robots-980x343.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-robots-480x168.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1240px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Canonical tags:</strong> A third issue you could be encountering is that a site’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canonical tags</a> may be pointing to a different site entirely. Again, you can check these by looking at the source code on a page, or crawling the site with a tool like Screaming Frog:</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/canonicals-set-up.webp" alt="canonicals set up in screaming frog" width="546" height="194" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91776" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/canonicals-set-up.webp 546w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/canonicals-set-up-480x171.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 546px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of crawlable content: </strong>If your content is hidden behind a login, JavaScript, or an element Google isn’t able to interact with, you may not be giving that content a chance to rank in search results. Again, Screaming Frog or other technical <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-seo-tools">SEO tools</a> can help diagnose these issues:</li>
</ul>

<div id="no-or-few-backlinks"></div>
<h3>3. You have no (or few) backlinks</h3>
<p>If you’ve confirmed that you’re reporting traffic correctly and that there aren’t specific technical issues preventing your site from being indexed and showing in search results, another issue may be a lack of links to your site.</p>
<p>If you’re hoping to get any kind of significant search traffic to your site, you’re going to need to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/05/24/link-building-now">build links</a> over time. As your site first launches, you may not be showing in any search results because your site has zero or very few links. This can be particularly likely if your brand name is something generic that existing companies already have as a name (e.g., Apex), as you may not rank for even your own brand name.</p>
<p>A quick way to address this is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-citations">build local citations for your business</a>, and then start to work on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/link-building-strategy">different link-building tactics</a> if you’re hoping to grow your site’s organic traffic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/local-citations-example-unrefined-bakery.webp" alt="examples of local citations in google search for unrefined bakery" width="900" height="663" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91870" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/local-citations-example-unrefined-bakery.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/local-citations-example-unrefined-bakery-480x354.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Some examples of local citations for this bakery that can act as backlinks.</em></p>
<div id="not-targeting-the-right-keywords"></div>
<h3>4. You’re not targeting the right keywords</h3>
<p>If your site already has a baseline of some links, and you’re still not seeing any traffic from SEO, keyword targeting could be the issue.</p>
<p>Again, if you don’t have a unique brand name, your pages may be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Targeting search terms that don’t have sufficient search volume.</li>
<li>Targeting search terms that are too competitive for the site to rank for.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re using GA4 and not seeing any <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/03/organic-traffic">organic traffic</a>, you can use Google Search Console to see not just clicks but also impressions:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ahrefs-sample-report.webp" alt="google search console report for keyword targeting" width="1031" height="358" class="aligncenter wp-image-91871 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ahrefs-sample-report.webp 1031w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ahrefs-sample-report-980x340.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ahrefs-sample-report-480x167.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1031px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And of course, you can use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">third-party keyword research tools</a> to identify keywords that have search volume as well.</p>
<p>As you identify relevant keywords, you want to build content that provides value while looking for internal and external linking opportunities to those pages to help drive organic traffic to them.</p>
<div id="site-has-been-penalized"></div>
<h3>5. Your site has been penalized</h3>
<p>If you do have links pointed to your site as well as relevant content that targets low competition keywords with search volume, there’s a chance your site has been penalized and will be unable to rank.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what to do about it.</p>
<h4>Check for manual penalties</h4>
<p>The most clearly identifiable penalty is a <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-penalties-manual-actions-notifications-guide-388509" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manual penalty</a>, which is the result of a manual review of your site where a Google Quality Rater flagged your site as spam. You can identify these in Google Search Console:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-manual-actions.webp" alt="google search console manual actions" width="702" height="390" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91872" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-manual-actions.webp 702w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-search-console-manual-actions-480x267.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 702px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you do have a manual action, there will typically be some information about the nature of the penalty, example URLs of the offense, and you’ll have an opportunity to submit a request for re-inclusion.</p>
<p>Manual penalties can often be difficult to remove and require significant time and effort, but there is at least a feedback system and some indication directly from Google as to why your site has been penalized.</p>
<h4>Look into recent algorithm updates</h4>
<p>If your site is adversely impacted by an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2024-google-algorithm-updates">algorithm update</a>, on the other hand, you won’t be given any information by Google and will have to try to self-diagnose the issue with your site.</p>
<p>If your site had been receiving traffic and then it dropped off, you can start by trying to correlate the drop with Google’s algorithm updates, which they list <a href="https://status.search.google.com/products/rGHU1u87FJnkP6W2GwMi/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>The most common causes of traffic drops to zero when it comes to being penalized are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-quality links, particularly at scale.</li>
<li>Low-quality content, again, particularly if you were generating it and having it indexed at scale.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you were using a vendor or someone inside your organization was doing SEO for you and you weren’t exactly sure what tactics they were using, investigating the links they were building and the content they were creating on your behalf is a good place to start.</p>
<h4>Look at your domain history</h4>
<p>If you investigate the activities you’ve taken on your site and there’s no manual action, you may have a historical issue with your domain. If you purchased this domain and there are existing links pointed at it, those may be causing you an issue. Third-party tools like Semrush and Ahrefs allow you to see the links pointed to your domain&#8211;looking at these to determine if this may be the cause of an issue is again a good place to start.</p>
<h2>Monitoring and addressing SEO issues moving forward</h2>
<p>Getting zero SEO traffic can be frustrating, but as we&#8217;ve seen, there are often clear, identifiable reasons for this problem. The key is to work through a systematic diagnosis process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Verify your reporting tools are correctly set up and not filtering out organic traffic.</li>
<li>Confirm your pages are being indexed by Google.</li>
<li>Address any technical barriers like noindex tags, robots directives, or canonical issues.</li>
<li>Build a foundation of quality links if your site lacks authority.</li>
<li>Ensure you&#8217;re targeting realistic keywords with actual search volume.</li>
<li>Investigate potential penalties or domain history problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s also important to keep in mind that even after fixing these foundational issues, it may take time for Google to recrawl your site and for rankings to improve.</p>
<p>Set up regular monitoring through Search Console and GA4 to catch any new issues early and consider implementing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/28/technical-seo">technical SEO audits</a> to ensure your site remains healthy from an SEO perspective.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re stuck troubleshooting a particularly challenging SEO issue, you may want to consider <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/marketing-services?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Demo_Blog_Demo">consulting with a professional</a> who can do additional troubleshooting and provide more targeted guidance based on your specific situation.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot of people in the search engine marketing space are talking about Google’s AI Overviews.</p>
<p>If you’re a B2B site targeting informational terms, they may have impacted your organic traffic significantly.</p>
<p>If you’re a business that thrives on local searches or an ecommerce company, they may not be entering into your search results in a meaningful way (yet).</p>
<p>If you’re a busy marketer or business owner, you’re likely wondering, “Should I be optimizing my site and pages for placement in AI Overviews? And if so, how do I do it?”</p>
<p>The short answer–like most things in SEO–is “it depends.”</p>
<p>The good news for many sites is that a lot of the things you can do to influence inclusion in AI Overviews (AIO) are the exact same “best practices” you’d be focused on to have your site rank higher in Google search results (and Google’s featured snippets) already.</p>

<div id="when-do-ai-overviews-matter"></div>
<h2>Do AI Overviews matter for your business?</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://lp.botify.com/q4.2024-aio-report">study</a> showed these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-overviews-impact-on-seo">AIO impacts</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>47% of organic searches now have AI Overviews.</li>
<li>AI Overviews take up 42% of the screen on desktop, 48% on mobile.</li>
<li>75% of AI Overviews also rank in the top 12 in search results.</li>
<li>AIOs showed up on ~60% of informational and ~20% of commercial queries studied.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the takeaways there?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-overviews-statistics">AI Overviews</a> (and now <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-ai-mode/">AI Mode</a>) are impacting <strong>a lot</strong> of searches. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-overviews">They were rolled out in May of 2024</a>, and less than a year later, are showing up across almost half of the searches on Google’s flagship, money-printing core product.</p>
<p>There is a lot of overlap between what works for ranking in traditional <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/03/organic-traffic">Google organic results</a> and ranking in AI Overviews. A strong majority of AI Overviews are pulled from/feature sites that are also ranking for the stand Google search term.</p>
<p>Some search terms are impacted more than others. This is a key factor if you’re thinking about how much to focus on Google’s AI Overviews. (If you’re looking for more data on which search terms are most impacted, here is <a href="https://www.authoritas.com/blog/ai-overview-user-intent-research">a recent study</a>.)</p>
<p>There was a lot of talk about the <a href="https://searchengineland.com/ex-hubspotters-reveal-5-seo-insights-about-hubspots-traffic-woes-451195">HubSpot blog losing organic traffic</a>. The HubSpot folks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBHoJMOkL6Y">talked about it on a recent podcast</a>, and while there are multiple factors, one that they called out was the introduction of AI Overviews (as well as other AI tools like ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Claude) and <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/2024-zero-click-search-study-for-every-1000-us-google-searches-only-374-clicks-go-to-the-open-web-in-the-eu-its-360/">zero-click searches</a> on some of the terms they’d been ranking for.</p>
<p>Here is a look at the number of keywords HubSpot is ranking 1-3 for with AI Overviews present, according to Ahrefs:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hubspot-ranking-with-ai-overviews-present-png.avif" alt="number of keywords HubSpot is ranking 1-3 for with AI Overviews present, according to Ahrefs" width="1121" height="345" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90985" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hubspot-ranking-with-ai-overviews-present-png.avif 1121w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hubspot-ranking-with-ai-overviews-present-300x92.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hubspot-ranking-with-ai-overviews-present-1024x315.avif 1024w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hubspot-ranking-with-ai-overviews-present-768x236.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hubspot-ranking-with-ai-overviews-present-1080x332.avif 1080w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hubspot-ranking-with-ai-overviews-present-980x302.avif 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hubspot-ranking-with-ai-overviews-present-480x148.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1121px) 100vw, 1121px" /></p>
<p>Lots of caveats here: These numbers may be impacted by which keywords are tracked, and this is a relatively new data set. But the main takeaway is that tens of thousands of keywords where HubSpot was ranking 1-3 now have a huge AI Overview layered above any content.</p>
<p>Again, many of the terms the site appears to have lost traffic and rankings on were very broad informational terms, but there are also terms like the one below, where they dropped from 1 to 3, and there’s also an AI Overview present. Look at what a searcher sees on this query:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-mission-statement-png.avif" alt="ai overview for mission statement search" width="1128" height="620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90986" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-mission-statement-png.avif 1128w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-mission-statement-300x165.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-mission-statement-1024x563.avif 1024w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-mission-statement-768x422.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-mission-statement-1080x594.avif 1080w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-mission-statement-980x539.avif 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-mission-statement-480x264.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1128px) 100vw, 1128px" /></p>
<p>Based on the Ahrefs classifications of search terms, these AI Overviews are showing on 3,187 keywords combined with the intent type commercial, navigational, and transactional, and 14,341 informational terms (some terms fall into multiple buckets there).</p>
<p>On the other hand, here are the keywords for a local roofing client of mine with hundreds of top 3 rankings. Of keywords with a local intent, here are those with AI Overviews:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/roofing-company-ai-overviews-png.avif" alt="roofing company keywords with local intent also displaying ai overviews" width="1125" height="323" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90987" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/roofing-company-ai-overviews-png.avif 1125w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/roofing-company-ai-overviews-300x86.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/roofing-company-ai-overviews-1024x294.avif 1024w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/roofing-company-ai-overviews-768x221.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/roofing-company-ai-overviews-1080x310.avif 1080w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/roofing-company-ai-overviews-980x281.avif 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/roofing-company-ai-overviews-480x138.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1125px) 100vw, 1125px" /></p>
<p><strong>One “local” keyword</strong> was impacted, and it was “how much does a roof cost in {state}?”</p>
<p>If we look at the phrase matched version of the top 1,000 keywords for “roofing company in X” terms:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/roofing-company-keywords-png.avif" alt="roofing company keywords with ai overview" width="1115" height="517" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90988" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/roofing-company-keywords-png.avif 1115w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/roofing-company-keywords-300x139.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/roofing-company-keywords-1024x475.avif 1024w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/roofing-company-keywords-768x356.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/roofing-company-keywords-1080x501.avif 1080w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/roofing-company-keywords-980x454.avif 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/roofing-company-keywords-480x223.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1115px) 100vw, 1115px" /></p>
<p>There is <strong>one</strong> search result showing an AI Overview, and the query was “how to start a roofing company in texas” (not a term a local roofing company would be targeting to drive roofing leads, obviously).</p>
<p>Now if we do the same analysis for “what is” keywords, there are <strong>312 AI Overviews out of the top 1,000 queries</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/what-is-keywords-with-ai-overviews-png.avif" alt="what is keywords with ai overviews" width="1131" height="557" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90989" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/what-is-keywords-with-ai-overviews-png.avif 1131w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/what-is-keywords-with-ai-overviews-300x148.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/what-is-keywords-with-ai-overviews-1024x504.avif 1024w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/what-is-keywords-with-ai-overviews-768x378.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/what-is-keywords-with-ai-overviews-1080x532.avif 1080w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/what-is-keywords-with-ai-overviews-980x483.avif 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/what-is-keywords-with-ai-overviews-480x236.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1131px) 100vw, 1131px" /></p>
<p>So to recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your site is targeting a lot of informational queries (keywords like what is X, how to do Y, etc.) AI Overviews are likely playing a huge role in search results.</li>
<li>If your site is targeting a lot of localized queries (like best {service} in {city}), you may not need to think about AIOs at all (right now).</li>
<li>If you’re not sure, it’s best to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-seo-tools">use third-party tools</a> to see how many of your current keywords show AIOs, and to spot-check your top-performing terms to see what the search results look like.</li>

<div id="when-to-optimize-for-ai-overviews"></div>
<h2>Should you focus on optimizing for AI Overviews at all?</h2>
<p>For most sites on the internet, I’d say <strong>not right now</strong>.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Many sites don’t currently have many AI Overviews in their search results. For many more, they would be better served focusing on all of the current SEO best practices than diving into deep research around AI Overviews. That said, I’ll share how to prepare if AI Overviews aren’t yet impacting you, and what to do if they are.</p>
<h3>What to do if AI Overviews aren’t yet impacting your site</h3>
<p>Here are things you can do that impact SEO that also impact AI Overviews:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build links at the domain and page level for key pages and your site as a whole.</li>
<li>Create clear, concise answers to the core question your page addresses (just like when you were targeting featured snippets previously).</li>
<li>Create clickable title tags.</li>
<li>Deliver on the promise of your title tag, getting searchers to quick answers and creating a great user experience that keeps visitors from bouncing back to search results for different answers.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">Build your brand</a> so that your site is mentioned frequently across lists, review sites, etc., so that you’re featured prominently amongst businesses in your category.</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Building your brand and getting listed on top directories can help you get found organically on search engines.</em></p>
<p>These are all things that will impact AI Overviews and rankings in other AI products like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/21/chatgpt-impact-on-marketing">ChatGPT</a>, DeepSeek, and Claude and will help you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google">rank higher in traditional organic results</a> whether there’s an AI Overview or not (and again: most of the time higher ranking sites see a higher likelihood of showing up in AI Overviews).</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/first-page-of-google?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_10WaysFirstPageGoogle_Download">10 Tangible &amp; Free Ways to Get on the First Page of Google</a></p>
<h3>What to do if AI Overviews are impacting your site</h3>
<p>If your site is losing traffic to AI Overviews (i.e., your organic rankings are the same, but you’re not featured as prominently in the AIO or those searches are turning into “zero-click” events and people are leaving where they used to be clicking), there are a few considerations:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/zero-click-searches">Optimize for AIO</a>. We&#8217;ll dive deeper into how to do this in the next section!</li>
<li>Find other targets. If you’re losing traffic for informational searches where more AI Overviews are showing, you may need to double down on optimizing for more transactional searches. For example, if you’re losing traffic for “how much does pest control cost in {city}?” you may need to invest in different terms where those AI Overviews aren’t present, like “pest control companies in {city}.” In some cases, these terms that are more transactional or commercial and less informational will have less top-line traffic, but they may bring more conversions.</li>
<li>Consider other channels. If you have a limited sphere of search terms that will drive relevant traffic, you may need to recalibrate your expectations for SEO as a channel. Investing in another channel, particularly if it’s something like video or PR that can also impact SEO, may have better results for you than some of your content creation and link-building efforts had previously.</li>
</ol>
<div id="rank-in-ai-overviews"></div>
<h2>How you can impact AI Overview rankings</h2>
<p>So let’s assume you do have AIOs in the search results for your target keywords. What can you do about it?</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/ai-overviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a>:</p>
<p><em>Google&#8217;s systems automatically determine which links appear. There is nothing special for creators to do to be considered other than to <strong>follow our regular guidance for appearing in search, as covered in Google Search Essentials</strong>.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://richsanger.com/google-ai-overview-study-link-selection-based-on-related-queries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rich Sanger</a> did another study of AI Overviews (with somewhat different findings from those highlighted above) but found two interesting takeaways:</p>
<p><em>“SERP Position and AI Overview Visibility: The likelihood of a search result document appearing in an AI Overview depends on its SERP position. A link ranked first has a 53% chance of being featured, while content ranked tenth has a 36.9% chance. This trend holds for related and reformulated queries as well, with higher-ranking documents more likely to be included.</em></p>
<p><em>Trends in Unaccounted Links: Further analysis of the unaccounted links revealed a significant presence of YouTube and Wikipedia, highlighting specific domains that AI Overviews favor.”</em></p>
<p>In other words, a lot of the work of getting featured in AI Overviews is to <strong>do the things you already knew you should be doing to rank in Google search results</strong>: Target relevant terms, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/27/backlink-audit">build links to your domain</a> and individual pages, write clickable title tags, and create a great user experience on your site so that your engagement metrics are strong.</p>
<p>Another key aspect of AIOs to note is that they change based on the user’s history and location, as well as engagement with an AIO by users generally.</p>
<p>Here is the above-the-fold experience for me for the same search in Chrome in one Google profile:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-how-to-rank-in-overviews-png.avif" alt="ai overview for how to rank in ai overviews on google chrome" width="1127" height="613" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90990" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-how-to-rank-in-overviews-png.avif 1127w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-how-to-rank-in-overviews-300x163.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-how-to-rank-in-overviews-1024x557.avif 1024w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-how-to-rank-in-overviews-768x418.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-how-to-rank-in-overviews-1080x587.avif 1080w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-how-to-rank-in-overviews-980x533.avif 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-how-to-rank-in-overviews-480x261.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1127px) 100vw, 1127px" /></p>
<p>In Internet Explorer (no AI Overview at all, just a featured snippet):</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-how-to-rank-in-overviews-internet-explorer-png.avif" alt="ai overview for how to rank in ai overviews on internet explorer" width="1120" height="601" class="aligncenter wp-image-90991 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-how-to-rank-in-overviews-internet-explorer-png.avif 1120w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-how-to-rank-in-overviews-internet-explorer-300x161.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-how-to-rank-in-overviews-internet-explorer-1024x549.avif 1024w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-how-to-rank-in-overviews-internet-explorer-768x412.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-how-to-rank-in-overviews-internet-explorer-1080x580.avif 1080w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-how-to-rank-in-overviews-internet-explorer-980x526.avif 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-how-to-rank-in-overviews-internet-explorer-480x258.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1120px) 100vw, 1120px" /></p>
<p>And in Chrome on an iPhone:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-how-to-rank-in-overviews-iphone-png.avif" alt="ai overview for how to rank in ai overviews on mobile (iPhone)" width="755" height="1200" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90993" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-how-to-rank-in-overviews-iphone-png.avif 755w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-how-to-rank-in-overviews-iphone-189x300.avif 189w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-how-to-rank-in-overviews-iphone-644x1024.avif 644w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-how-to-rank-in-overviews-iphone-480x763.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 755px) 100vw, 755px" /></p>
<p>These searches were performed within a few seconds of each other at the same location, and while the mobile and desktop results are very similar, the wording is slightly different, a few of the sources varied from desktop to mobile, and it’s likely this result will change over time (and from searcher to searcher).</p>
<p>So, like with all search engine rankings, you need to take into account that results will be personalized and dependent on user interaction with the AIO itself.</p>
<p>Beyond existing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO best practices</a>, there are some areas you can focus on, particularly when it comes to AIO placement:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://richsanger.com/ai-overview-optimization-insights-from-googles-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Verification and embedding distance</a>. If you’re targeting something like a definition for a term (e.g., what is X), having your definition of the term match the AIO with slightly different but highly similar “close” language helps increase the likelihood of being sourced in the AIO links.</li>
<li>Updating content and timestamps. Freshness is among the factors relevant patents from Google considers when it comes to AIOs.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-knowledge-panel">Knowledge graph inclusion</a>. This is one of the sources the LLM powering Google’s AIO results pulls from (along with its index).</li>
<li>Related topics. AIOs will change over time based on how an individual user or users generally refine their query, so having related topics is important.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, a lot of these <strong>are things you’re likely doing already</strong> as part of your typical SEO process.</p>
<h2>Stay ahead of the AI Overview curve</h2>
<p>Whether you need to make adjustments to try to rank in AI Overviews now or are taking the wait-and-see approach, every site that is investing in and generating revenue from search traffic should continue to keep an eye on:</p>
<ol>
<li>How many AI Overviews are showing up in their search results. While AI Overviews aren’t being used in localized search results now, that doesn’t mean they won’t be over time.</li>
<li>Changes in best practices around AIOs. If it becomes evident that they’re being impacted more by a specific factor, it may make sense to invest more heavily in optimizing for that specific element.</li>
</ol>
<p>And, as always, keep up with the latest SEO news and updates so you can make tweaks and changes as needed. If you need help, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/marketing-services?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Demo_Blog_Demo">reach out for a demo</a> to see what we can do for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot gets written about topic clusters when it comes to SEO-focused content in ecommerce or B2B, but much less so when it comes to local SEO.</p>
<p>Do locally focused businesses even need to think about topic clusters? What types of clusters could you build for a roofing company or plumbing company?</p>
<p>While internal linking and site structure is different for local SEO, it’s still critically important.</p>
<p>In this article, I’ll walk through the key types of topic clusters you should be thinking about for local SEO and how to implement and interlink them.</p>

<h2>What are topic clusters?</h2>
<p>Topic clusters are related pages that are interlinked, typically for SEO benefit.</p>
<p>More specifically, topic clusters have a “hub and spoke” set up with a hub or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/11/pillar-pages">pillar page</a> and spoke or cluster pages. Here is a visual representation of the basic concept:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topic-clusters-png.webp" alt="topic clusters how they work" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89790" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topic-clusters-png.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topic-clusters-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Typically, as part of your topic clusters strategy, you’ll want:</p>
<ol>
<li>The hub/pillar page to link to all of the spoke/cluster pages.</li>
<li>The spoke/cluster pages to all link back up to the pillar page.</li>
<li>The spoke/cluster pages to link to and have links from at least two spoke/cluster pages.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that you know what topic clusters are, let’s talk about how they can benefit your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/12/local-seo">local SEO strategy</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/first-page-of-google?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_10WaysFirstPageGoogle_Download">10 Tangible &amp; Free Ways to Get on the First Page of Google</a></p>

<h2>Why create topic clusters? What are the benefits?</h2>
<p>Creating topic clusters for local SEO has a few core benefits.</p>
<h3>Increases your chances for ranking in search results</h3>
<p>When you build a topic cluster around a core topic and page you increase the likelihood that the core page will rank. For instance, if you created a series of pages about Orlando roofing costs, Orlando roofing materials, related services, and surrounding towns and had all of those pages link back to your Orlando roofing page, that page will perform better for terms like “Orlando roofing” because you’re indicating to Google that your site is a comprehensive resource on the subject, and those pages can all convey to Google that the Orlando roofing page is about that topic (more on this later).</p>
<h3>Attracts more potential local customers</h3>
<p>Additionally, you can attract more potential customers by creating specific content related to a core topic that you wouldn’t have otherwise. Often those searchers are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/30/commercial-intent-keywords">higher intent</a> as well because their search terms are more specific, and the terms are within a cluster of terms that are relevant to your business.</p>
<h3>Improves the user experience</h3>
<p>Finally, creating content clusters and interlinking them strategically improves the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/03/29/ux-conversion-rates">user experience for your site’s visitors</a> as you are able to answer more of their related questions (by covering the topic more thoroughly) and giving them the option to dive deeper on a core topic by offering links to related content.</p>
<p>When implemented correctly, all of this leads to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more traffic</a>, leads, and revenue from local SEO.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Search ads can also help you attract more local searchers.</strong> Want to learn more about search engine marketing on Google?

<h2>Types of topic clusters for local SEO (+examples)</h2>
<p>The concept of topic clusters is relatively simple, but if you’re a locally focused business, what types of pages should you be “clustering” and how should you fit those pages into clusters? Let’s walk through some examples of topic clusters in local SEO.</p>
<h3>Service and area topic clusters</h3>
<p>If you’re providing any type of local service—from roofers to chiropractors—you’ll want to build out <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/multi-location-seo/#:~:text=1.-,Create%20a%20web%20page%20for%20each%20location,-(with%20a%20unique" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local service pages</a> targeting your service areas with town page + service. If you offer one service to a tight geography, this may be pretty straightforward with a structure like:</p>
<p>Service Areas</p>
<ul>
<li>Windemere roofing</li>
<li>Winter Garden roofing</li>
<li>College Park roofing</li>
<li>Lake Nona roofing</li>
<li>Oviedo roofing</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topic-clusters-service-service-area-png.webp" alt="topic cluster example for local roofing company service and service areas" width="1026" height="601" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89791" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topic-clusters-service-service-area-png.webp 1026w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topic-clusters-service-service-area-980x574.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topic-clusters-service-service-area-480x281.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1026px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you have a larger service area, you can cluster pages by geography, with batches of 10 or so towns.</p>
<p>What if you have a situation like the image above where there are several services across multiple service areas?</p>
<p>First, you need to determine how many pages you actually need. Unfortunately, to do this, you need to do some leg work and look at the actual search results in your area. Let’s look at a few of the services offered in this region by the company above. First, roofing company:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/orlando-roofing-serp-png.webp" alt="search results for orlando roofing company on google" width="913" height="1812" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89792" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/orlando-roofing-serp-png.webp 913w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/orlando-roofing-serp-480x953.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 913px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And here is the SERP for Orlando leak detection:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/orlando-roof-leak-detection-serp-png.webp" alt="search results for orlando leak detection on google" width="787" height="1976" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89793" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/orlando-roof-leak-detection-serp-png.webp 787w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/orlando-roof-leak-detection-serp-480x1205.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 787px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>All of these results are service pages or entire sites specifically dedicated to leak detection, so if we want to rank, we’ll need to create a new services page (and not just a sub-section on our roofing page).</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you look at “roof repair Orlando” the results aren’t exactly the same as “Orlando roofing company,” but there are a number of the same sites, and virtually every page is a general roofing page (not specific to repairs):</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/roof-repair-orlando-serp-png.webp" alt="search results for orlando roof repair on google" width="728" height="1976" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89794" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/roof-repair-orlando-serp-png.webp 728w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/roof-repair-orlando-serp-480x1303.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 728px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>So that term can likely be addressed on the roofing page.</p>
<p>For sites that have a mix of multiple services and multiple service areas, the structure might look something like this:</p>
<p>Service Areas</p>
<ul>
<li>Windemere roofing
<ul>
<li>Windemere roof leak detection</li>
<li>Windemere commercial roofing</li>
<li>Windemere tile roof repair</li>
<li>Windemere solar panels</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Winter Garden roofing
<ul>
<li>Winter Garden roof leak detection</li>
<li>Winter Garden commercial roofing</li>
<li>Winter Garden tile roof repair</li>
<li>Winter Garden solar panels</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>College Park roofing
<ul>
<li>College Park roof leak detection</li>
<li>College Park commercial roofing</li>
<li>College Park tile roof repair</li>
<li>College Park solar panels</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lake Nona roofing
<ul>
<li>Lake Nona roof leak detection</li>
<li>Lake Nona commercial roofing</li>
<li>Lake Nona tile roof repair</li>
<li>Lake Nona solar panels</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Oviedo roofing
<ul>
<li>Oviedo roof leak detection</li>
<li>Oviedo commercial roofing</li>
<li>Oviedo tile roof repair</li>
<li>Oviedo solar panels</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So the Windemere roofing page would link down to its “spoke” pages, those pages would link back up and across to each other, and the Windemere page would have at least two links to and from the other location roofing “spoke” pages.</p>
<h4>What to keep in mind when creating this type of topic cluster</h4>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that your most important services and most important service areas are covered (look at the SERPs to determine if you need a new page).</li>
<li>Structure content in hub-and-spoke format with the main service pages linking to location-specific pages.</li>
<li>Ensure each location page links back to the main service page and at least two other location pages.</li>
<li>Group locations geographically when dealing with large service areas.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f50e.png" alt="🔎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Need help finding the right keywords for your topic clusters?</strong> Try our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">Free Keyword Tool</a>!</p>
<h3>Cost and cost calculator topic clusters</h3>
<p>Many services will have search volume around town/city + service + cost as well:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/local-keyword-research-results-roofing-cost-png.webp" alt="wordstream free keyword tool results for roofing costs" width="1176" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89795" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/local-keyword-research-results-roofing-cost-png.webp 1176w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/local-keyword-research-results-roofing-cost-980x498.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/local-keyword-research-results-roofing-cost-480x244.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1176px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>These are national results from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">the Free Keyword Tool</a> but many of these modifiers will show up for localized searches.</p>
<p>Cost pages—particularly if you can invest in building simple cost calculators and in-depth data for specific areas—can also get passive links from other sources as well.</p>
<p>These can be linked to and from both within service + service area pages, and a broader “{service} costs” or “state {service} costs” page that acts as a hub page and links down to the service area pages.</p>
<h4>Tips for creating this type of topic cluster:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create area-specific <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/08/landing-page-examples">cost pages</a> for services with significant search volume.</li>
<li>Develop interactive calculators to provide value and attract links.</li>
<li>Link cost pages to relevant service area pages.</li>
<li>Consider building a state-level cost hub page if you’re building out a cluster of these pages.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Measurement and materials topic clusters</h3>
<p>This is a cluster that depends on the service you’re offering, but there are a lot of locally focused services where measurements and material estimates play a role. A potential customer may want to estimate things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The size of a roof, room, exterior of their house, etc. to help them understand the price of a service.</li>
<li>The amount of materials (shingles, exterior lights, floor panels, etc.) they’ll need for their specific job.</li>
</ul>
<p>Providing tools and frameworks for customers to conduct these estimations can help build credibility and authority around a topic. Plus, if you build something like a free tool for your visitors, you can get links from other sites to help with your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google">ranking</a> as well.</p>
<h3>Frequency and maintenance topic clusters</h3>
<p>If you have a recurring service, there are likely a lot of questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How often do I need to replace my windows?</li>
<li>How often should a cleaner come?</li>
<li>How often do you need to {perform specific maintenance activity}?</li>
</ul>
<p>As with measurement terms, you want to get in front of these customers as they’re researching whether they need something replaced or how often they need a recurring service:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/local-keyword-research-results-roofing-png.webp" alt="wordstream free keyword tool results for roof replacement query" width="1200" height="606" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89796" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/local-keyword-research-results-roofing-png.webp 1200w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/local-keyword-research-results-roofing-980x495.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/local-keyword-research-results-roofing-480x242.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>An underrated fact here is that these queries are often <strong>personalized based on location</strong>. You may think a search query like this will reach everyone across the country—and if you rank well for the term it may—but Google will also <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">personalize these results</a> based on search history and location. Here is the search result for this phrase according to keyword tools:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/roof-replacement-query-results-png.webp" alt="roof replacement query results in ahrefs" width="561" height="627" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89797" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/roof-replacement-query-results-png.webp 561w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/roof-replacement-query-results-480x536.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 561px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is the result I see in Massachusetts:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/local-informational-content-roofing-example-png.webp" alt="informational query for roofing result on google" width="908" height="604" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89798" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/local-informational-content-roofing-example-png.webp 908w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/local-informational-content-roofing-example-480x319.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 908px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The Nova Home Improvement site doesn’t show up at all in the generalized search results, but for a local searcher, it’s getting a featured snippet! Again this is a great opportunity to get in front of your potential customers.</p>
<p>The fundamental structure of these kinds of clusters would be the same&#8211;you don’t need to build a separate page for each service area you have, just a cluster of related terms around replacement, maintenance, and frequency terms with the same hub and spoke approach.</p>
<h4>Tips for creating these topic clusters</h4>
<ul>
<li>Focus on location-specific maintenance schedules and requirements.</li>
<li>Include tools for measuring materials and estimating project scope.</li>
<li>Create content addressing “frequency of {service}” questions.</li>
<li>Link maintenance content to relevant service pages.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Informational and blog topic clusters</h3>
<p>Not every local site needs a lot of informational content. If you’re servicing an area that’s low competition, and/or you offer a service that’s lower competition, you may want to focus on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-seo-in-2024">local SEO best practices</a> like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-citations">building local citations</a>, links, and service area pages rather than informational content.</p>
<p>But the screenshot in the section above gives you an indication of how informational content helps you reach prospects. You can then <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/17/retargeting-campaign-tips">remarket</a> to those folks, have them see your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/03/organic-traffic">organic result</a>s or ads, and get more business down the line from these activities. More informational content also has a couple of additional advantages for local businesses:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/topical-authority"><strong>Topical authority</strong></a>: Building out “how to” content (e.g., if you’re a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/cleaning-services-advertising-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cleaning business</a>, a series of posts about how to clean various surfaces, rooms in the house, etc.) helps indicate to Google that your site is an authority on a topic. If you can localize this content, that’s even better as it indicates to Google that you’re an authority on both the topic and the area you service.</li>
<li><strong>Passive links</strong>: If you start to rank for informational terms, you often get people doing research through Google who will then link to your resource. Those links are extremely valuable for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/12/domain-authority">improving the authority of your sit</a>e and having it rank better for queries in Google.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, these could be on a variety of topics, using the same hub and spoke model with the same linking recommendations outlined above. Some examples of informational content that could work for your locally focused site include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How to:</strong> How to perform specific maintenance tasks, DIY certain aspects of your service, etc. For a window replacement company, this may be tips for winterizing your windows or maintaining them (again particularly if those tips are specific to your service region).</li>
<li><strong>Best tools/products</strong>: For a salon, this may be hair care products, for someone offering golf lessons the best equipment for a variety of different golf-related tasks, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Pain points/FAQs</strong>: Answering specific questions or <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-pain-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pain points</a> your customers may have is another great way to build informational topical clusters. If you’re a dentist, you can create a series of posts answering questions related to teeth whitening that people may be searching for.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Tips for creating these types of topic clusters</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create how-to content specific to your service area.</li>
<li>Develop best tools and product recommendations.</li>
<li>Address common customer pain points and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/24/faq-page">FAQs</a>.</li>
<li>Focus on locally relevant topics that build authority.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Competitor comparison topic clusters</h3>
<p>A lot of businesses don’t want to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/competitive-insights">talk about competitors</a>, but it’s often the case that your prospects already know about your competitors, and being willing to mention them can be a way to get in front of more potential customers who are close to paying for your service.</p>
<p>Just as with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/12/paid-search-conquesting">Google Ads “conquesting” campaigns</a> that target competitor names, you can potentially rank for some search terms related to your competitors by being willing to mention them and highlight where you’re different.</p>
<p>First, you can create a list of the businesses in your area. Again: this is a bit scary and something a lot of businesses want to stay away from, but it can be a great way to rank for terms that you couldn’t otherwise. When a searcher looks for “roofing companies in Nashville” they want a list, not just the site of a specific company.</p>
<p>This organic result is mostly third-party sites like Yelp or the BBB, but the third organic result here is an individual roofing company that was willing to list competitors:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/roofing-companies-nashville-serp-png.webp" alt="roofing companies in nashville search results on google" width="890" height="602" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89799" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/roofing-companies-nashville-serp-png.webp 890w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/roofing-companies-nashville-serp-480x325.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 890px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>From there, you could go a step further and actually link to a page with your competitor’s name, and do a comparison of what your strengths are versus the competitor. Obviously, you have to be careful not to say anything false or libelous about the competitor, but you can often rank well with these pages for search terms like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Competitor name + competitors</li>
<li>Competitor name + alternatives</li>
<li>Competitor name + reviews</li>
<li>Competitor name + costs</li>
<li>Competitor name + pricing</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a fairly common practice in other industries but not well used with locally focused businesses.</p>
<p>In terms of structure, you would use the &#8220;best of&#8221; list as the hub, and the competitor pages would each function as a spoke.</p>
<h4>Tips for creating these topic clusters</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create comprehensive <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/01/business-directory-listings">local business listings</a>.</li>
<li>Develop alternative/comparison pages for major competitors.</li>
<li>Address competitor-specific searches like reviews and pricing.</li>
<li>Maintain professional, factual comparisons.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f575-fe0f-200d-2640-fe0f.png" alt="🕵️‍♀️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Want to know what your competitors are up to?</strong> Get the guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/how-to-spy-on-competitors?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SpyOnCompetitors_Download">How to Spy on Your Competitors: 7 Ways to Become a Competitive Supersleuth</a></p>

<h2>How to think about topic clusters for local SEO</h2>
<p>Ultimately the most important “topic cluster” for local SEO is making sure that you have coverage around service pages to target your core services and service areas.</p>
<p>If you have additional resources and/or are in a competitive market, a lot of these additional content types and topic clusters can both help you drive incremental traffic and leads and can help solidify your rankings on your core services and service areas.</p>
<p>Here are the key takeaways to help you get better <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-statistics">SEO results</a> using topic clusters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement a hub-and-spoke model with a clear <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/04/internal-linking">internal linking structure</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/competitive-analysis">Assess competition levels</a> before investing in informational content.</li>
<li>Ensure all content serves your target geography and audience.</li>
<li>Focus on topics directly relevant to your services and local market.</li>

<h2>7 ways SEO changed in 2024 (and not always for the better!)</h2>
<p>Here are the top seven ways SEO changed in 2024.</p>
<div id="ai-overviews-shook-up-serps"></div>
<h3>1. AI Overviews shook up Google SERPs</h3>
<p>If you’ve run informational searches on Google recently, you’ve likely seen something like this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ai-overview-example.webp" alt="example of ai overviews on google" width="870" height="469" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87687" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ai-overview-example.webp 870w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ai-overview-example-480x259.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 870px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>These are AI Overviews, AI-generated responses to queries created by Google. Three things are currently true about AI Overviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>In some niches for some sites, they’ve already had a massive impact.</li>
<li>In some niches and for some sites, they’ve had precisely zero impact.</li>
<li>Their impact is expanding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at the history of AI Overviews:</p>
<ol>
<li>Google tested AI Overviews (then called <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/19/google-search-generative-experience">Search Generative Experience or SGE</a>) from 2023 to 2024.</li>
<li>On May 14, 2024, Google officially rolled out these overviews, calling them <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-overviews">AI Overviews</a>.</li>
<li>Many of these results were pretty bad, even <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-ai-overview-fails-442575" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dangerous</a>, and Google got a lot of blowback in the press for the quality of AI overviews.</li>
<li>Third parties have <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-ai-overviews-visibility-new-low-444048" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> that the number of search queries impacted by AI overviews was between 7-15% in the summer of 2024.</li>
<li>Those numbers continue to <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-ai-overviews-volatility-continues-rise-fall-repeat-445177" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fluctuate</a>, and Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/ai-overviews-search-october-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded the reach of AI Overviews to over 100 countries at the end of October 2024</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Percentages like 7-15% don’t sound like a lot, but for a certain set of queries that might mean more like 80% of searches. Or your site might get 60-70% of its traffic from 25-50 pages, and those pages might be disproportionally impacted.</p>
<p>If you’re a cybersecurity software company, you may be seeing results like this one (only with ads overlaid over the AI Overview) in all of the search results where you rank in organic results:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cybersecurity-ai-overview-example.webp" alt="ai overview example from cybersecurity query" width="856" height="429" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87688" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cybersecurity-ai-overview-example.webp 856w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cybersecurity-ai-overview-example-480x241.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 856px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you’re a local business trying to rank for plumbing in Sioux Falls, you likely don’t have an AI Overview within miles of your SERPs:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/plumbing-query-example.webp" alt="plumbing query example" width="738" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87689" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/plumbing-query-example.webp 738w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/plumbing-query-example-480x390.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 738px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The results here are still <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/11/google-local-service-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Local Services Ads</a>, Google Maps, and standard organic search. Through all of the shake ups the SERP displays, the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-seo-in-2024">best practices for local SEO stay relatively consistent</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How does this impact sites? </strong>For sites that have AI Overviews in a lot of their search results, there are a variety of impacts, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less traffic: Your page could be pushed down in search results, which would lead to less traffic.</li>
<li>More traffic: Getting featured in AI Overviews may <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drive more traffic to your site</a>.</li>
<li>Inaccurate tracking results: Rank tracking tools are showing a page that is featured in AI Overviews (even if it’s well below the “load more” button and many searchers may not be seeing it) as ranking “#1.”</li>
</ul>

<div id="ai-generated-content-creation"></div>
<h3>2. AI-generated content was created en masse</h3>
<p>The ability to push a button and—for very low costs—generate content of reasonable quality is another thing that’s had a major impact on SEO in 2024.</p>
<p>Originality AI <a href="https://originality.ai/ai-content-in-google-search-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimates</a> that the percentage of AI content ranking in the top 20 Google results has more than doubled in 2024.</p>
<p>Entire industries have been built around the growth of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/25/ai-content-generators">generative AI content</a>, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://searchengineland.com/ai-chatgpt-content-detectors-395957" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI content detectors</a></li>
<li>AI writing tools</li>
<li>AI content editing services</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course, many more are likely to pop up over time.</p>
<div id="google-responded-to-ai-generated-content"></div>
<h3>3. Google responded to AI-generated content</h3>
<p>During the pandemic, people flocked to online sources to do comparison shopping. Many affiliates had quietly been ranking for all kinds of “best X” and “best X for Y” searches. With all of the new search volume around these terms, additional attention (in the form of media and users noticing) was paid to this fact.</p>
<p>Subsequent updates meant that these smaller affiliates were replaced with large, authoritative sites (more on this shortly).</p>
<p>This is a common trend in Google search results over the years. It’s happened with <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/jason-calacanis-revenge-google-matt-cutts-18794.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">larger publishers cranking out thin content</a>, with <a href="https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2014/03/19/google-penalizes-myblogguest-a-guest-blog-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guest blog marketplaces</a>, with <a href="https://retrododo.com/google-is-killing-retro-dodo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">niche sites</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/seo-heist-aftermath-how-burn-your-organic-traffic-nick-malekos-yjqgf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s already happened with AI</a>. The basic cycle goes something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>{Thing} starts to work for ranking in Google.</li>
<li>Attention starts to swirl around the fact that {thing} is working, there is an article in the tech press somewhere.</li>
<li>Google takes some kind of action (sometimes manual, sometimes algorithmic).</li>
<li>{Thing} may still work to some extent or with some specific adjustments, but it doesn’t work as easily or for the same people (particularly those who had been highlighted in the press).</li>
</ol>

<h3>4. Search results shifted to focus on forum and tools content</h3>
<p>As Google responded to AI content, one of the biggest shifts in 2024 (a continuation of Google updates over the last couple of years) has been how aggressively “UGC” or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/28/user-generated-content">user-generated content</a> from forums and Q&amp;A sites has been.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/03/organic-traffic">organic traffic</a> to Reddit:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/organic-traffic-to-reddit.webp" alt="organic traffic to reddit" width="829" height="355" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87690" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/organic-traffic-to-reddit.webp 829w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/organic-traffic-to-reddit-480x206.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 829px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here’s organic traffic to a niche forum focused on stargazing (many niches will have a forum or two with the same graph):</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/niche-forum-stargazing-example.webp" alt="traffic to niche forum on stargazing" width="827" height="352" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87691" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/niche-forum-stargazing-example.webp 827w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/niche-forum-stargazing-example-480x204.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 827px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And here’s the traffic graph for Omnicalculator, a large site with calculators around topics like calculating a dog’s weight, calculating steps to calories, etc.:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/omnicalculator-traffic.webp" alt="traffic to omnicalculator" width="829" height="351" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87692" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/omnicalculator-traffic.webp 829w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/omnicalculator-traffic-480x203.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 829px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Looking at where Omnicalculator has gained traffic in the last year is particularly instructive here. Some of the terms are calculator terms where they displaced other calculators or traditional articles, but here are some terms in the top 10 traffic gainers for them:</p>
<ul>
<li>calorie deficit</li>
<li>slope</li>
<li>diameter of a circle</li>
<li>how to find the p value</li>
</ul>
<div id="search-results-shifted-to-favor-forum-tools-content"></div>
<h3>5. Affiliates and niche sites were hit hard by updates</h3>
<p>Google’s Helpful Content Update impacted a lot of “niche sites” or small independent publishing sites focused on a specific area (frequently focused around and dependent upon Google for traffic, which was then monetized via ads or affiliate marketing).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/august-2024-google-core-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some sites have seen recoveries</a>, some have seen partial recoveries, and many have abandoned any effort to recover or rank in Google at all.</p>
<p>Helpful content updates have been the subject of a ton of speculation, misinformation, and agitation for those impacted. Speculation about the focus of these updates includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://moz.com/blog/helpful-content-update-not-what-you-think" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focus on brand strength</a>.</li>
<li>The wrong combination of not having a strong domain and <a href="https://x.com/GrindstoneSEO/status/1851858039432974381" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having the wrong anchor text mix</a>.</li>
<li>“Over-optimization” or an overly aggressive (particularly for smaller sites with fewer/lower quality link domains pointed to their site) <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/outdated-seo-tactics">SEO tactics</a> (title tags, headers, content, and links all using targeted keywords aggressively).</li>
</ul>
<div id="parasite-seo-gained-traction"></div>
<h3>6. Parasite SEO gained traction</h3>
<p>Every Google action leads to an equal and sometimes opposite reaction from SEOs.</p>
<p>An interesting picture is starting to form here:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI content is getting better and is widely and cheaply available.</li>
<li>Google has aggressively favored UGC or forum content and content hosted on big brand sites like Forbes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enter: Parasite SEO and “Site Reputation Abuse.”</p>
<p>While <a href="https://x.com/Charles_SEO/status/1848335859608957257" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parasite SEO didn’t start in 2024</a>, it has become a more talked about and more heavily utilized tactic.</p>
<p>This manifests in a few ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reddit spam:</strong> Many people have found ways to game <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-smart-bidding">Reddit</a> so that their recommendations float to the top of Reddit posts and threads that are ranking in high-traffic search results.</li>
<li><strong>Contributed articles:</strong> Marketers would pay to have an article placed on an authoritative site with their own affiliate links in the article. Often these marketers will also use low-quality (and cheap) link sources to get the articles to rank (this can work on authoritative sites, even if it frequently may not on smaller sites, and of course there’s little risk for the poster because the site getting risky and spammy links pointed to it is not their site).</li>
<li><strong>Brands doing affiliate marketing:</strong> Large brands like <a href="https://larslofgren.com/forbes-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cnet-published-ai-generated-stories-then-its-staff-pushed-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNET</a> cranked out AI-generated articles and/or product roundup posts and generated affiliate income from that content.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, of course, as this practice got more and more press and attention, Google responded with a “site reputation abuse” policy and <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2024/11/site-reputation-abuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a> this year.</p>
<p>Outlook India, which had become a popular parasite SEO host, has seen surges and drops in the way of all of this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/outlook-india-parasite-seo.webp" alt="traffic to outlook india parasite seo site" width="830" height="353" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87693" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/outlook-india-parasite-seo.webp 830w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/outlook-india-parasite-seo-480x204.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 830px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And <a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/cnn-forbes-lose-millions-google-seo-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes and CNN</a> saw hits as well:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/forbes-cnn-traffic.webp" alt="traffic loss for forbes and cnn" width="829" height="358" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87694" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/forbes-cnn-traffic.webp 829w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/forbes-cnn-traffic-480x207.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 829px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>More and more stories <a href="https://recleudo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">along these lines</a> continue to surface, and as they get pushed into the press and Google responds, what works and doesn’t will likely continue to change.</p>
<div id="google-recognized-as-monopoly"></div>
<h3>7. Google was recognized as a monopoly (and it had consequences!)</h3>
<p>Google is no stranger to accusations of being a search monopoly, and it seems like <a href="https://searchengineland.com/googles-quality-rating-guide-leaked-version-five-196619" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their search quality rater guidelines get leaked every year</a>, but there were some developments that were specific to 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google had a <a href="https://searchengineland.com/unpacking-googles-massive-search-documentation-leak-442716" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search documentation leak</a>.</li>
<li>An endpoint exploit <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-algorithm-documents-leak">exposed more information about the algorithm</a>.</li>
<li>This summer Google was officially <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24155520/judge-rules-on-us-doj-v-google-antitrust-search-suit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruled a search monopoly in court</a>, and next year the Department of Justice may force Google to take any number of actions, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24300617/doj-google-search-antitrust-chrome-breakup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spinning off and selling Chrome</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While this may not have had a visible impact on many sites trying to rank in search results in 2024, there could be any number of implications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes to the algorithm as Google has less behavioral data.</li>
<li>Changes to Google’s behavior in general as they’re under the watchful eye of the US government and have officially been labeled a monopoly.</li>
<li>Impacts on things like search result layouts, search syndication, etc, as yet unforeseen consequences of the ruling that force Google in other directions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Google also had a creator summit&#8211;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq77Xjbx_mQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recapped</a> by various <a href="https://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/tech/google-creators-event.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attendees</a>&#8211;where they <a href="https://mike-hardaker.com/f/i-drank-the-kool-aid-at-the-2024-google-web-creator-summit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted</a> that in some HCU traffic drops, content was not the issue.</p>

<h2>The future of SEO: Tips and takeaways for small businesses in 2025</h2>
<p>Even if you’re a small, locally-focused business, any and all of these changes, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-trends-2025">trends</a>, and events in 2024 <em>could </em>impact you at <em>some </em>point.</p>
<p>But what can you actually do about any of them right now?</p>
<h3>Tips for 2025 SEO success</h3>
<p>There are a few things that you (or the person in charge of your SEO) can do right away to address these trends:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on user-generated content and placement on large sites:</strong> If forums are showing up in relevant search results and contributed posts on larger sites are showing up prominently in search results, you’d be doing yourself a disservice if you didn’t explore how you can get your customers to comment on prominently featured forum threads or how you can get a contributed post on a publication well-positioned to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google">rank for your targeted terms</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Invest in tools and calculators:</strong> Even a local home services company can build cost calculators or tools to help plan out a home renovation, and these types of utilities are exactly what Google’s currently ranking for lots of relevant search terms.</li>
<li><strong>Have a strategy around AI content:</strong> Google <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/02/google-search-and-ai-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has said</a> they don’t explicitly penalize AI content, but AI content without any editing or guardrails can certainly get sites into trouble. You can drive highly qualified search traffic that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-generation-ideas">increases leads</a> and sales without using AI content at all, and you can incorporate carefully edited AI content into your strategy as well. Make sure you know which one your company or your agency are executing, and that you understand the risks and rewards around each.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Looking for more ways to drive people to your site?</strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website</a></p>
<h3>Key takeaways to inform your 2025 SEO strategy</h3>
<p>Additionally, there are a few things you can keep in mind as 2025 progresses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monitor placements in AI Overviews and AI search results:</strong> Currently, showing up in AI search results is unlikely to have a significant impact on local business search traffic. And again: You may not have a single AI Overview in your “dentists in Dover” search results currently. That said, it’s important to start to understand <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-overviews-breaking-search">how AI Overviews work</a>, and what you’ll want to do to rank for them as they do get introduced.</li>
<li><strong>Keep up with Google’s PR offensive and upcoming court appearance:</strong> Keeping an eye on what happens in search results, what happens with Google in the press, and anticipating the likely implications is all part of a responsible search strategy. Whoever is overseeing your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/05/seo-strategy">SEO strategy</a> should be aware of these kinds of updates, and how they’re (actually) impacting your business&#8217;s search results (again sometimes the answer to this question will be “not at all”).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Get prepared for better SEO in 2025</h2>
<p>Ultimately the main thing to keep in mind as you enter 2025 is to try to understand how your search results (both the rankings and the search features included in them) have changed, are changing, and may change in the future so that you can continue to generate as many leads, sales, and profits as you can from SEO in 2025.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are a small business targeting local customers, local SEO can still generate a great and sustainable ROI (and has become simpler and more predictable than other forms of SEO).</p>
<p>That said, an aspect of local SEO that is often misunderstood is local citations. This is because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many people don’t know whether citations impact map listings, organic listings, or both.</li>
<li>Most people aren’t sure how many citations they need to build, or how frequently they need to build them.</li>
<li>Citations are often confused with updating information across data providers and “NAP” consistency.</li>
<li>Citations are sometimes confused with links and link building.</li>
</ul>
<p>And perhaps most importantly: Many small business owners aren’t sure whether they should contract out work on citation building or do it themselves (and if they should do it themselves, how to do it).</p>
<p>In this article, I’ll answer all of these questions and walk through how to build citations yourself.</p>
<p>If you’re not interested in the nitty gritty and just want an answer to “how should I handle citations for my small business” you can <a href="#local-citations-recap">skip ahead to the last section</a> where I’ll answer that for you based on budget and how competitive your industry and area are.</p>

<h2>What are local citations?</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/local-online-marketing#:~:text=Get-,citations,-in%20directories">local citation</a> is an online mention of a business. In the context of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-seo-in-2024">local SEO</a>, this typically refers to a structured listing on an external website that includes the business name, address, and phone number (NAP).</p>
<p>These are usually <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/home-services-business-listings-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business listings</a> at any of a variety of sites, most frequently directory-style websites. They come in different flavors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>General local business information across all types of businesses (e.g., Yellow Pages, Yelp)</li>
<li>Industry-specific (e.g., a directory of home remodeling companies across the US)</li>
<li>Location-specific (e.g., a directory of small businesses in Mississippi)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, let’s say we own a home remodeling business in Oxford, Mississippi. We can get our business listed on general sites like the Yellow Pages:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/home-remodeling-citation-on-yellowpages.webp" alt="home remodeling citation on yellow pages" width="911" height="439" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87432" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/home-remodeling-citation-on-yellowpages.webp 911w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/home-remodeling-citation-on-yellowpages-480x231.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 911px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Chamber of commerce, government or travel directories, or other town/city, county, or state directories:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/chamber-of-commerce-local-citation-example.webp" alt="chamber of commerce local citation result example" width="846" height="394" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87433" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/chamber-of-commerce-local-citation-example.webp 846w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/chamber-of-commerce-local-citation-example-480x224.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 846px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Or we could find directories focused on construction or resources for homeowners:</p>

<h2>Are local citations links? Is citation building the same as link building?</h2>
<p>Many local citations that you build will include links to your website, but some will not.</p>
<p>The focus in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/12/local-citations">building citations</a> is not solely to get links, it’s to have your business listed in key directories where legitimate small businesses frequently appear, and in local and industry directories to help signal to Google that your business is noteworthy and trustworthy when it comes to your business focus and location.</p>
<p>That said, building citations will typically lead to an increase in the number of links to your website, as many sites will allow you to include a link.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Looking for more ways to drive people to your site?</strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website</a></p>
<div id="citations-vs-nap-consistency"></div>
<h2>Is building citations the same as NAP consistency?</h2>
<p>NAP consistency refers to the consistency with which your business listings across the web and with major data providers is the same.</p>
<p>If your business has changed names, addresses, phone numbers, websites, etc. you may have inconsistent data in different listings on the web. This can hurt <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-marketing-2024">local rankings</a> as it’s a signal to Google that your business may not be reliable and trustworthy.</p>
<p>Building citations generally refers to the practice of <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/best-free-business-listing-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creating new local citations</a> for your business which is not the same as updating your existing citations for consistency, but many vendors will simultaneously work on “cleaning up” any NAP inconsistencies (claiming your business profiles places where you may not have known they exist, updating them in instances where you, a vendor, or someone within your company may have created them before a change in business name, phone number, or physical address, etc.), and building out new citations.</p>
<div id="benefits-of-local-citations"></div>
<h2>How valuable are citations?</h2>
<p>I recently came across two different tweets from folks who share a lot of good local SEO information on X (formerly Twitter) with different perspectives on citations.</p>
<p>This case study:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/XC0qFMfrIU">https://t.co/XC0qFMfrIU</a></p>
<p>— Joy Hawkins (@JoyanneHawkins) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoyanneHawkins/status/1836039665578545205?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>And then this tweet and reply:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">constant citation building is so underrated for maps rankings imo</p>
<p>— Cole | Dental + Local SEO (@AllGasSeo) <a href="https://twitter.com/AllGasSeo/status/1849217209945780520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In the first example, the case study did find that citations boosted <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/03/organic-traffic">organic rankings</a> for a landing page, even though Maps rankings weren’t impacted. The responding tweet notes something that I’ve observed myself: Citations do have a direct impact on rankings in some cases.</p>
<p>So like with many SEO questions, the answer here is likely “it depends.”</p>
<p>A few things are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many practitioners have seen <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-maps-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maps rankings</a> improve when building local citations, so they do likely have a positive impact here.</li>
<li>The listings showing up for branded searches and listings that are indexed, as Joy points out in the case study cited above, are likely to have the largest impact.</li>
<li>If you are in a low-competition vertical with limited resources, you’re likely best served sticking to those citations.</li>
<li>If you are in a more competitive market, you’re likely best served to at least test building regular citations over time to determine their impact on both your maps and organic rankings.</li>
</ul>
<div id="how-many-local-citations-to-build"></div>
<h2>How many local citations does my business need?</h2>
<p>In terms of “how many” local citations your business needs, here are some guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every business should have citations on the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/best-free-business-listing-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10-20 most important sites</a>.</li>
<li>A standard starting point is to build ~50 citations, particularly in a competitive market.</li>
<li>If you’re in a very competitive market and want to test regular citation building, 10-25 is a standard range.</li>
</ul>
<div id="”how-to-build-local-citations&quot;"></div>
<h2>How can I build local SEO citations myself?</h2>
<p>Building local citations is a time-consuming process, but a relatively simple one.</p>
<p>First, you want to start by making sure you have the right information to bring to the citation-building process, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your company name</strong>: This seems simple enough, but you want this to be consistent with your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/09/edit-update-google-business-listing">Google Business Profile</a>, and with your official company name or DBA name. If my company name is “Tom’s Construction” but I want to rank well for bathroom remodeling jobs in search results, just calling myself “Tom’s Construction &amp; Bathroom Remodeling” can get me into trouble with Name, Address, Phone (NAP) consistency.</li>
<li><strong>Address:</strong> This is the physical address where a customer could theoretically show up to conduct business (not a virtual address or PO Box).</li>
<li><strong>Phone number</strong>: Whether you have a standard business number, or a standard <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/call-tracking">call tracking number</a> from a call tracking company, use that number everywhere. When you switch to a call tracking solution you need to update your citations, and if you’re using one currently you want to use that as you build new citations (for both consistency and tracking).</li>
<li><strong>Description: </strong>Have a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-write-a-business-description/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brief and compelling company description</a> ready to submit to third parties.</li>
<li><strong>URL:</strong> Use your website’s home page as you submit local citations.</li>
<li><strong>Categories:</strong> Have your categories ready (if you’ve optimized your GBP, you likely know these).</li>
<li><strong>Email:</strong> You usually want to set up an email dedicated to citations that someone will occasionally monitor, as you can sometimes get spam and cold outreach at these addresses.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/local-citations-google-business-profile.jpg" alt="an example of a google business profile for a coffee shop" width="378" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71136" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/local-citations-google-business-profile.jpg 378w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/local-citations-google-business-profile-189x300.jpg 189w" sizes="(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px" /></p>
<p>It’s a good idea to keep a spreadsheet handy and add fields that you run across as you’re building citations to your sheet, as they’ll often come up again. For instance, if a site asks you for an alternate phone number, plug what you submit there into your spreadsheet (or, in some cases, if the field is optional, you may want to just leave those blank).</p>
<p>You also want to be able to access the email you’re going to use and to be able to access the phone number you’re giving for verification across these citations.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4cd.png" alt="📍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Are your listings up to date?</strong> Find out with a free, instant audit using the <a href="https://localiq.com/free-business-listings-grader/?cid=Web_WS_InContentTextLink_Freemium_Listings&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium">LocaliQ Business Listings Grader</a>.</p>
<div id="how-to-find-local-citation-opportunities"></div>
<h2>How to find citation opportunities</h2>
<p>Looking for ways to build citations? Follow these steps.</p>
<h3>Get on the top citation sites</h3>
<p>The simplest way to start here is to make sure you have the “major players” and most common citation sources covered first. Start with these:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://business.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Business Profile</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mapsconnect.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Maps</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a></li>
<li><a href="https://foursquare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foursquare</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bingplaces.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bing Places</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yelp</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.yellowpages.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yellow Pages</a></li>
</ol>
<p>From there, you can also get to 50+ local citations easily by leveraging lists like this<a href="https://whitespark.ca/top-local-citation-sources-by-country/united-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> top 50 citations by WhiteSpark</a>, this one by <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/resources/top-citation-sites/general/top-50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrightLocal</a>, etc. (I’ll get more into how to evaluate different citations in a minute).</p>
<h3>Submit your business information to data aggregators</h3>
<p>While it’s not a direct citation, by having your data submitted to the major data aggregators you can then have those sites submit your data to multiple additional directories in turn. Here are the largest data aggregators:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://local-listings.data-axle.com/search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Axle</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.neustarlocaleze.biz/directory/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neustar Localeze</a></li>
<li><a href="http://business.foursquare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foursquare</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.localvisibilitysystem.com/2013/09/24/how-to-add-your-business-to-factual/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Factual</a></li>
</ol>
<p>If you submitted to these 11 places, you’d be off to a good start, and in some niches in some areas, you may even be <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/how-to-spy-on-competitors">ahead of some of your competitors</a>. In even a moderately competitive industry/geography combination, though, all of your competitors will have these citations. How can you get more, impactful citations?</p>
<h3>Look at competitor citations</h3>
<p>The quality and impact a citation has will vary depending on your industry and geography. There are some ways to gauge likely impact here.</p>
<p>Start by looking at competitors. Think more about your SERP (search engine result page) competitors than your “real life” competitors. The company you think of as your closest competitor may not be the company you’re competing with for real estate in search engine results. When I search for Oxford, MS, home remodeling, I can see the first competitors I want to investigate in the Map pack:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/competitor-citations-in-google-map-pack.webp" alt="competitor business results in google map pack" width="857" height="440" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87435" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/competitor-citations-in-google-map-pack.webp 857w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/competitor-citations-in-google-map-pack-480x246.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 857px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>I type in the full name of the company with the geo-modifier to make sure I get the right results and look at the listings showing the highest for the company name:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/branded-search-for-local-citations.webp" alt="competitor branded search results for local citations" width="869" height="479" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87437" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/branded-search-for-local-citations.webp 869w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/branded-search-for-local-citations-480x265.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 869px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here is a second company:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/competitor-branded-search-citation-results.webp" alt="competitor branded search citation results" width="732" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87436" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/competitor-branded-search-citation-results.webp 732w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/competitor-branded-search-citation-results-480x392.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 732px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As you go through multiple competitors, you’ll quickly get insights like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook popping up first for many queries.</li>
<li>Houzz as a good possible source here.</li>
<li>BBB and Chamber of Commerce listings as options.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use this as an exercise both to help prioritize citations if you have limited time and resources and to find new citation opportunities.</p>
<p>Once you have a sense of which competitor seems to be getting a lot of these types of citations (which you can usually tell just by looking at the search results above) you can then unearth more citation opportunities by going to Google.com and typing in “competitorwebsite.com:”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/competitor-citation-results.webp" alt="competitor citation results in google serp" width="661" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87438" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/competitor-citation-results.webp 661w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/competitor-citation-results-480x434.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 661px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As you scroll through these results, you can really start to find some gems that may not show up just by searching for the competitor name:</p>
<p>This is a useful tactic as well because it allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>See which citations Google views as most relevant to your competitor’s site.</li>
<li>Filter out other companies with a similar name in different areas.</li>
<li>Find a list of citations that your competitor has <strong>that are all indexed by Google.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Use SEO tools</h3>
<p>You can also use paid tools like Ahrefs or Semrush to look at the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/10/link-building-secrets">backlinks</a> a competitor has to see which sites are linking to them, and paid local <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-seo-tools">SEO tools</a> like BrightLocal and WhiteSpark offer tools to find citations generally, and to look at competitor citations as well.</p>
<div id="how-to-monitor-local-citations"></div>
<h2>How to make sure your citations are indexed</h2>
<p>If Google doesn’t acknowledge your citations, there’s not really any value in having them. Checking to see if your specific citation is indexed is a good way to determine if the citation has been “counted” by Google.</p>
<p>To manually do this for one citation is pretty simple. Just go to Google and type in site:directory.com/toms-construction-listing. If you see your listing, that means it’s indexed:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/manual-citation-check-google.webp" alt="how to manually check citation indexed on google" width="878" height="532" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87440" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/manual-citation-check-google.webp 878w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/manual-citation-check-google-480x291.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 878px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If not, then your listing (or a competitor’s listing) likely isn’t indexed:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/citation-not-indexed-example.webp" alt="example of citation not indexed on google" width="720" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87439" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/citation-not-indexed-example.webp 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/citation-not-indexed-example-480x399.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you want to check your citations in bulk it’s a little trickier, but you can use some paid tools and services like URL Profiler or IndexCheckr.com.</p>
<p>If you find your URLs aren’t getting indexed, there are a few methods you can use to get them indexed:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can share a link to the profile on social media.</li>
<li>You can use services like IndexMeNow or similar.</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of things to be aware of with indexing services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Often these services use things like social media profiles or low-quality link sources to force indexation of pages. For third-party profiles, that’s not usually an issue, but it’s not a great idea to fire this type of activity at your main website.</li>
<li>They will occasionally fail to get your page indexed (usually they’ll refund in these instances), and it’s not uncommon that they get a page indexed, and then it later falls out of the index (which is why it’s a good idea to replicate citations that are already indexed, as it’s a signal that Google is likely to index and leave indexed your own citations)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re in a particularly competitive industry and geography and you want to go beyond the core citations and your direct competitors’ best citations, there are a few ways to expand your citation reach:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look at the towns you service outside of your physical location and research those competitors for citations unique to those towns.</li>
<li>You can also use the loc: site search operator in Google to find different types of directory or industry opportunities you may not have uncovered:</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/directory-search-on-google.webp" alt="how to do a directory search on google" width="743" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87441" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/directory-search-on-google.webp 743w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/directory-search-on-google-480x386.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 743px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As with many tasks in your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/local-advertising-ideas/">local business</a>, however, you need to ask yourself the question: Should I be building these local citations myself in the first place?</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f914.png" alt="🤔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>What are the biggest challenges small businesses are facing?</strong> Find out that and more in our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/smb-marketing-trends-report?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2025SmallBusinessMarketingTrendsReport_Download">Small Business Marketing Trends Report</a>.</p>
<div id="local-citations-recap"></div>
<h2>Bottom line this for me: What should I do in regards to local citations?</h2>
<p>Here are your basic choices for building citations if you’re a small business owner:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can hire a contractor specifically for citation building.</li>
<li>You can ask your SEO company to execute this task (likely if you have an SEO vendor, they’re doing this for you already in some capacity).</li>
<li>You can do the work yourself on the cheap or with the use of a paid tool or multiple paid tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>Things to consider here will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Industry and location competition</strong>: If your competitors in Google Maps all have a couple of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-online-reviews-impact-your-business">reviews</a>, many don’t seem to be building citations, and generally you know your industry/area isn’t competitive when it comes to SEO you may not need to be consistently building citations. Just the key citations and some you find key competitors have may be enough.</li>
<li><strong>Resources:</strong> If you or an employee have both time and the ability to execute relatively simple data entry tasks <strong>and</strong> you’re cash-constrained, this may be a good task to hand off to someone in the company. If you don’t want to worry about handing this process off or completing it yourself and you can spare a few hundred dollars to have citations built and updated, and then potentially a monthly fee to build more citations over time in a competitive market, it may be worth it to outsource this task.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the fact that citation building can have a significant impact on local SEO results, tends to be time-intensive to execute on your own, and is a relatively low-cost service compared to other marketing activities, it’s often the right choice to outsource. If you do hire an agency or contractor for this task, make sure:</p>
<ul>
<li>You understand the types and volume of citations you’re getting (ask about their process, and whether monitoring indexation and attempting to get citations indexed is included).</li>
<li>They use an email you have access to and give you login information for any profiles they create on your behalf in a shared spreadsheet.</li>
<li>They share the actual citations they’ve built with you in a shared document (which you can then check for indexation yourself!).</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google launched a significant core update on August 15, 2024. Since that time it’s been bumpy waters in the Google search results, as you can see from the search engine volatility tracker from Semrush:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/serp-volatility-post-august-2024-core-update.webp" alt="serp volatility after the august 2024 google core update" width="869" height="479" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86096" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/serp-volatility-post-august-2024-core-update.webp 869w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/serp-volatility-post-august-2024-core-update-480x265.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 869px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.semrush.com/sensor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>So what happened with this core update, what do you need to know, and what can you do to ensure your site doesn&#8217;t fall off the search results? We’ll explore all that and more.</p>

<h2>August 2024 core update: What happened?</h2>
<p>Google typically introduces updates to its core search algorithm a couple of times a year. The August core update was “designed to continue our work to improve the quality of our search results by showing more content that people find genuinely useful and less content that feels like it was made just to perform well on Search,” <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2024/08/august-2024-core-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google wrote in a statement</a>.</p>
<p>Google also stated that the August core update incorporated feedback from creators. We can assume this was mostly in response to the <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-march-2024-core-update-rollout-is-now-complete-438713" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March 2024 core update</a> which caused performance issues for many websites and a lot of unrest in the industry.</p>
<p>Since the update started rolling out on August 15, there have been reports from third-party data providers that <a href="https://searchengineland.com/data-providers-google-august-2024-core-update-was-very-volatile-446597" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this update was particularly volatile</a>. Google <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-august-2024-core-update-rollout-is-now-complete-446225" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the update was complete rolling out on September 3, but there have been rumblings of reversals in the weeks since the update was complete:</p>

<div id="august-core-update-impacts"></div>
<h2>What we’re seeing since the August core update</h2>
<p>Anecdotally, for publishing/affiliate types of sites, we’ve seen some graphs that look like this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/august-core-update-recovery.webp" alt="chart showing some recovery after the google august 2024 core update" width="853" height="416" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86098" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/august-core-update-recovery.webp 853w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/august-core-update-recovery-480x234.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 853px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This specific site saw a significant recovery, but not a complete recovery–this is the last 16 months, and if you pulled the graph back further traffic would have been even higher. Importantly, nothing was changed on the site to drive these changes, from the initial level, the drop beginning in October of 2023, and the recent recovery–this is all just the result of Google reordering search results.</p>
<p>This site <strong>did not recover</strong> on commercial/affiliate types of terms. In other words, rankings for informational queries such as “how big will my labradoodle get” have rebounded, but not rankings for terms with higher commercial intent like &#8220;best X for Y,&#8221; e.g. “best dog food for a labradoodle.”</p>
<p>Those more commercial search results are now <a href="https://larslofgren.com/forbes-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dominated by authoritative sites like Forbes</a>.</p>
<p>For certain types of business sites (B2B, SaaS, and ecommerce) we’ve seen multiple instances with graphs along these lines:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/august-core-updates-loss.webp" alt="chart showing some loss and fluctuation after the google august 2024 core update" width="830" height="348" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86099" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/august-core-updates-loss.webp 830w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/august-core-updates-loss-480x201.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 830px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For this site, the primary SEO activities were:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Pruning” or removing under-performing content (particularly content that was both highly <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-content-beginners-guide">optimized for SEO</a> and either wasn’t generating traffic and/or wasn’t getting strong engagement).</li>
<li>Updating <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/04/internal-linking">internal linking</a> to avoid overly aggressive anchor text.</li>
<li>Removing off-topic content that wasn’t tightly aligned with the core focus areas of the site.</li>
</ul>
<p>These activities <em>may </em>have led to the recovery, but we’ve also seen instances like the example above where no action was taken, and we’re not the only ones:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some may say this is a small recovery&#8230;</p>
<p>I say, it&#8217;s a glimmer of hope for SEO.</p>
<p>Let me be clear:</p>
<p>→ If this website SUCKED, it wouldn&#8217;t recover.<br />
→ We changed nothing during this time.</p>
<p>If your site ISN&#8217;T recovering, you have to ask yourself:</p>

<div id="what-google-says-about-august-core-update"></div>
<h2>What does Google say about the August core update?</h2>
<p>Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2024/08/august-2024-core-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">own post</a> about the August core update is typically vague, but with at least a nod to some of the recoveries for independent sites (which we’ll cover in a bit):</p>
<p><em>“This latest update<strong> takes into account the feedback we&#8217;ve heard from some creators and others over the past few months</strong>. As always, we aim to connect people with a range of high quality sites,<strong> including small or independent sites that are creating useful, original content, when relevant to users&#8217; searches</strong>. This is an area we&#8217;ll continue to address in future updates. This update also aims to <strong>better capture improvements that sites may have made</strong>, so we can continue to show the best of the web.”</em></p>
<p>The implication here seems to be something along the lines of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mix of dials that caused smaller/independent sites to get smashed in the Helpful Content Update and some subsequent updates were tuned to allow some of those sites to recover.</li>
<li>The time frame for those sites being reconsidered and “allowed” to rebound was shortened.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re a small business owner/operator, however, you likely don’t have time to read the tea leaves on Google update summaries. So what are the practical takeaways here?</p>
<div id="what-august-core-update-means-for-your-business"></div>
<h2>What does the core update mean for your small business?</h2>
<p>It depends.</p>
<p>If you have a local services business and are targeting a mix of map listings and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/organic-search">local organic rankings</a>: <strong>you may not have felt the core update at all</strong>.</p>
<p>Google’s core updates don’t impact local map rankings, so if that’s your primary source of traffic and leads from Google search, you may be experiencing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-seo-in-2024">local SEO in 2024 as an oasis of low volatility</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the query “home remodeling near me.” I searched for this from Wilmington, Massachusetts, on my desktop so that’s the results I get.</p>
<p>Here is the search result:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/home-remodeling-search-2024.webp" alt="search results for home remodeling query in sept 2024" width="652" height="1296" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86100" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/home-remodeling-search-2024.webp 652w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/home-remodeling-search-2024-480x954.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 652px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In this search result, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local Service Ads (ads, obviously).</li>
<li>Google Ads (ads again).</li>
<li>Maps results (local business listings, but not impacted by the August core update).</li>
<li>PAAs and search suggestions (which effectively keep you on Google’s search result page longer, or send you to a different Google search results page).</li>
<li>Organic listings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only the stuff in orange in this screenshot is <strong>even eligible to be impacted by the August core update</strong>. There are 17 entities on this page (between ad listings, PAA questions, search suggestions, map results, and organic listings) and <strong>only two are organic listings</strong>!</p>
<p>Now, it’s important to note that not every search result looks like this. If I look specifically for “home remodeling Wilmington MA” I see a very different SERP experience:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/home-remodeling-wilmington-search-results-2024.webp" alt="search results for home remodeling query in sept 2024 in wilmington, ma" width="478" height="1296" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86101" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/home-remodeling-wilmington-search-results-2024.webp 478w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/home-remodeling-wilmington-search-results-2024-111x300.webp 111w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/home-remodeling-wilmington-search-results-2024-378x1024.webp 378w" sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px" /></p>
<p>While it’s top-loaded with ads and map listings, this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/serp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SERP</a> has about 50/50 organic listings versus everything else.</p>
<p>Even so: if you were All Matters General Contracting or NE Home Services, your lead flow from this search result wouldn’t be impacted by the August core update at all.</p>
<p>If you are generating clicks and leads from the organic listings, there may be a bit more shakeup. Here’s an example of rankings shifts from July versus the current for home remodeling Boston:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/home-remodeling-boston-serp-changes.webp" alt="serp changes for home remodeling boston query" width="828" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86102" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/home-remodeling-boston-serp-changes.webp 828w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/home-remodeling-boston-serp-changes-480x347.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 828px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Both Angi and Yelp saw slight jumps in rankings, and there’s some general movement here. If we spot-check organic listings from other areas we see similar results with a fair amount of movement:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/home-remodeling-serp-changes.webp" alt="serp changes for home remodeling dallas query" width="866" height="595" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86103" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/home-remodeling-serp-changes.webp 866w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/home-remodeling-serp-changes-480x330.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 866px, 100vw" /></p>

<div id="how-to-respond-to-august-core-update"></div>
<h2>How to respond</h2>
<p>First off, you want to see if you were impacted by the update at all. Google actually <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/updates/core-updates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has some pretty good advice for this</a>:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/check-traffic-drop-in-search-console.webp" alt="google suggestion to check traffic in search console for august core update" width="857" height="440" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86104" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/check-traffic-drop-in-search-console.webp 857w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/check-traffic-drop-in-search-console-480x246.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 857px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you do see a drop in traffic after the core update, a couple of things to consider would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have a large number of pages built for search that either don’t get much traffic, and/or have very bad engagement (people leave quickly after visiting the page)?</li>
<li>Are you using very aggressive <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/anchor-text">anchor text</a> in links you get from other sites, and/or within your own site? In other words when another site links to your site do they use text like “Demers Construction” (not aggressive anchor text) or do they always use “exact match” anchor text for the keyword you’re targeting like “home remodeling wilmington ma?”</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re not sure how many pages your site has or what content is being created for you (by your own team or by an SEO you hired, for instance) you can look in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/16/how-to-use-google-search-console">Google Search Console</a>:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/pages-indexed-google-search-console.webp" alt="page index report in google search console" width="844" height="375" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86105" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/pages-indexed-google-search-console.webp 844w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/pages-indexed-google-search-console-480x213.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 844px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If the number surprises you, you can then drill down to see the actual pages that are being indexed and not. Similarly, you can go to google.com and type site:yoururl.com and quickly see the pages Google has indexed for your site (note that this is a rough estimate, and you don’t always see all of the pages indexed):</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/not-all-pages-indexed.webp" alt="not all pages indexed in google" width="312" height="570" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86106" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/not-all-pages-indexed.webp 312w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/not-all-pages-indexed-164x300.webp 164w" sizes="(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px" /></p>
<p>In this instance, you’ll note there are 10 pages of results for this local home remodeling company, and if you click to the last page of results, you can see there are actually several more listings:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/more-listings-on-google-serp.webp" alt="more listings in google" width="876" height="544" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86109" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/more-listings-on-google-serp.webp 876w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/more-listings-on-google-serp-480x298.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 876px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This may be fine and by design for this site, but if this were a site that had taken a hit in terms of traffic, it may be due to the fact that they have a larger number of pages than necessary being indexed.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/27/backlink-audit">analyzing backlinks</a> you’ll need a third-party tool like Ahrefs, Semrush, or similar to look at the anchor text pointing to your site:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/anchors-in-ahrefs.webp" alt="checking anchors in ahref" width="887" height="580" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86110" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/anchors-in-ahrefs.webp 887w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/anchors-in-ahrefs-480x314.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 887px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In this case, we can quickly see that a lot of the text linking to this site is branded or generic anchors, so the issue for this site likely isn’t overly aggressive exact match anchors (if we looked at this report and saw a heavy percentage of anchor text like “home remodeling wilmington ma” that would be a potential red flag).</p>
<h2>Most SEO best practices are still best practices</h2>
<p>Certain <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/outdated-seo-tactics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO tactics</a> that used to work don’t work anymore, and certain mixes of tactics won’t be as impactful as they used to.</p>
<p>But for the most part basic <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-issues">SEO best practices</a> still work. If you have a small business, you likely want to focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/03/google-my-business-optimization">Optimizing your Google Business Profile</a> for search.</li>
<li>Getting more positive reviews.</li>
<li>Getting <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/12/local-citations">local citations</a> and making sure your data is consistent.</li>
<li>Building location pages and making sure they’re targeting the right keywords.</li>
<li>Building links to your site generally and into your location pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, a key takeaway here is that if you have a mix of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local Services Ads (for services businesses)</li>
<li>Google Ads</li>
<li>A map presence</li>
<li>Organic listings</li>
</ul>
<p>You may still be impacted by core updates, but your leads from Google will be much better diversified and much more resilient to future updates (no matter how volatile they may be).</p>
