<h2>What is TikTok Live?</h2>
<p>TikTok LIVE is pretty much what you’d expect—it’s TikTok’s way of doing live video, just like how we have Facebook Live, Instagram Live, and YouTube Live. According to the platform, TikTok LIVE is a way for users and creators to interact in real time. There are a few requirements restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have to have at least 1,000 followers to unlock TikTok live (although there is a hack at the moment—more on that later).</li>
<li>You have to be 16 years and older to launch your own live</li>
<li>You have to be 18 years or older to send and receive gifts during a LIVE. Gifts are essentially virtual offerings from your followers during a live stream, which can be converted into cash.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>TikTok Live gifts appear below the live stream and show up on top of the video when given.</em></p>

<h2>How to go live on TikTok</h2>
<p>Provided you meet the above requirements, follow these steps to go live on TikTok:<sub></sub></p>
<ol>
<li>Open up the camera.</li>
<li>Scroll through the options under the red button until you find LIVE and tap it.</li>
<li>Create a title for your live stream.</li>
<li>Choose your cover photo, topic, and any other filters.</li>
<li>Tap the pink Go LIVE button.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are the steps with screenshots and a little more detail—courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb2Mri-ajWk&amp;t=298s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyla Liu on YouTube</a>—thanks Kyla!</p>
<p><strong>Step #1:</strong> Click the + at the bottom of your TikTok screen to open up the camera.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-go-live-on-tiktok-new-video.png" alt="how to go live on tiktok - add new button" width="450" height="786" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59616" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-go-live-on-tiktok-new-video.png 450w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-go-live-on-tiktok-new-video-172x300.png 172w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/round-record-button-at-the-bottom-of-the-screen.png"></a></p>
<p><strong>Step #2:</strong> Look below the red record button where the recording options are. Scroll right until you find the LIVE option, then tap it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-go-live-on-tiktok-live-option.png" alt="how to go live on tiktok - camera options" width="450" height="776" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59617" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-go-live-on-tiktok-live-option.png 450w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-go-live-on-tiktok-live-option-174x300.png 174w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step #3: </strong> Add a title. Keep this super short! You only have about 30 characters.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-go-live-on-tiktok-title.png" alt="how to go live on tiktok - add title screen" width="450" height="777" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59615" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-go-live-on-tiktok-title.png 450w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-go-live-on-tiktok-title-174x300.png 174w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step #4: </strong>Choose a cover photo. This can be your profile photo or you can change it to something else. Choose your topic, filters, effects, and more. You also have the option to support a nonprofit here.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-go-live-on-tiktok-topics-effects.png" alt="how to go live on tiktok - topics, effects, and photo change options" width="450" height="770" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59614" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-go-live-on-tiktok-topics-effects.png 450w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-go-live-on-tiktok-topics-effects-175x300.png 175w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step #5:</strong> Tap &#8220;Go LIVE&#8221; <img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-go-live-on-tiktok-go-live-button.png" alt="how to go live on tiktok - go live button" width="450" height="783" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59618" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-go-live-on-tiktok-go-live-button.png 450w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-go-live-on-tiktok-go-live-button-172x300.png 172w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p>You’ll get a three-second countdown before your video begins. If this button doesn’t pop up, make sure you’ve met all the requirements for TikTok LIVE. If you have, it’s possible that too many live streams are occurring at the same time. Try again a few minutes later.<br />

<h2>TikTok live tips/best practices</h2>
<h3>1. Have a goal</h3>
<p>Figure out what you want to get out of your TikTok LIVE. Do you want to share something specific with your audience, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">promote a new product</a>, drive traffic to your site, or just connect with your community? The options here are endless, and defining your goal before going live ensures that your live stream is intentional and actually benefits your marketing strategy.</p>
<h3>2. Pick a relevant topic</h3>
<p>Once you have your goal, it’s time to choose a topic that will help you accomplish that goal. Your topic needs to be enticing. If your goal was to promote your new product, a topic might be how your followers can use the product to solve a common problem. You might also want to choose a broader topic for the month and then do a weekly live stream on subtopics.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-go-live-on-tiktok-gifts.png" alt="tiktok live example - meditation" width="720" height="736" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59627" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-go-live-on-tiktok-gifts.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-go-live-on-tiktok-gifts-480x491.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>3. Structure your live</h3>
<p>If you want to keep your audience engaged till you sign off of your live stream, you need structure. Plan out how you’ll start, transition, and end your live before you click the red GO button. It’s usually a good idea to start by saying hi and introducing yourself to new viewers. Once a good bit of people join, explain the topic of the live stream.</p>
<p>The middle of your live stream can be structured however you like– it just needs to flow in a way that makes sense and keeps users engaged. Examples include steps in a how-to video or a question and answer session.</p>
<h3>4. Keep it to ~30 minutes</h3>
<p>Pre-plan how long you want to spend on live. 30 minutes is a good maximum time limit to keep in mind, as TikTok is geared toward shorter content (yes, even when it comes to live streams). You want enough time to accomplish your goal, but you also want to keep it short so that viewers stick around until you’re ready to say bye. Planning your duration beforehand helps you keep an eye on the clock while filming. That way, you know when you need to hurry up and move on to the next segment of your live stream.</p>
<h3>5. Go live at the right time</h3>
<p>Speaking of time, make sure you go live at a time when the majority of your users are online. This will ensure you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/17/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok">get the most likes</a> and engagement. You can access this information in the Follower Activity section of your TikTok analytics. The reasoning here speaks for itself—if you go live when your audience is online, you’ll get more engagement.

<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-do-a-tiktok-live-best-time-to-post.png" alt="how to do a tiktok live - best time to post" width="606" height="606" class="aligncenter wp-image-59636" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-do-a-tiktok-live-best-time-to-post.png 606w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-do-a-tiktok-live-best-time-to-post-480x480.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 606px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>6. Stay away from scripts</h3>
<p>Yes, pre-planning is important. With that said, don’t let your videos feel scripted. Part of TikTok’s charm is the authenticity of the raw content. If your live streams feel stiff and scripted, they might not resonate well with your TikTok audience. Your lives should be structured so that they provide value to you and your audience, but casual enough to foster an organic connection.</p>
<h3>7. Nail the quality</h3>
<p>TikToks shouldn’t be overproduced, live streams included. That doesn’t mean high-quality video isn’t a must. Make sure your live streams appear as high quality as possible by filming in good lighting (in front of a window will work just fine), checking the sound quality and avoiding noisy interruptions, and using a solid internet connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>8. Give viewers next steps</h3>
<p>You’ll get better results from your live if you include a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/05/best-call-to-action-phrases">call to action</a> before signing off. Reiterate whatever you wanted your viewers to get out of the live, then tell them what they can do next to learn more. Examples include asking for a follow or directing users to your site.</p>
<h3>9. Make it interactive</h3>
<p>As we mentioned above, the main purpose of TikTok live is to interact with users in real time. Pay attention to the questions and answer them. Thank new followers for following you and for any gifts you receive during your recording. Some TikTok lives are based solely on viewer requests, like the one below.</p>

<h2>TikTok live ideas and examples</h2>
<h3>1. Do a challenge</h3>
<p>Try out a challenge live. You can even show the behind-the-scenes of filming an actual TikTok on live— you’ll just need to film on separate devices.</p>
<h3>2. Film a live Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>Gather questions beforehand or wait for them to appear in your live stream comments, then answer the juiciest ones to build a stronger relationship with your audience.<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@heather_ramos/live"></a></p>
<h3>3. Host interviews</h3>
<p>Hosting interviews with other TikTok users is a fun way to increase your reach while providing value to your audience. And who knows, you may <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/07/how-to-get-on-tiktok-fyp">even end up on the FYP</a>. The below example. by @ameliezilber is not a live session, but could easily be. Also note that increasing your reach doesn’t have to mean interviewing another creator— you can collab by doing a challenge together, a joint Q&amp;A, or just by chatting on a topic relevant to both audiences.</p>

<h3>4. Ask for feedback</h3>
<p>Live is a great place to test new content and ideas and gauge your audience’s reactions. You can even ask directly in the live if your followers think your new content idea is a winner (or if it’s a flop).</p>
<h3>5. Behind the scenes tour</h3>
<p>Take your audience behind the scenes, showing them what it looks like when you create content or run your business.</p>

<h3>6. Do a helpful how-to</h3>
<p>Show your audience how to do something you’re good at, step by step. This is a great way to structure your live stream and keep users watching until the end. Plus, it’s an enticing offer for your audience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/tiktok-live-examples-lesson-how-to.jpg" alt="tiktok live example - how-to liv stream" width="400" height="866" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59628" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/tiktok-live-examples-lesson-how-to.jpg 400w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/tiktok-live-examples-lesson-how-to-139x300.jpg 139w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<h3>7. Discuss current events</h3>
<p>Your audience live in the same world you do. If current events in the world or your niche are on your mind, chances are your followers are thinking about them too.</p>
<h3>8. Chit-chat while cooking</h3>
<p>We all cook. Why not give your audience something to watch while you catch up via live. Chit chat about life, plans for future content— anything that might interest your audience works!</p>
<h3>9. Show how your product is made</h3>
<p>In the TikTok live example below, this cosmetics company is answering questions about their product while they show footage of how it&#8217;s made—a great way to show your customers that your product is exactly what you claim it to be.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/tiktok-live-examples-how-its-made.jpg" alt="tiktok live examples - showing how your product is made" width="400" height="866" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59629" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/tiktok-live-examples-how-its-made.jpg 400w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/tiktok-live-examples-how-its-made-139x300.jpg 139w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<h3>10. Put on a live stream fundraiser</h3>
<p>Give your audience a chance to give back by holding a live stream fundraiser. You can offer prizes or match donations to encourage participation. Fundraisers can help you bond with your audience, uniting you and your followers around a meaningful cause.</p>
<h2>Start your first TikTok live today</h2>

It’s a fantastic place to start building an audience because of the massive growth potential. Hopping on a new trend can launch your account into influencer status and sell out all your products if you play your cards right. Stitching is one of the platform’s many collaboration features that makes that kind of growth possible.</p>

<h2>What is Stitch on TikTok?</h2>
<p>The stitch feature allows TikTok users to clip and integrate scenes from another user’s video into their own. It allows you to easily reference another person’s content and either comment on it or reinterpret the idea altogether.</p>
<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktok/video/6867963867230653702" data-video-id="6867963867230653702" style="max-width: 605px; min-width: 325px;">

<p><script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script></p>
<p>Users who Stitch another person’s content expand the conversation to a wider audience. Since Stitch automatically credits the original creator and includes an attribution link right on the video, Stitching a video can actually send a good amount of attention the original creator’s way.<br />
<a id="how"></a></p>
<h2>How to stitch on TikTok</h2>
<p>Using the Stitch feature is super easy. Here’s how to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the TikTok video you want to Stitch and press the &#8220;Send to&#8221; button.</li>
<li>Press the “Stitch” button.</li>
<li>Choose the clip you’d like to include in your video. You can select up to five seconds from the original video.</li>
<li>Record your response or addition to the Stitched content.</li>
<li>Post and watch the conversation expand.</li>
</ol>
<ol></ol>
<ol></ol>
<ol></ol>
<ol></ol>
<ol></ol>
<p>Let&#8217;s walk through the same step with screenshots:</p>
<p><strong>Step #1:</strong> Open TikTok and find the video you want to Stitch and press the “Send to” button.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-stitch-on-tiktok-cow-in-house.png" alt="how to stitch on tiktok - finding the video you want to stitch" width="450" height="974" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58216" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-stitch-on-tiktok-cow-in-house.png 450w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-stitch-on-tiktok-cow-in-house-139x300.png 139w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<ol></ol>
<p><strong>Step #2:</strong> In the menu, tap &#8220;Stitch.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-stitch-on-tiktok-stitch-button.png" alt="how to stitch on tiktok - stitch button" width="450" height="974" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58232" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-stitch-on-tiktok-stitch-button.png 450w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-stitch-on-tiktok-stitch-button-139x300.png 139w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p><strong>Step #3:</strong> Choose the clip from that video that you’d like to include in your video. You can select up to five seconds from the original video.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-stitch-on-tiktok-trim-clip.png" alt="how to stitch on tiktok - trimming original clip" width="450" height="974" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58223" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-stitch-on-tiktok-trim-clip.png 450w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-stitch-on-tiktok-trim-clip-139x300.png 139w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p><strong>Step #4:</strong> Record your response or addition to the Stitched content. When you record, the red at the top marks original video content and the blue is what you are recording. Stitched videos can still make use of editing tools, timer, effects, filters, voiceover, text, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Step #5:</strong> Post and watch the conversation expand.<br />

<h2>How to turn Stitch off and on</h2>
<p>Allowing other users to Stitch your videos opens the door for millions of people to respond directly to your videos. This can increase your video reach and engagement, which might <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/07/how-to-get-on-tiktok-fyp">get your video onto the coveted For You Page (FYP)</a> or even improve your chances of going viral.</p>
<p>The internet can be intimidating, though. When you open the door to collaborations, you are welcoming potential criticism. Since you can’t choose what kind of responses you get, those who want to protect their privacy or avoid negative interactions might want to disable the feature.</p>
<p>Luckily, you can easily adjust these permissions via the Privacy and Safety page under “Settings and Privacy”. Here, you can choose to enable or disable Stitch for all videos on your account.</p>
<h3>Here&#8217;s how to turn Stitch off or on:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to your profile and tap the three dots in the top right corner.</li>
<li>Tap “Privacy” under the Account tab.</li>
<li>Tap “Who can Stitch with your videos.</li>
<li>Here, you can either select “Everyone”, “Friends”, or “No one”.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step #1: </strong>Go to your profile and tapp the three lines in the top right corner.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-turn-stitch-on-off-tiktok.png" alt="how to turn stitch on and off on tiktok - profile menu" width="450" height="974" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58221" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-turn-stitch-on-off-tiktok.png 450w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-turn-stitch-on-off-tiktok-139x300.png 139w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step #2:</strong> Tap “Privacy” under the Account tab.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-turn-stitch-on-tiktok-settings.png" alt="how to turn stitch on and off on tiktok - privacy settings" width="450" height="974" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58220" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-turn-stitch-on-tiktok-settings.png 450w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-turn-stitch-on-tiktok-settings-139x300.png 139w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p><strong>Step #3:</strong> Tap “Who can Stitch with your videos&#8221; and either select Everyone, Friends, or No one.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-stitch-on-tiktok-stitch-settings-e1646427282889.png" alt="how to turn stitch on and off on tiktok - stitch settings" width="450" height="367" class="aligncenter wp-image-58218 size-full" /><br />
<a id="disable"></a></p>
<h2>How to disable Stich for individual videos</h2>
<p>You can also enable or disable Stitch for each individual video, but you’ll have to do that when you go to post your new video. Simply toggle the “Allow Stitch” button on or off right before you click “Post”.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-stitch-on-tiktok-post.png" alt="how to turn stitch on and off on tiktok - sharing settings" width="450" height="974" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58222" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-stitch-on-tiktok-post.png 450w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-stitch-on-tiktok-post-139x300.png 139w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p><a id="saved"></a></p>
<h2>Can you Stitch on TikTok with a saved video?</h2>
<p>You can only use the Stitch feature with existing TikToks and newly recorded video. You can choose any video on TikTok to Stitch with, even from your Saved folder (as long as the creator enables Stitch for their video), but your response has to be recorded in the app.</p>
<p>In other words, you can’t upload pre-existing content that’s been saved to your camera roll to be Stitched. If you want to respond to a video using something from your camera roll, you’ll have to download the video you want to Stitch and then edit it and your response together as a regular TikTok video. This will not automatically link the original video and also won&#8217;t be recognized as a Stitch by the algorithm.<br />

<h2>TikTok Stitch ideas &amp; examples for inspiration</h2>

<h3>Make products go viral</h3>
<p>@Cindilooblink182 stitched @Snackqueen666’s video to rave about the Urban Decay lipstick mentioned in the original video. Stitch is one of the ways products go insanely viral on TikTok, and this video is a great example of how that happens. Users create a chain reaction trying products and stitching their reactions.</p>

<h3>Show off your talents</h3>
<p>@Ollierose_ posted a video asking what the tag is for the guy who “figures out people’s height”. A response to her video was highly requested by @Kentai.haven’s followers, pulling over 1,000 mentions in a night. He responded by showing off his unique talent for guessing people’s heights based on objects in their video and a lot of math.</p>

<h2>How to Stitch on TikTok: FAQs</h2>
<p><strong>Can every video be stitched?</strong></p>
<p>Not every video can be stitched, though. You have the choice to turn the feature on or off. If a user turns their Stitch permissions off, you won’t be able to Stitch their video.</p>
<p><strong>Can I Stitch from an existing video?</strong></p>
<p>You can’t Stitch using content from your camera roll. Additionally the TikTok Sound library is off limits for Stitched videos</p>
<p><strong>What’s the difference between Stitch and Duets?</strong></p>
<p>Stitch is sometimes confused with Duet. Duet is when you record a video that follows along with someone else&#8217;s video. This feature places your video and the original one side by side, with the new video on the left and the original video on the right. Both videos play at the same time.</p>

<p>Stitch, on the other hand, places the borrowed clip within your video rather than beside it. The borrowed clip doesn’t play at the same time as your recorded content. Instead, it plays as a part of your content.</p>

<h2>Why repost on Instagram?</h2>
<p>Reposting on Instagram is a way to ride the momentum of conversations that are already getting lots of engagement among your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/10/19/get-more-instagram-followers">followers</a> and target audience. It’s a win for both you and the original poster as it garners engagement for you and widens their own exposure. Here are some of the specific benefits of reposting on Instagram:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cultivate community:</strong> Acknowledging and uplifting others cultivates an inviting and engaged community around your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Save time: </strong>This is basically pre-made content that you know will do well and that you can share in just a few steps.</li>
<li><strong>Diversify content: </strong>Reposting can naturally deliver content from a range of perspectives and backgrounds that resonate with your audience.</li>
<li><strong>Get new ideas:</strong> When your creative well is running dry, this is a great way to spark inspiration (although you can find dozens of ideas in our <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/local-social-media-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social Media Marketing Lab</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Build trust: </strong>Sharing valuable content—and not just your own—shows your audience that you know them well and have their best interests (and not just your follower count)</li>
</ul>

<a id="what-repost"></a></p>
<h2>What to repost on Instagram</h2>
<p>Repost anything that sparks interest from your audience. Here&#8217;s who you can repost from:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Influencers: </strong>Share content from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/03/21/social-media-influencers">influencers in your industry</a> that will bring value to your audience.</li>
<li><strong>Complementary businesses: </strong>These are businesses that share your audience but aren&#8217;t competitors. For example, GoPro and Redbull.</li>
<li><strong>Accounts that share your core values: </strong>For example, you might repost an inspiring quote or demonstration of leadership or great customer service.</li>
<li><strong>Customers and followers: </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/13/ugc-instagram">User-generated content </a>is any post from your customers or audience that acknowledges your business. Posts with user-generated content yield a <a href="https://adespresso.com/blog/instagram-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5% </a>higher conversion rate than non-UGC.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you&#8217;ll see in each of the instructions below, you&#8217;ll always want to tag the original poster and mention them in your caption.</p>

<h2>How to repost on Instagram: photo to Feed</h2>
<p>The easiest way to repost Instagram photos to your Feed is the screenshot method.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Screenshot the Instagram photo you want to repost.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/how-to-repost-on-instagram-photo.png" alt="how to repost on instagram - take screenshot" width="360" height="515" class="aligncenter wp-image-56839" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Tap the “new post” button in the top right corner of your Instagram app. When presented with the different content format options, choose “post.”</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Use Instagram&#8217;s native cropping tool to resize the image. If you use a certain filter for your feed, you can add it to the photo (if you add filters using third-party apps, you’d edit the screenshot prior to clicking “new post”).</p>

<h2>How to repost an Instagram video to your Story</h2>
<p>Useful and even entertaining videos make great<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-to-post-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> content to post on Instagram</a>, even if you didn&#8217;t create them (but ONLY if you tag the original poster, and only if you do this sparingly). This method for sharing an Instagram video to your Story also works with photo posts. It goes like this:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Find the video you want to repost.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/how-to-repost-instagram-video-step-1.png" alt="how to repost instagram video - step one" width="400" height="866" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56849" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/how-to-repost-instagram-video-step-1.png 400w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/how-to-repost-instagram-video-step-1-139x300.png 139w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the paper airplane button below the video (right next to the like and comment icons).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> A pop-up menu will appear. Tap “Add post to your Story.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/how-to-repost-instagram-video-step-2.png" alt="how to repost instagram video - step 2 - add to your Story" width="400" height="866" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56850" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/how-to-repost-instagram-video-step-2.png 400w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/how-to-repost-instagram-video-step-2-139x300.png 139w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The video will appear as a Story draft. Customize the story by adding text, stickers, hashtags, etc. If you tap the video, you can show the original caption in your Story as well.</p>

There are three options for reposting an Instagram Reel. Sharing the Reel to your Story is the easiest option. Simply tap the paper airplane icon and follow the same steps you would when adding an Instagram video to your Story.<a id="reel-feed"></a></p>
<h2>How to repost an Instagram Reel to your feed</h2>
<p>To repost a Reel directly to your profile, you can either screen record or use a third-party app.</p>
<p>For the screen recording method, follow these steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Screen record the Instagram Reel you want to repost.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Head to your camera roll to crop out the background. We just want the video content.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Tap the “New Post” button in the top right corner of your Instagram app. When presented with the different content format options, choose “Reel”.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/how-to-repost-instagram-reel-step-1.png" alt="how to repost instagram reel - new post view" width="450" height="974" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56854" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/how-to-repost-instagram-reel-step-1.png 450w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/how-to-repost-instagram-reel-step-1-139x300.png 139w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
