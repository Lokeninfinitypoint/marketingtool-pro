<h2><span lang="EN"><strong>How did we get here?</strong></span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">As I’ve already alluded to, addiction treatment and rehabilitation is one of the most competitive industries in the digital marketing landscape. Further compounding this are Google, Facebook, and Microsoft’s own policies around advertising for these services—especially with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/15/google-rehab-ad-policy-changes">recent policy changes</a><span lang="EN">. </span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">The goal of these restrictive policies isn’t to police advertisers; it’s to protect people searching for these services. The industry is fraught with shady or outright fraudulent companies, inadequate and ill-defined best practices, so Google, Microsoft, and Facebook banded together to change the addiction treatment and rehabilitation industry’s ability to advertise on their respective platforms. First and foremost, these advertising platforms all enacted a simple but exceptionally effective policy: <strong>You must pass an in-depth, third-party certification process that verifies the company and its employees are in fact properly trained and vetted to provide treatment and support, and that your company offers all services advertised. </strong>And that certification provider is LegitScript.</span></p>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/LegitScriptsContent20200129LegitScriptsWebinarADVTOF.html?cid=Nurture_WS_Email_PPC_LegitScriptsWebinarADVTOF20200129_Reg&amp;utm_source=Email&amp;utm_medium=Nurture&amp;utm_campaign=LegitScriptsWebinarTOF20200129&amp;utm_content=WS&amp;utm_term=PPC"><em>Want to make sure you get advice right from the certification provider? Sign up for our webinar now!</em></a></p>
<h2><strong><span lang="EN">The immediate impact of these changes</span></strong></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">The effects of these changes were immediate and reverberated throughout the PPC world: Advertisers became required to have a LegitScript certification to even be eligible to run ads on Google, Microsoft, and Facebook, which cut down on illegitimate businesses taking advantage of people. LegitScript certification was a necessary step to help regulate and legitimize the marketing of addiction treatment and rehabilitation services; however, it wasn’t the most impactful change. Updates to HIPAA drastically changed who was eligible to see addiction treatment and rehabilitation ads and, to a large extent, upended the digital marketing and PPC best practices within the industry. No longer were all users who made a search related to the addiction treatment and rehabilitation services shown ads. At one point, advertisers were showing up for 96% fewer total searches than they were previously eligible to show on, though since our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/15/google-rehab-ad-policy-changes">initial study was published in 2018</a><span lang="EN">, Google has relaxed these restrictions slightly (but not by much). </span></span></p>

<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/15/google-rehab-ad-policy-changes">Data: September through December 2017</a></p>
<p><span lang="EN">With this new realization, digital marketers of addiction treatment and rehabilitation services scrambled to make up lost clicks, conversions, and, eventually, leads. </span></p>
<h2><strong><span lang="EN">Why this matters now</span></strong></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">You might be asking yourself, “But why are ads still important? Couldn’t SEO make up for this lost traffic?” And rightfully so. You would assume, with the massive dropoff in ads eligible to be shown, that organic links and SEO’s importance would skyrocket. And just as you can imagine, many advertisers switched their strategies and budgets to focus almost exclusively on SEO. While SEO is important, there’s one crucial difference between SEO and PPC efforts: It takes<em> a long time</em> to really see impactful changes and improvements from SEO. </span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">But Google, Microsoft, and Facebook Ads’ new restrictions—though drastically reducing overall ad impressions and eligibility—do still allow ads to be shown to the users most in need of help, users these platforms have identified as legitimately in need of addiction treatment and rehabilitation services. This means that these users will still see ads above the organic listings for Google and Microsoft searches.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">See those four ads—three text and one map ad—before the organic Google Maps listings? You may also notice the glaring lack of organic links, and that was intentional. On my 21” computer monitor this is what I saw before having to scroll down, which is where the organic listings start and the benefits of SEO could potentially be realized. PPC ads—in this example, Google text ads—and their importance cannot be understated. Users who are seeking help will likely not even get to the organic listings on a SERP if an ad draws their attention and subsequent click, so advertisers and marketers absolutely need to make and keep PPC an integral part of their marketing. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Want to make sure that your ads are getting that attention from searchers and taking up the valuable real estate on those SERPs? <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/LegitScriptsContent20200129LegitScriptsWebinarADVTOF.html?cid=Nurture_WS_Email_PPC_LegitScriptsWebinarADVTOF20200129_Reg&amp;utm_source=Email&amp;utm_medium=Nurture&amp;utm_campaign=LegitScriptsWebinarTOF20200129&amp;utm_content=WS&amp;utm_term=PPC"><strong>Register for our webinar and tune in on January 29 to learn more! </strong></a></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why just market … when you can remarket?!</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/remarketing-youtube-1.jpg" alt="Remarketing on Youtube" width="500" height="375" /></div>
<p>We recently shared <a href="/blog/ws/2013/12/04/adwords-remarketing-best-practices-guide">The Complete Guide to Google Ads Remarketing Best Practices</a> – but it wasn’t <em>100%</em> complete because it didn’t cover <strong>remarketing with YouTube videos</strong>.</p>
<p>Using YouTube videos is the next step in the evolution of remarketing. As Google continues to try and make searching (and advertising) a more visual and interactive experience, <strong>video ads are primed to fill this void</strong>. Remarketing with YouTube videos will allow you to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grab your potential customer’s attention</strong> and explain to them why your product is beneficial.</li>
<li><strong>Step outside of the 70-character limit of conventional text ads</strong> and push beyond the dull, static nature of image ads.</li>
<li><strong>Connect more directly with customers</strong> by explaining and demonstrating your product or service in a 30-second clip rather than a sentence or two.</li>
</ul>
<p>By combining these video ads with remarketing, you will be able to reach very qualified leads and potential customers. This blog post will outline and explain how to set-up Remarketing with YouTube videos so you too can start advertising with them!’</p>
<p>In this article I will walk through how to set up a YouTube remarketing campaign in Google Ads (AdWords), so you can start reaching your next customers with video.</p>
<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="/blog/ws/2014/01/22/adchoices">What is AdChoices?</a></p>
<h2>Setting Up Your YouTube Remarketing List</h2>
<p>First, we will need to go to the Video Campaigns section in Google Ads:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-adwords-all-video-campaigns-1.png" alt="youtube remarketing" width="213" height="678" /></div>
<p>Next we will need to choose which campaign will be used for remarketing, either selecting a current one or creating a new one. In this instance I created a new campaign called “Remarketing – Chroma.” If you are starting with a new campaign please create it before moving onto the next steps.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/video-remarketing-campaign-1.png" alt="video remarketing" width="788" height="662" /></div>
<p>Once you have either created or selected the campaign remarketing will be applied to, it is time to set remarketing up! Click on the campaign you have chosen to use for video remarketing and then click into the “Targets” tab, then click “Show More Criteria.”</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/youtube-remarketing-targets-1.png" alt="youtube remarketing " width="918" height="583" /></div>
<p>Then you will see an option that says “Remarketing Lists.” Click that option, then click “Add Remarketing Lists.”</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/select-youtube-remarketing-lists-1.png" alt="remarketing video tips" width="900" height="638" /></div>
<p>A menu will pop-up which allows you to select which remarketing list(s) will be added as the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/17/youtube-ad-placement-targeting">targeting method</a>. Go through this menu and select the remarketing list or lists that will be used and add them into the targeting group by clicking the “Add” button. Once you have added all the lists that will be used, click the “Add Remarketing Lists” button to save your targeting.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/add-new-youtube-remarketing-lists-1.png" alt="how to remarketing on youtube" width="840" height="450" /></div>
<p>Once everything has been saved and added, your targeting should look like this:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/youtube-retargeting-campaign-example-1.png" alt="remarketing on youtube" width="1680" height="670" /></div>
<p>Congratulations, you have successfully created a remarketing list target for Video Campaigns!</p>
<h2>Creating Video Ads for YouTube Remarketing</h2>
<p>Now onto the final step, making your remarketing ad! First, make sure you are still in the remarketing campaign you just made or selected that has the remarketing list in it. Next, click on the “Ads” tab and then click “Add Video Ad.”</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-create-remarketing-video-ad-1.png" alt="youtube remarketing guide" width="595" height="567" /></div>
<p>You will then be taken to the new ad screen, where we will select the YouTube video to use in the ad. Click the “Select A Video” button.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/select-video-ad-for-remarketing-1.png" alt="create video ads" width="642" height="379" /></div>
<p>Once you have clicked the “Select A Video” button, you will either need to select a video from your YouTube channel, if it has been synced with your account, or upload a video by copying and pasting the video’s YouTube URL. (NOTE: You must own the rights to the video or have been given express permission to use the video by the owner.)</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/remarketing-video-ad-channel-url-1.png" alt="remarketing video ad channel" width="629" height="240" /></div>
<p>After you have selected the video you will be using, make sure to create the ad itself by filling all applicable fields (Headline, Description, URL, etc.) and saving it.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/create-new-youtube-ad-for-retargeting-1.png" alt="youtube ads" width="919" height="846" /></div>
<p>You have now successfully made a remarketing campaign using YouTube videos! Your campaign should start getting views a couple hours after creation.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Learn how to geotarget with bid modifiers in AdWords Enhanced Campaigns, an easier, more effective way to target your best performing locations.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/08/05/geotargeting-with-bid-modifiers">Enhanced Campaigns: What Geographical Targeting With Bid Modifiers Can Do For You</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that July 22 has come and gone, let’s take a moment to look at one of the more promising new Enhanced Campaign features: geographical (location) targeting with bid modifiers.</p>
<p>You’re probably thinking, “But we’ve always been able to target a specific location or state, even before <a href="/blog/ws/2013/07/10/enhanced-campaigns-faq">Enhanced Campaigns</a>.” And you are right, location-based targeting did exist before Enhanced Campaigns. But now there is a new function called Bid Modifiers to better enable geographic-based targeting. Before Enhanced Campaigns, if you wanted to target a specific state/city/zip code/region, you would have to create an entirely new campaign unique to that targeted area. This often turned into a lengthy and time-consuming task, especially if more than one location needed to be targeted. Now, with Bid Modifiers, we can set bidding adjustments for specific locations within each campaign. Big timesaver!</p>
<h2><strong>How to Enable Location Targeting in Enhanced Campaigns</strong></h2>
<p>To enable this function you must first add the desired locations to the campaign by going into the <a href="/blog/ws/2011/12/05/adwords-settings-ultimate-guide">Settings Tab</a>. From there you will need to click the Locations button and then go to “Edit Locations”:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="79bf511d-f8c8-46b5-a192-d27bcc997a55" data-langcode="und">

</article>
</div>
<p>Next we add in our locations and hit save:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="29d570c4-6af5-4ce0-9e12-0faad5db2bb5" data-langcode="und">

</article>
</div>
<p>After adding in our locations we now see the Bid Modifier section for each location:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="b1b20ac2-0035-4467-9bf8-d7239aaf5e5a" data-langcode="und">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adwords-bid-modifiers-by-location-1.png" alt="Geotargeting Bid Modifiers" width="414" height="249" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>From here we can now set the bid adjustment for each location.</p>
<h2><strong>Some Tips for Geotargeting with Bid Modifiers in Enhanced Campaigns </strong></h2>
<p>If there is a location where the campaign is performing well or that you specifically want to target, you would set a <strong>positive bid adjustment</strong>. So say we want to target California more heavily than the United States as a whole: By setting a +10% bid adjustment we are telling Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords) to increase our Maximum CPC bid in California by 10%. This means if an ad group has a Maximum CPC of $3.00, with the bid modifier the Maximum CPC for California now becomes $3.30.</p>
<p>The inverse works as well. Say we want to lower bids in California (because clicks in that location aren’t worth as much), we could set a -10% <a href="/blog/ws/2017/11/20/device-bid-adjustment-alert">bid adjustment</a>. If the ad group’s Maximum CPC is $3.00, then with the negative bid adjustment it becomes $2.70.</p>
<p>This new Bid Modification feature in Google Ads allows for a much more granular level of management within each campaign, and can provide very positive results – as I am about to demonstrate.</p>
<h2><strong>Case Study: Better Results with Bid Modifier Geotargeting </strong></h2>
<p>Below are some results from a client of mine who sells plumbing fixtures, filters, and water tanks through their online retail store. The top 5 converting states for this client make up 42% of their year-to-date (2013) revenue, showing the importance of bid modifiers. By targeting these top 5 states with a +30% bid adjustment, as well as making smaller adjustments to other states, we were able to greatly improve the overall <a href="/blog/ws/2011/09/20/ppc-metrics-ultimate-guide">metrics</a> of the account from June 2012 to June 2013.</p>
<p>These were the metrics in June 2012 before bid modifiers were enabled on the account:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="ae5f32d2-23b7-4a8d-8d4f-dd1642465692" data-langcode="und">

</article>

<p>The metrics look pretty good, but they could be better! Here is the same account in June 2013, when bid modifiers were used:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0802cccd-969a-441c-9614-ffc777192067" data-langcode="und">

</article>
</div>
<p>Notice the improvement!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The cost per conversion dropped 27.4%</strong> from $14.16 to $10.28</li>
<li><strong>Conversions grew 57.76%</strong> from 1,127 to 1,778,</li>
<li><strong>Click-through rate (CTR) increased 12.71%</strong>, from 1.81% to 2.04%.</li>
</ul>
<p>To accomplish this, we adjusted the bids to increase in the areas that were converting well at a low cost per conversion and decreased bids in the areas that were either poorly converting or converting at too high a cost.</p>
<p>Congratulations, you now know how to geographically target with bid modifiers! Go forth and be prosperous!</p>
