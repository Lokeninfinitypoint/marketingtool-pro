										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whenever I have a client that asks about running YouTube ads, we run into the same roadblock about 99% of the time. The clients think they either (a) don’t have enough video creative to use for ads, (b) don’t have the extra budget for video creative, or (c) they don’t have the tools to do it themselves.</p>
<p>Sounds about right.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/video-marketing-challenges.jpeg" alt="video marketing challenges" width="500" height="658" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61798" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/video-marketing-challenges.jpeg 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/video-marketing-challenges-480x632.jpeg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://wave.video/blog/video-marketing-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>But there are plenty of affordable ways to get video creative. They don&#8217;t have to be picture-perfect to start. Then after you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/03/underrated-youtube-metrics">prove the value of your YouTube campaigns</a>, hopefully you can go back and request more budget to build new creative. Here are just a few ways you can get some videos for your next campaigns.</p>
<h2>Use screen recorders for demo-style ads</h2>
<p>There are plenty of affordable video editing tools out there to help you with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/23/youtube-advertising-tips">profitable video advertising</a>. For the videos we have on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PaidMediaPros" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paid Media Pros YouTube channel</a>, we use a tool called <a href="https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Camtasia</a>. This software allows us to record our screens as well as ourselves to make our demo-style videos. If you are looking to make any demo videos to for skippable in-stream video ads (formerly TrueView in-feed ads) on YouTube, then you may want to check out Camtasia. Here is something I put together in about 10 minutes using just my cell phone.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; padding: 40px 0px;"><iframe width="560" height="315" style="border: 1px solid #000;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3uZxAM9ICM8?rel=0" srcdoc='<style>*{padding:0;margin:0;overflow:hidden}html,body{height:100%}img,span{position:absolute;width:100%;top:0;bottom:0;margin:auto}span{height:1.5em;text-align:center;font:48px/1.5 sans-serif;color:white;text-shadow:0 0 0.5em black;border:5px solid #ffffff;width:60px;border-radius:50px;padding-left:10px;}a div{display:flex;width:100%;text-align:center;justify-content:center;}</style><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3uZxAM9ICM8?rel=0"><img decoding="async" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/3uZxAM9ICM8/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Video editing tools example YouTube video" /><div><span><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></div></a>'loading="lazy" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen title="Video editing tools example YouTube video"></iframe></div>
<p>Am I saying this is a video I would put out for advertising? Of course not. I just wanted to show you some of the features which included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cuts and edits</li>
<li>Audio adjustments</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/royalty-free-background-music">Royalty-free background music</a></li>
<li>Icons</li>
<li>Highlighting</li>
<li>Text annotations</li>
<li>Transitions</li>
</ul>
<p>Editing tools like Camtasia can also help you edit any <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/video-marketing-seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current videos</a> you have. Maybe you want to cut, splice, and reposition your main messages in the video. Maybe you want to test different video footage for just the first five seconds (these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/20/youtube-studio-reports">YouTube Studio reports</a> might help you identify those edits). Editing the video yourself can be a lot cheaper than having to have someone recreate a new video every time.</p>
<p>Camtasia only cost us a couple of hundred bucks the first time we downloaded it. Then there are optional upgrades which are extremely affordable. If you want to run demo-style ads on YouTube, a tool like Camtasia can help you pump them out efficiently.</p>
<h4>Video editor tools to try</h4>
<p>In addition to the tools in our list of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/12/15/best-video-editing-software-for-beginners">best video editing software for beginners</a>, here are some tools similar to Camtasia that you can use for creating demo-style video ads:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Filmora</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ScreenFlow</a></li>
<li><a href="https://democreator.wondershare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DemoCreator</a></li>
<li><a href="https://atomisystems.com/activepresenter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ActivePresenter</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Try video templates for commercial-style ads</h2>
<p>If you want to create a more commercial-style video ad, there are plenty of good video templates out there. The provider my clients use the most is Promo. Here is a basic look into what they have.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/video-ad-tools-promo.jpg" alt="video ad tools - promo template library" width="720" height="481" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61791" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/video-ad-tools-promo.jpg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/video-ad-tools-promo-480x321.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Video templates are sorted in a variety of ways such as platform (YouTube, Facebook, etc.), industry (Ecommerce, Real Estate, etc.), and more. Promo also has the option to create 6-second bumper ads (learn about them in our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/03/how-to-advertise-on-youtube">guide to YouTube advertising</a>). Here’s a preview of one of the marketing templates they have. I didn’t change anything in the template.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; padding: 40px 0px;"><iframe width="560" height="315" style="border: 1px solid #000;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UDTGGq3iz7s?rel=0" srcdoc='<style>*{padding:0;margin:0;overflow:hidden}html,body{height:100%}img,span{position:absolute;width:100%;top:0;bottom:0;margin:auto}span{height:1.5em;text-align:center;font:48px/1.5 sans-serif;color:white;text-shadow:0 0 0.5em black;border:5px solid #ffffff;width:60px;border-radius:50px;padding-left:10px;}a div{display:flex;width:100%;text-align:center;justify-content:center;}</style><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UDTGGq3iz7s?rel=0"><img decoding="async" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/UDTGGq3iz7s/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Video template example YouTube video" /><div><span><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/25b6.png" alt="▶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></div></a>'loading="lazy" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen title="Video template example YouTube video"></iframe></div>
<p>Any of the text elements can be changed to say whatever you want in the spaces. You can pick out different music to match the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/23/how-brand-your-business">look and feel of your brand</a> or promo. You can even upload your own media to add to any of the templates to customize the video even more.</p>
<h4>Video template tools to try</h4>
<p>There are many template sites out there for making <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/12/memorable-youtube-ads">memorable video ads</a> Here is a list linked to each of their pricing pages so you see how much these tools cost (which isn’t a lot compared to an actual video shoot).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://promo.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Promo</a></li>
<li><a href="https://animoto.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Animoto</a></li>
<li><a href="https://vimeo.com/upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vimeo</a></li>
<li><a href="https://biteable.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biteable</a></li>
<li><a href="https://invideo.io/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Invideo</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Use mobile tools for social video ads</h2>
<p>Besides software and tools for desktop, there are also options if the only camera your business has is on your phone. I also feel, and this is just my opinion, that these apps are better suited for creating <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/10/social-media-video-marketing">video content for your social ads</a> on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and others.</p>
<p>Many of the apps provide templates like what we saw in the previous section (since many of them do have desktop versions). The one below is from Ripl.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/video-ad-tools-ripl.png" alt="video ad tools - ripl" width="305" height="596" class="aligncenter wp-image-61792" /></p>
<p>You can then add text, other images or media, change the fonts, update the music, and more. Once you&#8217;ve made all of the changes you would like, most of the apps have the option to upload the video directly to one of the ad platforms. Not all platforms are going to be available on each app, which is fine because then you can just download your completed video.</p>
<h4>Mobile video tools to try</h4>
<p>Here is a list of some of the apps you may want to check out for creating social media video content, like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/14/facebook-video-ad">Facebook video ads</a>. I’ll mix iPhone vs. Android to be fair:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ripl.android&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripl</a></li>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/promote-make-social-video-ads/id1481307190" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Promote</a></li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cyberlink.addirector&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdDirector</a></li>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/powerdirector-video-editor/id1473574597" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PowerDirector</a></li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wondershare.filmorago&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FilmoraGo</a></li>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magisto-video-editor-maker/id486781045" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magisto</a></li>
</ul>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>These little nuances can lead to lots of wasted spend, but we've got you covered.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/29/google-ads-video-campaign-settings">4 Fine-Print Settings to Beware of in Google Ads Video Campaigns</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I never shy away from expressing my love for YouTube Ads. I strongly believe they are one of the most cost-effective ways to build brand awareness or stay in front of a target audience.</p>
<p>But as much as I love video campaigns in Google Ads, I also admit they are not perfect. There are certain things new YouTube advertisers should be aware of before launching a campaign. This post will cover three mistakes that are all too easy to make if you don&#8217;t pay attention to the fine print with your campaign settings.</p>
<h2>4 fine-print details that impact your budget in Google Ads video campaigns</h2>
<p>The many features that give us flexibility with Google ads can also lead to mistakes when <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/21/how-to-run-google-ads">setting up a Google Ads campaign</a>. Here are three to be aware of when running video campaigns.</p>
<h3>1. Your video ads will default to showing outside of YouTube</h3>
<p>When going through the video campaign setup process, you&#8217;ll come across a section called “Networks.” If you expand this section, you&#8217;ll see<strong> your video campaign is automatically included in the three Networks for YouTube Ads</strong>: YouTube search results, YouTube videos, and Video partners on the Display Network. That&#8217;s right. Your videos will serve on websites outside of youtube.com.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-advertising-network-options.png" alt="youtube advertising network options" width="720" height="215" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59450" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-advertising-network-options.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-advertising-network-options-480x143.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is not necessarily a bad thing if you&#8217;re looking to expand your reach. But if you want more control over the experience, leaving the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/18/google-display-network-tips">Display Network</a> on may not be the best idea. Let me explain.</p>
<p>People go to YouTube to watch videos. So we see better watch times, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/06/youtube-earned-metrics">earned actions</a>, and overall engagement from YouTube networks. When people are on another website, they visit the site to view specific content; not your video ads’ content. <strong>So if your budget is limited, remove the Display Network from your targeting. You can always turn this setting back on if you feel you&#8217;re limited in your reach.</strong></p>
<h3>2. Video ad extensions don&#8217;t show up on TV devices</h3>
<p>I love using Video Action campaigns for my clients who want to get as much traffic and conversions as possible from their YouTube ads. We can add call-to-action extensions, sitelink extensions, and more to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">encourage users to visit your website</a>. A big problem with these extensions is that they don’t show up on most TV devices. According to <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/150471#zippy=%2Ccall-to-action-button" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a>, &#8220;The call-to-action button on TVs is only available for Video campaigns that use the &#8220;Brand awareness and reach&#8221; and &#8220;Product and brand consideration&#8221; goals.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-advertising-sitelink-extensions.png" alt="youtube advertising sitelink extensions" width="600" height="471" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59454" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-advertising-sitelink-extensions.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-advertising-sitelink-extensions-480x377.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/youtube-trueview-ads-demystified-what-marketers-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>So if you’re running a Video Action campaign, you’re most likely assuming you’re getting the most changes for a conversion or traffic visit, but you’re not. Call-to-action buttons won’t show on TV devices. Sitelink extensions won’t show on TV devices. Lead form extensions won’t show on TV devices. So to make sure I’m using my Action budget for action, I turn off TV devices.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-advertising-device-placements.png" alt="youtube advertising device placements" width="720" height="240" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59449" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-advertising-device-placements.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-advertising-device-placements-480x160.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>That being said, <strong>I am not saying TV devices are worthless</strong>. So many people watch TV with their phones in their hands. After seeing your ad they could easily look up what your brand or product is. If you still want to capitalize on TV devices, split it out into its own campaign. You’ll have better control of the budget and get better insight on how your Action campaigns perform both on and off TV devices.</p>
<h3>3. Google can ignore your managed placements</h3>
<p>When selecting your targeting, advertisers can handpick to have their ads shown on specific YouTube channels, YouTube videos, video lineups, Display websites, apps, and app categories. Just like the exact match type in Search Ads is not as exact as we’d like, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/17/youtube-ad-placement-targeting">YouTube ad managed placements</a> can be just as shaky. You may think your ad is only going to appear on the placements you chose, but that is definitely not the case. Look at the fine print Google Ads places next to the Placements settings.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-advertising-placment-targeting.png" alt="youtube advertising placement options - the fine print" width="720" height="375" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59451" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-advertising-placment-targeting.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-advertising-placment-targeting-480x250.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8220;Your ad can appear on any YouTube or Display Network placements that <strong>match</strong> your other targeting.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>This means Google Ads has the right to ignore your managed placement targets</strong> and use other targeting options you have layered into the ad group, like Topics, Audiences, etc. We have seen a lot of wasted spend in new client accounts because their ads were being shown on many other placements they didn’t expect.</p>
<h3>4. Not every Display network website plays video ads</h3>
<p>Finally, if you are researching Display websites for managed placements, you also have to be careful. <strong>Google will show you every website result that is part of the Display Network; not just the websites with video ad placements</strong>. So you need to closely monitor any Display website placement you add to your ad group targeting to make sure your video ads are actually playing on the chosen website. It’ll help you avoid a lot of wasted ad spend.</p>

<h2>Bonus tip: Test more than just the video</h2>
<p>So far, I&#8217;ve provided some mistakes to avoid with YouTube video campaigns, so I want to finish off on a positive note with a proactive tip.</p>
<p>Ad testing is an important part of any <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/10/paid-media-strategy">paid media strategy</a> and YouTube ads are no exception. Your video creative should be the component you test the most in your video campaigns. But if you only have one video to use, there are other components of the video ad you could test.</p>
<p>In your In-stream ads, you could look at testing out a few different extension messages to see which one encourages more clicks:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-ad-variant-testing.png" alt="youtube ad variant testing" width="720" height="411" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59452" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-ad-variant-testing.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-ad-variant-testing-480x274.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>With your In-feed video ads, you could look at testing different thumbnails, headlines, or descriptions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-in-feed-video-ad-thumbnail-testing.png" alt="youtube in-feed video ad thumbnail options" width="720" height="453" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59453" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-in-feed-video-ad-thumbnail-testing.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/youtube-in-feed-video-ad-thumbnail-testing-480x302.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Then depending on your campaign’s goals, you can see which variants are improving view rates, improving watch times, increasing engagements, or possibly increasing traffic and conversions. I understand it can be difficult for many companies to get a lot of video creative (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/13/video-ad-tools">I have three tips on that here</a>). But even if you fall within that scenario, you still can (and should) test a few different ad variants to see how you can improve performance.</p>
<h2>Bottom line: Always read the fine print (and test!)</h2>
<p>There are many more mistakes to avoid I could go over, and hopefully we can get to those in a future post. The ones I included were the mistakes I run into the most when auditing a new account. Always read the fine print in the support sections to see how campaign targeting or campaign settings actually work for your video campaigns in Google Ads. So many times there are little nuances that make them work much differently than expected. Having the full grasp on how video campaigns work will not only save you money, but also improve your performance from the start.</p>
<ol>
<li>Your video ads will default to showing outside of YouTube</li>
<li>Video ad extensions don&#8217;t show up on TV devices</li>
<li>Google can ignore your managed placements</li>
<li>Not every Display network website plays video ads</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>Using keywords to target other brand names, products, or services is one of the easiest ways to go after competitors in Google Ads—but it&#8217;s not cheap.</span></p>
<p><span> For example, let&#8217;s pretend I have a client that is a CRM brand. If I am looking to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/09/competitor-keywords">target competitor keywords</a> on Google Search, let&#8217;s take a look at the prices I may have to pay for these keywords in the United States.</span></p>
<p>$7.17 all the way up to $69.61</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/competitor-targeting-competitor-keyword-prices.png" alt="competitor keyword research example" width="881" height="335" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56449" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/competitor-targeting-competitor-keyword-prices.png 881w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/competitor-targeting-competitor-keyword-prices-480x183.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 881px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The good news is, there are more options we have than just the Search Network.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="f77c776f-f128-4cda-b60d-a4cbd809e2a7" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>While Search will always have the deepest intent, there are some pretty specific targeting options we can use for other campaign types and other platforms that also have decent intent. Read on to learn nine of my favorite way to target competitor audiences without targeting their keywords.</article>
</div>
<h2>9 cost-effective ways to target competitor audiences</h2>
<p><span>I acknowledge these aren’t going to be apples to apples comparisons in audience targets. I also acknowledge the user intent for search ads is different than with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/02/reasons-to-advertise-on-social-media">social media ads,</a> but we can still get in front of a relevant audience that has shown interest in your competitors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Build custom audiences with competitor keywords</li>
<li>Build custom audiences with competitor URLs</li>
<li>Target YouTube ads on competitor videos</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Build custom audiences with competitor keywords</h3>
<p>As you may or may not know, custom intent and custom affinity audiences have been combined into one custom audience feature in Google Ads, which helps us to reach audiences more in line with our campaign’s goal type. It also helps us to run <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/26/competitive-ads">competitive ads.</a></p>
<h4>How it works</h4>
<p>This strategy sets your Video and Discovery campaigns to appear in front of users who have searched competitor terms.</p>
<h4>How to do it</h4>
<p>Go to Tools &amp; Settings &gt; Shared Library &gt; Audience Manager to create your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/19/google-custom-audiences">custom audience. </a></p>
<p>Choose the option to target “People who searched for any of these terms on Google.“</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="a038cbb3-70c9-452a-8833-dac292b556ce" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-target-competitor-audiences-people-who-searched-terms.png" width="720" height="251" alt="google ads custom audience setup- option to choose people who have searched competitor terms" typeof="foaf:Image" class="aligncenter" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>The “on Google” part of this is key, because it means you are essentially targeting people who searched for any in a list of terms on Google properties like YouTube and Google.com. You read that correctly. Here is the exact quote from Google.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Enter search terms your ideal customer is using on Google. Your ads will reach people who search for those and similar terms only on campaigns running on Google properties.  On other campaigns, the terms will be used as interests or purchase intentions.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>So now take your list of competitor terms and add them to your new Custom Audience. As an example, let’s say you sell laptops and Asus is one of your competitors. Terms you might add include: asus laptop reviews, asus laptop issues, asus i5 laptop, best asus gaming laptop, and so on.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="5d419d5a-f30c-4c35-a231-5bcc6c9820b9" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-target-competitor-audiences-google-custom-audience-search-terms-list.png" width="720" height="469" alt="example of google ads custom audience using competitor search terms" typeof="foaf:Image" class="aligncenter" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>If people have searched for these terms on Google and YouTube before, that is a much deeper intent than an awareness audience.</p>
<p>While custom audiences may not be as specific as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/06/12/bidding-on-competitor-brands">bidding on competitor brand names on Search</a>, we can still use them to get in front of a very relevant audience and <a href="/blog/ws/2021/04/23/influence-buyers-marketing-psychology">sway their decision-making</a> in your brand’s favor.</p>
<h4>Notes on this strategy</h4>
<p>What I do want to point out is that last sentence in the quote above.</p>
<p>“On other campaigns, the terms will be used as interests or purchase intentions.”</p>
<p>What this means is, this setting will apply to YouTube and Discovery campaigns because those are Google Properties. While you can use Custom Audiences for <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/22/how-display-impacts-search">Display campaigns</a>, Display placements are not Google properties.</p>
<p>Test them out for your Video and <a href="/blog/ws/2019/05/17/discovery-ads">Discovery campaigns</a> (Discovery now includes <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/16/gmail-ads-going-away">Gmail placements</a>) to get in front of your competitors’ audience in a different way.</p>

<h3>2. Create custom audiences with competitor URLs</h3>
<p>Besides keyword or search term targeting for your Custom Audiences, you can also enter in specific URLs. This was a strategy I loved using in the Custom Affinity days, but it’s still available in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/18/google-ads-custom-segments">Custom Audiences</a>.</p>
<h4>How it works</h4>
<p>This strategy takes a list of all of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/18/ppc-competitor-analysis">your competitors’</a> URLs and makes an audience off of those domains.</p>
<h4>How to do it</h4>
<p>So what you’ll do is create a new custom audience and choose the “Include people with the following interests or behaviors” option. Below that box, you’ll then see “Expand audience by also including:” where you can click on “People who browse types of websites.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="cb8e4646-970f-4b96-a4f0-3b57bcf612dc" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">

</article>
</div>
<p>You can then select “People who browse websites similar to” and you’ll be given another area where you can add in as many competitor web pages as you want.</p>
<p>Continuing on with my laptop seller example, some URLs I added to this list include www.dell.com/en-us, www.asus.com/us/, store.acer.com/en-us/laptops, and more.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="8a541059-5f25-4a63-80e3-c749f0140cd6" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-target-competitor-audiences-competitor-URLs.png" width="720" height="326" alt="google ads custom audience creation using competitor URLs" typeof="foaf:Image" class="aligncenter" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>While this is not as exact as historical search term targeting, it does focus on a specific user behavior if <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/why-is-it-important-companies-have-competitors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your competitors </a>have pretty similar websites. Use this strategy for a more top of funnel approach to make an introduction to users who could be interested in your brand’s products.</p>
<h4>Notes on this strategy</h4>
<p>It is important to note that this targeting works differently than adding search terms. We are not and cannot target users who actually visited the URLs you entered. You cannot do <a href="/blog/ws/2016/05/17/remarketing-audiences">remarketing</a> without having your tag on those URLs, and this is not <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/07/google-display-network-placements">placement targeting for the Display Network</a>.</p>
<p>Rather, this setting tells Google to target your ads at users who visit websites similar to the ones you enter.</p>
<h3>3. Place YouTube ads on competitor videos</h3>
<p>This third strategy (one of my favorites) does involve placement targeting—<a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/17/youtube-ad-placement-targeting">placement targeting for YouTube</a>.</p>
<h4>How it works</h4>
<p>This <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/10/paid-media-strategy">paid media strategy</a> puts you in front of your competitors’ audiences by advertising on their own YouTube videos. One of the best feelings I get in this industry is showing a client the placement report for a particular<a href="/blog/ws/2017/12/21/targeted-ad-groups"> ad group </a>and showing them what awareness, views, and conversions we’re getting from their competitors’ YouTube videos or <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<h4>How to do it</h4>
<p>To do this, head to your <a href="/blog/ws/2016/01/12/memorable-youtube-ads">YouTube ad</a> placement options.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="24fb06fa-31cc-437b-9fb2-e76d1d48120f" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube20placement20targeting20choose20placements.png" width="800" height="534" alt="youtube placement targeting choose placements" typeof="foaf:Image" class="aligncenter" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Continuing on with my laptop example, I typed in hewlett packard.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="4e263745-ad00-4d7c-a272-73ce95da7a6d" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-target-competitor-audiences-youtube-channel-placement.png" width="720" height="288" alt="example of youtube placement search for competitor name" typeof="foaf:Image" class="aligncenter" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>You can then target specific YouTube videos or target an entire channel if your competitor is showing up.</p>
<h4>Notes on this strategy</h4>
<p>If you do decide to run a managed placement ad group on YouTube, you should be aware of the fine print. If you’re targeting placements solely on YouTube or the Display Network, your ads will now be eligible to run on both. So still monitor where your ads appear in the placement reports to make sure your ads are staying on the competitor placements you wanted.</p>
<h3>4. YouTube search results</h3>
<p>In-feed video ads (formerly TrueView Discovery) were the first <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/17/youtube-ad-placement-targeting">YouTube placement</a> where advertisers could target just the YouTube search results pages with Google Ads video campaigns. This has changed slightly with the introduction of responsive video ads, but the setup is pretty much the same. We should always remember that YouTube is a massive search engine. It is actually the second largest search engine after Google.com. But you can place In-feed video ads at the top of the YouTube search results like this.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-competitor-audiences-youtube-display-ads.png" alt="targeting competitor audiences with paid media - youtube search results ad example" width="720" height="207" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57909" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-competitor-audiences-youtube-display-ads.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-competitor-audiences-youtube-display-ads-480x138.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The example above isn’t a video ad, but video ads can appear at the top of the results. Other CRM companies could appear when users are looking for Salesforce videos on YouTube, thus claiming the #1 video spot. This is easy to do. When setting up your video campaign in Google Ads, head to the Networks section. There you will have the option to target just the YouTube search results.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-competitor-audiences-youtube-search-results.png" alt="targeting competitor audiences with paid media - youtube search results setting" width="720" height="166" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57906" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-competitor-audiences-youtube-search-results.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-competitor-audiences-youtube-search-results-480x111.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Now you don’t have to always target just the YouTube search results, but it is an option. And when I target just the YouTube search results, this is the only time I use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/14/youtube-keyword-research">keyword targeting for video campaigns</a>. My volume will be much lower because I’m removing any audience-based targeting, but my results will be more specific.</p>
<p>I typically see much higher view rates and completion rates on YouTube results page campaigns because I am being very specific.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/26a0.png" alt="⚠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Caution! </strong>Just make sure you have a video that makes sense as a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/26/competitive-ads">competitive ad.</a> Remember, people go to YouTube to watch videos. And with In-feed videos, you are paying for every single view. Make a longer, engaging video that shows why you are the better option.</p>
<h3><span>5. Quora ads by topics or interests</span></h3>
<p><span>Quora is a question and answer site that offers a variety of ways to target its users. The most specific form of targeting with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/30/quora-promoted-answers">Quora ads</a> (but also the lowest volume) would be to target individual questions. If you only want your ad to show on a very specific question, you can do that.</span></p>
<p><span><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/competitor-targeting-question-targeting.png" alt="how to target competitors on social - quora question" width="720" height="269" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56405" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/competitor-targeting-question-targeting.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/competitor-targeting-question-targeting-480x179.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /> </span></p>
<p><span>If people are researching which CRM is the best, or in the example above what are the faults of certain CRMs, you can place your ad on that question to showcase why your product is the better option. But as I stated above, question targeting is not going to have a lot of volume, which is why I recommend targeting Topics or Interests first.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>Quora question targeting is not going to have a lot of volume, which is why I recommend targeting Topics or Interests first.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>All questions in Quora are categorized under Topics. If you target a Topic, your ad could appear on any question within that Topic, while a user is currently on the page. Interests use the same targeting options as Topics, the difference being that it will target people who have interacted with the questions or answers of a Topic at some point in the recent past. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/competitor-targeting-quora-topics.png" alt="how to target competitors on social - quora topics" width="708" height="360" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56403" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/competitor-targeting-quora-topics.png 708w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/competitor-targeting-quora-topics-480x244.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 708px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>In this case, I can find my competitors as Topics on Quora. What you can’t see in the image is that these five Topics have 200,000 to 300,000 weekly impressions. Pretty good volume. Now what is the recommended bid for these Topics?</span></p>
<p><span><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/competitor-targeting-quora-bids.png" alt="how to target competitors on social - quora bid" width="427" height="101" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56404" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/competitor-targeting-quora-bids.png 427w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/competitor-targeting-quora-bids-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px" /></span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>$0.24 &#8211; $1.28. Even at the high end of the bid range, the amount is far less than what we’d have to pay for those above keywords on Google. I am pretty sure you can find a few areas in your accounts where ad spend is being wasted and bring it over to Quora to test.</span></p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt;</strong>Use our <strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Free Google Ads Grader</a> </strong>or <strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-advertising?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FBGrader_FBGrader">Free Facebook Ads Grader</a></strong> to find wasted spend.</p>
<h3><span>6. LinkedIn Member Groups</span></h3>
<p><span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/05/linkedin-advertising">LinkedIn ads</a> have a reputation of being expensive, but that doesn’t always have to be the case. There are several targeting options that are less expensive than the popular Job Title or Company match targets. I love to use Member Groups to find users who are interested in my services, or in this case, my competitors’ services.</span></p>
<p>In our example for this post, some member groups I could target are those for Salesforce, Zoho, Pipedrive, Agile, and Zendesk:</p>
<p><span><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/competitor-targeting-linkedin-member-groups.png" alt="how to target competitors on social - linkedin groups" width="720" height="96" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56406" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/competitor-targeting-linkedin-member-groups.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/competitor-targeting-linkedin-member-groups-480x64.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /> </span></p>
<p><span>These were just some of the Member Groups I could target. But targeting users who like to participate in active discussions about a product could be a pretty relevant audience. I will admit if users are dedicated to a particular product, they might be harder to convince to switch, so it&#8217;s worthwhile to visit each group and see what people are discussing. If you’re noticing complaints or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points">pain points</a>, or see that you can offer features better than what everyone is talking about, you may want to target these groups. </span></p>
<p><span>Now what is the cost for the Member Groups I picked above?</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/competitor-targeting-linkedin-bid.png" alt="how to target competitors on social - linkedin bids" width="712" height="170" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56407" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/competitor-targeting-linkedin-bid.png 712w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/competitor-targeting-linkedin-bid-480x115.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 712px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>$12.65 &#8211; $27.87 with a recommendation of $17.24. <span>If I choose manual bidding, the lowest bid I can use is $4.45— much lower than Google Search. Even if I use the bid recommendations from similar advertisers, it’s lower than Google Search. Another avenue I may want to test if I’m not getting the performance I want from competitor Search campaigns.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Individuals in groups dedicated to product users will be hard to convert, so visit the group first to see if there are complaints or pain points you can capitalize on.</p></blockquote>
<h3><span>7. Twitter follower look-alikes</span></h3>
<p><span>I will be the first to admit this is not as direct of a targeting option as my other examples, but it can work. In <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/12/14/why-use-twitter-ads">Twitter ads</a>, you cannot target the followers of other accounts on Twitter, but what you can do is advertise to people who have similar behaviors as an account&#8217;s followers. How does Twitter determine a person fits within the look-alike? </span></p>
<p><span>Here&#8217;s what Twitter <a href="https://business.twitter.com/en/help/campaign-setup/campaign-targeting/interest-and-follower-targeting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">states</a>: </span><em><span>“We determine users similar to those who follow accounts based on a variety of signals, including what they Retweet, click on, Tweet, and more.” </span></em><span><a href="https://business.twitter.com/en/help/campaign-setup/campaign-targeting/interest-and-follower-targeting.html"><em></em></a></span></p>
<p><span>When creating your ad group, head down to Targeting Features. You should easily see the Follower look-alikes section. Start typing in each of your competitor’s Twitter handles and select each one. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/competitor-targeting-follower-lookalikes.png" alt="how to target competitors on social - follower lookalikes" width="550" height="352" class="aligncenter wp-image-56409" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/competitor-targeting-follower-lookalikes.png 550w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/competitor-targeting-follower-lookalikes-480x307.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 550px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Twitter is going to recommend targeting at least thirty accounts for follower look-alikes. Take that with a grain of salt. I recommend only choosing specific accounts that fit your target audience no matter how many that is. Now let’s look at the costs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/compeitor-targeting-twitter-bids.png" alt="how to target competitors on social - twitter bids" width="720" height="169" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56402" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/compeitor-targeting-twitter-bids.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/compeitor-targeting-twitter-bids-480x113.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>$0.70 &#8211; $3.80. This ad group didn&#8217;t have any additional layers added to the targeting. We can see the bid suggestions are, once again, much lower than Google. While the targeting option is definitely not as relevant as keyword targets, you still can use your competitors’ brand recognition to try and reach a relevant audience.</p>
<blockquote><p>Twitter recommends targeting at least thirty accounts for follower look-alikes, but I recommend only choosing specific accounts that fit your target audience no matter how many that is.</p></blockquote>
<h3>8. Reddit Communities</h3>
<p>Despite not being one of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">top social media marketing platforms</a>, Reddit is one of the most visited websites in the world. So odds are at least some of your target audience visits the channel. And of course, Reddit has an advertising platform. While most of the basic targeting options are pretty generic (and not where I recommend starting unless you have a big budget), there is one targeting area for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/24/reddit-advertising">Reddit advertising</a> I always look at first. That is going to be the option named “Communities.”</p>
<p>Communities are essentially Subreddits, which are categories of specific groups on the Reddit platform that can often be targeted with ads. So take a little bit of time and see if your competitors show up as options.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-competitor-audiences-reddit-community-example.png" alt="targeting competitor audiences with paid media - reddit communities" width="720" height="567" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57907" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-competitor-audiences-reddit-community-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-competitor-audiences-reddit-community-example-480x378.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In the image above, I chose an industry where I know some of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/competitive-analysis">competitor names</a> would be bigger brand names. This is because not every Subreddit is available as a Community targeting option. So this option may only be for brands where the competitors are bigger brands or the desired target audience may be similar to people interested in these brands.</p>
<p>So continuing on with my example of running ads for a CRM platform, I might target Communities for Salesforce, Zoho, HubSpot, and Zendesk.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-competitor-audiences-reddit-communities.png" alt="targeting competitor audiences with paid media - reddit ads community targeting settings" width="720" height="144" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57908" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-competitor-audiences-reddit-communities.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-competitor-audiences-reddit-communities-480x96.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/26a0.png" alt="⚠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Caution!</strong> Reddit is a different beast. Many people on Reddit do not like to be advertised to, and they will let you know publicly. That is why it is important to research each Community you are targeting.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do people engage in that Community?</li>
<li>What is the tone in the Community?</li>
<li>Is it more educational or is it more for fun?</li>
</ul>
<p>You will want to make sure your ads reflect that tone. This is especially important for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/01/facebook-competitive-advertising">competitor targeting</a> because you may be showing ads to users who are dedicated to your competitors.</p>
<h3>9. Almost everywhere (with retargeting)</h3>
<p>I could have sworn I included this in my previous posts about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/16/competitive-advertising">competitive advertising strategies</a>, but I didn’t. Shame on me because this is one of the easiest ways to stay in front of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/competitive-insights">competition’s</a> audience. A vast majority of paid media platforms offer URL-based audiences to use for retargeting. Should we list some of them? Okay here goes…</p>
<ul>
<li>Google (Search, Display, Discovery, YouTube)</li>
<li>Facebook/Instagram (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/04/facebook-retargeting">Facebook retargeting tactics here</a>.)</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Microsoft (Search, Audience Ads)</li>
<li>LinkedIn</li>
<li>Quora</li>
<li>Reddit</li>
<li>Pinterest</li>
<li>Snapchat</li>
<li>TikTok</li>
<li>Taboola</li>
<li>Outbrain</li>
<li>Yahoo Native</li>
<li>So…many…more….</li>
</ul>
<p>And retargeting is such an easy way to get in front of users after they have already visited your site from a competitor campaign. To get started, head to these posts:</p>

</ul>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/26a0.png" alt="⚠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Caution! </strong>Whether you’re targeting via Search or any other means, you need to add UTM parameters to your ad URLs. You can use whatever naming conventions you want as long as you can tell which visits came from your competitor-targeted campaigns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-competitor-audiences-URL-setup.png" alt="targeting competitor audiences with paid media - URL campaign creation" width="720" height="650" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57911" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-competitor-audiences-URL-setup.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-competitor-audiences-URL-setup-480x433.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The image above is an example from Google’s <a href="https://ga-dev-tools.web.app/campaign-url-builder/">Campaign URL Builder</a>. For this fake Quora Ads campaign, I am making sure I have “competitor” in my campaign name. That way any visit from this competitor campaign will be recorded, and I will repeat this process for every competitor campaign I have running across all of the channels in my <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/10/paid-media-strategy">paid media strategy</a>.</p>
<p>I try to keep the competitor naming conventions consistent across all channels for a very specific reason. I want to have the ability to combine all competitor campaign visits into one audience. This will help me have a larger audience to use for my retargeting campaigns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-competitor-audiences-competitors.png" alt="targeting competitor audiences with paid media - competitors selection" width="720" height="171" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57910" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-competitor-audiences-competitors.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/target-competitor-audiences-competitors-480x114.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you need to break out the competitor campaign audiences based upon the channel or what the initial ad experience was, you can do that depending on what UTM parameters you used. Retargeting to users this way can be much more affordable than continuing to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/06/12/bidding-on-competitor-brands">bid on expensive competitor keywords</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Just make sure second-time interaction fits the proper user flow after they have interacted with your brand the first time.</p>
<h2>Target your competitors&#8217; audiences without breaking the bank</h2>
<p><span>Yes, users typing in keywords on a search engine like Google or Bing will have a deeper intent, but people visit many more websites than search engines. Paid social platforms can offer effective and much more affordable options when trying to use competitors in your targeting. As I mentioned earlier in the post, I am pretty sure every account can find areas to pause or clean up. Use this new ad spend to test out different <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/10/paid-media-strategy">paid media strategies</a> in other channels. And read how to level up your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/competitors-ads">competitor spy game</a> here. The results may surprise you.</span></p>

<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>Couldn&#8217;t resist.</em></p>
<p>And that&#8217;s where lead qualification comes in. In this post, I&#8217;m going to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>What lead qualification is and why it&#8217;s important.</li>
<li>How to identify your lead qualification parameters.</li>
<li>Four lead qualification strategies I use with my clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read on to learn how to get leads that will convert into customers, and customers that will stay with you longer.</p>
<h2>What is lead qualification?</h2>
<p>Lead qualifications about making sure the leads you attract through your ads and other marketing assets are those who are most likely to drive your business goals. Qualified traffic to your website is more likely to take action there, and qualified leads are most likely to become customers. Lead qualification is essential for an effective <a href="/blog/ws/2021/06/25/optimize-lead-generation-process">lead generation process.</a></p>
<h3>MQLs vs SQLs</h3>
<p>In the B2B world, you may have heard of marketing qualified leads (MQLs) and sales qualified leads (SQLs). MQLs are those who have shown interest in your product or service, but are probably not yet ready to buy—thereby making them qualified for, well, more marketing—namely, <a href="/blog/ws/2016/08/30/lead-nurturing-campaign-emails">nurturing campaigns</a> to move them down the funnel where they can <a href="/blog/ws/2017/04/04/nurture-marketing">convert from prospects to customers</a>.</p>
<p>SQLs are those who have shown interest in your product or service and are very likely to buy.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="1ab4044e-cf62-4189-93f2-86c6ad1a338a" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">

</article>
</div>
<p>Some leads come in as SQLs, while others start as MQLs, and with effective <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-lead-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lead management</a> and nurturing, become SQLs.</p>
<h2>Why is lead qualification important?</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s obvious that you want qualified leads coming in from your marketing efforts—you want to <a href="/blog/ws/2016/07/12/get-more-customers">get more customers</a>. But there&#8217;s a financial side to it too. If you&#8217;re running paid ads and you have a high click-through rate, that means you have an appealing offer and/or great copywriting. But is it appealing to your <em>most likely customers</em>?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re pulling in tons of clicks, you may be <a href="/blog/ws/2021/08/17/lower-cost-per-click">paying less per click</a>, but if you&#8217;re not getting conversions, what&#8217;s the good in that? You&#8217;re not really saving money, you&#8217;re wasting spend on unqualified traffic.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader"><strong><em>Speaking of wasted spend, find where yours is with our free Google Ads Performance Grader!</em></strong></a></p>
<p>So while click-through rate and cost per click are important, your conversion rates are at the core of your ROI, and at the core of conversions is lead qualification.</p>
<h2>How to identify your lead qualification parameters</h2>
<p>Knowing your ideal customers and your <a href="/blog/ws/2014/09/18/beginners-guide-to-target-markets">target audience</a> is essential for knowing what lead qualification looks like for your business. There are also a number of <a href="https://www.uplead.com/lead-qualification/">lead qualification formulas</a> that could apply to your business, but the most basic one is BANT:</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="fe9aa163-dd09-4821-87e1-a60cbff15520" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/lead-qualification-bant.png" width="720" height="351" alt="lead qualification BANT formula" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/what-is-BANT-and-how-can-it-streamline-lead-qualification" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget: </strong>Can the prospect afford your products/services</li>
<li><strong>Authority:</strong> Are they the ultimate decision-maker for the purchase?</li>
<li><strong>Need: </strong>What is the need they&#8217;re looking to alleviate? Does it align with those of your long-time customers?</li>
<li><strong>Urgency: </strong>How urgent do they need this need met?</li>
</ul>
<p>Your<a href="/blog/ws/2016/08/02/landing-page-copywriting"> landing page copy</a> and the information you request in your forms will help to qualify your leads, but that doesn&#8217;t solve for the issue of paying for unqualified clicks in the first place. In this next section, we&#8217;ll cover four ways to qualify your <em>clicks.</em></p>
<h2>Lead qualification strategies</h2>
<p>These strategies enable you to <a href="/blog/ws/2019/04/08/lead-quality">improve your PPC lead quality</a> before the user even gets to your landing page.</p>
<h3>1. Be specific in your ad copy</h3>
<p>The easiest way to tell people they are not the customer you are looking for is to straight up tell them. It makes complete sense to use certain wording in your ads to and have unqualified users not click on your ad. I know in the PPC world it is tough to see a lower click-through rate. But click-through rates mean nothing if those leads are never going to convert into customers.</p>
<p>For example, I had a client that had a CRM product for startups and small businesses. While of course they targeted keywords like “small business crm,” they also targeted many generic CRM keywords that don’t mention “small business.” In these ad groups, we made sure we <a href="/blog/ws/2011/06/23/how-to-qualify-ppc-leads">pre-qualified our leads</a> with ad copy speaking just to small business owners.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="431234fa-c98d-4a18-b55c-c4175765d79e" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/lead-qualification-pre-qualifying-google-ad-copy.png" width="500" height="319" alt="lead qualification strategy: prequalifying google ad headline" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>With qualifying ad copy, you may be able to target broader keywords without wasting too much spend on unqualified clicks. </em></p>
<p>We were letting searchers know if they worked for a company with more than 50 people, our CRM wasn’t right for them. Yes, our CTR in those ad groups decreased. But our lead quality increased. And since our CTR decreased, so did our costs. With lower costs and a higher conversion rate, our Cost/Conv. numbers noticeably went down. That is the most important metric to us. And when the quality gets better with a lower Cost/Conv, the decrease in CTR didn’t hurt us at all.</p>
<p>And if you were confused by all that metric speak, check out our <a href="/blog/ws/2021/10/19/ppc-metrics">Ultimate Guide to PPC Metrics</a> and it will all make sense!</p>
<h3>2. Use price extensions</h3>
<p>The same mentality can be applied to your <a href="/blog/ws/2011/09/15/adwords-ad-extensions-guide">ad extensions for paid search</a>. If you have a more expensive product, you probably only want to reach users who have money. Call out the price or the status of your product in your ad extensions.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="9e5c381d-1db1-4b7a-92b8-6e5a36e06c3b" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/lead-qualification-price-ad-extension.png" width="500" height="329" alt="lead qualification strategy: price extensions" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Good ‘ole sticker shock. If a user sees higher prices, and the user doesn’t have money, they’re most likely not going to click on the ad. I am now saving my <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/09/14/adwords-budget-guide">ad budget </a>for the right user later on. Not everything needs to be about price either. Maybe you adjust your value messages based on the right user. Make everything fit for the perfect audience you want to reach; not everyone who may be interested in your product.</p>
<h3>3. Optimize lead forms for quality, not volume</h3>
<p>Both Google and Facebook have lead form type settings for their lead forms. This gives advertisers the option to optimize either for more leads or more <em>qualified</em> leads. Of course, the channels’ default selection will be for more volume. They will encourage you to get more leads which will make your <a href="/blog/ws/2021/09/07/ppc-reporting">PPC reporting look great</a>. But if you have tested lead forms in these two channels and received junk leads, consider switching your optimization settings to focus on higher quality.</p>

<p>You can see Google tries to scare us a bit. It warns that you may get fewer leads for a <a href="/blog/ws/2019/04/18/facebook-ads-cost-per-lead">higher cost per lead</a> (which is true). But I am always willing to pay more for leads that are more qualified and are easier for my clients’ sales teams to close. Feel free to create two different forms, one focusing on volume while the other on quality, to see which ones actually drive a more qualified user.</p>
<h3>4. Add more questions in your lead forms</h3>
<p>Many lead forms on Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Quora, etc. start off asking users for the bare minimum like name and phone number. In most cases, the fields are auto-populated based on the user’s profile information. This can make the form easy for someone to fill out and submit, but because it is so easy, you may not be pre-qualifying users.</p>
<p>The good news is, most of the channels that offer lead forms allow advertisers to ask more questions or customize questions. Here are some examples:</p>
<h4><strong>LinkedIn lead form custom questions</strong></h4>
<p>You can create custom questions in your <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/05/linkedin-advertising">LinkedIn advertising</a> lead forms to ask users for more information. This will make them work a little more, but if they&#8217;re willing to spend a little extra time giving you more information, they could be more interested in your product. Also, you may ask questions that scare away unqualified users and that’s okay too.</p>

</article>
</div>
<h4><strong>Facebook lead ad custom questions</strong></h4>
<p>Just like LinkedIn, you can create custom questions for <a href="/blog/ws/2019/01/24/facebook-lead-ad-examples">Facebook lead ad forms</a>. You can have the user type in a response, choose from a list of options, or even create a conditional answer set based upon an uploaded CSV.</p>

</article>
</div>
<h4><strong>Google lead ad additional questions</strong></h4>
<p>Google has additional questions too, but you cannot customize them. Instead, you have a list of question options broken out by specific industries or categories. You can add multiple qualifying questions to your lead forms to get more information form your users. Many of them are multiple choice, so if a user doesn’t see the option that describes them in their questions, they most likely will not fill out the form.</p>

<h2>5. Run Google Local Services Ads</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re a service-based business, this is a great lead qualification strategy. In short, you create and manage ads right from your Google Business Profile and Google makes sure your ads only show for customers in your service area.</p>
</article>
<p>Furthermore, once a user clicks on your ad, Google prompts them to confirm the job they’re looking for as well as their service area. If you fit the job and serve that area, you’ll be matched to the searcher and they’ll be able to review your qualification, ratings, and Google reviews before calling you.</p>
<p>If you’re not a good fit for their job or you don’t serve their region, then Google will connect them to a more appropriate Local Service Ad.</p>

<h2>Get more out of your budget with lead qualification</h2>
<p>Internal data from your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/11/09/crm-for-small-business">CRM</a> will always help you make better optimization decisions to hone in on the right user. But whether you have CRM information or not, you can still put in some effort with your ad copy and lead form settings to try and qualify the user before they even visit your web site. You may see less traffic and less conversions. But if you are qualifying the right users, you will hopefully see better close rates and less churn. To recap, here are the strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use pre-qualifying ad copy.</li>
<li>Add price extensions to your Search ads.</li>
<li>Optimize lead forms for quality, not volume.</li>
<li>Add more or custom questions to your lead forms.</li>
<li>Run Google Local Services Ads</li>
</ol>

<p>Several times, I have had clients ask how they can see cost information for non-Google channels in Google Analytics. They do not want to go into each paid media channel to review the data. And even if I create a Google Data Studio dashboard compiling all of the data, certain clients are just used to Google Analytics. So what do I do?</p>

<p>I import the cost data into Google Analytics via spreadsheet. While the process is fairly manual (I’ll admit the manual way is the only way I know how to do it), it is fairly easy and doesn’t take long.</p>
<p>Let’s dive in so you can make ROAS reporting for all of your paid channels in Google Analytics a lot easier.</p>
<h2>Why import cost data into Google Analytics?</h2>
<p>This reporting strategy spares you from having to go into each of your channels and report on ad performance separately. With everything in one place, you can save time and get a holistic view of your overall PPC performance.</p>
<p>You can view cost data  such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost</li>
<li>CPC</li>
<li>CTR</li>
<li>ROAS</li>
</ul>
<p>from channels like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>LinkedIn</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Pinterest</li>
<li>Bing</li>
<li>Reddit</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to compare your performance to benchmarks, theses resources might help:</p>

</ul>
<h2>What information can you upload to Google Analytics?</h2>
<p>This seems like a silly question, but I am talking about more than just cost information from each channel. That is because we need to attribute that cost to a data point when uploading our spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Unfortunately you cannot upload anything you want from other channels into Google Analytics. There is only a specific number of data sets. Let’s break them down.</p>
<h3>Required information</h3>
<p>There are three pieces of information you must include when uploading your information. They are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Date</li>
<li>Source</li>
<li>Medium</li>
</ul>
<h3>Must include one</h3>
<p>The obvious selection is Cost, but you still need only include one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost</li>
<li>Impressions</li>
<li>Clicks</li>
</ul>
<h3>Optional information</h3>
<p>Any of the following data may be included when uploading your information, but they are not mandatory. There are more options that I’m going to list, but some options available in Google Analytics only apply to Google Ads accounts. Here are some of the optional data sets you can include if you want to implement other paid media channel information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Referral Path</li>
<li>Ad Content</li>
<li>Campaign</li>
<li>Final URL</li>
<li>Keyword</li>
<li>Search Query</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to create your CSV for the cost data import</h2>
<p>When creating your spreadsheet (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cu-1BzKOrp8KvIJSwruZi7vq1weafuBXFW-vtzitxyg/edit?usp=sharing">you can reference this sheet as an example</a>), each of the data points mentioned in the previous section must be in their own column.</p>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">This example I provide is pulling LinkedIn information for one of my clients (campaign names changed) for June 2021.</span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><strong>Column header format</strong></p>
<p>And when making our column headers, we can’t just add the words “Campaign” or “Medium.” We have to make sure our headers are formatted properly. If you do not do this, your upload will be rejected.</p>
<p>So instead of having Date as your column header, you need to format it as <em>ga:date</em>. Instead of Medium as your column header, you need to format it as <em>ga:medium</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Date format</strong></p>
<p>The next major formatting rule is for the Date. You need to have your Date formatted as YYYYMMDD. Any other date variation will not be accepted and your upload will be disapproved. And because the format is YYYYMMDD, this means any date information you pull needs to be at the day level.</p>
<p><strong>File name</strong></p>
<p>Last, if you are importing campaign names, I recommend that you make sure the names in your file uploads match any campaign names that you might manually tag in your URLs. If you don’t do this, you could have duplicate campaigns showing up in Google Analytics and the data may be split between the same campaigns with different names.</p>
<p>When you are in Google Analytics selecting your columns, you will see the schema ID as you see in the image below.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>Now that we have this in place, let’s go to Google Analytics and upload the data.</p>

<h2>How to import cost data to Google Analytics</h2>
<p><strong>Select data import from the property column</strong></p>
<p>When you are in Google Analytics, go to your Admin section. Then click on the “Data Import” link which will be at the very bottom of your Property column.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Name your data set</strong></p>
<p>After you click “Continue,” you will need to name your data set and select the Google Analytics views the data set should be applied to. Then I’m going to select the data set schema options that I laid out in my spreadsheet example. Notice how the IDs match my column headers</p>

<p><strong>Upload your CSV file</strong></p>

</div>
<p>Then upload your CSV file. I personally have always used the CSV MS-DOS file type since it has never caused any issues.</p>
<p>After you upload your file, you will get a status notification whether the file was accepted (Completed) or not (Failed). I purposely uploaded my file a few times with incorrect data to show you what you may see.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p><strong>Correct any mistakes</strong></p>
<p>If your upload Status comes up as Failed, you can click on the Failed link to get information on exactly what needs to be fixed. Here’s one example when I used incorrect column headers.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>You can see how easy it is to find your errors and correct the mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>Refresh as needed</strong></p>
<p>Once you have a Completed upload, you are all set. If you ever need to refresh a data set because, for example, you uploaded a larger date range. You can always go back to “Manage uploads” to delete older files and/or upload new ones.</p>
<h2>Your cost data is now visible in Google Analytics</h2>
<p>To view your cost data in Google Analytics, go to Acquisition &gt; Campaigns &gt; Cost Analysis.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="b618156e-7604-428a-a85f-317880980fec" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">

</article>
</div>
<p>It can take a few hours to have your data start showing up in Google Analytics. But now you can create a custom report to start seeing cost data from your other paid media channels in Google Analytics.</p>
<h2>How to customize your cost analysis report</h2>
<p>In the above example, we&#8217;re sorting by Source/Medium and can see Cost, CTR, and CPC data. But you can also add a secondary dimension to view by campaign, ad content, keyword. And you can add additional metrics such as ROAS, transactions, revenue, RPC (revenue per click), and more.</p>
<p>To do this, hit Edit in the upper right corner of your report. Here, you can add metrics and adjust your dimension drilldowns.</p>

<h2><strong>Is it possible to automate the cost data import process?</strong></h2>
<p>Yes. There are several popular tools on the market that can automate the process of importing ad cost data on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Thanks to such tools, you don’t need to go into each advertising account and manually export ad cost data for the selected period, then prepare a CSV file in the format required for import into Google Analytics.</p>
<p>You simply connect your Google Analytics account, select the ad platforms you use, and the system automatically imports your ad cost data on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Examples of such tools (ours included):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://segmentstream.com/google-analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SegmentStream</a></li>
<li><a href="https://supermetrics.com/product/supermetrics-uploader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supermetrics GA Uploader</a></li>
<li><a href="https://funnel.io/google-analytics-cost-data-upload" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Funnel.io</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And as I mentioned above, you can also create a dashboard with the same information in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/18/how-to-use-google-data-studio">Data Studio</a>.</p>
<h2>View your ad performance across multiple networks in Google Analytics</h2>
<p>As you can see there are a few steps you have to take to get this information into Google Analytics, but these tasks do not take long to complete.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="72133709-b8bb-4fec-961f-79136c072365" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">

<p>Thanks to Apple’s iOS 14 updates, Facebook advertisers who use events for conversion optimization now have to use the new Aggregated Event Measurement. And the kicker is that you’re now limited to only eight events per domain.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="a7817b18-9187-4108-9385-edc7c872656d" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">

</article>
</div>
<p>Going from unlimited to only eight events really shakes things up, because conversion events can be used for more than just bottom-funnel campaigns. I work in accounts that have had events created for link clicks, video plays, specific page views—all on top of our deeper-funnel events.</p>
<p>So how can we work around the event quantity limitations? Let me show you some ways my accounts have changed to try and keep event performance on par with the previous event setup.</p>
<h2>3 ways to deal with Facebook&#8217;s Aggregated Event Measurement</h2>
<p>The below four steps will help you to make the best of your eight conversion events to <a href="/blog/ws/2021/06/03/keep-facebook-ads-working-iOS14">keep your Facebook ads performing well in OS 14</a>.</p>
<h3>1. Start with a good ‘ole spring cleaning</h3>
<p>Let me get the easiest one out of the way. If you have a bunch of unused events, why even bring them over? Save yourself some time and don’t even bring over any events you have not used in a long time. You can easily see this by checking the original pixel events.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="315480df-650d-46f4-a6ec-c75a3f132817" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/facebook-aggregated-event-measurement-inactive-events.png" width="300" height="178" alt="facebook ads inactive events" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>In the example above, we can see a list of events that have been set up but have not received any activity in a while. It makes no sense to worry about creating the new Aggregated Events for these actions if they are not even working or are not being used.</p>
<p>Even if you find current events that are working, see if they are being used in any active ad sets. You can easily see which events are being used when looking at either your Results or Optimization Events columns in Facebook.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="1ea64b47-0b55-4242-a106-4eb2e6848dc2" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/facebook-aggregated-event-measurement-results-column.jpeg" width="700" height="396" alt="results column in facebook ads to identify events to remove" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://funnelinsiders.com/blog/how-to-setup-facebook-ads-columns-a-facebook-ads-tutorial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>Any event not showing up in these columns can easily be skipped or removed from your new Aggregated Events Measurement setup.</p>
<h3>2. Use custom conversions to combine similar events</h3>
<p>One <a href="/blog/ws/2021/08/02/ppc-strategies">creative strategy</a> I have used when running out of event spaces is to group similar events together. One of my clients has a variety of guides we are promoting for the first touchpoint, broken out by industry. Originally, we had a conversion event created for each download. But these <a href="/blog/ws/2019/02/21/facebook-funnel">top-of-funnel</a> events alone would take up all of our eight event spaces.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="22845935-f59c-40cf-916f-eefe18c3e326" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/facebook-aggregated-event-measurement-form-completions-combined_0.png" width="450" height="65" alt="facebook ads form completions combined custom conversion event" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>In this particular case, each user who downloaded one of the industry guides was seeing the same <a href="/blog/ws/2021/06/24/design-facebook-ads-free">ad creative</a> in the next step of the funnel. This made it an easy decision to just create one custom conversion for all of the top-funnel downloads and use that as our main conversion action—even if our ad sets were segmented out by a specific audience.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="cbe68d24-8e4a-4a81-b4a7-f0da8928dd4e" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/facebook-aggregated-event-measurement-custom-conversion-1.png" width="500" height="471" alt="facebook ads custom conversion tab for aggregated event measurement" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Here are some ways you can combine event actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>All content events into one (guide views, blog views, video views, etc.)</li>
<li>Specific events in different levels of the funnel (top, mid, bottom)</li>
<li>All events for seasonal actions together (you can switch out your eight events if needed).</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, when you are managing your Aggregated Events, you can choose a custom conversion action as one of your events. So in this case, your custom conversion already combined a few actions together. This way you only have to create one Aggregated Event instead of trying to figure out what to do with several of them with limited slots.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you&#8217;d rather not deal with the headache of conversion events, you can always try out these <a href="/blog/ws/2021/07/26/generate-leads-facebook-ads-ios14">two strategies to generate leads on Facebook without traffic or conversion campaigns</a>.</p>
<h3>3. Continue using events to build audiences</h3>
<p>While we only receive eight spots for conversion tracking and optimization with Aggregated Events, we can still set up as many events as we want. For any event that does not make your top eight for Aggregated Measurement, you can still create audiences to use for ad set targeting.</p>
<p>When creating a <a href="/blog/ws/2016/01/27/facebook-custom-audiences">Facebook custom audience</a>, click on the Events dropdown to view your source options. Then choose one of your eligible events from the Pixel to use as your audience source.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="9b99960c-7f61-4140-b18c-98771a928184" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/facebook-aggregated-event-measurement-custom-audience.png" width="500" height="651" alt="facebook ads website custom audience setup tab" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>You can then start creating <a href="/blog/ws/2018/09/04/facebook-retargeting">retargeting ad sets</a> based upon these specific event actions to try and get the user to the next step or final conversion action.</p>
<p>Using a previous example, we can create an audience of users who downloaded a specific industry guide to <a href="/blog/ws/2015/11/16/facebook-remarketing">retarget</a> them with the next step in the funnel. Then we would use the new combined custom conversion as our Aggregated Event for conversion optimization.</p>
<h2>Track and target effectively with Facebook Aggregated Event Measurement</h2>
<p>With Facebook Aggregated Event measurement, you can still set up as many events as you want. But the idea here is to combine several custom conversions together into one aggregated conversion event. Or, to use those events to build full-funnel campaigns.</p>
<p>We all would prefer the way things were with standard pixel events, but those days are gone. The sooner we find new strategies to cope with the <a href="/blog/ws/2021/01/20/ios-14-update-facebook-ads">iOS 14 changes</a>, the better off your account performance will be.</p>
<p>I will be the first to admit not every strategy will work for every account. We’ve had to play around with a few different setups to find new ways to match pre-iOS 14 performance. But hopefully you can test out some of these strategies if you’re looking for ways to get your old campaign setups back in place.</p>

<p>Google Ads already has dedicated columns you can use to review the performance of your video campaigns. While these built-in columns are always helpful, sometimes you just need more information. This is where YouTube Studio can be extremely helpful. YouTube Studio’s analytics can provide a ton of data on how organic and paid viewers interact with your YouTube videos.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="6f4a3baf-b67d-404c-a7d1-00d0071734b7" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>There are so many reports in this tool we do not get within Google Ads. So whenever I am working on an account running Google Ads video campaigns, I require my clients to grant me access to their Channel Analytics so I can get more information to make better optimization decisions. In this post, I am going to cover just four of the reports I look at the most:</p>
<ol>
<li>Device type</li>
<li>External sources</li>
<li>Key moments</li>
<li>Suggested videos</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;ll show you how to pull the reports as well as how you can use them to improve your video ad performance.</p>
<h2>1. Use the &#8220;Device type&#8221; report to avoid misleading data</h2>
<p>Right away you may be thinking, “We can already get device information in Google Ads. This is not anything new.” While that is true, YouTube Studio Channel Analytics can tell a bigger picture. Here is one view of the initial data we get on the Device type tab.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="02c06f9a-cce9-4866-8b99-8cab328d3090" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/youtube-channel-analytics-device-type-1.png" alt="device type report in youtube studio channel analytics" width="1096" height="319" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>When looking at the default three columns displayed, the Computers and Mobile phone categories get the majority of the watch time. TV and Game consoles, however, are getting a much higher Average view duration. More watch time could mean better engagement, so you may feel inclined to push those devices more.</p>
<p><strong>But this actually isn&#8217;t the right move. </strong>Click on the blue and white “plus” button to add &#8220;Card clicks,&#8221; and &#8220;Average percentage viewed.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="d4b4854a-4f3d-4931-b7b0-b61ebbe726b0" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/youtube-channel-analytics-device-type-card-clicks-1.png" alt="extended device type report in youtube studio channel analytics" width="936" height="218" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Now we can see a different story. While Average view duration is longer for TV and Game console, these devices have zero clicks. This is because <strong>TV and Game console devices will not show your cards</strong>. If you are running a TrueView discovery campaign, you&#8217;ll be paying for those <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/05/14/how-to-get-more-views-on-youtube">video views</a> even though they&#8217;re not converting. Unless you&#8217;re also striving for awareness or video engagement, the <a href="/blog/ws/2020/12/03/underrated-youtube-metrics">metrics</a> in this view suggests that you only run your campaigns on Computer or Mobile phones.</p>
<h2>2. Use the &#8220;External sources&#8221; report to create Custom Audiences</h2>
<p>In the Traffic Sources report, you can drill down further to look at where your video traffic came from. The first one I like to check out is External sources. These referral sources are going to be placements outside of YouTube. Here is one example.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="b155e00b-d146-493f-851b-0cb8b4de45cb" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/youtube-channel-analytics-external-sources_0-1.png" alt="external sources report in youtube channel analytics" width="1096" height="1059" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>We see common sources like Facebook and LinkedIn. The blurred-out sources are actual domains, concealed for client confidentiality. If other websites or blogs are sharing your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/03/video-marketing-ideas">video content</a> (easier when you allow people to embed your videos), we can see where the video was shared. If you have a large enough list of referral sources, you can use this list in a variety of ways.</p>
<ol>
<li>Take the list of External sources and see if you can use them as managed <a href="/blog/ws/2019/02/13/youtube-ad-placements">placement</a> targeting options in your Display campaigns.</li>
<li>Use the list of External sources in a <a href="/blog/ws/2021/04/19/google-custom-audiences">Custom Audience </a>for a variety of Display, Video, or Discovery campaigns.</li>
<li>Admittingly not as common, but answer Quora questions using your channel’s videos embedded in the answers. You can then start building video user audiences from certain videos to use for future <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/17/remarketing-audiences">remarketing</a> campaigns from a very reliable source.</li>
</ol>
<h2>3. Use the &#8220;Key moments&#8221; report to identify the best video for your campaign</h2>
<p>This area I use primarily for <a href="/blog/ws/2017/03/29/youtube-trueview-ads">TrueView</a> discovery campaigns which have become my favorite YouTube campaign format for many reasons. With a TrueView discovery campaign, you are sending users to the video watch page. In my opinion, if I am paying for that view every time, I want to make sure the user engages with the video as long as possible. With that in mind, I frequently rely on the Key Moments report to either research the best video or find out how to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/14/facebook-video-ad">improve my video ads</a> for TrueView discovery.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="fbe525f3-1139-4bd9-836d-a06ebe2b8935" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/youtube-channel-analytics-key-moments-1.png" alt="key moments report in youtube studio channel analytics" width="936" height="418" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Key Moments will reveal particularly important segments in your video based on viewer behavior like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous Segments where the majority of viewers don’t drop off</li>
<li>Segments with spikes in audience retention</li>
<li>Segments with dips in audience retention.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you review these numbers by each video, you’ll get a good understanding of what moments in the video may need improvement. This can also help you plan how to structure future videos so you’re getting the most for your money if you decide to promote them with TrueView discovery.</p>
<h2>4. Use the &#8220;Suggested videos&#8221; report for new placement ideas</h2>
<p>One of my favorite views in YouTube Studio’s Channel Analytics is the Suggested videos report. This report is also under Traffic Sources. Then click on the Suggested Videos source. Essentially what this report will show you is videos from other channels that are sending traffic to your own videos on your YouTube channel. Here is an example of what I mean using data from the channel I run with fellow WordStream writer, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/michelle-morgan-3867" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michelle Morgan</a>.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0964d627-7275-444b-a84e-afe201a7ddd8" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/youtube-channel-analytics-suggested-videos-report-1.png" alt="suggested videos report in youtube studio channel analytics" width="936" height="604" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>The video titles you see in the image above are not our videos. Our organic videos appeared as recommended options on the video titles we see in this report. So now we can ask the question, &#8220;How can this help our campaigns in Google Ads?”</p>
<p>Depending on which column is important to you, you can start gathering a list of new placement ideas to test for your video campaigns. If there are videos from other channels consistently sending traffic that have longer watch times or higher view duration averages, consider targeting those specific videos or the entire channel with ads.</p>
<p>Also remember you can show <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/13/youtube-ad-placements">Display ads on YouTube videos as well</a>. Even if you do not have the video creative to run YouTube campaigns, you can still try to place your <a href="/blog/ws/2019/05/23/google-display-ads">Display Ads</a> on any top-performing video placements or channels. Give the Suggested videos report a shot. You could find a great new source for building awareness to an audience already proven to be interested in your content.</p>
<h2>Use these YouTube Studio reports to further improve your video ad campaigns</h2>
<p>The columns we get in Google Ads are still valuable and still important, but YouTube Studio provides a deeper layer. It is pretty easy to go down the data rabbit hole in the Channel Analytics, but hopefully this post gave you some ideas to consider for your own account. Try and see the larger picture of what is actually working (or not working) from your video campaigns to make a more informed decision on how your video campaigns should be optimized.</p>

The details about what is changing can be found in the links above, and the ultimate impact is a bit of a wait-and-see game, but one thing we do know is that <strong>we will lose targeting options and third-party data points we have been using for several years.</strong></p>
<div><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-eu-gdpr-breach-reporting1-1.jpg" alt="10 things you need to know about the EU GDPR" width="600" height="411" /></div>
<p>While the changes will not impact every industry equally, there are still tactics we can start implementing to try and cushion any major effects from the channels updating their policies—the first of which being to collect more first-party data. In this post, I am going to cover just a few tactics to consider to start shifting your strategy to collecting more of this type of data on your own.</p>
<h2>What is first-party data?</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the strategies, let&#8217;s do a refresher on first, second, and third-party data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First-party data</strong> is the data you collect on your audience based on their behaviors directly on your website and/or app. While this data is most valuable with minimal privacy challenges, it can be hard to scale since it&#8217;s only coming from your efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Second-party data</strong> is basically someone else&#8217;s first-party data. You can feel good about accuracy and privacy since it&#8217;s coming from one source, but you do have to pay or partner up for it.</li>
<li><strong>Third-party data</strong> is a collection of multiple first-party data sources aggregated across websites and applications by independent researchers and companies, and is also purchased.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the new iOS 14 feature of being able to opt out of being tracked by apps, and with Google deprecating third-party cookies (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/27/google-topics-api">get our coverage on the Topics API here</a>), <strong>first-party data is critical </strong>(read more about it in our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/13/digital-marketing-trends-2022">2022 marketing trends)</a>.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/zero-first-second-third-party-data.png" alt="zero, frist, second, third-party data" width="720" height="467" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57202" /></div>
<h2>4 ways to collect more first-party data</h2>
<p>First-party data can be collected from your website, apps, social media platforms, advertising analytics, and the information that aggregates into your CRM. In this guide, we&#8217;re going to cover four PPC-focused strategies to obtain this data:</p>
<ol>
<li>Utilize lead gen campaigns</li>
<li>Use custom questions</li>
<li>Test out other ad platforms</li>
<li>Spend more time focusing on brand-building</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Use lead gen forms (even if you’re not a lead gen—focused account)</h3>
<p>One of the easiest ways for paid media advertisers to collect user information is by using lead gen forms in their ads. There are many channels offering lead gen options. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/10/linkedin-lead-gen-forms">LinkedIn</a> and Facebook are probably the most common options we jump to, but do not forget about Google (available for Search, YouTube, and Discovery campaigns) and Quora. And depending on your industry, you can use lead gen forms to collect as much or as little information needed to make an impact on your <a href="/blog/ws/2021/01/04/best-marketing-strategies-2021">marketing strategies</a>.</p>
<p>And lead gen forms are not just for B2B accounts!</p>
<p>I am currently running several<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/17/b2b-lead-generation"> lead gen campaigns</a> for a few ecommerce accounts with the goal to collect as many users as possible for their email campaigns. We are doing this because we know that their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/01/automated-email-marketing">email marketing campaigns</a> have the highest conversion rates and provide a very high return on investment. For these accounts, the clients have a goal of quantity,</p>
<div><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/first-party-data-lead-gen-forms-1.png" alt="how to collect first-pary data in a cookieless world—screenshot of lead gen form setup" width="800" height="482" /></div>
<p>Because of this, we are only asking for the bare minimum on each channel. In the example above, which is the default view when building a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/25/quora-ads">Quora</a> form, name fields are mandatory. And we also know that most people sign up for Quora with their personal email. We know we can get more users to sign up if we’re choosing the fields more applicable to the channel running the ads. (To be fair, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-email-examples-and-templates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business emails</a> do not apply to the industries using this strategy).</p>
<p>Also, lead gen campaigns are an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/26/generate-leads-facebook-ads-ios14">effective way to generate leads from Facebook post-iOS 14</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Use custom questions to pre-qualify or better segment users</h3>
<p>I completely understand that there are accounts looking for a specific type of user, and quantity is not the main goal. This could be for two reasons. First, you may have a very specific <a href="/blog/ws/2015/09/23/buyer-personas">audience persona</a> you need to target and you may be trying to save your sales team time by not having to sort through a ton of junk leads.</p>
<p>Second, you may want your leads to be better segmented to better help your marketing strategies further down the <a href="/blog/ws/2015/05/07/marketing-funnel">funnel</a>. If this is the case for your goals, consider adding custom questions to your forms.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/first-party-data-custom-questions-1.png" alt="how to collect first-pary data in a cookieless world—screenshot of lead gen form with custom questions in facebook ads" width="800" height="530" /></div>
<p>The image above is showing you the custom question options you have for Facebook. You can use these options to get more information that would better help your sales team nurture users to an eventually closed status. We have used a multiple-choice selection to get a better understanding of which <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">products or services</a> the user prefers. This has made our email marketing better by segmenting the users out into different buckets so we can <a href="/blog/ws/2021/03/18/how-to-follow-up-with-sales-leads">follow up</a> with emails using more appealing offers.</p>
<p>On a related note, here are more tips to <a href="/blog/ws/2021/06/03/keep-facebook-ads-working-iOS14">keep your Facebook ads working in iOS 14</a>.</p>
<p>The image you see below is coming from the “More questions” option in Google Ads for their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/31/google-lead-form-extensions">lead form extensions</a>.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/first-party-data-more-questions-1.png" alt="how to collect first-pary data in a cookieless world—custom question suggestions" width="500" height="637" /></div>
<p>Google has some built-in questions for a variety of industries to better help you qualify your users. These questions not only can help qualify leads, but you may get more information on who your target audience is to better market to a similar type of audience down the road.</p>
<h3>3. Test out more channels and more mediums</h3>
<p>While I do not expect the outcome to be as disastrous as everyone freaking out on Twitter speculating, I cannot deny that targeting options are going to be impacted with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-privacy-sandbox-update">third-party cookies</a> starting to go away. Because of this, I recommend starting testing out new channels (if they seem like a good fit) to have more ways to reach users.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/05/best-ad-platform">Each ad platform</a> has a few targeting options that are unique. With the different types of targeting options, we can try to find new users willing to come to our websites and give us their information.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/first-party-data-more-channels-1.png" alt="how to collect first-pary data in a cookieless world—google and facebook ads alternatives" width="800" height="414" /></div>
<p>Your audience visits more websites than just Google. Your audience visits more websites than just Facebook. By exploring what other paid media channels actually offer for targeting will give you more tools to use to try and get users to your site and give you their information. You just need to make the effort and research what paid media targeting options may work well for your business.</p>
<h3>4. Spend more time focusing on brand-building</h3>
<p>Hopefully, this has always been in your marketing game plan. But over the ten years I have been in this industry, it boggles my mind how many companies I see not care about <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/14/use-branding-to-improve-advertising">branding</a>. The “<a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/01/bottom-funnel-conversions">bottom of the funnel</a>” focused mindset has taken over so many strategies, and this is because of all the great targeting options we (used to) have over the past years. If we are shifting our focus to start collecting more first-party data ourselves, we have to do a better job of making users want to give us the information in the first place.</p>
<p>“Get a free demo!” Why should they?</p>
<p>“Sign up for our free webinar this Thursday.” What is so valuable about your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/05/webinar-marketing">webinar</a> compared to the other 20 webinar promos they have seen this month?</p>
<p>“Download our free whitepaper.” What could possibly be on this whitepaper that is so valuable you couldn’t have just sent them to a blog page?</p>
<p>If you want to start collecting more information from users, you are going to have to give them content they actually want. And this could take some time and some testing to find the perfect offer for whatever stage of the funnel the user belongs to. For a company lacking brand awareness, you may have to spend some time <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/01/brand-strategy">building your brand</a> into a trusted name people believe in or can relate with. Users are more willing to give their information or become involved with a brand they can believe in.</p>

<h2>First-party data is a must in a cookieless world</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/22/customer-data-privacy">data privacy</a> becomes more important, we know we can expect targeting and policies to change across many of the channels we use for advertising. The way we are used to advertising to users across these channels will not be the same, but adapting to change has always been a part of paid media. The sooner we embrace world <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/preparing-for-ppc-success-in-cookieless-world">without cookies</a> and adjust our strategies to be in compliance, the better off your accounts will be when policy changes are enforced.</p>
<p>Here are our four key strategies to get more first-party data starting today:</p>
<ol>
<li>Utilize lead gen campaigns</li>
<li>Use custom questions</li>
<li>Test out other ad platforms</li>
<li>Spend more time focusing on brand-building</li>
</ol>

<p>There will come a time in your paid search marketing career where you will hit a wall when trying to find new keyword opportunities. It could be because you are in a niche industry. It could be because you are not seeing as many opportunities due to the lack of search queries in our reports. I will always embrace new ways to find more valuable keywords for my accounts, and this is where Microsoft Advertising Intelligence comes in handy.</p>

</div>
<p><a href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/tools/microsoft-advertising-intelligence">Microsoft Advertising Intelligence</a> is a free tool available within the Microsoft Office Excel interface. Over time, I have used this tool more and more to try and find new keyword ideas for both my Microsoft Advertising AND Google Ads accounts. I am not going to go over how to set up the tool. You can do that in the link above. What I am going to do is go over my favorite keyword research tools available in Advertising Intelligence. These include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keyword suggestions</li>
<li>Traffic</li>
<li>Age group and gender</li>
<li>Associated keywords</li>
<li>Webpage keywords</li>
<li>Keyword performance</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let me jump in and show both why they&#8217;re my favorite tools and how to use each one.</p>
<h2>6 ways to use Microsoft Advertising Intelligence tools to get new keyword ideas</h2>
<p>As mentioned, the Microsoft Advertising Intelligence tool is a free offering available within the Microsoft Office Excel interface that can be used to find keyword ideas for any ad—Microsoft or Google. Below are my favorite aspects of the tool and how I use them to improve my keyword discovery for better ads and ad performance.</p>
<h3>1. Keyword suggestions</h3>
<p>Of course, a blog post about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/12/21/seo-keyword-research-ideas">keyword ideas</a> should start with the Keyword Suggestions tool, but this is the best place to start for my other recommendations in this post. Take the list of keywords you are trying to expand and paste them in Excel. Highlight those keywords and click on the Keyword Suggestions. You will then get a list of new potential keywords and stats based on the past month.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="c155d0e6-9e39-4a71-8ebd-2671f6ab048b" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Microsoft20Advertising20Intelligence20Tools20keyword20suggestions-1.png" alt="Microsoft Advertising Intelligence Tools keyword suggestions" width="800" height="484" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>The first column will show you the keywords you had in your list. The second column will give you a variety of keyword recommendations based upon your original list. You can then assess a variety of metrics such as potential volume, bid estimates, and more.</p>
<p>Looking for some ideas of what to try? The most common list would be a list of your converting keywords. We always want to find more of what is working right? The next list I would take would be a list of converting search queries. <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/10/modified-broad-match-going-away">Match types</a> are becoming more and more irrelevant. So the list of queries people type in is not the same as a list of keywords you are targeting.</p>
<p>Try both in this tool. This is the easiest way to find new suggestions in Microsoft Advertising Intelligence, but we’re far from done. There are a variety of other tools I am going to talk about that can help verify if these initial keyword suggestions are either worth pursuing more options or even adding to your account.</p>
<p><em><strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AdWordsGrader_AWGrader" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AdWordsGrader_AWGrader">Looking for more insights into your keyword strategy? Use our Free Google Ads Performance Grader!</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>2. Traffic</h3>
<p>After you have your list of suggested keywords from Microsoft Advertising Intelligence, highlight the list of new keywords. Then go back up to the top navigation bar, and click on the Traffic button. You can then create a new report from your selected keyword grouping to see a shorter list of keywords by device and number of searches from the previous month.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="c5aacac9-831f-4660-b4f6-cc141574b730" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Microsoft20Advertising20Intelligence20Tools20traffic-1.png" alt="Microsoft Advertising Intelligence Tools traffic" width="800" height="650" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>While it is similar to the original Keyword Suggestion export, the Traffic view is an “easier to digest” report. Since the Traffic view doesn’t break up the keywords by match type, we can see a consolidated view of the suggested keywords. Many times you will only need a quick scan of the list to easily find which options will actually have volume that will make an impact on any additional you add to your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/14/microsoft-ads-if-functions">campaigns</a>.</p>
<h3>3. Age group &amp; gender</h3>
<p>If you are trying to reach a very specific audience with your Search campaigns, you may want to check out the Age Group &amp; Gender tool which also lives under the “More Research” option in the top navigation. Highlight your desired list of new keywords to see traffic percentages broken by, you guessed it, age and gender on the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/03/differences-between-google-ads-and-microsoft-ads">Microsoft Network</a>.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="d579559a-de1a-481a-bbb7-8bc81335f473" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Microsoft20Advertising20Intelligence20Tools20age20group20and20gender-1.png" alt="Microsoft Advertising Intelligence Tools age group and gender" width="800" height="655" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>While the age and gender columns are right next to each other, the percentage totals are separated between the two. The five age columns will total to 100%, and the gender columns will total to another 100%. This tool has helped me for certain clients who are trying to reach a specific age range, gender, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>Sometimes a list of relevant keywords a client wants to target are searched a lot, but not by the main audience they are trying to reach. I can go back to them with this information to show them we may need to bid lower on these keywords or <a href="/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide">research new ones altogether</a> if it makes sense. I understand this tool may not be as important to some accounts, but I still wanted to touch upon it.</p>
<h3>4. Associated keywords</h3>
<p>Besides just getting a list of keyword ideas, you can use the Associated Keywords option (found in the More Research button) to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/09/competitor-keywords">find keywords that other advertisers are bidding on</a>. We do not get information on who is bidding on these keywords, but it can give you some idea on which keyword opportunities might be more valuable.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="64548629-9cb9-41b0-9948-b9f9f508c3c2" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Microsoft20Advertising20Intelligence20Tools20associated20keywords-1.png" alt="Microsoft Advertising Intelligence Tools associated keywords" width="800" height="566" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>While these keywords may have value, you might keep in mind that these keywords may also be more competitive. Possibly put this new list of keywords in the standard Keyword Planner and get information on the possible spend it will take to be successful.</p>
<h3>5. Webpage keywords</h3>
<p>Under the More Research button in the top navigation, you can choose to research keywords by specific URLs. Maybe you want to take a list of URLs that consist of popular products or products you need help <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">driving more traffic.</a> Take a list of those URLs and paste them into an Excel sheet. Then you can have Microsoft scan that list of keyword suggestions based upon the content of those pages.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="b8c9b34f-2e9a-4bfd-8be6-405d66660717" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Microsoft20Advertising20Intelligence20Tools20webpage20keywords-1.png" alt="Microsoft Advertising Intelligence Tools webpage keywords" width="800" height="631" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>In the image above you only see the results from one URL, but there were others included in the results. Initially the export will be sorted by the Input URL so you can run this on many URLs at once. Most likely not every keyword recommendation you will see in the export is worth targeting in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/25/bings-ads-vs-google-adwords">Search campaigns</a>. Handpick the keywords that are relevant. Then take that new list and run more Keyword Suggestion and Traffic reports to see if you can find even more relevant keywords related to your product URLs.</p>
<h3>6. Keyword performance</h3>
<p>I am going to pretend the list of keyword suggestions from the Webpage Keywords results was to my liking. I can then highlight those keywords and click on the Keyword Performance options to get recent, historical performance of these keywords solely on the Bing Network. Before I generate the performance list, I can choose which device and <a href="/blog/ws/2011/04/05/google-vs-bing-match-types">keyword match type</a> I want to review in the export.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="5addbcaf-e88a-4caf-9424-68963a3fe7a2" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Microsoft20Advertising20Intelligence20Tools20keyword20performance-1.png" alt="Microsoft Advertising Intelligence Tools keyword performance" width="800" height="651" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>In the view above, I sorted the list by the most impressions. I also added a keyword filter to make sure every keyword recommendation included “lightsaber.” Now we can see how these suggested keywords have recently performed on the Microsoft Advertising Search Network. Right away I can see which keywords could drive the most traffic as well as what I could expect to pay for each click using Microsoft Ads.</p>
<p>While I only used one scenario for the Keyword Performance tool, you can use this tool for any keyword list you have pulled up. I definitely recommend <a href="/blog/ws/2020/02/20/cross-platform-keyword-research-tools">trying this tool</a> for any opportunity list you think is ready to use in your campaigns as one last confirmation check.</p>
<p>I also like to use this tool for potential cost estimates a client could request. But since this will only show keyword estimates on the Bing Network, I would want to see what all of my new keyword suggestions could potentially bring in Google which brings me to my last suggestion.</p>
<h2>Test your keywords in Google</h2>
<p>After I feel I have exhausted all ideas in my current research phase in Microsoft, I will then take my various keyword suggestion lists and test them out in Google. Many times I will see keywords with little to no search volume in Microsoft show up in Google’s Keyword Planner tool.</p>
<p>I have grown to like Microsoft Advertising Intelligence as my starting ground because it is a lot easier for me to come up with initial lists and research even more options without having to start over. It is extremely convenient to research a variety of opportunities all within one Excel Worksheet.</p>
<p>You can then also flip the scenario. If you have found keywords working in Google, you can use those suggestions to see if they are worth targeting in Microsoft Ads as well.</p>
<h2>Microsoft Advertising Intelligence can work for any paid search account</h2>
<p>For a free tool, Advertising Intelligence is pretty robust. There are many other features this tool offers, and I only went through the few I would use when getting started. Take some time to download the tool and find out which features work best for you. You can also use the tools in a variety of combinations to keep expanding your lists. You do not have to go in just the same order as I ran through in this post. Do whatever makes sense to find the right keywords for your campaign goals.</p>

<p>As someone who has always been on the agency side of things, I am used to the pushback against Display advertising in Google. The number one reason I hear why clients do not want to use them is that they typically do not perform as well as Search. Of course they do not. The user intent between the networks is completely different.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="c24d9415-7be1-41fa-ae14-d48226f8d7a1" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>But just because users are not as likely to convert, it does not mean Display ads are not valuable. There are several ways you can check and see if Display Ads are impacting overall performance on Google, and we’ll be covering four of those methods in this post. The methods involve:</p>
<ol>
<li>Display-specific Google Analytics audiences</li>
<li>Observation audiences</li>
<li>Google Trends</li>
<li>View-through conversions</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s begin.</p>
<h2>1. Create display-specific Google Analytics audiences</h2>
<p>When you are in Google Analytics, click on the Admin button in the lower right-hand corner of your window. The middle column will be your Property column in Universal Analytics. Click on Audience Definitions towards the bottom of the middle column.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e12a9968-1ba1-420a-bedd-83cc12aff260" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>In Audience Definitions, we can create audiences from so many <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/09/20/ppc-metrics-ultimate-guide">metrics available within Google Analytics</a>.</p>
<p>Before you can create an audience in Google Analytics, however, you must have Edit permissions to the property. Click on the red “New Audience” button, and soon you will find yourself in the Audience Builder. With the Audience Builder, and how you have your Display campaigns set up in Google Ads, there could be a variety of ways to build audiences from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/18/google-display-network-tips">Display Network</a> traffic.</p>
<p>I always have “Display” in my Display campaign names so I can create a Traffic Source audience to include any visits from users who came to my site via a campaign with “Display” in the name.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="363d9ddf-4d87-4a49-bc4d-3215388e0d43" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>If you manually tag your Display URLs with a specific source and medium, you can create an audience that way. If you use specific landing pages for your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/30/best-display-ad-examples">Display campaigns</a>, you can create an audience in Google Analytics from just those landing page visits. There are a variety of ways you can do this. I just wanted to make it clear we can build audiences from our Display traffic in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>Now before you save the audience, you will want to make sure you are adding the audience to both Google Ads and Google Analytics. And this is a trick I learned a long time ago from <a href="https://twitter.com/Hoffman8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Bishop</a>. I wanted to make sure she got credit for teaching me this.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="855c09b8-c905-48a6-b54e-4163aba80030" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>The reason we want to make sure our audience is added to Google Analytics is because we can review the performance of this audience within the Google Analytics Audience report. In Google Analytics, go to the left-hand column and click “Audiences.” Then click on the subcategory which is a second “Audiences.”</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="8c93a980-26ba-4ae4-bc8e-7c760e142a44" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this report, you will be able to see if anyone within your audiences has <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/08/13/adwords-conversion-tracking-guide">converted</a> within your selected date range. So when we create an audience from Display campaigns, we can then go back and see if anyone who came to the website eventually converted.</p>
<p>The numbers I see from &#8220;audiences&#8221; in Google Analytics and &#8220;direct conversions&#8221; in Google Ads from <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/30/best-display-ad-examples">Display campaigns</a> are typically different. The difference I usually experience is that the numbers in Google Analytics are higher because Display is more of a first interaction approach unless you are doing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/12/04/adwords-remarketing-best-practices-guide">remarketing</a>.</p>
<p>This has helped me showcase to clients when users were not converting from my Display campaigns, that those users were eventually coming back to the site via many of our other channels and converting. This helped prove the impact of using Display to build the initial <a href="/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">brand or product awareness</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note: You can create this type of audience in Google Analytics 4 as well, but I wanted to stick with the more familiar Universal Analytics way of doing it for this post. </em></p>
<h2>2. Apply those audiences in observation mode</h2>
<p>After you have your audiences created in Google Analytics (if you created them using the Google Ads audience manager, that is completely fine too), I highly recommend adding each of these audiences as an Observation audience to all of your Search Network campaigns.</p>
<p>Observation audiences are bid-only audiences in Google Ads. We are not specifically <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/10/google-display-network-targeting">targeting users</a> within our Display audiences we just created. We just want to <em>observe</em> how users within this Display audience come back and interact with our Google Ads campaigns.</p>
<p>When you are in Audience Manager in Google Ads, you can select your Display audiences you just created. Once you click on the checkbox next to your audience, a blue bar will pop up on the screen. You can then choose to add that audience to as many ad groups or campaigns as you would like. Of course, I am going to recommend adding them to all of your campaigns because who doesn&#8217;t want more information?</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0f9915e6-e019-4125-afb4-93b00dd93eb0" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-display-ads-impact-search-observation-audiences-1.png" alt="How display advertising can impact search network performance observation audiences" width="600" height="271" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Now what we are doing is essentially creating Observation <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/03/12/remarketing-lists-for-search-ads">RLSA</a> campaigns. While we are not targeting users in these audiences, the RLSA audience rules still apply to the Search campaigns. This means your audience needs to have at least 1,000 cookies within that audience before we can start seeing the data show up in the Google Ads Audience report. But if you do have enough data, you can start seeing how your Display audiences are performing compared to the account averages or other audiences in the account.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>The biggest grain of salt when reviewing RLSA audiences as a success metric is that we are only seeing if users within your Display audience come back and interact with your other <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/06/06/best-ads">Google Ads campaigns</a>. And those campaigns have to be enabled for us to gather the Observation information.</p>
<p>This tactic is helpful from the impact on your paid search campaigns, but it will not help prove the impact on other search sources. Maybe users went back to your site through organic search. Maybe they came back to your site via a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/14/microsoft-ads-if-functions">Microsoft Ads search campaign</a>. We do not get the full picture using Observation audiences, but it can give you additional information on what users are searching for after interacting with your Display ads.</p>
<h2>3. Monitor Google trends to see if volume changes</h2>
<p>Depending on the goals of the Display campaign, I like to monitor how search trends change after we launch the campaign. If we are launching an overall <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/06/brand-advertising-for-conversions">brand campaign</a>, I am going to monitor the most important brand keywords to see if we see more searches across Google. If we are bidding on brand terms in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/03/differences-between-google-ads-and-microsoft-ads">Google or Microsoft</a>, we will also monitor if impressions increased for those keywords.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="ddacde60-9710-42e3-b9bd-88b58196f855" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-display-ads-impact-search-google-trends-1.png" alt="How display advertising can impact search network performance google trends" width="800" height="234" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>If our Display campaign is focused on specific <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">products or services</a>, we will pull specific branded product keywords and see if we see any growth. In the case of brand new products with zero awareness, we will see if any searches start showing up. Now it is always important to keep in mind any other channels you may be using to build the awareness. If you are running Display with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/30/social-media-advertising-tips">social campaigns</a>, YouTube ads, direct mail, etc., it is pretty hard to prove that the impact on Search was from just Display. But if you are only running Display to build awareness, I would look for changes in the interest over time to see if search volumes changed in your favor.</p>
<h2>4. Monitor your view-through conversions</h2>
<p>Now this tactic is not Search-specific, but it is one I monitor when I run any type of Display campaign. When you are reviewing your Display campaigns, you have the ability to adjust your columns in Google Ads. One column I always have selected for my Display campaigns is the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/view-through-conversion">View-through conversions column</a>. You can find this option when in the Conversions section when modifying your column views.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="951287a4-7145-4e55-99d6-a447dc6141e4" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-display-ads-impact-search-view-through-conversions-1.png" alt="How display advertising can impact search network performance view through conversions" width="700" height="476" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>View-through conversions do not include any conversions from users who have interacted with your other ads. In other words, View-through conversions are not included in the regular Conversions column totals. These conversions occur when someone sees, but does not interact with your ad. And seeing the ad means at least 50% of the ad was visible on the user’s screen.</p>
<p>So this action is very applicable to Display campaigns which can have a lower CTR compared to other paid media channels. People might see your Display ads, but they are not ready to click on it because they were on a particular website or app for different reasons.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="a68ca299-4bbc-42ef-b446-7a7987685a0f" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-display-ads-impact-search-view-through-conversions-2-1.png" alt="How display advertising can impact search network performance view through conversions" width="800" height="207" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>We use view-through metrics to evaluate the impression-based impact on our Display campaigns. Then we like to go back to our assisted conversion metrics in Google Ads and see how these users are coming back and converting. In many cases, users are coming back via search (both paid and organic) to make the conversion. That is how we can really see the value of just having Display ads visible to a user.</p>
<h2>See how your Display ads affect Search with these tips</h2>
<p>Can Display campaigns in Google Ads convert? Yes. Absolutely. But even if your Display campaigns are not converting, you have to review the complete impact your Display efforts are having before turning them off. Take the ideas I laid out in this post and apply them to your account.</p>
<p>Are users going back to Google and searching for your brand after seeing or clicking on your Display ad? There are several ways we can review this. Display is great for building the awareness to drive more Search traffic, and hopefully you can now see how that is possible.</p>
