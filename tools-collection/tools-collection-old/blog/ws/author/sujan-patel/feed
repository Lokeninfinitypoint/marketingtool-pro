										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fact: Email marketing returns <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/06/29/email-marketing-statistics">$40</a> for every $1 spent. It&#8217;s no wonder it&#8217;s one of the top marketing channels in terms of ROI.</p>

<p>But whether you’re prospecting, onboarding new users, saying thanks, or making a big announcement, staring at your cursor in a blank email is where all too many of us find ourselves. Luckily, you don’t have to reinvent the wheel. Because in this post, we&#8217;ve got five email templates you can use to get your communication off to a great start.</p>

<h2>Tips for using email templates</h2>
<p>Email templates help to save you time, minimize typos, and keep your branding consistent, but there is a right and a wrong way to use them. Be sure to follow these tips when using email templates</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Customize them: </strong>Templates should only serve as the base of your email. They should be customized to include specific details about your recipient so that they&#8217;re genuine. No point in saving time if your emails don&#8217;t make your customers feel valued.</li>
<li><strong>Double-check them: </strong>Even though templates can reduce errors, you still need to check and double-check them before sending—especially because if you&#8217;re following tip one, you will be manipulating the content.</li>
<li><strong>Test them: </strong>Templates can reduce your workload, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re off the hook with testing your emails. You should still try out different versions of the same template to see which one performs better, and even periodically change up your templates to keep them from going stale.</li>
<li><strong>Set them up in your email platform: </strong>Once you have the copy that works, don&#8217;t just save the copy to your notepad. <a href="https://www.rightinbox.com/blog/how-to-set-up-email-templates-in-gmail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Set up Gmail templates</a> to have them at the ready.</li>
<li><strong>Use design templates too: </strong>The templates below can be used as Gmail templates, but a branded HTML email offers a more attractive and professional touch. There are a number of branded email templates out there to choose from as well.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>Subject line: It&#8217;s here! {product, event, feature, etc}</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Hey {name}, </em></p>
<p><em>We’re incredibly excited to announce {event}! After a lot of work, we’re finally ready to bring {product, location, etc.} to the world, and we’re hoping that you’ll enjoy using it just as much as we have working on it. </em></p>
<p><em>Here are a few reasons that we’re excited about {product, event, etc.}:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em> {reason 1}</em></li>
<li><em> {reason 2}</em></li>

<p><em>Thanks again for being here on this journey with us. </em></p>
<p><em>Best,</em></p>
<p><em>{your name}</em></p>
<h3>Announcement email tips</h3>

<li>Consider giving your loyal customers early access.</li>
<li>Make sure that what you’re announcing is worthy of an email and relevant to your customers.</li>
<li>Give your readers an action to complete to get involved.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN">American author <a href="https://tim.blog/2017/11/25/steven-pressfield/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steven Pressfield</a> once said, “The disease of our times is that we live on the surface. We’re like the Platte River, a mile wide and an inch deep.” That quote applies in so many facets of our lives and none more evident than fostering relationships and building a marketing network. Too often, people go to networking events to collect business cards so they can follow up in the hopes of having some sort of transaction in the near term. While that tactic can work, it’s not as effective as it once was.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">What works better is having a common interest and laying the foundation for a relationship before asking for anything. Shifting your mind from quantity to quality takes work. You have to think less about what’s in it for you and focus time and energy on finding shared interests—figuring out what their wants and desires are and helping them move the needle toward accomplishing their goals. </span></p>

<h2><span lang="EN">1. Leverage guest posting</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Guest posting refers to writing and publishing an article on somebody else’s blog or website. It’s a fantastic way to get connected with a new audience, build credibility, and build greater brand exposure. While it dramatically benefits the person posting, it also gives the host site valuable, engaging content free of charge. Ultimately, you get a rare opportunity to collaborate with little to no risk, which could potentially open the door to other projects.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">Getting started with guest posting can seem a little daunting, but there’s a risk-free method that works exceptionally well. Once you figure out who you want to reach out to, you’ve got to craft the perfect pitch. The secret sauce here is to make it easy for them to say yes by doing all the research and leg work before reaching out. Here are some key steps to get you started: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span lang="EN">Use a tool like <a href="https://ahrefs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ahrefs</a> or <a href="https://buzzsumo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BuzzSumo</a> to find content ideas that have worked well for them in the past and some keywords you’d like to target.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Once you’ve completed your research and come up with some content ideas, work on crafting some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/05/17/how-to-write-great-headlines">appealing headlines</a>.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Pitch them the headlines without writing a word so you don’t waste any precious time and resources on someone who may not respond or may say no.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="EN">That’s it! Repeat and follow up regularly to see the best results. When you do finally get your first guest post, try to make it value-packed and not too much of a direct sales pitch for your product. </span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">2. Request an interview or a quote</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Guest posting works well, but posting on your own blog can work equally well with the right strategy. If you’re working on a high-quality piece of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/23/cornerstone-content-guide">cornerstone content</a> like a blog post or an <a href="https://venngage.com/blog/what-is-an-infographic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infographic</a> that you know is going to be popular, you can leverage your own hard work to make new connections. The easiest way to do so is by reaching out and interviewing an expert on the subject. They’ll likely have an opinion and would love the free brand exposure.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Depending on the situation, sometimes a quote is the best path to go when first connecting since it’s less of a time commitment on their part. It’s also helpful to ask them for a short bio to include in the post, a headshot, and a link to their website or a specific content piece of their choosing. Not only does that help them with exposure, but it gives you more content and added credibility for your article since they’re a subject matter expert.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">“When I was writing for CXL, I’d always reach out to the smartest people I could think of, my ideals and role models in the conversion optimization world,” he says. “They almost always graciously helped out, which made my articles way better. Now, I’m good friends with lots of them as well.” </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">You can leverage that strategy for other forms of media as well, such as finding podcast guests, vlog collaborators, or partnered Q&amp;A sessions on social media platforms. The more you invite people to collaborate, give quotes, and <a href="https://www.lifesize.com/en/video-conferencing-blog/embracing-the-video-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">do interviews</a>, the more likely they are to reciprocate or want a partner with you on other projects. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">People love to be featured in interviews and talk about what they do for a living. It’s also great content and helps your own blog out.

<p><span lang="EN">It’s truly a win-win for everyone.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">3. Partner up on contests and giveaways</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Nothing gets your audience more engaged than the prospect of getting something of value. In other words, it has to be something worthwhile. If it’s small, uninteresting, or commonplace, then chances are you’ll just be ignored. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">A quick way to level up your prize offering is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/26/partner-marketing">partner with other companies</a> and professionals to sweeten the pot with a contribution of their own. Similar to guest posting, you can reach out to other marketers to share your giveaway and contest ideas and see if they want to get involved. Depending on your industry, the prizes can come at little-to-no cost to you or them. It could be as simple as a strategy call with a subject matter expert or free access to your SaaS product for a year. Or it could be as grand as an all-expenses-paid trip. The sky is the limit here! </span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Once you&#8217;ve narrowed down your giveaway prize, all you’ve got to do is get the word out. Make it easy on your new connection by giving them <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/26/networking-email-subject-lines-templates">email templates</a>, custom graphics, and some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/03/copywriting-examples">copy examples</a> they can use on their marketing channels. The easier you make it, the more likely they’ll say yes to a partnership. </span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">4. Go to networking events</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">It’s an old school tactic, but face-to-face meetings are a quick way to break the ice. It’s also a great way to level up your game. Find industry conferences, trade shows, <a href="https://growthmarketingconf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growth conferences</a>, or TED talks, and go learn something. Be sure to take advantage of the happy hour, the meet and greet, and scheduled breaks to mingle with other participants.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Again, once you’ve narrowed your focus to the right event with the right crowd, you want to remember to focus on creating <em>quality</em> relationships—<em>not quantity</em>. </span></p>

</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://twitter.com/creativemorning/status/1224347142636044289"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Don’t bounce around the room, bending the ear of anyone who will listen and hand your card out to anyone who’ll take it. Do your research. Figure out who will be there and who you want to connect with. Come prepared with something of value to offer them, whether that’s industry insights or valuable partnership opportunities. And remember to have fun while you’re at it.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">5. Throw a party</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Didn’t expect that one did you? Whether you’re a fresh face in town or a local legend, find a venue and pick something to celebrate. You can even call it your quarterly “thank you” to community professionals and invite everyone you know and everyone you want to meet. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">A great party starts with the right attendees. Shout it out on social media, send out <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/03/cold-email">cold emails</a>, and go to networking events to spread the word. Another layer here is making sure you have the right blend of activities, so people are encouraged to interact in a low-pressure environment. You could go all out with a karaoke machine and a catered buffet. Or as simple as backyard games and a food truck. The choice is truly yours, and if you’re not good at throwing parties, that’s okay. Find someone to partner up with or consider hiring a party planner.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">6. Ask for introductions</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Skip the awkward introductions and jump straight to doing business together with a trusted intermediary. You’ve likely already got a contact list full of people who know other people you want to know. Start there. Or leverage a platform like LinkedIn, which is ripe for introductions since you can actively see who in your network is already connected with who you want to meet.</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="f75752c1-6cfd-4d3e-9457-bc5f61d08f24" data-langcode="en">

</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://www.yesware.com/blog/introduction-email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Another way to break down the awkward factor is to ask your mutual connection to tag along for an in-person introduction. They can help you break the ice by starting the conversation and connecting commonalities you didn’t know you shared. Your ally can also help you get the inside edge on your prospective connection beforehand by answering a few questions. One thing to always keep in mind when asking for introductions is to make sure you’re connecting for a reason. <strong>Connecting just to connect never feels good.</strong> Have a purpose for the meeting. Do your homework and have something of value to bring them.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">7. Try your hand at cold outreach</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Sometimes it’s really that simple. A cold email or cold call can go a long way. Just make sure you enter the conversation with something of value to offer the potential partnership. You can do this the old-fashioned way by typing out your emails one-by-one, or you can <a href="https://blog.appsumo.com/tools-for-email-outreach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leverage the right tools</a> to make the most of your time.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">For instance, using <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/sales-solutions/sales-navigator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn Sales Navigator</a> or <a href="https://discoverorg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DiscoverOrg</a> makes it easier to find the right people to connect with. Once you’ve narrowed your list, you can use a tool like <a href="https://www.voilanorbert.com/">VoilaNorbert</a> to help you find anyone’s email address based on simple criteria like their name and company. Later, when you’re ready to reach out, you can use <a href="https://mailshake.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mailshake</a> to help you create powerful email templates for your guest post requests or party invites and automatically send follow-ups based on a cadence of your choosing. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">The right <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/04/tech-stack">stack of tools</a> can help you lengthen your reach and start a conversation. From there, it’s all about finding the right connection and finding a way to make a deep and meaningful relationship you can leverage for years to come.</span></p>
<h2>Get started with these networking strategies!</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Networking doesn’t have to be a dirty word. The old adage, “It’s not what you know, but who you know” holds true. What has shifted is how you go about building that network—quantity is not greater than quality when building a network. The best advice is to go narrow and long, which involves deep relationships with a small number of people—then playing the long game.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let’s play a game of “Who Do You Trust?” Those paid results at the top of the SERP, or your sister? That banner on YouTube, or your best friend from college?</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/referral-marketing-easy-button.jpg" alt="easy button" width="786" height="524" /></div>
<p>Okay, this is an easy game. We all trust our family, friends, and even strangers more than we trust advertisements and brands. We’re influenced by recommendations, reviews, testimonials, social chatter, and, most importantly, <strong>referrals</strong>.</p>
<p>Using referral marketing will help you stand out from your industry competition—as long as you do it effectively. Here’s everything you need to know to get started, including referral marketing ideas from companies that have already used this tactic to improve their businesses.</p>
<h2>What is referral marketing?</h2>
<p>Referral marketing is a marketing tactic that makes use of recommendations and word of mouth to grow a business&#8217;s customer base through the networks of its existing customers. Referral marketing can take many forms, but at its heart, it&#8217;s a way to get your biggest fans to help spread the word about your brand. In other words, referral marketing turns your current customers into <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/24/brand-advocacy-paid-social">brand advocates</a>.</p>
<h2>Why does referral marketing work?</h2>
<p>Before we get into<em> how</em> to create your referral marketing strategy, let’s talk about why you <em>need </em>to. How much of a difference do referrals make? Consider this:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.annexcloud.com/blog/39-referral-marketing-statistics-that-will-make-you-want-to-start-a-raf-program-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">word-of-mouth impression drives at least 5x more sales</a> than a paid impression.</li>
<li>Customers acquired through word-of-mouth <a href="https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/word-of-mouth-statistics-quotes-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spend 2x more and make 2x as many referrals</a> themselves.</li>
<li>Referred leads <a href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/referral-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convert 30% better and have a 16% higher lifetime value</a> than leads acquired via other channels.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.convinceandconvert.com/word-of-mouth/statistics-about-word-of-mouth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Half of Americans would pick word-of-mouth</a> if they could only select one source for information on potential purchases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Word-of-mouth and <a href="https://www.oberlo.ca/blog/referral-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">referral marketing</a> are cost-effective, powerful, and trusted. When we have a good experience with a brand, product, or service, we’re happy to—and frequently do—share it with others.</p>
<p>In his bestseller <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451686587" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Contagious</em></a>, marketing professor and author Jonah Berger identified six principles of sharing and word-of-mouth:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Social currency:</strong> We share what makes us look good.</li>
<li><strong>Triggers:</strong> We share what’s at the top of our minds.</li>
<li><strong>Emotion:</strong> We share what we care about.</li>
<li><strong>Public:</strong> We imitate what we see people around us are doing.</li>
<li><strong>Practical value:</strong> We share things that have value to others.</li>
<li><strong>Stories:</strong> We share stories, not information.</li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/referral-marketing-contagious.jpg" alt="chart from Contagious" width="730" height="547" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://jonahberger.com/resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image Source</a></em></p>
<p>Hit as many of them as possible, and you’ve got an idea, product, or announcement that people will want to talk about and share with others—which will help you stand out from your competition.</p>
<h2>Using referral marketing for competitive advantage</h2>
<p>The numbers don’t lie: Recommendations and referrals are not only useful, but crucial if you want to stand out from the crowd. Consumers actively go looking for them, and they can be the key differentiator between two otherwise similar products or brands.</p>
<p>The digital revolution has made launching and running a business easier than ever before, but that comes with a price: increased and <em>fierce</em> competition.</p>
<p><strong>Referrals turn your satisfied customers into very convincing cheerleaders. They’ve paid good money for your product, and if they’re happy with it and the return-on-investment they’re getting from it, that’s a powerful selling point to others. </strong></p>
<p>Ask for and incentivize referrals with a convenient and largely automatic program, and you’ve got a self-perpetuating lead machine. It’s a spotlight on you and your brand in a sea of sameness.</p>
<p>Working with <a href="https://twitter.com/raulgalerad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raúl Galera</a> of <a href="https://www.referralcandy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ReferralCandy</a>, I’ve collected a few examples of how to use referral marketing to stand out from your competition.</p>
<h2>Referral Marketing Strategy #1. Girlfriend Collective launches into a crowded market</h2>
<p>Fashion is a crowded market. Women’s fashion is an <em>especially</em> crowded field. You need to stand out immediately if you want to make it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.girlfriend.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Girlfriend Collective</a> is an athleisure wear ecommerce company, and it needed to do something that would make them stand out from the crowd. The company needed to gain traction fast and compete with big names like Lululemon, Adidas, and Nike.</p>
<p>To do so, the company started by creating an awesome product: Their leggings and bodysuits are made entirely from recycled plastic drinking bottles under fair-trade.</p>
<p>Next, Girlfriend Collective needed to get its name out to as many people possible at minimal cost. The company didn’t want to spend money on traditional marketing as their competitors had done. So it decided to spend their marketing budget by giving away their $80-leggings for free.</p>
<p>As co-founder <a>Elle Dinh </a>put it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of scary to purchase a $100 pair of leggings from a brand you&#8217;ve never heard of. We wanted people to trust us, and by giving people the product, we knew they would trust us—that&#8217;s how much we believed in what we&#8217;re doing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Both Ellie and her husband/co-founder Quang Dinh were confident that anyone who tried on their leggings would love them. And for a similar cost of acquiring a customer through traditional means, this strategy removed the barrier of paying for an unknown brand.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/referral-marketing-girlfriend-collective-ad.jpg" alt="Girlfriend Collective ad" width="502" height="363" /></div>
<p>From their pre-launch website, customers were educated on Girlfriend’s use of plastic bottles in their leggings and their commitment to fair trade. This told customers that not only were they getting a free pair of leggings, but the leggings were also environmentally-friendly so they were supporting a good cause.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/referral-marketing-girlfriend-collective.jpg" alt="Girlfriend Collective image" width="741" height="361" /></div>
<p>This appeals to Jonah Berger’s emotion principle that we want to share things we feel strongly towards. People who saw this would tell all their friends about the pair of leggings they could get for free that also supported environmental and social causes. This created a win-win situation that ultimately made this story extremely compelling to share.</p>
<p>This offer was only valid for a few months, which added an extra push for customers to get it and share with their friends as fast as possible. People often attach more value to things that are in short supply, which is why <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/12/scarcity-marketing">scarcity marketing</a> tactics like this work.</p>
<p>In this case, it worked amazingly well. Girlfriend’s word-of-mouth marketing strategy resulted in 10,000 orders within the first day. The sheer traffic even crashed their website, and the sharing feature on Facebook! It also garnered a lot of online coverage from websites like <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/05/111417/girlfriend-collective-leggings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Refinery29</a>, <a href="https://observer.com/2017/01/your-next-pair-of-leggings-should-be-eco-friendly-and-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Observer </a>and <a href="https://www.instyle.com/fashion/girlfriend-collective-free-leggings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">InStyle</a>.</p>
<p>Today, Girlfriend Collective has a substantial social media following of 187k from Instagram and 66k from Facebook. Thanks to their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/26/word-of-mouth-marketing">word-of-mouth</a> referral strategy, the ecommerce company was able to gain a huge customer base and following within such a short period of time. And at an arguably lower price that it would have cost to use an advertising agency.</p>
<h2>Referral Marketing Strategy #2. Critical Pass scales with referral program</h2>
<p>The exam preparation industry is a big market. From physical aids like flashcards to online study tools from big names like <a href="https://www.kaptest.com/bar-exam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaplan</a>, students are spoilt for choice.</p>
<p><a href="https://criticalpass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Critical Pass</a> sells flashcards for law school and the multistate bar examination. It’s a battle-tested method to study and learn, a quality product, and provided at an affordable price.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/referral-marketing-critical-pass.jpg" alt="Critical Pass flashcards" width="720" height="480" /></div>
<p>The company needed a way to convince students that their solution was the best one for them. But it had a couple of issues to solve.</p>
<p>First, the product’s effectiveness would not result in any repeat sales. Secondly, due to individual variances in studying capacity, there was no tangible guarantee of how many marks students would obtain from using their study cards.</p>
<p>Initially, the company used a variety of marketing channels to various degrees of success. But eventually the team realized that the key to encouraging students to try their flashcards lay in their existing satisfied customers.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/natekleiner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathan Kleiner</a>, CEO at Critical Pass, “Our goal is to make sure we only have customers once. They use us. We help them pass. Then they never have to buy from us again. They’re so happy with us that they refer their friends.”</p>
<p>The bar examination is extremely difficult and law students tend to search social media, online forums, and community pages for tools that can help them pass. This creates an organic community based on the <strong>practical principle</strong> in Jonah Berger’s STEPPS where successful students would share the tools and tricks that had worked for them.</p>
<p>Critical Pass recognized since its happy customers were likely to tell their peers and juniors what tools worked for them, a referral program to reward those who shared could work. This program would incentivize—and, as a result, encourage—the sharing process.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/referral-marketing-critical-pass-ad-1.jpg" alt="Critical Pass referral program offer" width="782" height="527" /></div>
<p>Using a personalized link, customers receive $10 for every referral that ends up purchasing a flashcard set. New customers get a 10% discount. Due to the long preparation duration and stressful nature of the exam, many law students usually get by on a part-time job or student loans. These monetary incentives are helpful for them, so they worked.</p>
<p>The referral program was a huge hit, <a href="https://www.referralcandy.com/case-studies/critical-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delivering a 24x return-on-investment</a>, and accounts for over 10% of revenue and orders. Not bad for a system that essentially runs itself.</p>
<h2>Referral Marketing Strategy #3. Hawkers recruits every customer as an influencer</h2>
<p>The founders of <a href="https://www.hawkers.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hawkers</a> an ecommerce company selling sunglasses worldwide, started off as distributors of a popular sunglasses brand Knockaround in their home country, Spain.</p>
<p>The founders helped Knockaround achieve success by giving away sunglasses to friends on Facebook who had large amounts of friends on the social media platform in return for featuring the sunglasses in their posts.</p>
<p>But they didn’t feel satisfied being distributors and wanted a brand they could call their own. And so Hawkers Co. was born.</p>
<p>This company used the same micro-influencer <u><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business">social media marketing strategy</a></u> that had worked so well for a similar product previously. The founders started off with Facebook Ads and micro-influencers, giving free sunglasses to those with a large social media following. They then extended it to Instagram, and it was so effective the social media platform actually featured them as a successful advertising case study.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/referral-marketing-hawkers-instagram-ad_0.jpg" alt="Hawkers Instagram ad" width="600" height="1073" /></div>
<p>Besides providing customers with free sunglasses alone, Hawkers eventually created a referral program that benefited the influencers, their followers, and of course, the company itself.</p>
<p>This gave customers another big reason to show off cool photos of themselves wearing Hawkers’ products. Now they could gain social currency as well as give their friends a good deal.</p>
<p>Sharing personalized promo codes, every customer was now an influencer, and could receive a commission for every sale, while referees received a discount for their purchase.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/referral-marketing-hawkers-instagram-offer.jpg" alt="Hawkers Instagram referral offer" width="610" height="271" /></div>
<p>The referral program amplified the social sharing phenomenon their word-of-mouth strategy had created, allowing roughly <a href="https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/hawkers-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90% of revenue to come from social media</a>. The company also currently exceeds $70 million USD in sales every year.</p>
<p>Thanks to brands like Hawkers Co., the eyewear industry that used to rely heavily on celebrity endorsements has now been revolutionized. Now anyone can become an influencer for their peers through social media and spread the word through referral marketing.</p>
<p>With the right tools and messaging, referral marketing can be an extremely powerful and cost-effective marketing tool for your business.</p>
<p>Here are some things to take note of before you can make it work:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make sure your brand message is easy to understand and<em> repeat. </em></strong></li>
<li><strong>Build a community around your brand.</strong> It’s more than a product and a logo. It’s what it stands for and represents. If your customers identify with those values, they will share your story with others, with or without an incentivized referral program.</li>
<li><strong>Your customers are your best salespeople.</strong> They can “sell” to their friends and family without sounding <em>salesy. </em>And their friends are more likely to go with a recommendation from a friend than some celebrity on a TV screen.</li>
<li><strong>Make referrals easy. </strong>It should be simple for your customer to share your brand with referral rewards that match their purchasing behavior—do that and you’ll have an army of loyal cheerleaders working on your behalf.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you bring in more customers than you lose, then you’ll grow. Fail to do so, and your competition will devour any market share you had.</p>

<p><span lang="EN">“A startup business is always going to be full of uncertainty, and marketing is no different,&#8221; according to  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattjosborn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Osborn</a>, director of marketing at <a href="https://apruve.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apruve</a>. &#8220;With any new business, with new target audiences, business owners cannot make the assumption that the marketing channels that worked in larger organizations will also work with a new company. For this reason, startups need to concentrate on trying out multiple channels, analyzing their return, and finding out <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/09/google-ads-networks">which channels work the best</a>.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">With that in mind, here are 15 SaaS startup growth strategies to try this year. They&#8217;re low-risk, high-yield opportunities you can deploy today to start seeing results in no time.</span></p>
<h2>1. Deploy a talk trigger</h2>
<p><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Talk-Triggers-Complete-Creating-Customers/dp/0525537279" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Talk trigger</a> is a phrase coined by bestselling author <a href="https://twitter.com/jaybaer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jay Baer</a>. It&#8217;s all about creating a fundamental element of your business that triggers positive word-of-mouth about your company and naturally generates growth.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Talk triggers typically have the following traits:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Remarkable</span></strong><span lang="EN">: Surprising and delightful enough that people want to tell their friends about it.</span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Reasonable</span></strong><span lang="EN">: Enough to make an impact but something scalable.</span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Relevant</span></strong><span lang="EN">: In line with your product or service offering so it makes sense.</span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Repeatable</span></strong><span lang="EN">: Creates an amazing experience for all or many customers, not just one.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="EN">One example of a talk trigger is the chocolate chip cookies that DoubleTree hotels offer every customer at check-in. The hotels give out roughly <a href="https://www.inc.com/shama-hyder/what-you-can-learn-from-doubletrees-famous-chocolate-chip-cookies.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">75,000 chocolate chip cookies</a> every day. For his book, Baer surveyed 1,000 DoubleTree customers, and found that <a href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/customers-evangelize-business-jay-baer/">34% of them</a> had mentioned the cookie up to 60 days later. Further proof people love them? The <a href="https://www.google.com/search?ei=2QZiXILzCOaMggfm8qb4Cg&amp;q=doubletree+chocolate+chip+cookie+recipe&amp;oq=double+tree+chocoltat&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.1.0.0i13l3j0i13i30l4j0i13i5i30.8350.11012..12441...0.0..0.130.1959.17j4....2..0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j0i131j0j0i67j0i10i67j0i10j0i131i10j0i22i10i30j0i22i30.gVo6DE9XBIc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">countless copycat recipes</a> posted all over the internet.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">Talk triggers for a SaaS company can be as simple as Dropbox’s <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/gueste94e4c/dropbox-startup-lessons-learned-3836587" target="_blank" rel="noopener">innovative referral program</a> (more on this one later) or You Need A Budget’s (YNAB) <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/tag/whiteboard-wednesday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weekly webinars</a>. </span></p>
<h2>2. Offer freemium services or free trials</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">“Try before you buy” is nothing new, but it’s expected even more these days. According to a new Accenture report, there are roughly 75 million millennials with an estimated annual buying power of <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-outlook-who-are-millennial-shoppers-what-do-they-really-want-retail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$600 billion</a>. It’s also estimated that by 2020 millennials will be spending $1.4 trillion annually.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sujanpatel/2015/04/29/7-examples-of-freemium-products-done-right/#236690ce6f15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freemium pricing model</a> is a great example of a millennial-friendly business deployment model because that generation (and subsequent ones) are used to a self-serve option. Gone are the days when you had to talk to a salesperson to decide if you liked something; today, almost anything you want to know can be found online. Free trials are just an extension of that.</span></p>

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/saas-startup-growth-free-trial.jpg" alt="saas startup growth strategy free trial offer" width="902" height="422" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Offering free trials is also a great way to keep a steady <span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/06/29/email-marketing-statistics">email marketing</a><span lang="EN"> campaign going where you can educate prospects on the value of your software. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Another freemium model <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/28/growth-strategy">growth strategy</a> is win-back offers for expired trials. This allows you to continue to reach out periodically to offer exclusive deals or extended free trials.</span></p>
<h2>3. Launch a worthwhile referral program</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">According to a <a href="https://www.heinzmarketing.com/2015/12/new-research-formal-referral-programs-lead-to-higher-sales-faster-deals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joint report</a> between Heinz Marketing and Influitive, less than one in four B2B organizations have a formal referral program. However, those that do enjoy significantly higher sales, lower acquisition costs, and a more cohesive relationship between their sales and marketing teams.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN"><a href="https://sujanpatel.com/marketing/set-up-referral-marketing-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Setting up a referral marketing program</a> for just about any industry is completely doable and an easy win for growth if you do it right. One notable example is Dropbox, now valued at <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/082015/startup-analysis-how-much-dropbox-worth.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$12 billion</a>. They used a simple referral program to skyrocket from <a href="https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/dropbox-referral-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100,000 to 4 million users</a> in just <em>15 months</em>. The referral offer gave 500 MB of bonus space for users <em>and</em> each friend they referred.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Digital note-taking app Evernote&#8217;s referral program also grew like wildfire. Evernote gained their<a href="https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/evernote-referral-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> first million users in just 446 days</a>, due in part to their referral program. They offer a freemium product with basic features, and a premium product that’s feature-rich and provides more space. </span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="01acc13b-9e6e-4513-8d61-c3917e0c9882" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">The referral program highlighted the premium offering by giving points for each referral that could then be used as credits toward free months of Evernote premium. The referral program had the added bonus of highlighting the benefits of the premium account.</span></p>
<h2>4. Run your sales department like you&#8217;re selling a service</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Fast-growing SaaS businesses like <a href="https://sumo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sumo.com</a> owe some of their scale to sales. Sumo, now focused on ecommerce and particularly <a href="https://acquireconvert.com/shopify-exchange" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shopify stores</a>, sends <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/03/cold-email">cold emails</a><span lang="EN"> offering free consultation calls to potential leads. This gives the company more of an agency feel than the SaaS that it is. </span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">That attention to customer service, plus persistence (they send multiple follow-ups) means it&#8217;s much easier to convert leads to paying SaaS customers when compared to less hands-on SaaS growth tactics like onboarding in the app.</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="5cbe77fe-cecf-4a54-b4e4-ffbbbd601e93" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/saas-startup-growth-selling.jpg" alt="selling strategy for startup growth" width="1176" height="872" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">The team at <a href="https://close.io/">Close</a> takes a similar approach. &#8220;We also train our sales team to personally follow up with every new trial user of our CRM product and offer them a quick consultation over the phone about how to best leverage our product,&#8221; explains <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/theryanrobinson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryan Robinson</a>, content marketer at Close. &#8220;We do this completely free of charge, and while it&#8217;s very hands-on compared to the way many SaaS companies work to convert users, we&#8217;ve found that this level of curated help and guidance creates not only happy customers, but brand advocates who are much more likely to champion usage of our product throughout their organizations and to other similar companies they know.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>5. Use a high-end influencer marketing strategy on a budget</h2>
<p><span lang="EN"><a href="https://diymarketers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DIY Marketers</a> publisher Ivana Tyler believes that influencer marketing doesn’t have to be expensive, but you do need to be strategic and smart about it. Use <a href="https://buzzsumo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BuzzSumo.com</a> or <a href="https://brand24.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brand24.com</a> to find either influencers in your industry, or people who might be ideal users of your platform in other industries. </span></p>
<p>Once you have your list of influencers, use Voila Norbert’s <a href="https://www.voilanorbert.com/email-finder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email finder</a> to track them down and reach out, and start building a relationship with them by following them on social media, sharing their content, and engaging with them on their social platform of choice.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="69a584ad-c6a8-4a2e-8a7e-7a4c1774e48a" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/saas-startup-growth-twitter.jpg" alt="engaging on Twitter" width="624" height="381" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Once your brand is more familiar to the influencer, have the founder or CEO send a personal email to the influencer offering a personal demo and a free license for a year (either to them or as a giveaway to their community),&#8221; suggests Tyler. &#8220;<strong>Do not </strong>do an automated outreach blast, and <strong>do not</strong> have the email come from a PR firm – all of those will get ignored.&#8221;</p>
<p>Keep the relationship with your core group of influencers going by sharing their content and continuing the conversation. &#8220;Check in to see if they are using the platform and if not, why not,&#8221; Tyler continues. &#8220;See what the obstacles are and how you can help them become power users of your platform. Over time, you will see that these influencers will continue to reference you, give shout outs and recommendations.&#8221;</p>
<h2>6. Blur the line between help articles and blog articles</h2>
<p>It’s 2019, which means you’re working on building content marketing and SEO to grow organic traffic – which also means your marketers are going crazy trying to figure out what content works and what to write next, according to Clwyd Probert, founder of digital agency <a href="https://www.whitehat-seo.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whitehat</a>. The answer? <strong>Make them work in support.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Existing customers are likely to ask the same questions as new customers would ask, and prospective customers/leads are likely to wonder as well,&#8221; Probert explains. &#8220;Figuring out what your customers worry about/are uncertain about allows you to answer it once and for all in a blogpost. This has the added benefit of appearing in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-for-startups">Google</a> when people search for &#8216;How to …'&#8221;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="54836346-553e-41b2-a4bc-c2eb5fb43676" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/saas-startup-growth-search.jpg" alt="search for startup growth strategies" width="674" height="407" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>This strategy is straight from <a href="https://www.leadfeeder.com/blog/ahrefs-content-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the playbook of Tim Soulo of Ahrefs</a>. &#8220;If you ever ask a question on Ahrefs’ Intercom (support chat), chances are they’ll offer a link to a blog that covers both product feature and strategic/marketing thinking,&#8221; says Probert.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">Early on in the buyer’s journey, it’s important to focus on the buyer, their problems and their goals. Probert confirms: &#8220;Follow an industry standard <a href="https://www.whitehat-seo.co.uk/knowledge/inbound-marketing-blueprint" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing blueprint</a> and build your website around the idea of helping your potential clients, and you will become an authority in your sector.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>7. Repurpose your content</h2>
<p>Content assets like white papers and ebooks offer a ton of lead-generating potential – but they are costly and time-consuming to produce. To get the most value from your content efforts, look into repurposing your content. &#8220;A single ebook can turn into a YouTube video, a blog series, a series of marketing emails, or an infographic,&#8221; says David Campbell of <a href="https://www.rightinbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Right Inbox</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Repurposing content allows you to connect with different audiences in the medium they prefer.&#8221;</p>
<h2>8. Launch your first partner program</h2>
<p>If it’s time to take your business to the next level in 2019, consider adding a partner program to your mix. Having a well-designed partner program can yield highly-motivated partners, which in turn can <a href="https://www.allbound.com/resource-center/aberdeen-study-partner-channel-sales-study-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lead to a 48% growth</a> in overall business revenue, according to research from partner relationship and channel management solution <a href="https://www.allbound.com/partner-management-solutions/simple-powerful-prm-software-for-building-successful-partner-programs/?utm_source=068&amp;utm_medium=googleadwords&amp;utm_term=allbound&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-268626664730&amp;hsa_ad=301803764621&amp;hsa_acc=6765831655&amp;hsa_grp=40338944281&amp;hsa_mt=e&amp;hsa_cam=700673924&amp;hsa_kw=allbound&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI96_2jIe34AIVAtbACh1jNgzVEAAYASAAEgJLf_D_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allbound.</a></p>
<p>The team at Allbound offers some tips for launching your first partner program. First, you’ll need to set a few guidelines to keep everyone on track:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Define your ideal partner persona</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>What is your ideal partner’s target audience, and does it overlap too much with your own target audience? How does your ideal partner sell? Does your ideal partner have a product that works well with yours?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Define partner goals</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Partnerships are about giving and taking. When entering into any partnership, you’ll need to figure out what a fair trade is for their services. Not only that, you’ll need to define the results you are hoping to see from your partner program.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Eliminate assumptions</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re looking for a successful partner program, you’ll need to define what steps need to be completed in order to achieve the goals you’ve put in place. Your partners should be an extension of your sales team, so it’s helpful to communicate what you expect from them on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Establish lines of communication</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If done incorrectly, having a partner program can be more work than owning a puppy. It’s important to set up your lines of communication right away. There are plenty of tools out there to help empower your partners with the content and resources they need to confidently sell.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Build a content library</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Put yourself in your partner’s shoes. It’s your first day on the job, what do you need to be successful? Content. Give your partners <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/15/quality-content-defined" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-quality content</a> that can help them answer questions and be proactive about their prospect’s needs.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Launch</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t expect your partner program to be perfect after the first week, month, or even year. Some of the biggest players in the game are still working on how to <a href="https://www.allbound.com/resource-center/19-ways-to-elevate-your-partner-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elevate their partner program</a>. The key is, keep trying, keep testing, and keep moving forward.</p>
<h2>9. Try PPC for non-promotional content</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Pierre de Braux of <a href="https://www.spiralytics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spiralytics</a> says one strategy he&#8217;s been seeing results with recently is PPC for non-promotional content like ebooks and whitepapers.</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="1942a539-4dbc-43ca-9738-6ef9a501dd3f" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">&#8220;Using mostly Facebook to &#8216;boost&#8217; gated content, we&#8217;ve been able to drive a relatively large number of conversions at a very competitive CPC,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;Sure, landing page <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/22/conversion-rate-optimizations">conversion rates</a><span lang="EN"> for PPC don&#8217;t quite match those of organic users, but the sheer volume of new leads coming in is tough to ignore. That&#8217;s why this strategy works so well for young companies and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/23/ways-startups-can-stand-out-saturated-market">startups</a> trying to build <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/05/brand-awareness-campaigns">brand awareness</a><span lang="EN"> and supercharge growth.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">&#8220;The end result is a solid (and cost-effective) list of leads who love your content. And that&#8217;s a great place to start nurturing.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>10. Use themed content clusters</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Dominique Jackson of <a href="https://www.copper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Copper CRM</a> says the top <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/27/growth-academy">growth strategy</a> his company implemented last year was to release their content in themed clusters. “Instead of publishing articles on random unrelated topics, we came up with broad themes and created 10-20 related articles for each,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;For instance, one theme was sales emails. We created around 20 in-depth articles covering topics like how to write an email after a trade show, or tips on writing open house follow-up emails.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">Not only did this allow them to reach highly-targeted audiences looking for very specific content, but it was very beneficial to their SEO efforts as well. &#8220;With this strategy, we were able to grow our organic blog traffic by over 200% in less than four months,&#8221; Jackson says. </span></p>
<h2>11. Reverse engineer CTAs</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Nissar Ahamed at <a href="https://www.atomicreach.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomic Reach</a> suggests one avenue to growth is reverse engineering calls-to-action. &#8220;Like many SaaS marketing teams, we relied on traditional CTAs such as ‘Book a Demo’ or ‘Talk to Sales’,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;However, we weren&#8217;t satisfied with our conversion rates. As our traffic continued to rise month over month, we had minimal conversions to show for it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>He says that&#8217;s when Atomic decided to drop the best practices and improvise. They approached their customer success team and got some insights into the conversations they were having with customers during the onboarding process. What they learned changed their entire approach and drove massive growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;We uncovered that more often than not, customers were using us to perform content audits,&#8221; says Ahamed. &#8220;We reverse engineered our CTAs and frequently visited landing pages by doing some keyword research. We discovered that the keyword ‘Content Audit’ was being searched approximately 700 times a month. By incorporating the keyword into our CTAs and landing pages, our conversion rates tripled, and continue to drive leads for us at a steady rate.&#8221;</p>

<h2>12. Employ infographics in new ways</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">One strategy that worked like a charm (and is still a game-changer) for infographics software company <a href="http://venngage.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Venngage</a> was using infographics to build links to their landing pages and blog posts. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">“We focused on creating viral infographics that visualized data and/or summarized our research findings, and pitched that to hundreds of publications,&#8221; explains Naser Alubaidi, Growth Marketer at Venngage. &#8220;We found that pitching a viral evergreen infographic was more effective than simply trying to get other blogs to link to our content.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Turns out infographics are far from dead, and rightfully so. According to MIT, <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2014/in-the-blink-of-an-eye-0116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90% of the information</a> sent to our brain is visual. </span></p>
<h2>13. Incorporate review portals</h2>
<p>Operating inside the SaaS industry, Matej Kukucka of <a href="https://www.liveagent.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LiveAgent</a> is working heavily with review portals and incorporating them inside their daily tasks.</p>
<p>&#8220;According to the user feedback, which we are collecting after each upgrade from a trial account, we found out that a lot of customers made the decision after going through one of the review portals,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;That made us respect them, not hate them for reducing our revenue. We are offering our customers Amazon gift cards for leaving us an honest review, since we are aware that people don’t leave reviews on their own after the purchase, and we want to compensate them for their time.&#8221;</p>
<h2>14. Focus on customer storytelling</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s a fact: <a href="https://medium.com/the-protagonist/the-science-behind-storytelling-51169758b22c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our brains are hardwired for stories</a>. That&#8217;s probably why customer storytelling is one of the most effective SaaS <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/12/growth-marketing">growth marketing</a> strategies out there.</p>
<p>The 2017 content preferences report from Demand Gen found that <a href="https://www.demandgenreport.com/resources/research/the-2017-content-preferences-survey-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">78% of B2B decision makers</a> used customer stories and case studies to research their purchases. And a report by DocSend analyzed 34 million data points and found that customer case studies have an <a href="https://labs.openviewpartners.com/34-million-data-points-show-what-type-of-sales-content-performs-best/#.XGKWZlwzbIU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">83% reading completion rate</a> compared to other sales content.</p>
<p>With the right kind of case studies, prospects can see themselves in your customers&#8217; shoes and will trust your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/08/brand-story">brand</a> to help them solve their biggest challenges. They&#8217;re also a great way to maximize the ROI of your content strategy because they can be used at every stage of the sales funnel.</p>

<h2>15. Leverage business networking events/workshops</h2>
<p>Business networking events and workshops are one of the most inexpensive ways to get the word out about your SaaS and make new contacts. &#8220;Get in touch with local and national business event organizers, breakfast meets, marketing events, and trade shows,&#8221; suggests Paul Granger of <a href="https://websitepromoter.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Website Promoter</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don’t be shy to get up and talk about your business, product or services. Remember to collect business cards and email addresses and see if you can get subscribers to your newsletters. Always follow up after events with people you’ve met to keep the relationship strong and see if you can work together on something mutually beneficial.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve tried hard to implement a bold and experimental culture when it comes to marketing at Mailshake. I don’t see failure as a bad thing; it’s fear of venturing into the unknown that I want to discourage.</p>
<p>Basically, my philosophy is this: <strong>Try it</strong>. If it doesn’t work, change your approach or do something different. <em><a href="https://sujanpatel.com/business/failing-fast-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fail fast</a></em>.</p>
<p>We tried a lot of different marketing tactics in 2018. Most failed, a few worked well, and a few more were home runs.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>That&#8217;s usually the reality of marketing. It’s also why I decided I needed to branch out and ask some of the best marketers I know to share some of their home runs in 2018.</p>
<p>Here’s the advice they gave me. I’m sharing it here so that you can implement these tactics for yourself in 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Update!:</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/18/best-marketing-strategies">The 19 Best Marketing Strategies to Get Results Now</a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/13/best-worst-marketing-campaigns"></a></p>
<h2>1. Building relationships with tools in our space</h2>
<p>Content is synonymous with digital marketing, to the point that nearly everyone is investing in it to some extent. This means standing out and getting results from content has never been harder. You need creativity, skill, and, perhaps most importantly, strategy. I learned this firsthand at Mailshake:</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, we didn’t have a lot of traction in our marketing efforts, specifically around content marketing. Rather than fight that uphill battle alone, the first thing we did was make a list of all the tools in our space (SaaS for salespeople), organize them by categories (CRMs, proposal software, prospecting, etc.), and write an article featuring them. <strong>This gave us an excuse to reach out with some flattery and with a link to their site, which opened the door to other co-marketing opportunities, like guest posting, webinars, and even product partnerships.</strong> It really became the bedrock of our marketing efforts in 2018 and was a good reminder that <a href="https://mailshake.com/blog/step-step-process-link-building-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing is all about relationships</a>, both with your customers and with other marketers in your space.</p>
<p>You can implement something similar by strategizing and utilizing your content on multiple levels. Don’t just write an article targeting one head term and hit “publish.”</p>
<p>Decide who will read and benefit from the content. Include influencers, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/19/influencer-marketing-content-promotion">leverage them</a> to help distribute your content, build relationships, and open doors to other marketing opportunities.</p>
<h2>2. Updating old content</h2>
<p>It’s harder than ever to stand out from the competition when it comes to content, but that doesn’t mean we always have to keep creating new, better content. Sometimes we can actually get great results by revisiting and updating old content.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">&#8220;One marketing tactic that we saw the biggest results from was simply giving lift to older content. We connected Google Analytics and Screaming Frog, and after crawling the website, we were able to organize the spreadsheet and drill down on blog posts that haven&#8217;t been viewed in 3+ years. Then, we sorted them by topic and after reviewing each blog post we&#8217;d decide whether it was best to just trash it, merge it with another post or update it with new content, imagery and a fresh title. This strategy is something we work on a little bit each month, because it does take time. However,<strong> this allows you to focus more on the evergreen content vs. sharing short-lived blog posts</strong>. For example, we&#8217;ve updated this blog post on <a href="https://thriveagency.com/news/free-plagiarism-checker-for-web-content/">duplicate content checkers</a> over the years, and it continues to be a top performer for us!&#8221; – <span lang="EN">Amber Ooley, <a href="https://thriveagency.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thrive Agency</a></span></span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">Image <span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/blogging-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></span></span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Want to implement the same? Grab a list of all your content using a website crawler that can be connected to Google Analytics so you can also gather traffic data, like <a href="https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Screaming Frog</a> or <a href="https://sitebulb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sitebulb</a>. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Check each URL (by hand), and then decide whether the content should be:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Combined with another post (advisable when you have multiple similar posts that are potentially competing with each other)</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Optimized and updated</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Ditched altogether</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Bear in mind that if you’ve got a long history of content creation, this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/07/best-marketing-strategies">marketing strategy</a> won’t be easy, and it will be time-consuming. Be prepared to spread it out over many months if necessary.</span></p>
<h2>3. Using SMS Chat</h2>
<p>In many cases, live chat is the platform of choice for customers looking to communicate with a company they do (or are considering doing) business with.</p>
<p>Specifically, <a href="https://www.superoffice.com/blog/live-chat-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30% of customers expect websites</a> to offer a live chat option. For customers on mobile devices, that percentage climbs as high as 62%.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="90a06945-1b64-4f07-b7f2-647a9bcac92f" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>It’s clear that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/14/chatbot-marketing">live chat</a> is an asset, but some companies have seen even better results by taking their chat offline.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">&#8220;Our best acquisition tactic was actually using our own tool. This past year we created an SMS Chat widget. On desktop, it looks like a live chat. The difference is that messages come in as texts and replies go as texts to the user&#8217;s cell phone. This way prospects don&#8217;t have to stay on our website to continue the conversation. We have <a href="https://www.textrequest.com/blog/ways-small-businesses-get-more-new-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several channels for bringing in traffic</a>, and they all produce leads, but SMS Chat has boosted our sales conversions significantly. <strong>We get a lead, we text them back ASAP, and they love it.</strong> SMS Chat works on mobile sites, too. Viewers just click a button to start a text.&#8221; – <span lang="EN">Kenneth Burke, Director of Marketing <a href="https://www.textrequest.com/queuniversity/sms-chat/">Text Request</a></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Implementing this yourself is relatively simple. Add an upgraded live chat service to your website that encourages visitors to input their phone number and asks their permission for you to text them. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Once the conversation has moved away from your website, you’re in a stronger position to keep it flowing, follow up, and convert more leads into sales.</span></p>
<h2>4. Forming linkbuilding partnerships</h2>
<p>There’s so much to be gained from looking at the search results, but most of us aren’t paying them nearly enough attention. Do some digging. You’ll learn who your true competitors are and get new ideas that will help you outrank them and gain more of the clickshare.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="2ee0de19-b408-4530-b5a2-5d800ee9ce3c" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Depending on the keywords you search for, you can also discover valuable potential link partners, which can land you a position in the top 10 for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/01/23/keyword-search-volume">high-traffic terms</a> that are too competitive for your own site to claim.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">&#8220;For us at LiveAgent, the best marketing tactic was to look for top money keywords via an SEO tool, in our case words like “Live Chat Software,” and look for all the variants and who was included in first top 10 results. Then, we pitched all the portals and tried to get a link or partnership going. <strong>Whether it was a review portal, blog, or magazine, the exposure led to both traffic increase and improvement in rankings.</strong>&#8221; – Matej Kukucka, Senior Growth Marketer, <a href="https://www.ladesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Live Agent</a></span></p>
<p>To implement this in your marketing strategy for 2019, pick <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/03/most-valuable-keywords-high-ctr">your top money keywords</a>, and, using either a tool or manual search, look at which sites and what content ranks in the top 10 for those terms.</p>
<p>Where appropriate (i.e., when the site isn’t a competitor), approach them with the goal of getting some of your own content onto those sites. If you succeed, you can still appear in the top 10 via a third-party site (even when your own site can’t break onto page one of Google for your top money keywords).</p>

<h2>5. Hosting highly-focused webinars</h2>
<p>Depending on the topic (and their quality), webinars can be an invaluable onboarding tool for new customers. They can also help with customer acquisition and retention.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">“We really invested in webinars in 2018, and as a result they became one of our biggest lead drivers. One of the things that we&#8217;ve really noticed is that <strong>the more focused a webinar, the better turnout we have</strong>. We work with dental practices so topics such as HIPAA, PPOs, and proper phone skills really get a great response. Viewers are engaged during these presentations and stick around for the full hour so they can take part in a Q&amp;A. They finally have somebody at their disposal to answer complex questions that affect their day-to-day!&#8221; – <span lang="EN">Jonathan Bass, Content Marketing Manager, <a href="http://www.revenuewell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RevenueWell</a></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Thinking about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/03/marketing-webinars">leveraging webinars</a> for the first time in 2019? To start you’ll need <a href="https://www.superoffice.com/blog/live-chat-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a platform to host them on</a>. </span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">You’ll also need to learn how to host a webinar that <a href="https://www.copyblogger.com/webinars-engage-convert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engages viewers and achieves its aims</a>. And last but not least, you’ll need to promote your webinar so the right people know about it, and <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33540/18-ways-to-guarantee-nobody-misses-your-next-webinar.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actually turn up when you want them to</a>. </span></p>
<h2>6. Leveraging video through guest blogging</h2>
<p>We’re viewing more video online than ever before. In fact, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/08/video-marketing-statistics">one third of online activity is spent watching video</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re not part of this ever-growing trend, there’s a good chance you’re missing out on the opportunity to engage with your existing customers, as well as potential new ones.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">“Our best marketing strategy in 2018 would be video marketing through YouTube. Hands down. With little investment and time spent, we focused on inbound strategies like showcasing our video quality through guest blogging and capitalized on our clients’ positive word-of-mouth to drive more people to see our content on the platform. This way,<strong> we managed to bring in over 4K new subscribers and 668K new views to our channel in 2018</strong>. An 81% and 89% increase, respectively, from our 2017 numbers.” – <span lang="EN">Victor Blasco, CEO of <a href="https://www.yumyumvideos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yum Yum Videos</a></span></span></p>
<p>Ready to experiment with video marketing? Lucky for you, it’s never been easier to get started. You just need a halfway-decent smartphone, a bit of charisma, and some basic editing skills (or a willingness to learn them). It also helps to learn a little about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/20/youtube-marketing">YouTube optimization</a>.</p>
<h2>7. Developing persona-based ebook marketing</h2>
<p>Today, written content doesn’t have to be good, or even great, to stand out. It has to be awesome. One way to start producing content that’s leaps and bounds ahead of what your competition is creating is to look beyond long-form blog content and write ebooks.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the beginning of the year, our content library consisted of a couple generic ebooks about branding and design. And while they performed well, we weren&#8217;t really getting the lead quality we wanted. <strong>We wanted to reach out to new audiences, and that required us to dive in and truly understand what mattered to them.</strong> Now, our library has grown to 10 ebooks that speak to various industries, such as franchises and real estate, about the challenges and opportunities most important to them.</p>
<p>For example, we published an ebook for marketing leaders at colleges and universities titled &#8220;<a href="https://www.lucidpress.com/pages/resources/report/branding-in-student-recruitment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Branding in student recruitment</a>.&#8221; Before writing the ebook, we didn&#8217;t know much about student recruitment, but the research process helped us get up close and personal with a challenge our clients deal with intimately. Hearing about their experiences gave us a much fuller picture of their day-to-day concerns – and how our platform could help them succeed. That ebook was our most popular one this year, driving hundreds of leads via LinkedIn ads, email nurturing, and blog promotion. As a result, we&#8217;ve closed more higher ed clients this year than any other, showing the value of a team-wide coordinated campaign that puts your audience&#8217;s unique challenges front and center.&#8221; – Karla Renee, <a href="http://lucidpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lucidpress</a></p>
<p>As with all content formats, there are countless people producing average (or less than average) ebooks.</p>

<p>To get results like Renee&#8217;s, you need to be much more than average. You need to be producing ebooks that are interesting, professionally written, and targeted at a specific audience – all while bringing something new to the table.</p>
<p>If you can achieve all that, getting into ebooks in 2019 could mean big things for your brand and your business.</p>
<h2>8. Optimizing blog content</h2>
<p>Writing great, unique, insightful blog content is a start, but for best results you need to be paying close attention to how you’re optimizing that content, too.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">“We <strong>optimized our website for conversions</strong>. We were driving a lot of traffic to our site and had solid organic search engine rankings, but that traffic wasn’t sticking and interacting with our site. We had a lot of great content in the form of white papers, ebooks, case studies, and webinars. Our mission was to pull that content forward and drive interaction through downloads. We looked at our top entry pages and developed specific calls to action on those pages. We looked at the keywords driving traffic to those pages and matched content and CTAs to those keywords. We included the CTA in several places on the page, including links towards the top of the page, bottom CTA image, and a slide-in pop-up that appeared after the user scrolled a third of the way down the page. Here’s an example from one of our most popular blog posts: <a href="https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/21-powerful-open-ended-sales-questions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">21 Powerful, Open Ended Sales Questions</a>. The results have been outstanding. We’ve <strong>more than doubled the conversion rate across our site</strong>, and inbound opportunities from organic search have grown by 32%.” – <span lang="EN">Erica Stritch, VP of Marketing at <a href="https://www.rainsalestraining.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RAIN Group</a></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Want to level up your content optimization in 2019?</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Blog post optimization typically starts with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/long-tail-keywords">long-tail keyword</a> tools like <a href="https://kwfinder.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KWFinder</a> and <a href="https://longtailpro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LongTailPro</a>, but it doesn’t need to end there. Try optimizing your content for conversions, too. Be heavier-handed with how you utilize CTAs, and, where appropriate, let keywords that drive traffic to your content influence how you phrase your CTAs.</span></p>
<h2>9. Testing non-traditional social media</h2>
<p>When you think “social media,” odds are sites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram come to mind—but there is so much more to social media than these “traditional” platforms.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">“In 2018, we focused more on non-traditional social media sites, such as Quora and Reddit, to try our outreach tactics and saw a great ROI. Those sites are categorized to be more specific, and they helped us reach our target audience more efficiently than general sites, such as Twitter and Facebook.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">It served as a public relations type of function. Earned media and engagement rather than paid. We gave advice to people looking for software solutions that would drive them to our site and also create more brand recognition. We found these people based on specific subreddits they belonged to and/or posts they had made. It takes more time than using an automated response, but having a chance to interact with such a niche target audience group in a more personal way improved our ROI in a very valuable way.” – <span lang="EN">Mackenzie Jones, <a href="https://technologyadvice.com/crm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechnologyAdvice</a></span></span></p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image <a href="https://www.quora.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look at leveraging more community-based platforms, like Reddit and Quora, as well as industry or subject-specific forums.</p>
<h2>10. Prioritizing User Experience on the blog</h2>
<p>Today’s consumers have high expectations when it comes to online experience. If your site’s not up to scratch, you can be sure you’re not getting the results you could be.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">&#8220;We doubled down on user experience this year. <strong>Focusing on improving our user experience has been incredibly useful in our SEO strategy in 2018 and helped us to triple our traffic </strong>as we placed a larger emphasis on the experience of our users, especially mobile users on the site.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">We redesigned our theme to make it faster and more usable, keeping mobile users in mind. We focused a lot on performance and reduced our page load speed by 300% as a large drop-off of users were due to a large page size. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Using user data, we are also able to track where in a blog post were the majority of people dropping off and modified the content to have a CTA around that point.” – <span lang="EN"><a href="https://jeremynoronha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeremy Noronha</a>, SEO Manager, <a href="https://foundr.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foundr Magazine</a> </span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Ready to make UX a bigger priority in 2019? </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Pay more attention to how visitors use your site. Look at the pages they drop off on and ask why. It might simply be that you’ve successfully answered their query, but there might also be a problem with the page, or the site in general.</span></p>

<h2>11. Including CTAs on our top-performing blog posts</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Well-written and optimized blog content is great for getting people to your site, but what then?</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">&#8220;Halfway through the year, we noticed that five of our top-performing blog posts made up 80% of our organic blog traffic. We decided to add two CTAs to each of these blog posts to see if we could convert any of this traffic. We used Sumo to design the CTAs, and we A/B tested different CTAs and found what worked best. <strong>We now generate daily sales from the visitors to the top five blog posts on our site thanks to our CTAs.</strong>&#8221; – <span lang="EN">David Campbell, Marketing Strategist, <a href="http://www.rightinbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Right Inbox</a> </span></span></p>
<p>Want to get more sales from your content, too?</p>
<p>When someone lands on your site via a blog post, odds are they’ll get the information they need, and leave. This is what we want to stop. While you’ll never “save” every visitor, you can make a big difference to the value your content delivers by being more aggressive with your CTAs.</p>
<p>Include CTAs within your content and alongside it. Don’t be afraid of exit pop-ups, either – after all, if that visitor was already leaving, what do you have to lose?</p>

<p>So what now?</p>
<p>Remember, when it comes to marketing, there is no one-size-fits-all. There are too many variables to ever say “do x and you’ll get y result.” To get the best results, you need to always be experimenting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A cold email is an email that’s sent without prior permission from or contact with the recipient. In many respects, a cold email is the same as a cold phone call – it&#8217;s just much less intrusive. This means it’s almost unanimously favored by both the sender and sendee.</p>

</div>
<p>Cold email <a href="https://www.saleshacker.com/cold-email-vs-spam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shouldn’t be confused with</a><a href="https://www.saleshacker.com/cold-email-vs-spam/"> spam emails</a>, which are sent to countless addresses at once, without researching the relevancy of the recipient or confirming that the email address itself even exists.</p>
<p>In contrast, a cold email is generally sent to a qualified prospect, meaning that at least some research has been done on whether the recipient is a fit – and that email address has been confirmed.</p>
<p>But does cold email work? And is it worth it?</p>
<p>In short: yes.</p>
<p><span lang="EN"><a href="https://blog.mailshake.com/100-sales-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">89% of marketers say that email is their primary channel for lead generation</a>, and for good reason. Cold email is an awesome tool for <em>all</em> businesses because it’s affordable, scalable, and effective. These benefits are even more apparent for small businesses.</span></p>
<p>Here’s how small businesses can start leveraging cold email to grow their business in five simple steps.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Build Your Email Lists</h2>
<p>Warning – obvious statement ahead: Before you can execute a cold outreach campaign, you need people to contact.</p>
<p>At this stage, make sure you <a href="https://thegood.com/insights/customer-personas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">target a focused customer persona</a>. To define that, begin by summarizing the characteristics of your best customers. Customer personas will help increase the relevance of your cold emails and increase your odds of getting a response.</p>
<p>There are a number of methods you can use to prospect for leads. You might choose to use one, some, or all of them. The most common form of prospecting, however (and where most small businesses are likely to start), is manual prospecting.</p>
<h3>Manual Prospecting</h3>
<p>Manual prospecting is time-consuming. On the other hand (if we forget for a minute that time = money), it’s free.</p>
<p>It also generally results in the highest quality of lists, with the most qualified prospects. That’s purely because no tool can replace human intuition for who is and isn’t a fit.</p>
<p>You can prospect manually using a multitude of tools, from Google for a simple search to <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/uk/blog/2016/02/7-ways-to-use-twitter-for-sales-prospecting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/little-known-ways-to-find-new-prospects-on-linkedin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a> for targeted queries, like in the example below.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e327e114-062a-4347-bdfe-5920e2386ed1" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN"><a href="https://linkedprospect.com/boolean-search-linkedin-find-prospects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image Source</a></span></em></p>
<p>Tim Watson, email marketing consultant at <a href="https://www.zettasphere.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zettasphere</a>, underscores the importance of diligent research in his own experience sending cold emails. “While permission-based emails need to be relevant, cold emails need to be personalized,” says Watson. “I often see open rates of over 40% on cold emails when I personalize my outreach with highly relevant information that I find in my prospect research.”</p>
<p>And a word to the wise: Don’t be tempted into buying data to quickly build your list of prospects. The data will be incomplete, inaccurate, and ineffective. You’ll also likely run into <a href="https://www.zettasphere.com/7-tips-so-you-dont-burst-your-deliverability-balloon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deliverability issues</a> that can negatively affect your domain&#8217;s reputation, which will make it harder to reach inboxes in the future.</p>
<p>Bottom line: You need to put in good, quality time with this mode of prospecting. And you definitely need to capture it within your <a href="https://technologyadvice.com/crm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer relationship management</a> system. That spreadsheet titled “Cold Prospects 2018” may work for you. But siloed data becomes useless data very, very quickly.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Learn How to Write a Great Email</h2>
<p>Some articles make writing cold emails sound easy—as easy as adjusting a template someone used successfully five years ago and hitting send.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s not that simple.</p>
<p>For one, using someone else’s template doesn&#8217;t constitute writing your own email. There’s also a good chance that by recycling templates, you’re sending emails your recipients have already seen. In other words, your insincerity will be plainly obvious, and your email will instantly be deleted (or worse – labeled as spam).</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>In practice, writing a good cold email is a skill. It’s a skill that comes more naturally to some than others, but it can be learned.</p>
<p>To get started, you should to learn the following <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/03/email-marketing-best-practices">email marketing best practices</a>:</p>
<h3>Craft Enticing Subject Lines</h3>
<p>The right <a href="https://www.voilanorbert.com/blog/sales-email-subject-lines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subject line</a> depends on the contents of your email, your goals for the email, and who you’re contacting.</p>
<p>However, as a general rule, this means that you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be concise.</li>
<li>Invite curiosity.</li>
<li>Be honest (i.e. not tricking recipients into opening your emails by misleading them).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="https://mailshake.com/blog/cold-email-subject-line-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learn more about crafting effective cold email subject lines here</a>.</p>
<h3>Write an Interesting and Convincing Email Body</h3>
<p>As with subject lines, the rules here depend on the goal of your email and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/01/31/email-marketing-with-buyer-personas">who you’re emailing</a>. The more qualified a lead, the easier it should be to capture and keep their attention. This means that when you’re sending cold emails to these prospects, you can get away with writing longer and more detailed emails.</p>
<p>You should still be keeping cold emails as concise as possible, but the more relevant your product is to your lead, the more leeway you have when writing your email.</p>
<p>But let’s take a step back.</p>
<p>Regardless of who you’re emailing, there are a few boxes all your messages should tick. Every email should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearly explain the purpose of your email.</li>
<li>Answer “What’s in it for me?” by demonstrating why your recipient should care.</li>
<li>Avoid using first person pronouns like “I”, “we” or “our,” and use words like “you” and “yours” instead.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tell Your Recipient What You Want to Happen Next</h3>
<p>All emails should end with a closing statement that acts as a call to action and tells the recipient what you want to happen next.</p>
<p>The trick here is to avoid being pushy or presumptuous. This is a cold email. This person has never spoken to you and may well never have heard of you. Do you really think they’d like a “quick call” with you next Tuesday at 2:15?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>They might, however, be open to receiving more information via email, especially if you can personalize that information with something like a custom demo video.</p>
<p>This does depend on the exact nature of the “cold” email, though. Someone who&#8217;s been on your site, consumed your content, and voluntarily added themselves to your email list might actually appreciate a phone call at this stage of the sales cycle.</p>
<p>Decide on an appropriate CTA by putting yourself in the recipient’s shoes. How would you respond if you were in their position and received this email? What would you want to happen next?</p>
<h2>Step 3: Let Your Email Signature Do the Rest of the Talking</h2>
<p>Your <a href="https://thriveagency.com/news/create-email-signature-works-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email signature</a> is an essential yet often overlooked marketing tool that can transform a good email into a terrific one.</p>
<p>Email signatures are especially relevant when it comes to cold emails because it’s an unobtrusive way to direct the recipient to more of your content. How? Dynamic email signatures can easily embed media (like a YouTube video) or link to your social media channels, blog, website, and more.</p>
<p>When your team is sending out cold emails, make sure to use an <a href="https://www.wisestamp.com/corporate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email signature management</a> tool so that your entire team is sending a unified message. Your signature can promote your upcoming event, webinar, ebook, whitepaper, or any content you choose.</p>
<p>See the signature examples below for inspiration.</p>

</div>
<h2>Step 4: Scale Your Cold Email Strategy</h2>
<p>Scaling cold email is a given for most businesses, but it’s even more important for small businesses that can’t afford to squander cash on campaigns that are unnecessarily labor-intensive.</p>
<p>If your outreach efforts currently involve sending emails directly from an inbox and tracking progress in a spreadsheet, I can guarantee you’re not being as efficient or effective with your outreach as you could be.</p>
<p>Invest in a tool like <a href="https://mailshake.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mailshake</a> or <a href="https://mailchimp.com/?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;ds_rl=1260419&amp;ds_rl=1260446&amp;ds_rl=1260760&amp;ds_rl=1260760&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI1JGdu9_03gIVj1qGCh3-QgCXEAAYASAAEgL-O_D_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mailchimp</a> so you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/13/targeted-email-marketing-strategies">create segmented campaigns</a>, make <a href="https://mailshake.com/blog/cold-email-templates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">effective use of templates</a> (and personalize them with ease), and schedule follow-up emails:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="7e9efdb5-11f7-4725-a68e-c721c0fb0a9d" data-langcode="en">

<p>By using an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/30/video-email-marketing">email marketing</a> tool, you’ll also be able to track open rates, responses, and link clicks. You can even see at a glance which subject lines and templates are getting the best (and worst) results.</p>
<h3>Score Your Leads</h3>
<p>It’s no secret that personalization has a big impact on how recipients respond to emails. It’s also not news to most that you can’t write a completely bespoke email to every contact, at least when you&#8217;re trying to scale.</p>
<p>But we need to be putting <em>some</em> effort into personalizing emails, so what’s the answer?</p>
<p>Lead scoring.</p>
<p>Scoring leads helps you determine how much you should personalize an email. The higher the score, the more effort you should put into personalization.</p>
<p>Typical metrics for scoring leads include things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Industry, job role, and seniority.</li>
<li>Whether they currently use a competitor&#8217;s product.</li>
<li>Whether or not you’ve had contact with them before.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can then assign scores to leads in an outreach tool and use that score to determine whether you’ll:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use simple merge fields to personalize according to name and company.</li>
</ul>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="b0a26375-551f-4311-8a16-c15f6ff9a317" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cold-email-mail-merge.jpg" alt="cold email mail merge" width="737" height="581" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Spend time <em>really</em> researching a prospect in order to <a href="https://beamery.com/blog/personalized-emails" target="_blank" rel="noopener">write a super-personalized email</a> that’s clearly been written for them and only them (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">just be sure not to sound like a creep while you’re at it</a>).</li>
<li>Write something in between. For example, use merge tags to automate completing name and company fields, alongside one or two personal references that show you’ve done your homework.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 5: Follow Up with Your Prospects</h2>
<p>Don’t assume that someone isn’t interested if they don’t reply to your first email. You don’t need to wipe them from your contacts list yet. Getting the cold shoulder on your first message is not the exception; it’s the norm.</p>
<p>In fact, one study found that <a href="https://mailshake.com/blog/100-sales-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">while 18% of recipients responded to the first email they were sent, 27% replied to the sixth email</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s a knack to sending effective <a href="https://www.rightinbox.com/blog/free-examples-of-follow-up-emails-thatll-get-you-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">follow-up emails</a>.</p>
<h3>Don’t Spam</h3>
<p>Leave a bigger gap between each email you send. It’s fine to send your first follow-up two or three days after your initial email. You should probably be waiting a few weeks between sending emails five and six.</p>
<h3>Avoid Generic Templates</h3>
<p>You know the type I mean:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="d2636bee-3d31-460c-a131-1fddd19f99df" data-langcode="en">

</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN"><a href="https://mailshake.com/masterclass/follow-up-email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image Source</a></span></em></p>
<p>Most recipients will have seen it all before and are going to pay no attention to your plea for a reply.</p>
<p><strong>Keep it simple, human, and, where possible, personalized.</strong></p>
<h3>Use Sequences</h3>
<p>Don’t send follow-up emails by hand (except, perhaps, to those few, super-highly-qualified leads). It’s a huge waste of time when most outreach tools make it really easy to create follow-up sequences.</p>

<p>Your initial email is just step one in successfully closing a sale with a cold contact. You are still responsible for moving the lead through the <a href="https://www.mailmunch.co/blog/sales-funnel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales funnel</a>.</p>
<p>While I’ve touched on the fact that your first email shouldn’t necessarily be followed by a phone call, that escalation will need to happen at some point in order for the sale to progress. That’s because while email is great for opening doors, it’s often impersonal and unsuitable for closing high-level deals.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a common mistake is separating email from all other stages of the <a href="https://blog.pandadoc.com/how-to-create-a-sales-process-map-for-your-sales-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales process</a>.</p>
<p>In only the very smallest companies will the same person be sending that initial outreach email <em>and</em> shaking on the final deal in the boardroom. Unless you’re in one of those companies, you simply cannot get away with allowing sales channels to exist in isolation.</p>
<p>Use email as your first touch point, and then nurture leads through your <a href="https://blog.pandadoc.com/use-sales-pipeline-boost-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales pipeline</a> using other channels (namely the phone, and in-person meetings) – just don’t depend on different members of your team to communicate effectively with each other during any hand-offs. It’s a poor use of their time, and it’s incredibly unreliable. The odds that<em> all</em> relevant information will get passed on are pretty much zilch.</p>
<p>So what’s the answer?</p>
<p>While I’d love to offer you up a choice of solutions, there’s only one that really works: a CRM.</p>
<p>Now, over to you – do you use cold emails in your sales process? If not, why not?</p>
