										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To quote one of my favorite clients whose business has been impacted by COVID-19: “This sucks, but we’ll get over it and be back better than ever.”</p>
<p>He’s right. The COVID-19 pandemic has been difficult for all of us so far, and it has been particularly difficult for the restaurant industry. Restaurants are facing unprecedented challenges to find ways to keep the lights on, with Americans staying home to flatten the curve and save lives. OpenTable found that <a href="https://www.opentable.com/state-of-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reservations are down 100% year over year globally</a>, which means these businesses are challenged to generate revenue solely through the available options: online orders for takeout or delivery and online gift card purchases.</p>
<p>The good news is that search trends indicate the demand for online ordering and take out is higher than ever. Check out the search volume around online ordering, for pickup or delivery.</p>

<p><strong>Now is the time to connect with your community online and turn them into lifelong customers. </strong>That’s why we’ve put together five tips to help restaurant owners pivot their Facebook Ad strategy so when things do return to normal your business will be stronger than ever.</p>
<p>P.S. We&#8217;re back with an update. You may now also want to check out these <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/27/post-pandemic-marketing-strategies">post-pandemic marketing strategies</a> that will help you to yield long-term gains.</p>
<h2>1. Target your local community on Facebook</h2>
<p>Marketing to your community means a personalized approach, and <a href="https://scontent-bos3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/89072001_250807969274239_4692504551180206080_n.pdf?_nc_cat=111&amp;_nc_sid=ad8a9d&amp;_nc_ohc=EwOgxrpFgzkAX8ZL0F2&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-bos3-1.xx&amp;oh=32093ff6f0edb0a5bd034bc84cab8f56&amp;oe=5EC612B3">Facebook is personalized marketing at scale</a>. Not only can you deliver a highly personalized message to your prospective customers, but you can also target users strategically and cost-effectively. There are over 2 billion users on Facebook and 700 million users on Instagram, and use of both platforms has been growing during the pandemic. In fact, Facebook recently hit  an all-time high of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/05/04/ppc-rebound-covid-19-data">2.6 billion monthly users</a>, and daily Instagram usage <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/style/viral-challenges-coronavirus.html">has increased</a>. With this huge potential for reach and the platform’s targeting options, Facebook offers almost unparalleled possibilities to reach your community. You can target local users, previous customers, or ideal customers with advertisements about delivery options, gift cards available, and any promotions or changes to service that you might be running during the pandemic.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="25f3ede2-a365-40ad-8b5f-ee821874ed20" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>The best part is that it’s cost-effective to reach your community on Facebook, too. Did you know that the food and beverage industry actually has the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/12/facebook-ad-benchmarks"> lowest CPC by industry on Facebook</a>?</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="229fd987-232e-45a6-be0b-6a401d4fdd37" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook_benchmarks_2019_CPC.png" alt="average cost per click on Facebook 2019" width="704" height="850" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>At $0.42 average CPC, you could capture 230+ clicks from just $100 of ad spend. Now, don’t take that metric at surface level. Yes, clicks are inexpensive for the food and beverage industry on Facebook, but that does not mean that all clicks are created equal! Creating a persuasive message and delivering it to the right audience at the right time is paramount to your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/11/restaurant-marketing-covid-19">restaurant marketing </a>campaign’s success. That’s why ad targeting and engaging with your community directly is so important, especially with your messaging. Which brings me to our next tip.</p>
<h2>2. Get creative with your messaging</h2>
<p>With people staying home there are ways to help them stay connected with your brand or discover your food for the first time. Advertise upcoming virtual events with DIY food kits or new recipes to try while staying home.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="7cc6b14d-ce90-453a-8e4a-b2d629d536ac" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Keep people in the know by announcing any changes to your food and beverage menu in your ads. Try marketing your loyalty program right now, or consider creating one. Facebook is currently <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/facebooks-testing-a-new-option-which-would-connect-brand-loyalty-programs/574521/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testing a new option</a> that would connect brand loyalty programs to in-app activity. While this is only open to certain brands, you can still use Facebook’s lead generation campaign format to market a loyalty program. Hopefully this pilot program will be open to more users after testing.</p>
<p>And whatever you include in your messaging, be sure to take advantage of the Facebook and Instagram news feed format by using mouth-watering imagery of your food that will make users stop as they scroll through their feed. An amazing image or video can go a long way—that might just be one of the reasons why the food and beverage industry has the second-highest CTR by industry on Facebook.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="4ff9207b-f037-424e-a688-221349dd880f" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<h2>3. Help your community</h2>
<p>Is your restaurant located near a local hospital, grocery store, or post office? Create a thank you promotion where customers can donate meals to say thanks for all of the hard work from essential workers.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="865b9f28-fe91-40a4-8bc2-9f36328a1aac" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Running ads to promote your initiatives will encourage your audience to donate meals to deserving front-line workers right now, helping your business make more of an impact. And it’ll also remind your customers that your business is still open for takeout and delivery.</p>
<h2>4. Market your restaurant’s app</h2>
<p>Use Facebook’s app install campaign objective to drive app installs. This is a great time to run these campaigns, which will lead to more online orders.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="d60ab72a-149a-4a5f-a819-d08fd7675354" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-for-restaurants-during-covid-19-starbucks.jpg" alt="Starbucks Facebook ad" width="372" height="526" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Don’t yet have an app? Head over to this <a href="https://www.websitetooltester.com/en/blog/app-makers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list </a>and choose from the many DIY app making offerings. Not only will this help in the short term, but it can also become the start of a future post-COVID-19 when your restaurant is thriving with online orders and in-house customers.</p>
<h2>5. Remember your marketing funnel</h2>
<p>As my English teacher used to say, “form follows function.” Facebook’s campaign objectives make it very easy to create a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/21/facebook-funne">marketing funnel</a>. Choose your campaign objectives based on the function or goal you are looking to achieve. In this case, use brand awareness to introduce your restaurant to your local community and remind them that they can support local business by ordering online. Optimize for leads, messages, or app installs to nurture users. Finally, optimize for conversions and target users at the “point of hunger” or bottom of the funnel ready to place an order!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re on the lookout for the next great thing to add to your marketing tool belt, look no further than Facebook’s Dynamic Ad Creative <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/170372403538781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feature</a>.</p>
<p>This new feature, accessible in the Quick Creation workflow, allows you to test the best combinations of your ad assets (images, videos, titles, descriptions, CTAs, etc.) across different audiences without having to do any of the heavy lifting manually.</p>
<p>I recently put it to the test against a standard ad set and the results were pretty impressive.</p>
<p>But before we dive into our use case, let’s run through how you can implement dynamic creative in your own <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/30/facebook-ads-account-structure">Facebook ad account</a>.</p>
<h2>Setting Up Dynamic Creative in Your Facebook Account</h2>
<p>To use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/20/facebook-dynamic-ads">Facebook dynamic ad</a> creative in your own campaigns, you will need to begin by creating a new ad set. Unfortunately, you cannot implement dynamic creative within an ad set already running with standard Facebook ads.</p>
<p>Select one of your existing campaigns or create a new one. If this is a new campaign you can click the Green Create Button in the campaign tab.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0376a5a1-e9a2-449e-a7eb-62c36baae9d7" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ads-manager-campaign-tab-overview.png" alt="facebook ad manager campaign tab overview" width="700" height="135" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>This will open the quick-creation workflow, where you can start by naming your new campaign.</p>
<p>Next, select the buying type. You will be presented with two choices: <strong>Auction or Reach and Frequency</strong>. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/07/goal-talk-episode-9">Auction</a> will allow you to bid to reach your audience at the lowest possible price; reach and frequency means you pay a fixed price to predictably reach your brand’s audience.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="a7c49e5b-1eac-4299-b0e0-5ab0f36d0b10" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ad-audience-auction-or-reach-and-frequency.png" alt="facebook ad goal auction or reach and frequency" width="700" height="189" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Next you will need to select your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/26/facebook-objectives">Campaign Objective</a>.</p>
<p>Here you will be presented with a host of objectives grouped into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Awareness</li>
<li>Consideration</li>
<li>Conversion</li>
</ul>
<p>The one you select will depend on your personal business goals and strategy. In the example I’ll touch on later in the post, we chose a Conversion Optimized campaign.</p>
<p>Next you can start creating your dynamic ad set. First, start by choosing the Conversion you would like<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/01/facebook-competitive-advertising"> Facebook to optimize </a>for. You can optimize around an action taken on your website, in your app, or within Facebook Messenger.</p>
<p>The next step is the <strong>most important part</strong> since it is here that you will turn on the Dynamic Creative Feature capability.</p>
<p>You will find this nestled between the Conversion and Budget &amp; Schedule Tiles:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="53d032bc-54b4-43d2-a26e-63dc3e64d1c4" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>From here, you can set your budget and schedule as usual and then make your way over Audience tile to set up your targeting. Facebook offers a host of different powerful targeting options to choose from. I always recommend starting somewhat broad at first so Facebook’s algorithm has enough data to optimize. To maximize your results, you want to find the sweet spot in terms of audience size and budget.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="107ecf9e-87fc-4090-9b5d-bcd8c568a79f" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>I usually refer to the Audience Definition gauge (depicted above) on the right side of the workflow to determine if I need to adjust the targeting and budget. This is key since you can quickly see before launching your ad set if the audience is too small.</p>
<p>Once your targeting method is chosen, you will need to define which placements you would like to advertise on: Facebook, Instagram, Audience Network, and Messenger.</p>
<p>In order to provide the Dynamic Ad set with the most options I recommend choosing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/03/20/facebook-advertising-myths">Automatic Placements</a>, then optimizing after you’ve recorded enough impressions to make data-backed adjustments.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="51a23e15-e887-49a0-9b38-933d14bfff2f" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Once your new ad set is finished you can start creating your dynamic ad. (Oh and if you’re in the mood for some must-know Facebook optimizations for advertisers ballin’ on a budget, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/31/low-budget-facebook-ad-campaigns">check out our killer guide</a>!)</p>
<h2>How to Ensure Great Dynamic Ad Creative</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/24/facebook-creative-hub">Creating the ad</a> is the fun part, since you can put your top, best-performing Ad Titles, Ad Text, Images, Ad Descriptions, and CTA’s together and let Facebook find the best combination.</p>
<p>Like a normal Facebook ad, you can now use the Ad creation work flow to import your image creative, destination URL, Text, and CTA. The difference here is you can add up to five variations of these assets all at once.</p>

<p>After adding your creative you can preview different variations of your new <a href="/blog/ws/2021/03/10/customize-facebook-dynamic-product-ads">Dynamic ad </a>by selecting the Preview Ad radio button. This is handy to see what your ads could potentially look like before going live. I would recommend taking a quick look here to make sure your copy combinations all make sense.</p>
<p>To view performance by Dynamic Creative asset you can head over to the ads tab and select the breakdown drop down.</p>

<h2>Facebook Ads Dynamic Creative: The Results</h2>
<p>To measure the success of this campaign, we created a control ad set with the same targeting as our dynamic ad set but a <em>single, unchanging ad</em>.</p>
<p>While I would normally not suggest creating two ad sets targeting the same audience, since that can cause audience overlap and drive up costs, for the sake of the experiment we did this to make sure we were comparing apples to apples. One word of caution, it did take longer than normal for the dynamic ad set to gain traction; however, <strong>once Facebook optimized for the best combination the results were much better than its static counterpart</strong>.</p>
<p>We ran this experiment for over 30 days to get a true sense of performance. In our test, we saw <strong>60% more conversions generated by the dynamic creative ad</strong> set than the standard version. Efficiency also improved, with a <strong>55% lower cost-per-conversion for ads using dynamic creative. </strong></p>
<p>One interesting finding when comparing these two ad sets was the difference in Ad Frequency. While CPM was 12% cheaper in the Dynamic Ad Set, the frequency the dynamic ad was shown was 45% higher than the standard ad set.</p>
<p>It is possible the dynamic ads are less likely to experience ad fatigue over the same time frame than a standard ad allowing the algorithm serve one of the combinations more frequently thereby increasing likelihood of the desired user action.</p>
