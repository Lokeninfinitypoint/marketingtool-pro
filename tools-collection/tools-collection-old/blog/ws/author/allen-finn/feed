<p><span lang="EN">Things have changed.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Now, in a dozen states (and counting), you can walk into a store with nothing more than a license and a fistful of cash and select from assorted prerolls, vape pens, and THC-laden sweet treats. Heck, Illinois did $39 million in sales in its first month and, by the time you read this, that won’t even be impressive.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">The recreational cannabis industry is booming, folks, and it’s just getting started. </span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">Unfortunately, the marketing of cannabis—and CBD, it’s non-psychoactive cousin peddled by gas station attendants and ecommerce #brands as cures to every ailment imaginable with impunity—remains woefully behind. This is part regulatory hamstringing, part foolhardy hubris; in many fledgling markets, the prevailing attitude remains: “Marketing?! My customers are still in awe that they can buy a blunt in a spot that looks like an Apple store.” </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">In what follows, I&#8217;ll share what I&#8217;ve learned over the past several years running a marketing agency that caters to the cannabis industry. I&#8217;ll share an industry snapshot as well as what I see as the biggest challenges for cannabis marketers. Finally, I’ll review seven common marketing channels through the lens of a cannabis marketing:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Paid search</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Paid social</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Programmatic advertising</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Content/SEO</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Email marketing</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">SMS</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Out-of-home advertising</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Some are hot fire, others are tire fires, and some blacklist the devil’s lettuce entirely; today, you’ll learn where it makes sense to spend your time and money if you hope to drive revenue and sidestep regulatory wrath.  </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">But first…</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">Cannabis marketing: An industry snapshot</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">The cannabis industry is, uhhhhh, not small.</span></p>

</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Despite a tenuous federal status, the legal cannabis market spans 33 medical and 13 medical/recreational states and is comprised of more than 10,000 businesses. The space is experiencing rapid growth, with sales in excess of $14 billion in 2019 and projected to reach <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/exclusive-us-retail-marijuana-sales-on-pace-to-rise-35-in-2019-and-near-30-billion-by-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$25 billion by 2021</a>.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">While cannabis has created cottage industries across the country (ancillary businesses ranging from armored cars to delivery apps, IoT soil regulators to PoS systems), plant-touching businesses—a very literal industry term—can be subdivided into the following segments.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Dispensaries: The local businesses of the cannabis industry</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Ah, the SMB, the backbone of America. Dispensaries are often small, local businesses with limited marketing budgets looking to drive foot traffic and, ultimately, sales. They’re like any other brick-and-mortar, but with more red tape and longer lines.</span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Dispensaries tend to struggle mightily with advertising because, well, most of what’s out there seems unfathomably expensive (who actually knows what a billboard costs, anyway?) or nonexistent. As such, these businesses lean heavily on email and SMS to cross-sell and drive repeat business. While this certainly improves customer lifetime value, or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/10/cac-vs-clv">CLV</a>, it has virtually no impact on net-new customers. </span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN">CPG: Think “smokable White Claw”</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">As in any other industry, cannabis features its own suite of consumer goods vying for shelf space and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/18/loyalty-marketing">customer loyalty</a>. While the existence of consumer-packaged goods, or CPG, brands in the space is mostly limited to mature recreational markets today, their prevalence will undoubtedly increase (particularly as rights to launch established brands in nascent markets are sold off and, eventually, interstate commerce becomes a reality). </span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="3e5dfcff-59d3-43bd-ac8d-9d406436f620" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">For these businesses, the ability to develop and target an audience across brand-safe digital properties is essential; it’s also a huge challenge. The lack of availability and accessibility on the digital front. Worse still is the fact that CPG brands are reliant on second-hand or anecdotal data to determine the efficacy of digital campaigns designed to drive foot traffic in dispensaries that stock their products. This makes CPG brands discerning spenders who are forced to lean heavily on secondary metrics (impressions, brand lift, etc.) to gauge success.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">You can roll most CBD brands into this category but with one key caveat: The ability to peddle wares online makes tying clicks and impressions to revenue a cinch, so you can treat CBD brands like any other ecommerce client (with some mode-specific FDA hurdles).</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN">Multi-state operators: Marijuanopolies-in-waiting</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Last but certainly not least, we have the large, often publicly traded entities, multi-state operators (colloquially referred to as MSOs).</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">These folks typically operate dispensaries across the country <em>and</em> have their own in-house CPG brands to boot; they also tend to have the most advanced in-house marketing teams (and marketing needs). </span></p>

<h2>Cannabis marketing channels: What to use and what to avoid</h2>
<p>Now, we&#8217;ve covered what the cannabis industry looks like and who the players are in cannabis marketing—it&#8217;s time to get into how you can reach your potential customers. Because depending on the novelty of buying blunt in a spot that looks like an Apple store just won&#8217;t hold up.</p>
<p>Cannabis marketing is highly regulated and highly monitored, so you need to know where you can market. Here are seven common marketing channels and how they work (or, spoiler, don&#8217;t work) for the industry.</p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Cannabis marketing channel #1: Paid search</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Although paid search can be a very effective tool for non-cannabis organizations to acquire more customers (preaching to the choir here), cannabis organizations are not able to use it at this time. Google’s ad policy clearly states that “ads for substances that alter mental state for the purpose of recreation or otherwise include ‘highs’” are <strong>not allowed</strong>:</span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Which makes this <em>super</em> interesting:</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="87655198-352f-4ce1-94ea-4d273080535a" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cannabis-marketing-paid-search-google-example.jpg" alt="cannabis marketing ad on the Google SERP" width="345" height="337" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">That’s an ad for a dispensary! And a poorly geotargeted one at that; I’m in Jamaica Plain, MA, and I’m being served an ad for a dispensary in Florida. The commercialization of these terms would suggest that changes could be on the horizon (at least in legal markets), but there’s been no official word from Google on the matter. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Until that’s the case, I would advise against tempting the search gods. If you operate a dispensary, there’s too much to be gained from a functional Google My Business account and access to your customers’ inboxes to fly in the face of clearly written policy.</span></p>
<h4><span lang="EN">Recommended for:</span></h4>
<p><span lang="EN">I mean, everyone … if it were kosher. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">The ability to target the canna-curious (top and mid-funnel prospects) and those looking to allow for creative differentiation that you’re not going to get anywhere else. That being said, I’d advise capping your search-related endeavours at SEO and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/27/google-my-business">GMB optimization</a> until Google gives the OK.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Cannabis marketing channel #2: Paid social</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Social media has quickly become one of the most crucial tools for digital marketers to communicate their message effectively to a specified target audience, ostensibly replacing blogs in the B2C space.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Cannabis is no exception.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">That being said, major social platforms parallel search’s ban on ads. While cannabis companies can maintain a social media presence to engage and communicate with their customers it is still against <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policies/ads/prohibited_content/drugs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook’s advertising policy</a> to promote cannabis through Instagram and Facebook advertisements: </span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="ec732581-aba7-4586-b8b7-354b5adb1a62" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cannabis-marketing-paid-social-facebook-rules.jpg" alt="cannabis marketing rules for Facebook ads" width="418" height="475" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Crushing, I know. The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/10/facebook-ad-targeting-options">exceptional targeting</a> options afforded to advertisers (including but not limited to age; many states require advertisers to ensure 70+% of their audience is 21+) would make Facebook/Instagram the ideal place to reach cannabis consumers. The creative units would make for a true brand-building </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Now, there are marketers in the space who claim to have <a href="https://www.coladigital.ca/can-dispensaries-advertise-on-facebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found haxxx</a>, but <em>can</em> and <em>should</em> are not the same thing. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Like GMB, Facebook business pages and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/28/facebook-messenger-marketing">Facebook Messenger</a> represent an invaluable customer services tool and a means by which to engage with prospects and customers in an unpaid, promotional capacity; Instagram, while less of space for promoting deals, is also an exceptional organic brand-building tool. Giving up the opportunity to leverage these channels in the name of running a few ads that <em>might </em>lead to an online cart complete (not a transaction, mind you), is a fool’s errand. </span></p>
<h4><span lang="EN">Recommended for:</span></h4>
<p><span lang="EN">Folks who sell ”topical hemp” (read: CBD that goes on your skin, not in your mouth) can advertise on social without incurring the wrath of Zuck; they’ve been given the green (okay, more like gray) light to <a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/facebook-tweaking-policy-cbd-ads/">run ads on Facebook and Instagram</a>. If you sell cannabis—or orally administered CBD—avoid paid promotion on Facebook for now. </span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Cannabis marketing channel #3: Programmatic advertising</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Imagine you could zoom out and see what (almost) everyone on the internet is doing in real-time. If you could cherry-pick specific people to reach based on content they&#8217;re consuming and where/when they’re consuming it.</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0875022b-91cb-4407-b0ed-d3142904493b" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cannabis-marketing-programmatic-advertising.jpg" alt="programmatic advertising" width="582" height="183" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">That’s what programmatic advertising allows you to do.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">I’m biased here as <a href="https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/toasted-collective-is-bringing-programmatic-advertising-to-the-cannabis-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helping cannabis brands execute programmatic ad buys</a> is how I make my livin’, but it’s one of the most effective ways to reach current and future cannabis consumers in a compliant fashion.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">While it may sound terrifyingly complex because of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/23/marketing-buzzwords">buzzword soup</a> in which it&#8217;s mired (DMP, VTC, SSP, DSP, etc.), programmatic is really just the digital ad buying you’re used to on steroids. It started as a means by which to buy the inventory on websites nobody else wanted; the placements publishers couldn’t sell for top dollar were offloaded and sold on the cheap in a real-time auction.</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="5b2b48a2-000b-4279-908c-94786d9cfb01" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cannabis-marketing-programmatic-advertising-example.jpg" alt="cannabis marketing programmatic advertising map" width="453" height="237" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">This has since evolved to encompass premium inventory and many different ad units (display, native, video, OTT, DOOH: the acronyms never stop!); it’s a way for agencies and brands to use first- and third-party targeting data to reach their ideal customers across an incalculable number of potential impressions.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Now, as it pertains to cannabis, programmatic is still largely unavailable; the biggest, sexiest exchanges (read: Google) do not accept the category. It’s simply too much of a headache to deal with state-level regulation to warrant opening the floodgates. As such, most established agencies and ad tech orgs can’t or won’t touch the space.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Sucks, huh?</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Unless, of course, you have access to pre-negotiated private marketplace deals that allow you to advertise across premium media properties and harness more than 250mm unique impressions each month. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Over the last 18 months, <em>some</em> publishers have begun to open their inventory to cannabis brands, albeit with regulations more stringent than most states. The general rule(s) of thumb:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Avoid people.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">No depictions of consumptions.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">No health claims.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">No use of words like “weed,” “cannabis,” and “marijuana.”</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Lean towards educational vs. transactional CTAs.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Provided you can craft compliant creative <em>and</em> adhere to state and city/town regulations (which are constantly changing), you can leverage programmatic advertising to reach new and existing customers online.</span></p>
<h4><span lang="EN">Recommended for:</span></h4>
<p><span lang="EN">Everyone in the cannabis space with marketing dollars. Duh.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">On a more serious note&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">If you’re a dispensary owner, the hyper-local targeting capabilities available to you are unrivaled; better still, you can pair programmatic with your email and SMS campaigns to build powerful retargeting funnels.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">If you&#8217;re a CPG brand, the ability to tailor an ideal customer profile through third-party data makes it easier to drive your target consumer into dispensaries that stock your products.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">And if you’re an MSO, you can do everything above and more, there just happens to be more red tape—what’s allowed in State X is explicitly forbidden in State Y and ambiguously defined in State Z.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Cannabis marketing channel #4: Email marketing</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Email marketing is one of the most effective marketing channels for cannabis organizations as it allows them to communicate their message without restrictions (outside of opt-in, of course).</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">If an organization can incentivize customers to opt into their email list—either during an in-store purchase or with a CTA on their website—by offering some type of deal or discount to subscribers this can be an excellent way to build leads and push marketing to existing or prospective customers. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">It’s also one of the few places where product-centric creative—which is to say, marketing material that actually depicts what’s being sold as opposed to, like, nebulous stock photos of a middle aged couple gazing off into the sea during a blustery twilight—can shine. Where you can promote <em>deals</em>. Check out this email from <a href="https://curaleaf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Curaleaf</a>’s Arizona team:</span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">If you tried to run a product shot of tincture in a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/02/banner-ads-examples">banner ad</a> (or, god forbid, on Instagram), you’d be shut down. Here, it’s totally kosher.</span></p>
<h4><span lang="EN">Recommended for:</span></h4>
<p><span lang="EN">Everyone. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Everyone with a cannabis business should be using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/03/email-marketing-best-practices">email marketing</a>. Even if it’s just a MailChimp account, there is no excuse to avoid this valuable (ostensibly free) touchpoint. Plus, since dispensaries are often mandated by states to have some sort of CRM in place, they are actively collecting the requisite information anyway. No excuses.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Cannabis marketing channel #5: Content/SEO</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Nobody knows the value of a killer content marketing program quite like WordStream. I challenge you to search anything PPC-related and find something other than a WordStream blog post at the top of the SERP.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Cannabis is like most industries in that authoritative sites that invested in content early and often rool the roost. For paid search, it’s WordStream. For inbound marketing content, it&#8217;s HubSpot. For cannabis, it’s Leafly.</span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Trying to get a website to rank for mid-funnel, educationally-leaning search terms in 2020 is a fool’s errand. </span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">As a result, attempting to build a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/17/content-marketing-stats">content marketing program</a> around these terms is akin to spinning your tires. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Fortunately, opportunity still exists at the<strong> local level. </strong></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">While <a href="http://www.mypureoasis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pure Oasis</a>, for instance, is never going to rank for “dispensary” or “best indica-leaning hybrid,” it can certainly rank for hyper-local search terms like “recreational dispensary boston.”</span></p>

</div>
<p><span lang="EN">As is the case for any other local business, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/12/local-seo">optimizing local SEO</a> by creating and updating a GMB account, soliciting quality reviews and backlinks, and ensuring local keywords make an appearance in your metadata, copy, and URLs can be the difference between discoverability and certain death.</span></p>
<h4><span lang="EN">Recommended for:</span></h4>
<p><span lang="EN">Dispensaries! A concerted focus on local SEO should be table stakes for any local cannabis retailer.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">The increased footprint of MSOs will make it easier to rank for higher-competition keywords, but location-specific pages (or microsites, depending on state requirements) should adhere to the same best practices outlined above.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">CPG brands, on the other hand, will likely struggle to gain traction via content and good SEO; keywords like “tincture” and “preroll” are dominated by Leafly or dispensary sites optimized for hyperlocal variants. They’re better off leaning on organic social.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Cannabis marketing channel #6: SMS</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">SMS advertising can often be a difficult channel to navigate due to privacy and regulatory concerns; customers often refrain from opting into receiving marketing materials by text, leaving little room for advertisers.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">But while it might feel like a thing of the past, SMS marketing—&#8221;direct mail” delivered via text message—is a boon for the cannabis industry.</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="8f6df0e9-dc9e-45be-a79f-f5675969e63c" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Dispensaries can use SMS marketing tools like <a href="https://sprout.online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sprout</a> to inform customers of new products or special discounts and, ultimately incentivize repeat visits. This is particularly valuable in saturated markets, where a customer’s loyalty ultimately lies with their wallets; in what can quickly become a race to the bottom price-wise, fostering engagement through cross-selling and upselling with manicured, persona-based offers are incredibly valuable.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Since SMS messaging has such a <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2019/01/roi-showdown-sms-marketing-vs-email-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high open-rate</a> (~98%!), it is key that cannabis businesses communicate their messages briefly and effectively with more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">personalization</a>; there’s no better way to engage an existing customer.</span></p>
<h4><span lang="EN">Recommended for:</span></h4>
<p><span lang="EN">Dispensaries.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">If you operate a dispensary and you aren’t leveraging SMS—or its media rich cousin, MMS (multi-media messaging)—please start ASAP.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">If you operate multiple dispensaries, take a step back and really assess your options. Multi-state operators can run into some serious fees when using an SMS service, as many charge based on volume. If you’re slinging a few hundred thousand messages a month, you may want to have a conversation with your provider and negotiate more favorable terms; most are amenable. </span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Cannabis marketing channel #7: OOH</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">I went to Vegas about a month ago to visit with some <a href="http://www.redwoodcultivation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabis cultivators</a> and <a href="https://groveinc.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBD producers</a> and the thing that shocked me most wasn’t the sheer volume of dispensaries but, rather, the sheer volume of billboards and cab ads.</span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">As far as cannabis markets go, you could not possibly get more different from Boston, where there’s a single dispensary (soon to be two!) and a few billboards over by the airport. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">As restrictions are lifted on cannabis for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/26/out-of-home-advertising">out-of-home advertising</a> (billboards, vehicle wraps, bench ads, etc.) this channel is quickly becoming an effective way to grab consumers attention and get some buzz around your cannabis brand. Every state has different rules around OOH advertising, but most of the time they boil down to this:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Don’t put it near a school.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Don’t depict consumption.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Don’t depict product.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Don’t make health claims.</span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">DO</span></strong><span lang="EN"> ensure that 70+% of viewers are over 21 years old (and get it in writing from your vendor).</span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">DO</span></strong><span lang="EN"> add the state’s required disclaimer. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">These disclaimers will vary. In Nevada, for example, it’s this: &#8220;For use by individuals 21 years of age or older only. Keep out of reach of children. It is illegal to drive a motor vehicle while under the influence of marihuana. National Poison Control Center 1-800-222-1222.”</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Some states also have educational requirements; others disallow OOH entirely (Michigan did until they rolled out recreational at the beginning of the year). </span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Although it is often difficult to measure returns on OOH, the most successful out-of-home advertising grabs consumers attention and quickly resonates with the target audience to leave them with a lasting impression of your brand or service. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">While it’s not as exact as device ID or cookie-based tracking, here are a few of the ways you can measure the effectiveness of OOH advertising for cannabis:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Direct response:</span></strong><span lang="EN"> By using a market or billboard-specific vanity URL (something like [brand][location].com or [yournormalurl].com/[location or promotion]), you can measure both site traffic and sign ups based on entry point; this is also a great opportunity to share region-specific <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">value propositions</a> and regulatory information with your new customers. </span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Additional form field:</span></strong><span lang="EN"> Asking prospects where they hear about your cannabis brand once they hit your website is also a viable way to gauge efficacy. This is reliant on self-reporting—you could make the field mandatory or optional—but if it&#8217;s a radio button or drop-down appended to your existing form, it’s not a big deal to ask this question. </span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Flight-based: </span></strong><span lang="EN">The least scientific option, this involves simply cycling periods in which you are or are not running OOH ads in order to get an idea as to how they impact success. </span></li>
</ul>
<h4><span lang="EN">Recommended for:</span></h4>
<p><span lang="EN">Pricing varies wildly based on location, duration (typically rates are quoted in four-week increments) and inventory, but OOH is a solid route for most cannabis businesses looking to expand outside of digital marketing.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">No matter what kind of cannabis business you’re marketing, if you’re entering a geo with established players (or none at all), OOH advertising is an effective way to reach eyeballs. It’s the perfect complement to digital activity (and, as an added benefit, it can make investors feel warm and fuzzy inside: never a bad thing in a volatile market).</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">For cannabis marketing, it’s omnichannel or GTFO</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">While not every channel outlined in this post is appropriate for every kind of cannabis business or budget threshold, I advise you to take a look at what you can manage and spread your time, energy, and dollars across multiple tactics; reliance on a single strategy for acquisition and customer marketing and an ever-changing landscape is setting yourself up to fail. Diversify!</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Oh, and <em>please</em> familiarize yourself with the regulatory environment in which you (or your clients) operate. Failure to comply means fines, and crackdowns on the folks to follow the letter of the law. Don’t you dare harsh my mellow.</span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Intricate lighting. Tryptophan comas. Mother-in-laws.</p>
<p>Yup: the holiday season is finally underway. For most people that means truncated workweeks, a few extra layers for the daily commute (in our neck of the woods, at least), and those warm-fuzzy feelings incited by too much time spent among distant relatives. For ecommerce advertisers, however, the end of the year inevitably comes with a heaping side of unyielding stress.</p>
<p>Unless, of course, you’ve decided to alleviate the pre-yuletide neuroses associated with managing your Google search and shopping ads with product promotions.</p>
<p>Today, I’m going to show you how you can gain a distinct competitive advantage in Google Ads using one (or every) flavor of these powerful tools. For those unfamiliar, product promotions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Merchant Center-only promotion extensions</li>
<li>Implementing sale pricing within your shopping feed</li>
<li>Pricing and promotion extensions (these are for search ads, but they’re particularly useful for ecommerce advertisers!)</li>
</ul>
<p>For each, you’ll learn what each promotion is, when to use them, and, most importantly, how to implement them in your Google Ads account.</p>
<p>But first&#8230;</p>
<h2>The (Rather Obvious) Case for Product Promotions</h2>
<p>Holiday shoppers are a fickle bunch.</p>
<p>They’re picky. They’re price-conscious.</p>
<p>But if they can be counted on for one thing, it’s that they always do their homework. How else are they going to scope out those unmissable deals, huh?</p>
<p>Given that we live in an era in which phonelessness is closer to limblessness than a mere faux pas, it’s a given that this research is happening in the palms of your prospective customers’ hands, <em>not </em>as they serendipitously stroll past your storefront.</p>
<p>In fact, according to <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/four-types-holiday-shoppers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google </a>, 89% of deal seekers (holiday shoppers hungry for savings) use a search engine while shopping.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>More impressive still is that the time they spend shopping on their phones is a stone’s throw from <em>double </em>that which is spent shopping in-stores.</p>
<p>With so much shopping time spent interacting with search engines, the opportunities for deal-hungry eyeballs on your (search and shopping) ads are aplenty. <em>Seems prudent to signpost potential cost savings in as many ways as you can, right</em>?</p>

<h2>Add Sale Pricing to Your Merchant Center Feed</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most obvious way to notify your prospective ecommerce customers of a sale is to, uh, change your pricing to reflect said sale.</p>
<p>Google allows you to do this by <a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6324471?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding</a> the “<strong>sale_price</strong>” and “<strong>sale_price_effective_date</strong>” attributes to your shopping feed.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="98cb2df7-18c4-43ce-9c1d-4555f8b658b3" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>How does it work? Simple.</p>
<p>When the sale price effective date hits, your sale price will appear in your shopping ads as in place of your original price. But wait, there’s more! Sometimes, both the original price may <em>and</em> the sale price will show simultaneously (as is the case in the image below), showing your prospects just how exquisite your sale truly is.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="8d856b1b-e7fa-4eee-817f-63d5419a3ebe" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shopping-promotions-google-shopping-promotion-price-annotation202800229.png" alt="Shopping promotion price annotation" width="122" height="250" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>This is called a sale price annotation, and it comes with a few stipulations. Your original price:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must have been charged for a period of at least 30 consecutive days in the past 180 days.</li>
<li>Must be valid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, your shiny new sale price:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must be lower than the base price.</li>
<li>Must represent an offer greater than 5% and less than 90% of the original price.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do <a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/9017019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these things</a>, and your shopping ad will have some panache. The sale price will show as the current price alongside the original price, which will show with a strikethrough. Your ad will also show with a badge that highlights your sale. The specific colors used for annotations differ depending on where your ad appears.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not the annotation shows, there are, of course, some additional hoops to jump through (thanks, Google!) in order for a sale price to show at all:</p>
<ul>
<li>The initial price and the sale price must <strong>both</strong> be present on your landing page. The sale price does not have to be more prominent, but both prices <em>do</em> need to be clearly displayed.</li>
<li>The sale price in your feed needs to match the sale price on your website. It also needs to be presented in a way that makes sense within the context of your target country’s currency (so, like, $511.918171773 aint gonna fly)</li>
<li>This should go without saying, but the sale price you submit must be <em>lower</em> than your original price.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, know this: if your sale will run in perpetuity, you don’t <em>have</em> to include the <strong>sale_price_effective_date </strong>field in your feed; Google will assume that the sale price should go into effect ASAP and it will run until you remove the field entirely.</p>
<h2>Leverage Merchant Promotions</h2>
<p>Merchant Promotions let you augment your shopping ads on Google with badges that convey potentially irresistible offers. They look neat. They give you a leg up on the competition: what’s not to love?!</p>
<p>In the olden days, when Motorola Razrs roamed free, ecommerce advertisers looking to leverage promotions in their shopping ads had to do so through the feed. And an <a href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/merchantpromotionsform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">application process</a>. With the advent of Google Ads, however, it’s now easier than ever to sweeten the deal for online shoppers.</p>
<p><strong>You can build promotions directly within Merchant Center, no feed-fiddling required.</strong></p>
<p>First, sign into your Merchant Center account and navigate to the Promotions tab:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="09d5e3ab-b009-43d3-85ad-2f0f295bb874" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Next, you’ll be prompted to select the country and language you’d like your promotions to appear in:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="eade5d21-d4ce-4a62-9338-2ac625235668" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Now, the fun part.</p>
<p>Merchant Promotions come in four different flavors, each of which has three variations of its own:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amount off: </strong>Offer a monetary discount</li>
<li><strong>Percent off: </strong>Offer a percentage-based discount</li>
<li><strong>Free gift: </strong>Offer a free gift (!!!)</li>
<li><strong>Free shipping:</strong> Offer free shipping</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s dig deeper into each option available to you…</p>
<h3>Amount Off &amp; Percent Off</h3>
<p>These are grouped together because, well, they’re variations on a theme. Simple replace the word “amount” in the explanatory cards below with “percent” and, voila, you’ve got a percent off merchant promotion.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="54a9d8ec-7b19-4f2e-8f26-07c26806a722" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shopping-promotions-google-merchant-promotions-amount-off202800229.png" alt="promotions amount off" width="700" height="400" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Let’s begin with straight-up “Amount/Percent off.” You are asked to choose your discount (as a dollar amount or a percentage, depending which you selected above); from there, you also have the option to assign a minimum purchase amount.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="67f9b446-d031-48c7-9a9a-a8774187a8bd" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shopping-promotions-google-merchant-promotions-buy-quantity-get-amount-off202800229.png" alt="buy quantity get amount off" width="700" height="424" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Next up we’ve got “buy quantity of products, get [amount/percent] off.” As the name implies, this Merchant Promotion allows you to offer a discount to customers who buy (at least) a specific number of products; if your ecommerce business is dependent of high-volume orders, this one’s for you.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="889a5885-d63d-4b65-a2e2-38bfa02ee6ce" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shopping-promotions-google-merchant-promotions-buy-quantity-get-item-discount202800229.png" alt="buy quantity get item discount" width="800" height="511" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Finally, we come to “buy quantity of products, get the same item at a discount.” A bit confusing, right? Of the amount/percent off discount types, this is the most complex, if only because it has three variable fields. If you choose this option, you need to input the number of products a customer needs to have in their cart to be discount-eligible. From there, you need to enter the <em>quantity</em> of discounted products <em>and</em> the size of the discount you’re offering.</p>
<p>Phew.</p>
<h3>Free Gift</h3>
<p>For what it’s worth, the free gift Merchant Promotion is my personal favorite. A discount is nice, but FREE STUFF?!?! I can’t think of a better way to catch the eye of a holiday-season shopper on the hunt for a great deal <em>and</em> a free stocking-stuffer.</p>
<p>The first free gift option is simply “get a free gift.”</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="9fede6af-7532-4c04-bba1-6e91a9a0488c" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shopping-promotions-google-merchant-promotions-free-gift-card202800229.png" alt="promotions free gift" width="700" height="469" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Simply describe the free gift that’ll wind up in the cart of someone who clicks you shopping ad once they purchase; you also have the ability to add a minimum purchase amount or quantity.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0ff6631a-c760-4cd2-831f-0747ed73441d" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Next, you can implement an offer that adds a gift card to the cart of your new favorite customers. The only difference between this Merchant Promotion and “get a free gift” is that you have to assign a value to the gift card you’re giving away.</p>

<p>Finally, “give a free gift from your inventory” requires you to input the item ID of a product in your feed that you’d like to give away once a prospective customer hits a purchase threshold.</p>
<h3>Free Shipping</h3>
<p>Next, we come to ol’ faithful: free shipping.</p>
<p>While Amazon has created a world in which packages magically appear on your stoop two days after clicking “buy now” without forking over a penny for the privilege, smaller ecommerce businesses who can afford to cover the cost of shipping gain a distinct advantage against comparable competition.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>There are three different free shipping offers available within the Merchant Center interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free standard shipping</li>
<li>Free overnight shipping</li>
<li>Free 2-day shipping</li>
</ul>
<p>For each option, you have the option to assign a minimum purchase amount or quantity; neither is necessary if you’re feeling particularly giving this holiday season.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>That’s it for holiday tips implemented in Merchant Center; now let’s take a look at the two most effective ad extensions for your Google Ads search campaigns!</p>
<h2>Implement Price Extensions</h2>
<p>Price extensions help your search ads stand out on the SERP by adding information-rich to your copy. Each price extension gives you the ability to link to a specific product page, ensuring that searchers can navigate directly to your hottest holiday deals with limited friction.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="fdf5dbec-68d5-46b5-99fc-5c25441d45fa" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>They allow you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Highlight your offerings more effectively</li>
<li>Provide links directly to your offers, decreasing friction between click and conversion</li>
<li>Skip crafting new ads to reflect holiday pricing changes</li>
</ul>
<p>When they first hit the scene, price extensions were only available on mobile devices. Since then, however, price extensions have been rolled out across all devices, making them an invaluable tool for ecommerce advertisers.</p>
<p>We’ve done extensive testing with price extensions here at WordStream and one thing’s clear to us: they’re <em>powerful. </em>In fact, we’ve seen them <strong>4x CTRs</strong> when compared to run-of-the-mill text ads.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="87dd1b79-0b20-48f6-a1db-89da768f7db8" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at how to implement them in your account.</p>

<h3>Setting up Price Extensions</h3>
<p>You will be asked to identify a language, type, currency, and price qualifier for each price extension you wish to create.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="07cc02cc-9edb-4f4f-a8a7-778b6be4c272" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shopping-promotions-google-ads-price-extensions-new202800229.png" alt="price extensions new" width="355" height="188" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Languages are limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dutch</li>
<li>English</li>
<li>French</li>
<li>German</li>
<li>Italian</li>
<li>Japanese</li>
<li>Polish</li>
<li>Portuguese (Brazil)</li>
<li>Portuguese (Portugal)</li>
<li>Russian</li>
<li>Spanish (Latin America)</li>
<li>Spanish (Spain)</li>
<li>Swedish</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the language of your price qualifier (more on that in a moment) may change if Google detects that a searcher is using a different language than you have indicated here.</p>
<p>“Type” refers to the kind of price extension you’re creating. Available types include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brands</li>
<li>Events</li>
<li>Locations</li>
<li>Neighborhoods</li>
<li>Product Categories</li>
<li>Product Tiers</li>
<li>Products</li>
<li>Service Categories</li>
<li>Service Tiers</li>
<li>Services</li>
</ul>
<p>This is used in the sample ad (to the right of the extension creation UI) to provide you with an example of what a given category might look like.  For example, selecting “Product Tiers” will change the example headers to the following:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="68a7a757-fa1f-46da-8a20-5d8228adbbf1" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shopping-promotions-google-ads-price-extensions-examples202800229.png" alt="google ads price extension examples" width="314" height="110" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Finally, you will be asked to identify currency (there are a whole mess to choose from so I won’t list them all here) and a price qualifier, which allows you to select either “from,” “up to,” “average,” or nothing in order to more effectively highlight price.</p>
<p>Once you’ve completed the high-level categorization, it’s time to create the individual items.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="82d6f717-02e4-4dbb-bd7c-3347a3da6110" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shopping-promotions-google-ads-price-extension-creation-interface202800229.png" alt="creating price extensions in google ads" width="395" height="371" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Each item you’d like to create a price extension for must include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Header: </strong>25-character limit; this should be the name of the product or service you’re highlighting with a price extension.</li>
<li><strong>Description: </strong>25-character limit; as is the case with callout extensions, you’re going to want to attempt to stay closer to 15 characters than 25, because this will ensure that your description isn’t truncated.</li>
<li><strong>Price: </strong>Self-explanatory.</li>
<li> <strong>Unit: </strong>Language that relates to your product or service and compliments your price qualifier. Choose from: Hour, day, week, month, year, night, or N/A.</li>
<li><strong>Final URL: </strong>Last but not least, add a link to a relevant landing page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that, for these gems to show, you must have <em>at least 3 items listed</em> (and Google recommends listing more than 5).</p>
<h2>Implement Promotion Extensions</h2>
<p>Google Ads promotion extensions give you the opportunity to highlight sales (particularly those that occur during the holiday season) without forcing you to write fresh ad copy. They’re the best friend of the busy ecommerce advertiser looking to stand out from the competition.</p>
<p>In fact, ads using promotion extensions had CTRs that more than doubled those of text ads served without any extensions:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="3bf27356-7d74-4a52-a4de-bec5f0245ed2" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shopping-promotions-google-ads-promotion-extension-performance202800229.png" alt="Google Ads promotion extension performance" width="458" height="282" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Promotion extensions show a price tag icon beneath your ad and highlight a sale you’re running on your website. Additionally, you can specify details around your promotion, such as whether it requires any promo code at checkout and when the sales ends.</p>
<p>As you can imagine after reading that description, promotion extensions have <em>a lot</em> of moving parts, which can make them seem a bit intimidating.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="7f52bc28-ced8-4ad9-b171-28dae796a585" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shopping-promotions-google-ads-promotion-extension-components202800229.png" alt="promotion extension components" width="407" height="111" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>The components include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Occasion: </strong>An optional field you can use if your promotion aligns with a holiday (and in our case, it certainly does). Each occasion is eligible to show during select dates (which can be narrowed further in the advanced settings).</li>
<li><strong>Promotion Type: </strong>Choose between monetary or percent discounts.</li>
<li><strong>Item: </strong>Product or service you’re promoting (20-character limit).</li>
<li><strong>Currency: </strong>Self-explanatory.</li>
<li><strong>Promotion Requirement: </strong>Choose between “none,” “on orders over,” or “promo code.” Note that, if you select promo code, you will be allotted an additional 15 characters to add one.</li>
<li><strong>Promotion Dates: </strong>Dates during which your promo is eligible to run as an extension. If you don’t identify dates <em>but</em> select an occasion, Google will run your promotion extension for the duration of the allotted window.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the are the available occasions and the dates through which associated promotion extensions are eligible to run:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="afd0a762-4a78-4327-9553-e9c13399c18f" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shopping-promotions-google-ads-promotion-extension-available-occasions202800229.png" alt="extension available occasions" width="513" height="205" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>It’s also worth noting that, like price extensions, promotion extensions <strong>are clickable</strong>.</p>
<h3>Setting up Promotion Extensions</h3>
<p>First, decide the level at which you’d like to implement your promotion extension (account, campaign, or ad group) and if it aligns with one of the occasions listed above:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e73443d7-3905-481c-bc28-9c8e9fdffb5b" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shopping-promotions-google-ads-promotion-extension-setup202800229_0.png" alt="promotion extension setup" width="422" height="285" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Next, choose your language and the type of promotion you’re running (percent discount, monetary discount). If you select a monetary discount, you’ll also be prompted to identify your currency. Now, name the product or service you’re promoting in 20 characters or less.</p>
<p>Next, add the final URL you want your promotion extension to bring prospects to and, if you’re using a promo code (people love promo codes) <em>or</em> would like to add an “on orders up to” caveat, do so here.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="68dcb42f-4749-4d51-9577-28e173345c33" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shopping-promotions-google-ads-promotion-extension-promotional-details202800229.png" alt="extension promotional details" width="407" height="136" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>And you’ll end up with something that looks like this:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="01d02aca-077b-4b0a-a0b5-9ed4bde6a0ef" data-langcode="en">

<p>Who wouldn’t click that?!</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, Google sent out an email that caused a stir among SEMs with clients whose accounts contain at least one GDN campaign. The gist? The long-running workaround for excluding mobile apps en masse—adding <strong>adsenseformobileapps.com </strong>as a placement exclusion—is being killed off in September.</p>
<p>Case in point…here&#8217;s one reaction I saw on Linkedin:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="314dc312-88a1-423e-9dbd-9bf77bde89f0" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Like I said, visceral responses abound.</p>
<p>Some see Google’s outreach email, particularly the statement, “you may see a significant increase in mobile apps or mobile web traffic,” as laying the foundation for a cash grab.</p>
<p>Here’s everything you need to know about why this is happening.</p>
<h2>So, Uh, What’s Happening?</h2>
<p><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9051067">Per Google</a>, “In September 2018, the adsenseformobileapps.com exclusion and the GMob mobile app non-interstitial exclusion will no longer be available within Google Ads.”<strong> </strong>Other content exclusions (Embedded videos, In-video, Below-the-fold, etc.) will continue to work just fine, and the GDN will still have functionality to opt in/out of devices without the use of a -100% bid adjustment like we’d have in a search campaign.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="d61b54e3-72e3-4141-85ef-5876e0c7fec4" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Why is Google eliminating a tried-and-true workaround?</p>
<p>&#8220;Simplicity,&#8221; of course.</p>
<p>This change will make it easier to serve ads to the ever-growing subset of humanity spending their web browsing hours on mobile devices. And, yes, <strong>it <em>could</em> mean more bad clicks in your Display campaigns</strong>.</p>
<p>In reality, many advertisers didn’t know about the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/06/exclude-mobile-apps-adwords">adsenseformobileapps.com </a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/06/exclude-mobile-apps-adwords">placement</a> and have undoubtedly spent a <em>ton </em>of advertising dollars serving Display creative to fat-thumbing app-users. And even those of us who<em> do</em> know about managing and excluding mediocre (or junk) placements inevitably spend dollars on ones that don’t convert; it’s an inherent risk of advertising in spaces where search intent doesn’t rule the roost, and it’s why the clicks are so darn cheap.</p>
<p>Newsflash: <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/03/display-network-click-fraud">managing placements</a>—that is, excluding based on performance and other, squishy factors like brand alignment or, say, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/12/05/breitbart-ad-boycott">general </a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/12/05/breitbart-ad-boycott">morality</a>—is extremely important. It’s akin to adding negative keywords to your search campaigns (and we all do that, right?). Is this change a minor annoyance? Sure, for some. But in a channel with millions of websites and hundreds of thousands of apps, diligence, good creative, and thoughtful audience creation—not a single placement—are the keys to success, and the death of adsenceformobileapps.com isn’t going to change that!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just going to make it a lot more difficult to eliminate riffraff.</p>
<p>With that, here’s how you can exclude <strong>all </strong>mobile apps in Google Ads (for the next 30 days or so at least).</p>
<h2>Excluding Mobile App Placements in Google Ads</h2>
<p>This is a two-step process, the first of which is pretttttty obvious.</p>
<p>You’ll need to head to the placement tab, then to exclusions:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="99dbcccb-050a-488a-b9f3-8d9c520c9b9a" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google_ads_exclusions_tab.png" alt="google ads exclusions tab" width="689" height="421" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Simply check the box next to adsenseformobileapps.com, then hit “remove.”</p>
<p>(Note that if the placement lives in a list of exclusions, you’ll need to remove it from there instead of at the campaign level)</p>
<p>Next, go to your campaign settings and click “additional settings.”</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0376492d-7929-4256-b7e0-a53cb11add6d" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/additional_settings_google_ads.png" alt="additional settings google ads campaign" width="800" height="295" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Here, you’ll want to navigate down to “Devices.” If it says “Show on All Devices,” you’re gonna have a bad time (and by that, I mean your Display ads will serve on mobile apps). To rectify this situation, click the radio button next to “set specific targeting for devices”</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="968c075a-e123-4d8f-adaa-307c95c448be" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google_ads_select_device.png" alt="google ads select device placements" width="800" height="139" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>This will open a menu that breaks devices into three subsets: computers, mobile, and tablet.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="94c85c89-e69b-48c2-81f7-9047cb4d4d40" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>If you only want to serve your ads on the mobile web, <strong>uncheck “mobile app” and “mobile app interstitial.”</strong> Ditto for tablet.</p>
<h2>Annnnnd you’re done (for now)</h2>
<p>This change, which I initially read as “great, Google’s killing off an exclusion that should never have been necessary,” looks to be the exact opposite and could, in fact, make mobile apps more difficult to avoid [insert my very own LinkedIn ragepost here]. We’ll update once we have more clarification from Google.</p>
<h2>UPDATE (February 2019)</h2>
<p>Thanks to a commenter for letting us know that friend-of-WordStream <a href="https://zatomarketing.com/blog/how-to-exclude-141-mobile-app-categories-in-google-ads-the-easy-way/">Kirk Williams of ZATO Marketing</a> has found a workaround using Google Ads Editor. Have you tried Kirk&#8217;s workaround? Let us know if it works for you!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Google has done it again!</p>
<p dir="ltr">A year after setting the world on fire with the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/05/23/google-marketing-next">announcement </a>of the new AdWords Experience and some sensational shots of a particularly photogenic goldendoodle, the advertising juggernaut’s Marketing Live event has yielded yet another slew of exciting new features.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Outside of the buzzwords already in vogue (machine learning, <em>frictionless</em>), today’s keynote focused on innovation across all Google advertising products through three core concepts: <strong>value, transparency, and trust </strong>(for advertisers and prospects alike).</p>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center" dir="ltr"><em>The view from inside (our fearless leader Laura Taylor was in attendance)</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Per Google’s Senior VP of Ads, Sridhar Ramaswamy, marketers now operate in a world packed with more curious, demanding, and impatient consumers; our prospects expect us to deliver ads that offer personalized, hyper-relevant solutions, not generalizations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Basically, people aren’t stupid: they want answers yesterday and they want to save money. Put more eloquently (thanks, Sridhar), “People don’t see value in advertising if they don’t feel valued by advertising.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">From high-level overviews of recently released tools like TrueView for Action, to the announcement of brand new features like automated shopping feeds [insert fire emoji], Google has made strides across its freshly rebranded solutions to help advertisers meet the needs of an increasingly savvy, mobile, and data-conscious public.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cool? Cool.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With that, here are the 11 most interesting <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/20/google-ads-innovations">features and changes</a> announced at Google Marketing Live. Hopefully we can get through this without too many gratuitous NSYNC references.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Update! <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/24/google-marketing-live">&gt;&gt; Google Marketing Live 2022 Recap &gt;&gt;</a></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">#1: “My Account” Makes it Easier to Opt Out of Ad Personalization</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In keeping with core themes of the event (value, trust, and transparency for those who skipped the intro) the first item to receive any semblance of explanation is the user’s ability to opt out of ad personalization. While it isn’t a spankin’-new feature, the ability to stop advertisers from tailoring your individual experience is an essential step towards, uhhh, not falling into the same hot water that Facebook’s been treading in for the better part of 2018.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This, friends, is a good thing.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="82e9cc8e-2912-43b9-978a-1f01b1af9f41" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-marketing-live-2018.png" alt="Google Marketing Live 2018" width="614" height="383" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Yes, this is a pain for advertisers who rely on audience-centric targeting methods to reach net-new prospects. But offering ad personalization options paints Google as a more trustworthy entity, which keeps users placated and engaged.</p>
<p>This, friends, is a good thing.</p>
<h2>#2: AdWords Becomes Google Ads</h2>
<p>This isn’t so much an announcement as an inevitability.</p>
<p>A mere week ago, Google announced the switch from AdWords to the shiny new catch-all brand <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/28/google-ads">Google Ads</a>.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="7084bac2-7900-4531-b3c8-0cdcce4a4f32" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-marketing-live-2018-google-ads.png" alt="Google Marketing Live 2018" width="192" height="205" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">With this new name comes better alignment with Google&#8217;s entire suite of advertising solutions. “Google Ads” is a broader moniker capable of adequately housing ads across search, display, map, video, in-app, and more without generating confusion.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">#3: Google Marketing Elevates Programmatic Advertising Through Collaboration</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In the same vein, Analytics 360 and DoubleClick have formed like Voltron within the new enterprise (and agency) solution called Google Marketing, which will launch in the coming weeks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Combining these formerly siloed tools allows Google to offer big-spenders a complete set of tools that help plan, buy, measure, and optimize both media and consumer experience. An end-to-end solution if ever one existed. The platform will feature:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">100+ integrations with exchanges and measurement solutions managed from a single interface</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Search Ads 360, which will allow advertisers to plan, buy, and measure search ads</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Display Ads 360, which will allow advertisers to manage bids and audiences from a central location</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But the most interesting component of the Google Marketing platform is the way in which it will unlock collaboration between media buyers, creatives, and their bosses (or clients). In an interface that looks somewhat like the updated <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/24/facebook-creative-hub">Facebook Creative Hub</a>, this feature will allow brands and the brains behind them to generate better campaigns without the hassle of constant email chains.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oh, and one more thing…</p>
<p dir="ltr">Google also invented pivot tables! (They’re called “Instant Reports” and they exist to help those who own video ad metrics generate answers at lightning speed).</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">#4:TrueView For Reach + TrueView For Action + Maximize Lift Bidding = Full-Funnel Video Ads</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Numbers time…</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>People watch more than a billion hours of video on YouTube every day, and 91% of smartphone users have bought or planned to buy something after seeing a video ad.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">With metrics like those, and this&#8230;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="634fbeee-bd46-4ab4-b283-826aac65b74f" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-marketing-live-2018-conversion-growth.png" alt="Google Marketing Live 2018 Conversions" width="740" height="452" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">It’s no wonder Google is pushing video hard this year through a whole mess of exciting new YouTube functionality.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At Marketing Live, Google touched on two important TrueView features that have been out for a minute now but haven’t received much fanfare. The first, TrueView for reach, allows you to hit more prospects with your video creative using CPM bidding, which can be insanely efficient.  The latter, TrueView for action, helps you advertise to prospects on YouTube who have recently searched for your products or services on Google.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="56c38464-c029-4ea6-99d1-5d9df99915a1" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-marketing-live-2018-mobile.png" alt="Google Marketing Live 2018 Mobile" width="1000" height="562" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">As far as net-new YouTube features go, Google just announces a new Smart Bidding strategy called Maximize Lift, which will help advertisers reach prospects who are likely to search for their brand after watching a video. <a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/ads/machine-learning-hands-advertisers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It </a>“automatically adjusts bids at auction time to maximize the impact your video ads have on brand perception throughout the consumer journey.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Using all three features in concert lets you build a full funnel approach to video-centric advertising that leads to, yup, real conversions. That’s right: no more fluffy impression-based KPIs!</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">#5: Lead Ads On YouTube?!</h2>
<p dir="ltr">For my money, this is <strong>the coolest thing that was mentioned in the entire keynote</strong>, yet it inexplicably received little more than lip service. Advertisers have been slaying with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/24/facebook-lead-ads">Facebook lead ads</a> for some time now, but Google hasn’t had a comparable offering.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Until now…</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lead ads on YouTube will combine the unfathomable reach of the world’s most popular video platform with robust audience targeting and the ability to capture the contact information of valuable top of funnel prospects without asking them to go allllll the way to your website before forking it over.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stay tuned for more info; I’m willing to bet a month’s pay we roll out a post when there’s more information to be had.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">#6: Gigantic Responsive Search Ads Are Coming to a SERP Near You</h2>
<p dir="ltr">What has 15 headlines, 4 descriptions, and probably won’t incite nearly as much hullabaloo as Expanded Text Ads circa 2016?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Why, it’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/10/responsive-search-ads">Responsive Search Ads </a>of course!</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e4f63713-1dd8-4e36-b97b-8433c0924489" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-marketing-live-2018-serp.png" alt="Google Marketing Live 2018 SERP" width="800" height="589" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">Per our acclaimed Senior Data Scientist, Mark Irvine, the headlines and descriptions you’ll need to upload in order to create a responsive text ad will afford you the opportunity to create 43,680 different permutations: good luck generating that much copy by hand…</p>
<p dir="ltr">Instead of writing components explicitly for the purpose of working together, RSA gives Google a pool of copy to work from; from there, the platform will automatically test different combinations of headlines and descriptions and learn which combinations perform best. Over time, your Responsive Search Ads will serve the best message to different searchers depending on the keyword they search for, their device, their past browsing behavior, and other signals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Interested?</p>
<p dir="ltr">You can apply to the newly expanded beta through the Google Ads blog or just wait a few months, at which point Responsive Search Ads will be released (in English only) to everyone.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">#7: Mobile Speed Score Gets a Column</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="6c85fdf1-3977-483d-84c9-b5e360c8146a" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-marketing-live-2018-mobile-speed.png" alt="Google Marketing Live 2018 Mobile Speed" width="1073" height="614" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">What good are responsive search ads if your mobile landing pages aren’t up to snuff? Not very, according to Google Ads Project Management Director Anthony Chavez: 50% of users will move on from a potential purchase if the landing page is slow to load.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Just a day removed from announcing that the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/22/google-speed-update">Speed Update</a> had officially rolled out to all users, Google announced the release of a Mobile Landing Page Speed Score column on the Landing Pages page within Google Ads. The tool scores landing page speed on a ten-point scale&#8211;from “very slow” to “extremely fast”&#8211;and does so based on a number of factors, including the relationship between <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/24/page-speed">page speed </a>and potential conversion rate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Wait, what about <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">PageSpeed Insights</a> and <a href="https://testmysite.thinkwithgoogle.com/">Test My Site</a>? How is this different?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Well, not only does the Mobile Landing Page Speed Score column live within the Google Ads UI&#8211;so you no longer have to leave <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/01/new-google-ads-features-for-agencies">Google Ads</a> to assess page speed&#8211;not only is it automatically updated daily, but it’s the first of Google’s speed tools to take potential ad performance into account when ascribing a score. For paid search advertisers, this is sure to be the page speed tool of choice.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">#8: Cross-Device Reporting Comes to Google Analytics</h2>
<p>Cross-device reporting is <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/06/17/cross-device-conversions">nothing novel</a>, and reports like the Device report and the Device Paths report have long allowed advertisers to attribute conversions to multiple devices. Now, for the first time, cross-device reporting is coming to Google Analytics.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="9bd816b8-3fe0-407c-8b15-07b16185a625" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-marketing-live-2018-devices.jpg" alt="Google Marketing Live 2018 Devices" width="1200" height="900" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">The Cross Device reports live within the Audience section of Google Analytics, and are divided into three sub-reports:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3123674">Device Overlap</a>: Find out what type and how many devices are used to access your content.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3123733">Device Paths</a>: Discover the last 5 device types used before a conversion.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3123672">Acquisition Device</a>: See the relationship between acquisitions and conversions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Now you can compare segments, visualize data, and distinguish usage across desktop, mobile, and tablet at each stage of your purchasing funnel&#8211;all within Google Analytics.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">#9: Smart Campaigns: A New Solution for Small Businesses</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Google <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/small-business/google-ads-helping-businesses/">officially announced</a> Smart Campaigns two weeks ago; and it used Google Marketing Live to continue building the hype. Google Ads’ new “default ad experience,” Smart Campaigns are tailor-made for small businesses with little in the way of paid search expertise, and little in the way of time.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="658d1fae-738e-4f6c-9281-5968ec8d7301" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-marketing-live-2018-shopping.png" alt="Google Marketing Live 2018 Shopping" width="800" height="429" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">Smart Campaigns give small businesses the tools to get up and running within just a few minutes, and drive the results they care about&#8211;making their phones ring, driving actions on their websites, and bringing customers to their stores (at least that’s how Google’s billing them).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Smart Campaigns are similar to (thought not the same as) <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/08/11/google-adwords-express-review">AdWords Express</a>&#8211;while fast, small businesses with bigger budgets may find themselves wanting more control over their ad spend. Still: if you’re truly strapped for time and are just looking to get some ads in the field with a smallish budget, Smart Campaigns might be worth testing.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">#10: Don’t Have a Website? No Problem!</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Nearly half of all small business owners in the United States don’t have a website (whoa). Among them, even fewer have the time and expertise to create websites and landing pages that are optimized for search ads. As a potential solution to that common predicament, Google is now testing auto-optimized landing pages. The functionality will live within Smart Campaigns, and will provide business owners an appealing alternative to creating resource-consuming, product-centric websites.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="02a1c6cd-c98f-49e6-a1e5-87adda77111e" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-marketing-live-2018-landing-pages.jpg" alt="Google Marketing Live 2018 Landing Pages" width="1200" height="900" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">Auto-optimized landing pages use machine learning to pull information about your products and services directly from your ad, and match that to your on-page creative. Google has also built conversion tracking and reporting directly into the experience; so ad creation, landing page creation, and conversion tracking and reporting now all live within the Smart Campaigns UI.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">#11: Major Innovations Come to Google Shopping</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Did you know that in any given 48-hour period, 80% of Americans are shopping online? It’s a fact! To account for the glut of online shopping, Google has <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/19/google-shopping-new-features">ramped up it’s shopping experience</a> with Smart Shopping. That’s right. Machine learning has rolled over into the shopping game now, too.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="d328c943-70ce-41e1-8b11-c05828c1cbaf" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-marketing-live-2018-shopping2.png" alt="Google Marketing Live 2018 Shopping" width="1060" height="424" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">Early tests have shown a 20% increase in conversion value at a similar cost when using Smart Shopping. Beyond maximizing conversion value, Smart Shopping now gives advertisers the option to select store visits and new customers as goals. Machine learning does the rest&#8211;making pragmatic bid adjustments, optimizing your ad placements, and optimizing which products are featured&#8211;based on a wide range of factors, from seasonal demand to pricing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The soon-to-be-launched “automated feeds” will also give advertisers the ability to create comprehensive product feeds with the touch of a button. Google Ads will pull all your products from your website directly into its UI. The best part? Smart Shopping is now integrated with leading e-commerce platforms like Shopify; so if you’re a Shopify user, you can manage and track ad performance right from your CMS.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bye, Bye, Bye</h2>
<p dir="ltr">What a whirlwind! A year removed from drastically changing the paid search experience, Google has seemingly topped themselves. From Smart Shopping to Responsive Search Ads; from YouTube lead ads to Mobile Speed Score; Google has taken it’s already bustling suite of marketing and advertising features and amplified it. The jury’s still out on if/how machine learning will contribute to lower CPAs, but the thought is there&#8211;time will tell if the execution is too!</p>

<p>We’re about to find out.</p>
<p>Google has made the executive decision to consolidate its overwhelming abundance of ad products under three brand new umbrellas: Google Ads, Google Marketing Platform, and Google Ads Manager. Behold, logos!</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="1d3570af-c0ad-4727-8e3a-73786b88c602" data-langcode="en">

</div>
<p>As is tradition, change cannot occur without casualties. In this cause, we’re saying goodbye to the digital marketing world’s favorite portmanteau: AdWords.</p>
<p>You didn’t misread. Google <em>is in fact</em> sunsetting AdWords, but in name alone.</p>
<p>At the highest level, this <strong>massive </strong>announcement was likely instigated by the proliferation of mobile and the shift towards an audience-centric mindset. More opportunities to reach more people across more channels is infinitely easier to take advantage of when all available solutions live in the same place.</p>
<p>This and a slew of other shakeups (more consolidation! Smart Campaigns!) were <a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/ads/new-advertising-brands/">announced </a>by Google’s Senior VP of Ads and Commerce, Sridhar Ramaswamy, just a week before <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/10/google-marketing-live">Google Marketing Next</a>, where blanks will surely be filled in.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll demystify the announcement and explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why this rebrand is happening now</li>
<li>What Google Ads means for the future of keywords</li>
<li>Whether or not Smart Campaigns are for you</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we take a closer look at how Google’s shocking brand overhaul will impact advertisers and agencies moving forward, a bit more on exactly <em>what’s going on.</em></p>
<h2>Introducing Google Ads&#8230;</h2>
<p>Obviously from our perspective, the most important piece of this announcement is the elimination of AdWords (the brand) and the creation of a new brand: Google Ads.</p>

<p>Per our ad-tastic overlords, Google Ads “represents the full range of advertising capabilities [Google] offers today… to help marketers connect with the billions of people finding answers on Search, watching videos on YouTube, exploring new places on Google Maps, discovering apps on Google Play, browsing content across the web, and more.”</p>
<p>Along with other channels, formats, and placements, GDN, YouTube, and Shopping (most of which were acquired, not built internally) have called AdWords home for a <em>minute</em> now. Unfortunately,  AdWords is synonymous with search. Having additional channels folded into the same interface has been confusing folks for years now. I don’t know about you, but I’ve certainly come across clients who have no idea their video, banner, and search creative are all served from the same platform.</p>
<p>It’s Google’s hope that this new, simpler name will usher in understanding and leave the door open to expand advertising options without confusion in the future.</p>
<h2>… and Google Marketing Platform</h2>
<p><em>You can probably jump right over this one if you’re a small business…</em></p>
<p>Use DoubleClick or Analytics 360? Not any more!</p>

</div>
<p>Built atop existing integration between the formerly disparate platforms, the second new brand borne of consolidation, Google Marketing Platform will allow enterprise marketers (and the agencies that service them) to marry ad creative and analytics in a single location. This will make it easier for both parties to “plan, buy, measure and optimize digital media and customer experiences in one place.”</p>
<p>As part of Google Marketing Platform, Google has also released a new feature called Display &amp; Video 360. This tool aims to enable “creative, agency, and media teams to collaborate and execute ad campaigns end-to-end in a single place.” This collaborative sandbox situation sounds similar to Facebook’s Creative Hub, which is, as the kids would say, hella useful.</p>
<p>The bottom line: Pretttttttttty neat <em>if</em> you’ve got reason to use it (but if you’re not Adidas or La Croix or some luxury SUV manufacturer, it may as well not exist).</p>
<h2> … and Google Ad Manager</h2>
<p>Finally, we come to <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/admanager/introducing-google-ad-manager/">Ad Manager</a>, Google’s shiny new programmatic platform.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="dabed8d6-4345-4d0d-aec4-7f50fd9089c3" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>A mashup of DoubleClick for Publishers and DoubleClick Ad Exchange (with a buzzword-worthy logo to boot!), Google Ad Manager is the search titan’s “complete and unified programmatic platform,” designed to “do even more for [Google’s] partners—earning them more money, more efficiently, wherever people are watching videos, playing games or engaging with content, and however advertisers are looking to work with them.”</p>
<h2>Overhauling Brand Architecture in the Name of Simplicity</h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, these substantial rebranding efforts are fueled by a growing need for simplicity in online advertising.</p>
<p>Consider the following…</p>
<p>Conceptually, AdWords was built for a computer-first world, one where someone gets home from work, has a smoke, retires to their chambers, and surfs the web for what very well may have been the first time that day.</p>
<p>If you’re younger than me, you might not even remember such a place existed.</p>
<p>Today we live in a mobile-first world, one in which we make initial queries on phones, conduct research from a three-monitor setup at the office, watch product videos on YouTube, and fork over our credit card information via some kind of voice-powered-AI.</p>
<p>Google can help advertisers reach prospects at every stage of this funnel, a fact that simply isn’t conveyed by “AdWords.” Google Ads on the other hand…</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="82d986ea-0b8f-44aa-ad60-d4fc17e591a6" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/emoji-hands.png" alt="emoji-hands" width="120" height="120" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Google Ads (all three new names, in fact) is succinct enough to make it clear what value business can derive from the platform <em>and</em> broad enough to house future Google acquisitions without inciting further confusion. Win-win.</p>
<p>This simplicity is by no means limited to naming conventions: One new(ish) feature that exemplifies the simplicity Google’s striving towards is the new Smart Campaigns.</p>
<h2>How Smart are “Smart Campaigns”?</h2>
<p>Built atop the same tech that powered AdWords Express, <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/small-business/google-ads-helping-businesses/">Smart Campaigns </a>are tailor-made for busy small business owners with little in the way of paid search expertise, and little in the way of time. The feature allows busy advertisers to “create ads in minutes and drive real results—like making your phone ring, sending leads to your website, or bringing customers to your store.”</p>
<p>Sounds neat, but will they work?</p>
<p>If you recall, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/08/11/google-adwords-express-review">AdWords Express,</a> though <em>fast</em>, was not particularly effective for <em>many businesses</em> because it stripped control from advertisers and put it in the hands of machine learning. Smart Campaigns build on the premise that most small businesses just want to drive calls, store visits, and conversions, and don’t have the time or expertise to learn how to use AdWords (uhh, Google Ads), so why not place your budget in Google’s machine learning-enabled hands.</p>
<p>Fast? Totally. But that doesn’t mean it understands the ins and outs of your business, and that’s a problem.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="5851f0ff-2ed6-402e-9781-0c51c664279e" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p><em>That being said…</em></p>
<p>Ultimately, it comes down to a simple question: do the time savings and the results from the simplified product generate a net win for your business? If you’re only spending a few hundred dollars a month on advertising, Smart Campaigns might be a decent option for you. On the other hand, if your monthly budget has a comma (or two, or three), it’s a different story entirely.</p>
<h2>Embracing Audiences Over Keywords</h2>
<p>Complexity across Google’s advertising platforms has led to a need for simple solutions.</p>
<p>In the past, we’ve speculated about Google transitioning away from keywords in favor of audience-centric targeting, similar to what you might find in paid social channels like Facebook and LinkedIn (and we aren’t the only ones!).</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="febac04b-5b64-4d8a-b76a-e404688a968b" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>By stripping “words” from the name of its ever-evolving ad platform, Google has begun the process of shifting advertiser perception away from <strong>keyword intent </strong>(the secret sauce that makes search queries so damn valuable as an advertising tool) and to a world where our focus shifts towards <strong>audiences</strong>.</p>
<p>While search will always remain an intent-centric and thus keyword-reliant space (augmented with audiences via tools like RLSA, in-market, etc.), the rollout of Google Ads makes taking a holistic approach to online advertising (investing in channels that don’t directly result in conversions) more palatable for many small businesses.</p>
<h2>Implications for Agencies (and SaaS Companies)</h2>
<p>Naturally, if you’re an agency or in-house SaaS marketer, there are some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/01/new-google-ads-features-for-agencies">changes you’re going to need to account for</a>.</p>
<p>For one, any paid and organic initiatives that previously hinged on the keyword “adwords” or ancillary keywords related to it will need to be tweaked. If you’re an agency that offers AdWords services, you’re going to need to figure out how to guide your clients through those changes.</p>
<p>The good thing is, “adwords” as a term and as a concept isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. Campaigns leveraging it won’t suddenly drop off the page. Still, it will be a good idea to monitor paid and organic search volumes around “google ads” and “adwords” as you go about making page updates and bid adjustments.</p>
<h2>Google Ads: A Brave New World?</h2>
<p>So..ultimately, what’s changing here?</p>
<p>Are you looking at massive campaign overhauls? No, probably not.</p>
<p>Google’s new brands will be rolling out gradually over the next month; and given its commitment to transparency, you can expect day-to-day campaign operation to remain more or less the same. In effect, Google has streamlined its ad and marketing experience. And in a growingly complex landscape of digital marketing apps, tools, and software, that’s a move we can get on board with.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">It’s official, people. July 10: A date which will live in infamy.</p>
<p>Per an email sent to advertisers last night, starting on July 10th, 2018, “the new Google Ads will become the exclusive way to manage your account…</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="b12b2b98-7a21-4149-95f0-a965d4e2f21c" data-langcode="en">

</div>
<p>&#8230;and access to the previous experience will no longer be available.”</p>
<p>We’ve all had access to the new UI – with its sleek transitions and moderately useful visualizations – for some time now, though its use was by no means mandated. Instead, there was a neat little CTA stuck in the corner of ye olde Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords) that suggested taking some lightning-quick new tool for a spin in the name of improved productivity.<strong>    </strong></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="ece72448-d6ec-4c9c-8b46-d083783e4cf5" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>In mere weeks, getting more done will no longer be optional. Weep, luddites.</p>
<p>If you’ve been familiarizing yourself with the new Google Ads UI for months, its nested layout and slew of new features (many of which were never given a home in the old UI) will be old hat come early July. For those old dogs unwilling to learn new tricks, though, I’ve put together a list of everything you need to do before old faithful rides off into the sunset.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">#1: Take the Guided Tour</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Things I enjoy: museums, historical homes, breweries.</p>
<p>Thing I do not: moving through them at someone else’s canned, pre-programmed pace.</p>
<p>Following and listening to tour guides isn’t for me, and I’d wager a fair number of you don’t love it either. For something as complex – and, you know, tied to my credit card – as the Google Ads Experience<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, though, I am willing to make an exception.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="111990e0-fa97-4a2d-86d8-9e6ba8692d4d" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/old20adwords20ui20get20started.png" alt="get started old adwords ui" width="800" height="489" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">(Mostly due to the fact that it’s only five steps long.)</p>
<p>The tour gives you an idea as to where important stuff lives within the new UI. It points out the locations of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The navigation panel, which allows you to jump between active/inactive campaigns and ad groups of a given type (search, display, video, shopping, or all of the above.</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The page menu – for my money the most important new feature – which allows you to bounce between everything from extensions and adjustments to audiences and change history.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The new home for tools and reporting.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The help icon (really useful!).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">And finally, the overview tab, which serves up piping hot account-specific insights for your viewing pleasure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Quick. Concise. Useful.</p>
<p>My kinda tour.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">#2: Ensure Your Filters, Rules &amp; Reports Are In Working Order</h2>
<p dir="ltr">While your data and most of your reporting will be pulled into the new UI, there are a handful of reports and rules that were altered or nixed entirely. For example, the dimensions tab (a personal favorite) now lives within the reporting icon and goes by “Predefined Reports.”</p>
<p>Sexy!</p>
<p>Rules-wise, any rule that relies on a column no longer available within Google Ads will cease to function within your account. I’m not going to list them out because there are a few dozen, but further details can be found <a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/6306932?ref_topic=6346221&amp;utm_source=msa&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=adwords_general_deprecation_lcs&amp;utm_content=features_rules#column_changes">here</a>. Note that filters that make use of these columns will not imported either.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="b7340304-fe04-41a4-b6c2-d64dca9c3b4b" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/old20adwords20ui20reports.png" alt="reports old adwords ui" width="800" height="972" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Reporting that’s going kaput includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Destination URL performance report</li>
<li>Managed placement performance report</li>
<li>Automatic placement performance report</li>
<li>Placement report</li>
</ul>
<p>Reporting that will continue to exist but with significant changes includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reports containing columns that no longer exist.</li>
<li>Reports containing child accounts no longer managed in your MCC.</li>
<li>Reports using columns not yet supported by Report Editor, like: Historical quality score, Landing page experience, Exp CTR, and Ad relevance.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also note that reports currently in .XLSX format will be transformed to .CSV format.</p>
<h2>#3: Wrap Your Head Around New Features</h2>
<p>As I mentioned before, Google has been rolling out new features since the end of last year that never surfaced in the old Google Ads UI. Smart way to save resources and entice users to give the new interface a go at the same time, huh?</p>
<ul>
<li>Bid adjustments for calls &#8211; Ensure your call extensions show more often!</li>
<li>Showcase shopping ads &#8211; Present your products in a new ad format that groups related items together for juicy SERP dominance.</li>
<li>Audience manager &#8211; Aligns targeting options across display and RLSA.</li>
<li>Promotion extensions &#8211; Append limited offers and discount codes to your search ads.</li>
<li>Ad variations &#8211; A/B test without having to write a million and one headlines on your own (then roll with the top performer).</li>
<li>Outstream video campaigns &#8211; Reach audiences with video beyond YouTube.</li>
<li>TrueView for action campaigns &#8211; Add CTA’s and headlines to your existing video creative.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you’ve probably guessed, some of these features are little more than window dressing (looking at you, outstream video campaigns). Others have the potential to be absolute game-changers for your account.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e0c9b555-9ce1-449d-adba-46ab562b124e" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/old20adwords20ui20promotion20extensions.png" alt="promotion extensions old adwords ui" width="800" height="492" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>For example, our research has shown that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/05/24/adwords-promotion-extension">Promotion Extensions</a> more than double CTR when compared to that of regular search ads. I know the learning curve might be steep, but make sure you take the time to educate yourself on the feature that didn’t exist in the old UI (as well as reacquainting yourself with the ones that did).</p>
<h2>#4: Commit the Quick (?) Reference Map to Memory</h2>
<p>The first thing you’ll notice in the new UI is that the layout is a drastic departure from what you’ve gotten used to. There are means of navigation oriented both horizontally and vertically; right out of the gate, that it is not intuitive.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Google has assembled something of a map to make it clear where things live and how to get there:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="8041c3d0-e3c7-4625-90d8-2b7b351d7825" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/old20adwords20ui20layout.png" alt="new layout old adwords ui" width="800" height="380" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">As you can see, navigation is divided into 5 unique segments, each of which is loaded with its own suite of subnavs. You can download a printable one-pager that outlines the location of key features <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/6y4gdCeW5YVQIdyA9NfyV1tuC6fXPH5KyjNY">here</a>. (I recommend printing it out or leaving it up on an extraneous monitor until you’re comfortable with where the tools you lean on live)</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">#5: Start Google Adsing Already!</h2>
<p dir="ltr">You’ve looked, now it’s time to leap.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="67db4024-ebae-4f9a-a9e7-ca037dc5c6af" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/old20adwords20ui20logo.png" alt="logo old adwords ui" width="800" height="340" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Switching over to the new interface is daunting, but once you get the hang of it, the nested features and navigation become pretty manageable (I’ve been switching back to the old UI to do larger tasks, so I’ve got some intuiting to do, too).</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Determining your most profitable keywords and creating relevant ad groups, ads, and landing pages based on those keywords is crucial to succeeding in paid search. Doing so allows you to find potential customers who are searching for offerings just like yours. But unless you’ve got money to burn, it’s equally important to identify and eliminate keywords—and thus, searchers—who <em>aren’t </em>looking for the products or services you provide.</p>
<p>Sadly, most Google Ads and Microsoft campaigns <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/21/how-much-does-adwords-cost">cost far more than they need to</a> because advertisers end up paying for clicks that never deliver a return on their often-substantial investment. For some, this can be frustrating enough to stop advertising on search networks entirely.</p>
<p>So how do you avoid the pitfall of wasted spend?</p>
<p>You use <strong>negative keywords</strong>, of course!</p>
<p>After reading what follows, you’ll understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exactly what negative keywords are</li>
<li>How they can improve the value and relevance of your paid search marketing efforts</li>
<li>The value of negative keyword lists</li>
<li>How to find and add negative keywords at scale</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s get to it.</p>
<h2>What Are Negative Keywords?</h2>
<p>Negative keywords are a method of preventing your ad from showing to people who search for or browse content related to those words.</p>
<p>Effective paid search management means consistently expanding the keywords you’re bidding on while simultaneously refining the keywords you’re<em> already</em> bidding on to maximize relevance and, as a result, ROI. That second part doesn’t just mean pausing poor-performers: it means eliminating some search queries entirely.</p>
<p>Negative keywords give you the opportunity to do just that, ensuring that your ads only reach the best potential audience.</p>
<p>Just like with the keywords you actually bid on, negative keywords can be assigned at the account, campaign, or ad group level and come in multiple flavors: broad, phrase, and exact. Understanding how these match types work is <em>imperative </em>if you want to maximize the value of negative keywords in your Google Ads and Bing ad accounts.</p>
<h3>Negative keyword match types</h3>
<p>When using negative broad match, your keywords are matched to multiple variations of a phrase, not all of which will be logical extensions of the phrase you’re targeting, and not all of which will be pertinent to your business.</p>
<p>In the example below, the negative broad match keyword <strong>running shoes </strong>would negate queries that show the entire negative keyword, even in cases where the words aren’t in the same order.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/broad-match-negative-keywords-example.png" alt="broad match negative keywords example" width="291" height="262" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>This does not, however, mean that you will eliminate <em>all</em> relevant search queries; your ads will still be eligible to enter an auction if they contain <em>some </em>(but not all) of the terms present in your negative keyword. This is illustrated in the example above, where an ad would still be served for search queries like “blue tennis shoes” and “google running gear.”</p>
<p>Negative phrase match keywords are slightly less restrictive.</p>
<p>Using the same example as before, your ads would be eligible to show for any search query that doesn’t contain the phrase “running shoes.” That’s because this iteration only negates search queries that contain the <em>exact phrase</em> you specify. A search query could have more words than your negative phrase match keyword, but if it contains the exact phrase you’ve specified, your budget is safe.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/phrase-match-negative-keyword-example.png" alt="phrase match negative keywords adwords" width="308" height="268" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>Finally, negative exact match keywords exist solely for you to eliminate <em>specific</em> search queries. If you add negative exact match keywords to your Google Ads account, your ads won’t show only when a searcher enters <em>exactly</em> what you’ve added to your account. No extra words. Nothing.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/exact-match-negative-keyword-examples.png" alt="exact match negative keywords" width="310" height="266" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>Note that things are a little bit different on the Display Network and YouTube (TrueView campaigns); in these campaigns, all negative keywords are considered exact match.</p>
<p>Regardless of which network you’re advertising on, you should be aware that adding too many negative keywords can have an adverse impact on your ability to reach prospects; a carefully curated list, however, has the potential to save you a ton of money.</p>
<h3>More advantages to adding negative keywords</h3>
<p><strong>Improve Click-Through Rate (CTR)</strong> — Ensuring that your ads aren’t running against irrelevant queries means exposing your account to fewer uninterested impressions, meaning that the percentage of people who click on your ad will be greater.</p>
<p><strong>Create More Relevant Ad Groups </strong>— By weeding out keywords that aren’t related to your business, you tighten the relevance of your ad groups. Small, closely related ad groups allow you to craft a single message that speaks to the entire group of keywords.</p>
<p><strong>Save Money (Again)</strong> — So nice it’s listed twice! By avoiding paying for useless clicks, you save a lot of money by weeding out searchers who aren’t a fit for your business. You can also avoid bidding against yourself, cannibalizing impressions and watering down your keyword-level data.</p>
<p><strong>Raise Your Conversion Rate</strong> — Negative keywords will ensure that your ads don’t show for particular terms that you know won’t convert, like the names of competitors or those that convey a total lack of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-intent">commercial intent</a>.</p>

<h2>How to Add Negative Keywords</h2>
<p>So, you want to implement broad and phrase match keywords in your account to capture more traffic, but you’re left with a burning question…</p>
<p><em>How do I combat irrelevant clicks and impressions and uncontrolled ad spend? </em></p>
<p>Discovering negative keywords has been a laborious process, involving sitting around and brainstorming (which only gets you so far) or poring through search query reports in Google Ads.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/turning-search-queries-into-negative-keywords.png" alt="turning search queries into negative keywords" width="543" height="603" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>To do this, you need to navigate your way over to the “Keywords” tab in the Google Ads UI at the account, campaign, or ad group level:</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/negative-keywords-menu.png" alt="negative keywords menu" width="300" height="747" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>The default interface here will allow you to look at the keywords you’re bidding on, but not the queries that triggered them. To see this information, click “Search Terms” in the same menu.</p>
<p>Welcome to Queryland!</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/negative-keywords-search-terms.png" alt="negative-keywords-search-terms" width="800" height="445" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>Here, you’ll notice columns that don’t exist on the keyword screen, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Search Term: </strong>The query a searcher entered into Google (or said to a virtual assistant) that triggered a keyword you’re bidding on.</li>
<li><strong>Match Type: </strong>The degree to which a search query matched up with one of your keywords.</li>
<li><strong>Added/Excluded: </strong>Action you’ve taken with a search query (added it to your account or added it as a negative keyword)</li>
</ul>
<p>…and any other columns you’d like to pull into the interface to make informed keyword-related decisions.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at how to add a negative keyword to your account.</p>
<h3>Adding a negative keyword to your Google Ads account</h3>
<p>Let’s say I really don’t want my ads to serve for the search query <strong>keyword tools.</strong></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/negative-keywords-add-negative.png" alt="negative-keywrods-add-negative" width="300" height="192" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>Checking the box to the left of the search query (as depicted above) will generate a blue option bar:</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/add-negative-keyword-adwords.png" alt="add negative keywords in adwords" width="465" height="54" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>Since we want to add this query as a <em>negative</em> keyword, select “Add as negative keyword” (shocking, I know). From here, you’ll be prompted to choose the level at which the negative keyword should be assigned <em>and</em> the match type you’d like to use.</p>
<p>From here, simply hit save, and your negative keyword will go live!</p>
<p>Now, in the event you decide to assign your negative keyword to a negative keyword list (and then apply said list to multiple areas within your account), there are some additional processes to follow. Let’s take a look at those.</p>
<h2>Creating Lists of Negative Keywords</h2>
<p>Let’s face it: a Google Ads account built solely on exact match keywords probably isn’t even effective if you’re Ford or BMW. As such, you need to rely on broad and phrase match keywords to ensure adequate search volume and uncover new opportunities. But there is, of course, a downside to this sort of fishing expedition: you’re probably competing for the same impressions across campaigns.</p>
<p>Let’s say you sell cat and dog clothes through your eCommerce website.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adorable-tux-puppy.jpg" alt="adorable tux puppy" width="725" height="725" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>Without negating the word cat (and all cat-adjacent queries) in your dog clothes campaigns, you’ll inevitably run into the issue of Google deciding to match a broad match cat keyword to a dog-related search query. The results will clearly be irrelevant to the searcher. If they don’t click it, your CTR is watered down over time; if they <em>do</em>, the resulting landing page will have nothing to do with the search intent.</p>
<p>This is called a <em>lose-lose</em>.</p>
<p>The only way to explicitly avoid this unfortunately wasteful snafu is to add negative keywords.</p>
<p>Doing so as queries come is terribly inefficient so, instead, it makes sense to proactively create lists of search queries you don’t want your ads to show for. In the scenario outlined above, the use of negative keyword lists would ensure that Google can’t serve a “dog clothes” ad to a “cat clothes” search query because the only ads eligible to serve are in your dog clothes campaign.</p>
<p>Neat, huh?</p>
<p>This doesn’t just work for high-fashion petwear.</p>
<p>Let’s say you need to eliminate a keyword across your entire account because, say, you only sell <em>new</em> cars and want to ensure your ad spend isn’t wasted on queries regarding <em>used</em> cars. Or you’re an agency with multiple clients who operate within a single vertical, who will likely have negatives in common.</p>
<p>You, my friend, are in dire need of negative keyword lists, too.</p>
<p>To create a negative keyword list, click the tool icon at the top of the Google Ads UI and select “Negative keyword lists” from the “Shared Library” column.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/negative-keywords-negative-keyword-lists.png" alt="negative-keywords-negative-keyword-lists" width="800" height="255" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>From here, hit the blue plus sign and name your new list of negative keywords. Add the terms you’d like to negate (ensuring match type accuracy) …</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/creating-negative-keyword-lists-in-adwords.png" alt="add negative keyword to a list in adwords" width="404" height="416" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>To add your new negative keyword list to existing campaigns, go to your campaign, jump over to the keywords tab, then the negative keywords interface.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/use-negative-keyword-list-adwords.png" alt="use negative keyword list radio button adwords" width="587" height="203" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>Here, just select “use negative keyword list” then select the appropriate list, hit save, and you’re ready to rock! Add any ad poaching search queries that you find directly to your negative keyword lists</p>
<p>Now sit back and enjoy getting Google to serve the right ads for the right search queries. Of course, you can push this same concept to the ad group level for even tighter control.</p>
<p>With that, here are some techniques you can use to uncover costly negatives you’d otherwise miss with surface-level analysis: especially if you’re scaling your account.</p>
<h2>Advanced (Negative) Search Query Mining</h2>
<p>If you’re bidding on broad match keywords to maximize impression volume but ignoring your search queries, you’re wasting money.</p>
<p>I’m sorry to have to break it to you, but it’s the truth.</p>
<p>By not managing your negative keywords in tandem with new opportunities, you’ll inevitably overlook costly search queries that might be torpedoing your ability to convert valuable searchers into customers.</p>
<p>Earlier, we reviewed the process of adding negative keywords to your Google Ads account; now it’s time to figure out <em>which</em> search queries actually deserve to be negated.</p>
<h3>Keywords are not search queries</h3>
<p>Say it with me…</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/05/25/keywords-vs-search-queries"><strong>Keywords are not search queries.</strong></a></p>
<p>Keywords are assumptions. Search queries are <em>actions</em>.</p>
<p>They are what you think your customer will look for when using a search engine; search queries are the reality.</p>
<p>Oftentimes one keyword can match out to hundreds or even thousands of search queries.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/search-queries-vs-keywords-negative-keyword-creation.jpg" alt="search queries paralleled with keywords" width="650" height="430" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>This is fantastic for uncovering new, long-tail opportunities (hyper-relevant, low-volume keywords you should add to your account), but it also leads to inevitable wasted spend. This is why digging through what appear to be insurmountably long lists of search queries in an efficient manner is <strong>So. Darn. Important.</strong></p>
<h3>Identifying the right negative keyword opportunities at scale</h3>
<p>Typically, inexperienced or busy account managers lean on a qualitative method for adding negative keywords.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>They alphabetize the list of search queries, reading line-by-line and asking themselves, “<em>does this thing here have anything to do with my business?</em>”</p>
<p>While this isn’t inherently bad—and will certainly help you remove cat-jacket queries from your dog sneaker ad group—it doesn’t make use of the wealth of quantitative data available (it’s also horribly inefficient at scale).</p>
<p>Whether or not a search query deserves to become a negative keyword (or be added to a list of negative keywords), can be deduced by asking three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Does this search query have a below-average CTR?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Does this search query have a below-average conversion rate?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Does this search query have an above-average cost per conversion?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The reasons that these are the questions you need to ask yourself should be self-evident.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>If a search query has a below-average CTR, it means searchers who see the ad triggered aren’t clicking. If the query in question has nothing to do with your business, it should become a negative keyword. If it does relate to the products or services you sell, and it has volume, consider creating a new ad group for that search query, in which a more-relevant ad is included.</em></li>
<li><em>If a search query has a below-average conversion rate or an above average CPA, it means that after clicking on your ad searchers’ expectation aren’t being met. This could be due to the fact that your landing page isn’t optimized for mobile or lacks adequate paths to conversions; it could be a result of poor alignment between intent and objective. Either way, queries that don’t convert don’t need to be triggering your ads.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>To glean answers to these questions (and any others you might use to determine the relative value of a search query), you’ll need to master the use of filters.</p>
<p>To use a filter, navigate to the “Search Terms” interface (discussed towards the beginning of this here guide) and click the small funnel. This will allow you to type the name of parameters you’d like to filter by <em>or</em> select them from a pick list.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/search-query-filter-new-adwords-ui.png" alt="adwords search query filter function" width="293" height="61" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>From here, ensure that you’ve enabled the columns you need in order to view the metrics you’re filtering by; to do so, click the three vertical bars.</p>
<p>Each filter will prompt you to establish parameters using greater than, less than, or equal to alongside an open field, like so.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adwords-conversion-rate-filter-modifiers.png" alt="adwords conversion rate filter modifiers" width="264" height="177" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>Note that you can layer filters to find search queries that exist at the intersection of specific metrics.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/multiple-search-query-filters-adwords.png" alt="layering multiple adwords search query filters" width="750" height="44" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>For example, you might want to find <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/09/19/whats-a-good-quality-score">queries with <em>exceptionally high CTRs and CPAs</em></a>, those that clearly trigger your ads but do nothing but cost you money. Once identified, check the queries you’d like to add as negative keywords, select your match type, and stop wasting ad spend.</p>
<h2>Going Negative</h2>
<p>Why is this time-consuming process so valuable?</p>
<p>Effective negative keyword management keeps your keyword research clean and maximally relevant, so you’re better able to deliver a compelling, targeted message to the exact segment of searchers you most want to reach. <em>And</em> your budget will be spent on impressions and clicks that are highly likely to drive relevant traffic, qualified leads, and eventual sales.</p>
<p>Boring? Yes. Time-consuming? Uh huh. Necessary? You betcha.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re based—or advertise to prospects—in Europe, there’s a pretty decent chance you’re familiar with the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/09/28/eu-gdpr">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR).</p>
<p>It’s a package of new legislative rules being introduced by the European Union to make it easier for residents of EU countries to protect their personal data online. The regulation was officially approved on April 27, 2016, and will formally go into effect across the entirety of the EU by May 25, 2018.</p>
<p>And it’s being heralded as <strong>“the most important change in data privacy regulation in 20 years.”</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve talked about how this suite of historically restrictive (at least from the advertisers&#8217; perspective) laws will <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/04/04/facebook-ads-gdpr">impact your Facebook Advertising</a> efforts.</p>
<p>Today, we tackle Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords).</p>
<h2>The Gist</h2>
<p>Search, plain old intent-based search, requires no personally identifying information. Today, at least, a search query doesn’t constitute “personal,” regardless of its contents.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="4e86bf0d-29a2-4c1f-8d45-8e86733bdd36" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-adwords-gdpr-changes.png" alt="google adwords gdpr impact" width="659" height="296" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Provided you aren’t using any kind of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-remarketing">remarketing</a> or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/10/11/facebook-conversion-tracking">conversion tracking</a>, you won’t need to do anything at all. <strong>Google is the controller </strong>(the handler of personal data) and there is no processor (an entity that process data on behalf of a controller); you’re just along for the ride.</p>
<p>This approach is great for, say, Coca-Cola’s next branding campaign in which impressions are the only metric that matter; for small businesses, not so much.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="9bc847e6-99be-483f-b505-9e79b6e1e9e8" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>When you want to learn something—or create audiences—based on the tangible business value created by all those clicks you’re paying for, things get messier.</p>
<h2>Cookies, Remarketing, and RLSA</h2>
<p>Do you use Google Analytics, Tag Manager, or the Google Ads Remarketing code on your site to build valuable, bottom-of-the-funnel audiences?</p>
<p>(Gosh, I hope the answer’s yes…)</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="2e1ee036-7fcc-4ae9-bebe-9182b23cd86f" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-conversion-tracking-suite-gdpr.png" alt="google tracking suite impacted by the gdpr" width="700" height="156" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>If so, <strong>you must obtain consent</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://adwords.googleblog.com/2018/03/changes-to-our-ad-policies-to-comply-with-the-GDPR.html">Per Google</a>, “Advertisers using AdWords will be required to obtain consent for the use of cookies where legally required, and for the collection, sharing, and use of personal data for personalized ads for users in the EEA. This includes use of remarketing tags and conversion tags. Where legally required, advertisers must also clearly identify each party that may collect, receive, or use end users’ personal data.”</p>
<p>In plain English, this means that <strong>if you’re using a Google product to track the on-site action of prospects in order to serve personalized ads down the line, you must acquire their consent to do so</strong>.</p>
<h2>Exceptions: Customer Match and Store Sales</h2>
<p>There are two instances—<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/11/02/adwords-customer-match-setup">Customer Match</a> and uploaded Store Sales data—in which Google acts as both a controller and a processor of personal data, meaning that they simultaneously determine the purposes of data while processing data <em>you</em> control.</p>
<p>The exact language they use is as follows (note that you are “the customer”):</p>
<p>“When we handle end user personal data, the customer and Google will each act as independent controllers under the GDPR<strong>, except for the Customer Match and Store sales (direct upload) features, where Google will act as the customer’s processor for customer-provided personal data</strong>.”</p>
<p>As such, in these situations you are responsible for ensuring that the data Google is processing complies with the GDPR.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Match</strong> is a tool that allows you to upload a CSV file loaded with customer data to target specific groups within Google Ads.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="2db70c99-5466-4abe-8368-36d35c31d162" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adwords-customer-match-gdpr.png" alt="adwords custom audiences gdpr" width="700" height="423" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Since you’re relying on data that’s by no means pseudonymous to create your Customer Match audience (email, phone, name, and zip code are all <em>pretty </em>identifying), you’ll need to be able to prove that you acquired explicit, opt-in consent from each member of your database; doing so simply isn’t Google’s problem.</p>
<p><strong>Store Sales </strong>refers to the ability to the ability to import offline transaction data into Google Ads, at which time Google matches transactions data with Google Ads user information to create powerful audience for optimization, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/03/06/multichannel-marketing-with-facebook-ads">upselling and cross-selling</a>.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="4d4492e2-79cf-4dc7-a4ce-24072618a33a" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adwords-store-sales-gdpr.png" alt="adwords store sales gdpr impact" width="512" height="512" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>In addition to the same personally identifying information implicated in Custom Audiences, when it comes to Store Sales there’s also a chance that financial data could be appended and, thus, there is a clear need for informed consent under the GDPR.</p>
<p>Now, the majority of advertisers <em>aren’t</em> using either of these valuable tools, but the ones that are will need to be able to prove to prospective auditors that the information uploaded for Google to process on their behalf is kosher.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Next?</h2>
<p>The GDPR promises to be one of the most far-reaching and ambitious consumer protection programs ever devised.</p>
<p>Although the implementation of the GDPR is likely to cause some businesses more difficulty than others (such as enterprise firms that offer “big data” products), it’s important to remember that this legislation is being introduced to protect users’ rights in a time at which almost every conceivable aspect of our lives is stored online – and is highly vulnerable to exposure and exploitation.</p>
<p>The regulations officially go into effect on May 25th. If you haven&#8217;t started preparing your Google Ads account (and landing pages) for the impending changes, you should <em>probably</em> get going.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Google is making it possible for advertisers to reach a key segment of the millennial population: cord cutters. Through a slew of new YouTube TrueView features, including the ability to target tv screens, a light tv viewing audience segment, and an ad experience through Google Preferred that mirrors the tv-watching experience, Google has expanded your ad reach to the biggest screen in most people's homes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Live television audiences might not be what they used to, friend, but that doesn’t mean millennial eyeballs aren’t glued to screens during primetime (and every other hour of the day). As such, businesses that once leaned on commercials to build brand awareness and promote new products—whether nationally or regionally—are looking for impressions elsewhere.</p>
<p>Enter Google.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="2aed56b9-5dae-4904-9511-57c0f4d096b7" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Everyone’s favorite monopoly-haver just released a suite of new features designed to help advertisers reach the coveted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cord-cutting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cord-cutting</a> subset of humanity (i.e. people who don&#8217;t pay for cable) while they catch up on the latest episode of SVU. Why? Because, per <a href="https://adwords.googleblog.com/2018/04/video-is-everywhere-helping-brands-find.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a>, “18- to 49-year-olds in the US are either light viewers of TV or do not subscribe to TV; but over 90 percent of these people watch YouTube.”</p>
<p>Here’s what’s being rolled out to help you ply your prospects away from the NBA playoffs.</p>
<h2>Target YouTube Audiences on TV Screens</h2>
<p>Despite not having a cable box tucked into the entertainment center, people are still <em>using</em> televisions. While recent years have seen mobile devices take the forefront as the medium for video viewership, things are swinging back towards TV.</p>
<p>This is due, in large part, to the rise of gaming consoles-as-entertainment-hubs and the proliferation of services like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and, of course, YouTube (where Google reports that more than 150 million hours of video are consumed each day…<em>on televisions alone!</em>).  In response to advertisers clamoring to reach these show-binging, sport-crushing viewers, Google has rolled out a new device type to target…</p>
<p><strong>TV Screens.</strong></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="17bd6685-456f-402b-ba99-fa85500faa6d" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/youtube-trueview-device-targeting-tv-screens.png" alt="youtube device targeting tv screens" width="418" height="282" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>At some point within the next few months, Google will add a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/07/youtube-ad-tv-placements">TV placement option</a> to the current list of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/12/29/adwords-networks-devices-settings">targetable devices </a>available in both AdWords and DoubleClick. That list currently includes computers, phones, and tablets. In beta tests, ads targeted to TV’s yielded an average lift of 47% in ad recall and a 35% uptick in purchase intent.</p>
<p>Not too shabby.</p>
<h2>New Audience: Light TV Viewers</h2>
<p>This one’s probably going to matter more to the majority of the advertising community…</p>
<p>If you’re looking to reach cord cutters—either as a standalone audience or paired with other traits that might help you define your target demographic—Google will now offer a new <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/07/adwords-if-functions">audience segment in AdWords</a>.</p>
<p>It’s called <strong>light TV viewers</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Unfortunately, </em>it’s only available as an audience on YouTube. Personally, I’d love to see it rolled out across the Display Network, too; I’d wager that if it sees use on YouTube, it’ll be opened up across the GDN. By pairing the light TV viewer audience with other affinities, geotargeting, and gender/age targeting, you’ll be able to get <em>even closer</em> to homing in on granular subsets of the clicking population, a la Facebook.</p>
<p>And finally, the pièce de résistance.</p>
<h2>…. YouTube Gets TV Commercials! (sort of)</h2>
<p>One for the big boys.</p>
<p>After launching YouTube TV in 2017. To say the service sees its fair share of use would be the understatement of the century. YouTube TV now reaches 85% of US households and has partnerships with a handful of pro sports leagues; it also just announced a partnership with cable networks to bring even more programming to the platform. As such, it makes complete sense for Google to begin offering advertisers the ability to interrupt the viewing experience of millions of Americans with the commercials they thought they’d left behind.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="6b772809-eae4-48e7-baab-1378bc12de85" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>If you currently leverage television commercials in any capacity—or would like to fold them into your brand-building efforts—you can now use <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/products/google-preferred/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Preferred</a> (a pre-packaged set of 12 high-quality channels designed to help advertisers succeed in the coveted 18-34 year-old group) to advertise on both top-performing YouTube content <em>and</em> traditional TV content from one place.</p>
<p>Game. Changer.</p>
<h2>More Toys for Advertisers</h2>
<p>With <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/03/facebook-f8">Facebook’s recent suite </a>of community-centric tools and AR integrations across Instagram and Messenger, it makes complete sense for Google to begin leveraging their most valuable subsidiary (YouTube) in ways that improve targeting while providing a more engaging, relevant industry for consumers.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/24/facebook-creative-hub">Creative Hub</a> is riddled with superlative examples of big brands (with creative teams and swollen bankrolls) launching neat stuff on Facebook, it can be difficult to envision, say, an accountant or plumber or three-person startup creating Canvas ads.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean you need to stay married to the same old static image creative (but hey, if it’s working, don’t abandon it: expand).</p>
<p>In fact, there are a handful of alternative ad types that can jumpstart your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/07/facebook-statistics">Facebook ad strategy</a> that don’t require you go out and find yourself a Jon Hamm knockoff with a MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>With that, here are the three Facebook ad types you probably aren’t using yet (but definitely need to roll out across your account ASAP)…</p>
<h2>Underutilized Facebook Ad Type #1: Offer Ads</h2>
<p>You’ve structured your account perfectly…</p>
<p>Your audiences have achieved peak granularity…</p>
<p>You’re still not moving units.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just need to start a fire under someone’s ass to make them act. And, for many bargain-starved browsers, a good ol&#8217; fashioned promotional discount is the perfect prod to incite a purchase.</p>
<p>So, why not sweeten the deal with a Facebook offer ad?</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="videos" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.embed_video" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="728e67f3-37a5-44ae-9640-11763892a952" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-offer-ad-example.png" alt="underused facebook ad types" width="700" height="439" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Offer ads are one of the best ways to get peoples’ attention on Facebook <em>and</em> prompt them to act.</p>
<p>They provide you with a handful of options in terms of the form and exclusivity of the promotion you’re pitching, and can serve as the perfect complement to your existing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/05/24/adwords-promotion-extension">promotion-centric advertising</a> efforts.</p>
<p>If you sell your wares online, prospects will receive notifications across all their apps and devices to remind them of your promotion.</p>
<p>But it’s physical stores that stand to benefit most from offer ads.</p>
<p>If you run a brick and mortar outfit, shoppers who walk through your front door can whip out their smartphones and use the offer served to them on Facebook in real life. They also get an email about the offer and—the best part—when they’re near your store, Facebook will remind them that you offer will expire soon: name another ad type with this many touch points!</p>
<p>(Note that your promotion will always appear in prospects’ “Offers” bookmark)</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-offer-ads-logo_0.png" alt="facebook offer ad logo" width="149" height="132" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, though, hardly anyone seems to be using these things.</p>
<p>Exploit their ignorance my friends.</p>
<p>Part of the reason offer ads might not be as widespread as they should be is that the option to create them only appears in your Ads Manager account if you select <em>specific campaign goals</em> (more on that in a moment) or boost an offer from your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/16/facebook-business-page">Facebook Business Page</a>. Pretend I didn’t say that last bit; creating ads from anywhere other than Ads Manager is a fool’s errand.</p>
<p>Offer ads are made from modular components that can be stripped or added as you see fit. The title (which should probably, you know, tell prospects exactly how sweet a deal you’re offering) can be up to 50 characters in length; the details—the textual meat of the thing—cap out at 250.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/create-facebook-offer-ad.png" alt="creating facebook offer ads" width="382" height="317" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s also important to note that you need to set an end date for your offer ads. Per Facebook, the ideal length for your promotion is 7 days; this is enough time for it to been seen, shared, and, most importantly, served up again as a reminder.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, offers can be redeemed online (using an offer URL), in store, or both; you also have the option to add catch-all or unique promo codes to allow for more effective tracking.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-offer-ads-promo-code.png" alt="facebook offer promo code creation" width="379" height="338" /></div>
<p>The last two need-to-know kernels regarding offer ads are that you can control the total number of available offers <em>and</em> the ability to share promo codes directly from an offer ad; while you may feel inclined to err on the side of exclusivity, I’d suggest setting the bar prettyyyyyyyy high. After all, if you’re working with well-defined, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/01/facebook-audiences">engaged Facebook audiences</a>, these folks probably have friends who’d be into your offer as well. In other words…</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-offer-ad-hide-share-button.png" alt="facebook offer ad hide share button" width="368" height="200" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>…don’t check that box ^^^</p>
<p>Now, the best way to get people to <em>use</em> the offers you serve up on a platter is to make your discounts substantial; Facebook recommends pushing things that are <em>free</em> or at least 20% off. Color me shocked.</p>
<h3>Some caveats about offer ads</h3>
<p>Facebook offer ads, versatile and powerful as they may be, do come without a few peccadillos. They can only be used when you choose the Traffic, Conversion, or Store Visits objectives (fail to do so and the slider that enables offer ads won’t appear in the Ad Set interface).</p>
<p>Finally, before you go ahead and activate an offer ad, make sure you’ve double and tripled checked <em>everything</em>: once pushed live, they can’t be edited or deleted.</p>

<h2>Underutilized Facebook Ad Type #2: Video Ads</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/m/facebook-video-ads#advertise-with-videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to</a> Facebook, people spend five times longer looking at video than at static content on both Facebook and Instagram. This could be related to the fact that more than 100 million hours of video are consumed on (just) Facebook <strong>every day</strong>.</p>
<p>Sure, images and carousels are effective tools for brand building, lead generation, and, you know, sales. But nothing captures the attention of the scrolling masses quite like video.</p>
<p>None of this is a secret.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-video-ad-engagement-metrics.png" alt="facebook video ads see a ton of engagement" width="669" height="390" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why, then, are so many SMBs sticking with stills?</p>
<p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/25/facebook-video-ads">Facebook video ads</a> the barrier to entry is far less daunting than you might think.</p>
<p>In fact, these days that statement applies to video in general. I mean look at <a href="https://www.drift.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drift</a>. If you’re a marketer in any sense of the world, you’ve undoubtedly stumbled upon at least <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwdKmeYQ76Sh22lfTiFg5fg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of their videos</a> in recent months (on product launch days they’re positively unavoidable on LinkedIn). Outside of the small handful composed by their in-house video team, none of these clips are particularly flashy. Most are recorded on phones. There’s minimal production. And they clearly work. Because they keep makin’ ‘em.</p>
<p>You can bring this same DIY approach to your business’s Facebook ads. Yes, that’s right: Driving engagement doesn’t require a director, a green screen, and a $10,000 production budget.</p>
<p>Simply by virtue of being some shade of dynamic, a shocking number of people will stop and look. Hell, you don’t even need to get <em>walk-while-recording-your-face-and-waxing-poetic</em>complicated: you can use apps like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/m/mobile-apps-to-create-video-ads/ripl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripl</a> (to add animation) or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/m/mobile-apps-to-create-video-ads/legend" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Legend</a> (for text overlay) to turn existing static assets into quick, attention grabbing videos, then upload those assets to Facebook or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/wordstream-for-ppc">WordStream Advisor</a> (that’s right, we support video ads)…</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/wordstream-advisor-facebook-video-ad.png" alt="manage facebook video ads with wordstream advisor" width="700" height="265" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And pair them the same audiences you’re already successfully serving ads to across Facebook, Instagram, and the Audience Network.</p>
<p>Watch what happens (you won’t be disappointed).</p>
<h3>How to make a great Facebook video ad</h3>
<p>While your video ads don’t need celebrity guests or ice wall-melting zombie dragons to move the needle, there <em>are</em> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/09/26/how-to-create-facebook-ads">best practices</a> that should be adhered to if you want to wring was much value out of them as possible.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-video-ad-example-underutilized-ad-type-2.jpg" alt="facebook video ad example" width="482" height="662" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Facebook recommends that your videos are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less than 15 seconds in length</li>
<li>Shot vertically (for optimal mobile performance)</li>
<li>Include your brand and/or the product you’re promoting right out of the gate</li>
<li>Are designed to be experienced <strong>without </strong>sound</li>
</ul>
<p>What does that last bit mean?</p>
<p>Most people who engage with Facebook video ads do so on their phones or while performing thirty other actions on a computer; in either case, they aren’t <em>listening</em>. This means that if your value proposition is spoken, a good chunk of your prospects (viewers you’re <em>paying for</em>) are going to miss it.</p>
<p>To ensure your message is received, add text to your videos (using one of the aforementioned tools), use images that makes sense without sound, and leverage the hell out of the ad text (90 characters), headline (25 characters), and link description (30 character) fields.</p>
<h2>Underutilized Facebook Ad Type #3: Messenger Ads</h2>
<p>Last but not least, we have <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/31/facebook-messenger-ads">Facebook Messenger ads</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s talk numbers real quick…</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-messenger-user-metrics-ad-support.png" alt="facebook messenger ads user stats" width="700" height="123" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/products/messenger-for-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a></em></p>
<p>Messenger takes advantage of the fact that the majority of us have no interest in picking up the phone; most folks would rather talk with their fingers and thumbs.</p>
<p>Now, I am by no means the first person to extoll the virtues of Facebook Messenger. There’s a guy named Larry you might be familiar with who’s <em>so</em> convinced of its value that he went and <a href="https://mobilemonkey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started a company</a> to help marketers tap into its utility by leveraging chatbots built on the platform. But while Facebook chatbots are capable of a million and one different actions, we’re here to talk about ads.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/28/facebook-messenger-marketing">Facebook messenger ads</a> can be as simple or complex as you like and come in two different flavors: click to messenger and sponsored message. Both are underused.</p>
<p>This is a mistake.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-messenger-ads-two-types.png" alt="facebook messenger ads varieties illustrated" width="407" height="237" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click to messenger ads are exactly what they sound like. They are served as standard ads (on Facebook, Messenger, or Instagram) with a special CTA that, when clicked, opens into a Messenger conversation.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-click-to-messenger-underused-ad-example.png" alt="facebook ads click to messenger" width="700" height="684" /></div>
<p>After selecting “Messages” as your campaign objective and choosing “Click to Messenger” at the Ad Set level, you’re directed to build out your audience, budget, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/10/facebook-ad-placements">placement</a>, and ad scheduling as you would with any other Facebook ad type.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-messenger-ads-click-to-message-ad-type.png" alt="setting up facebook click to messenger ads" width="800" height="226" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the ad level, though, the “Ad Setup” interface has an additional button (below the standard fare) labeled “Edit Messenger Setup.”</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ad-setup-edit-messenger-setup.png" alt="facebook ad edit messenger setup" width="383" height="572" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More on what that’s for in just a second, but note that, in the event you gloss over this step, any prospects who clicks your ad’s CTA button will be taken to Messenger and served a default response. This is not the way to maximize an underutilized ad format.</p>
<p>Switching gears, sponsored message ads send a message to people who have an existing Messenger conversation with your business (duh).</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-sponsored-messenger-ads-underused.jpg" alt="facebook ad sponsored messages" width="321" height="667" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By default, sponsored message ads are sent to everyone with an existing conversation with your business. If you’d like to reach a more targeted subset of your chatty compatriots, you can click “show advanced options” to open the regular audience creation interface.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-sponsored-messenger-ads-advanced-options.png" alt="facebook message ads advanced targeting options" width="617" height="355" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to ad creation for sponsored messages (and messenger setup for click to messenger ads) the process is relatively similar. The main distinctions are that, for click to messenger ads you’re able to use “text only,” “text and image,” or “text and video,” whereas the video option is unavailable with sponsored messages.</p>
<p>In both instances, you customize just about everything, from the initial message to the custom responses that a user can choose from; in the event you’d rather use the opportunity to direct prospects to specific pages on your website, you can roll with hyperlinked buttons instead of suggested replies.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-messenger-ads-customer-actions-suggested-replies.png" alt="facebook message chatbot ad intergration" width="509" height="715" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using some combination of replies or buttons, you can drastically increase the speed and scale of personalized customer interactions. For a more engaging experience, you can let AI do the legwork by clicking, you guessed it, “Connect Your Bot.” But that, my friends, is a topic for another day.</p>
<h2>What Are You Waiting For?</h2>
<p>As a platform with a seemingly infinite number of targeting options and well over a dozen ad types, it’s easy to let paralysis by analysis dictate your Facebook advertising strategy. By implementing just one of the three ad formats discussed in detail today, you’ll give your business a distinct advantage over the competition. What more could you want?!</p>
