<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/30/best-display-ad-examples">The 17 Best Display Ads We&#8217;ve Ever Seen (+Why They Work)</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Display ads are quite the worthwhile investment for a business. They yield widespread and targeted exposure across the web; they help consumers get familiar with and more easily recognize your brand, and retargeting with display ads have a high ROI.</p>
<div><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-lexus20example_0.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-lexus example" width="791" height="204" /></div>
<p>But, display ad click-through rates (CTRs) are, on average, a <em>fraction</em> of search ad CTRs—the reason being that while you can target for general interests and behaviors, you can’t directly target exact phrases prospective customers are typing into the search box when seeking out a product, service, or solution—as is the case with paid search ads.</p>
<p>What this means is, to compel someone to click on your display ads, you need outstanding visual creative and compellng copywriting. But it’s not easy to think up a great display ad from scratch. That&#8217;s why we’ve compiled some of the best display ads we&#8217;ve seen so far in 2020 to inspire your next campaign. We will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide images of real display ads that are successful.</li>
<li>Break down exactly how and why they work.</li>
<li>Help you identfy which strategies are best for your business.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The best display ad examples for inspiration</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, display ad CTRs are a fraction of search ads of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/06/google-ads-benchmarks-during-covid-19">0.46 percent</a>, which about 1/10th of the click-through rate (CTR) of the average search ad. This makes them a challenging marketing strategy to execute, but when done right, the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/benefits-of-display-advertising/">benefits of display advertising</a> are pervasive and long-lasting. These examples will equp you with some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/12/02/creative-display-ad-ideas">great display ads ideas</a> and strategies so you can experience these benefits without having to start from scrach.</p>
<h3>1. Apple TV uses simplicity to grab your attention</h3>
<p>You may not need a lot of text or <a href="/blog/ws/2017/01/12/how-to-write-great-advertising-copy">compelling ad copy</a> to grab someone’s attention with a display ad. In fact, it&#8217;s often much better to keep things simple, like with this Apple display ad example below.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-20rewind20rewatch20example.png" alt="best display ads of 2020- Apple rewind rewatch example.png" width="800" height="219" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>An example of an effective Apple display ad</em></p>
<p>Just look at this leaderboard ad for the Apple TV gift card. They highlight the colorful cards themselves and use four words of copy in total.That might sound like it’s not enough, but because of word selection, the <a href="/blog/ws/2013/08/15/ad-copywriting-tips">ad copy</a> works well.</p>
<p>It also capitalizes on the current situation and trend of staying at home and watching movies, rather than going out to the theater.&#8221;Learn more&#8221; isn’t the <a href="/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">strongest call to action</a>, but the high-contrast blue is strong and, otherwise, it’s a great ad.</p>
<p>The same campaign also includes two square display ads with an interesting use of emojis to replace letters in the copy.</p>
<p>You can find more great Apple marketing campaigns in our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/06/how-to-market-a-product">epic product marketing examples post</a>.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-apple20gift20card20example.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-apple gift card example" width="390" height="347" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>These Apple display ads use emojis to replace letters.</em></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-apple20gift20card20example202_0.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-apple gift card example 2" width="356" height="297" /></div>
<p>Both ads focus on the versatility of the gift card, and how you can use it for music, movies, or other entertainment on multiple devices.Plus, using<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/27/emojis-in-ad-text"> emojis in ad text has been shown to boost CTR</a> for social media ads, so why not implement it with display? If you want to stand out on the Google Display Network, you need to do something differently. The emoji headlines grab the eye without being noisy, annoying, or out of place on publisher sites.</p>
<p>Apple is good at marketing&#8230;who knew?</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Get the guide &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLiQContentDLHowToMakeGreatLandingPages.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_LandingPages_HowToMakeGreatLandingPagesGuide_Download">How to Make Great Landing Pages (with Crazy High Conversions)</a></p>
<h3>2. Geico uses color and contrast to highlight a new offering</h3>
<p>If you’re <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">promoting a new offer</a>, you could learn from Geico’s skyscraper display ad.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-geico20example_0.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-geico example" width="400" height="773" /></div>
<p>Everybody knows Geico for car insurance, but many don’t know about their home insurance. This display ad uses Geico’s <a href="/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">brand awareness</a> as a car insurance company to push a better, cheaper policy for both car and home.</p>
<p>The icons and color contrast also communicate the concept of mixing two different worlds. And it’s not the only format of <a href="/blog/ws/2020/03/02/banner-ads-examples">banner ad</a> they created for the campaign. Below is the square banner ad version that also uses the same concept and actually uses the phrase, “More than just car insurance:”</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-geico20example20square20banner20ad.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-geico example square banner ad" width="520" height="436" /></div>
<p>They also match the <a href="/blog/ws/2017/05/10/ad-creative-inspiration">ad creative</a> to the ad size, rather than just sizing down the house and car from the skyscraper.</p>
<p>As Geico has demonstrated, with the right banner ad, display can be a great medium for spreading the word about your new product or service.</p>
<h3>3. Instapage gets straight to the point</h3>
<p>In advertising, simplicity is a virtue. A potential customer can’t be interested in your product if you don’t efficiently <a href="/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">communicate the value</a> of your offer. Instapage’s ad simply states, “the most powerful landing page builder:”</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-instapage20example_0.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-instapage example" width="467" height="380" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Instapage uses a bold tagline in their display ad to succinctly communicate their value.</em></p>
<p>While this display ad feature-focused, rather than benefit-focused (not normally a <a href="/blog/ws/2019/10/02/display-ads-best-practices">display ad best practice</a>), the “see why” CTA hints at the value proposition for making the switch.</p>
<p>Plus, their target audience is quite technical, made up of marketing geeks (like us) who often<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/21/features-vs-benefits"> view features as benefits</a>. For example, there’s no need to translate that a <a href="/blog/ws/2013/07/11/landing-page-conversion-rate-guide">higher conversion rate</a> means more money in the bank.</p>
<h3>4. PlayerUnknown&#8217;s Battlegrounds breaks the rules successfully</h3>
<p>Sometimes it’s okay to break the rules. With a game as wild and chaotic as Pubg, a simple visual and some text might not get the message across. Instead, they’ve <a href="/blog/ws/2015/02/03/repurposing-content">repurposed</a> the explosion from the cover, highlighting the action in the fast-paced game.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-battlegrounds20example_0.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-battlegrounds example" width="787" height="99" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Repurposing existing creative for display ads can facilitate increased brand awareness.</em></p>
<p>It’s not the cleanest most original or<a href="/blog/ws/2016/12/20/creative-advertising-ideas"> creative ad</a>, but it uses their brand awareness well and aligns with their actual product. Of course, the formats and norms depend on the <a href="/blog/ws/2014/11/18/google-display-network-tips">ad network</a>, but that shouldn’t stop you.</p>
<p>If you’ve got a good idea that breaks the rules, <a href="/blog/ws/2015/06/16/ab-testing-tips">test it</a> against a rule-following control. That’s the great thing about digital marketing. You can test all your hypotheses <a href="/blog/ws/2016/08/18/ppc-money-saving-checklist">without having to spend a lot of time or money</a>.</p>

<h3>5. The New York Times addresses recent trends with their newest ad</h3>
<p>The news is under fire. The allegations of “fake news” exploding over the past few years is one of the most important and concerning <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/31/2020-ecommerce-marketing-trends">trends on the internet</a>. The New York Times addresses these changes with a simple display ad that frames them as the hero:</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-new20york20times20example_0.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-new york times example" width="450" height="369" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>The New York Times is leveraging current trends to convey a strategic message through their display ad. </em></p>
<p>Regardless of how you feel about NYT as a news provider, it’s a smart move. In an age where news stories sourced from Twitter are common, you need a reliable source of information. Just looking at Facebook or Twitter is likely to lead you down all sorts of rabbit holes. “We’re the answer” Is the statement this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/12/02/creative-display-ad-ideas">effective banner ad</a> makes. And the call to action, “see my options,” is personal and effective. It’s a great ad.</p>
<h3>6. This clickable ad from Lex uses eyes to attract yours</h3>
<p>A human face can be a good way to grab someone’s attention, as long as you use it in the right way.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-lexus20example.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-lexus example" width="800" height="217" /></div>
<p>Of course, it might seem strange for a car brand to use such a roundabout way to market a new model. But really, they aren’t marketing their car directly with this ad. Instead, they are marketing their latest innovation—the new speaker system in their Lexus ES.</p>
<p>This becomes clear from the <a href="/blog/ws/2014/02/12/great-landing-pages">landing page</a> with a dedicated video all about the human sense of hearing and sound design.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-lexus20landing20page20example.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-lexus landing page example" width="800" height="313" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://www.lexus.com/curiosity/ES-Mark-Levinson-PurePlay">Image Source</a></em></p>
<p>If the ad led directly to a static landing page full of car and engine specs, it wouldn’t work. But that’s not what it does. Instead, the ad and <a href="/blog/ws/2020/03/05/video-ad-ideas">video</a> together are meant to help cement an image of Lexus as an innovator. And it works.</p>
<h3>7. A clear message from Mount Sinai in troubling times</h3>
<p>Advertising is all about context. You can’t create an ad that resonates with someone if you <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/18/post-covid-19-customers">don’t know anything about them </a>or how they think. Mount Sinai knows what New Yorkers are going through, and knows how it’s affecting annual check-ups at their hospitals. They have taken steps to address the situation, and their display ad conveys that message well.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-mount20sinai20example.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-mount sinai example" width="400" height="338" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>An effective display ad demonstrates how well you know your audience.</em></p>
<p>If we wanted to improve the banner ad even further, there are a few things to nitpick.</p>
<p>The <a href="/blog/ws/2015/02/02/ppc-ad-headlines">headline</a> and CTA are great, but the main copy is a bit long and it&#8217;s hard to read due to the small font size. They could probably reduce the length by almost half, and still convey what they want.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4da.png" alt="📚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide download</strong> &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download">The 42 Best Call to Action Phrases Ever (&amp; Why They Work)</a></p>
<h3>8. The perfect brand awareness display ad from Polo Ralph Lauren</h3>
<p>What signifies class and style more than models wearing a fashion collection? The perfect setting.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-polo20example.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-polo example" width="400" height="333" /></div>
<p>Somehow these models are dressed and fancified to the teeth, wandering along the ocean’s edge at a beach. A throwback to when people went to the beach, sure, but not to sunbathe or swim, but to socialize.</p>
<p>It’s perfect for the more outdoorsy brand Polo is trying to establish (their fall collection is called Road Trip). It’s a great example of <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/14/use-branding-to-improve-advertising">branding with display ads</a>.</p>
<h3>9. Merrell makes you want to visit the great outdoors</h3>
<p>Instead of featuring their shoes on a blank white or black background like many shoe companies do, Merrell chose a forest setting.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-merrell20example_0.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-merrell example" width="300" height="597" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>This display ad advertises an experience, not a product.</em></p>
<p>The trees, green grass, and leaves, combined with the font choice for Ontario, come together and create a longing to visit the great outdoors. This ad promises the experience of hiking, not the product itself. And of course, if you want to go hiking, you’re going to need hiking boots.</p>
<h3>10. Integral Ad Science delivers a short and punchy message</h3>
<p>This display ad from IAS uses an eye-catching color scheme to drive home a short and punchy message.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-IAS20example_0.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-IAS example" width="396" height="315" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>For this display ad example, the copy <strong>is</strong> the creative</em>.</p>
<p>It’s incredibly simple, 9 words in total, with no real images, icons, or graphics. But it works because of the balance between creative and copy. The mad ad scientists know what they’re doing.</p>
<h3>11. Square proves that the KISS rule still works</h3>
<p>An ad doesn’t need to be revolutionary to be effective. Keeping things simple is often a recipe for success.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-square20example_0.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-square example" width="300" height="600" /></div>
<p>If you break down the Square ad above, these are the moving pieces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logo</li>
<li>Brand name</li>
<li>Benefit</li>
<li>Product image</li>
<li>Call to action (not even a button)</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as you have a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/26/product-photography">good product image</a> and a clear value proposition, you don’t need creative genius.</p>
<h3>12. SEMrush stands out with creative images, color, and animations</h3>
<p>You don’t need to put on an expensive photoshoot with professional models to create an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/19/outreach-marketing-techniques">attention-grabbing</a> ad. When used creatively, icons, or even <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/22/best-practices-stock-photos">stock photos</a> can help you stand out from the crowd. This square image ad from SEMrush is the perfect cure to <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/banner-blindness-old-and-new-findings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banner blindness</a>.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-SEMrush20example.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-semrush example" width="400" height="340" /></div>
<p>Instead of a stereotypical pedestal to indicate competition, SEMrush uses a chess piece inside of an hourglass. The hourglass symbolizes the speed at which you can gleam the competitor insights promised in the headline.</p>
<p>The photos have been edited to create a contrasting color scheme that grabs your attention. Of course, with the advent of HTML5, a display ad no longer has to be a static image ad. You have all kinds of animation options.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-semrush20gif.gif" alt="best display ads of 2020-semrush gif" /></p>
<p>In this banner ad, SEMrush uses a smart graphic of climbing the SERPs with a link chain. The animations help serve more copy in a readable format, as well as grab the user’s attention with the movement.</p>
<h3>13. The perfect B2B display ad from SAP</h3>
<p>This animated banner from SAP is an example of <a href="/blog/ws/2019/10/17/b2b-lead-generation">great B2B marketing</a>.The first headline is short and concise, highlighting a common pain point for many companies: a disengaged workforce.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-sap20banner20ad.gif" alt="best display ads of 2020-SAP animation example" /></p>
<p>The copy in the next frame then introduces a solution that will help you nurture a successful workplace. It focuses on the underlying problem and high-level benefits, rather than getting bogged down in specific features.</p>
<p>If more B2B ads were as human and concise as this, ad blindness might be a smaller problem.</p>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f914.png" alt="🤔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Are you taking advantage of all that Google Ads has to offer? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f914.png" alt="🤔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h3>14. Workplace highlights the benefits of using their software</h3>
<p>This animated ad from Workplace really showcases the potential of animation in <a href="https://localiq.com/products/display-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">display ads</a>. With just a few simple transitions and text, it highlights its three most important benefits to managers and business owners.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of20202020workplace20example20gif.gif" alt="best display ads of 2020 workplace example gif" /></p>
<p>There’s no way you could do that with a static banner of the same size (without making the text illegibly small). When used right, animation is a tool that can help you convey more information to potential customers. Key takeaway here: It’s not just about grabbing attention.</p>
<h3>15. PNC Bank uses dogs and humor to promote their wallet app</h3>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2013/10/08/funny-ads">Humor</a> is a great, and often underutilized tool in the advertiser’s toolbox. This short, animated ad from PNC Bank is a great example of a display ad.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020_pnc20bank.gif" alt="best display ads of 2020_pnc bank" /></p>
<p>It contrasts the ease of taking pictures and using social media, with the typical difficulty of mobile banking. And it’s not just ads, like we’ve previously covered, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/09/10/comedy-in-content-marketing">humor works in content marketing</a> too. That saidd, you may want to add some stand-up to your Netflix routine.</p>
<h3>16. Constant Contact uses animation to demonstrate tech saavy</h3>
<p>This ad from Constant Contact uses simple animation to make their ad seem smarter and more modern.</p>

<p>Since the ad is about smart email marketing automation, the added movement feels like a necessary addition. The rich media works almost like a promise in itself, that the ad is as smart as the service.</p>
<h3>17. Bulldog Skincare proves interstitial ads don’t have to be torture</h3>
<p>Interstitials are the most controversial display ad format by far. Although you get unprecedented size to advertise your message, it comes at a price.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20display20ads20of202020-bulldog20example.png" alt="best display ads of 2020-bulldog example" width="500" height="306" /></div>
<p>The user is forced to see the ad and often clicks (which you pay for) accidentally while trying to close the ad. But with the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/30/design-principles">right banner ad design </a>and targeting, they can still be an effective medium.</p>
<p>Bulldog Skincare uses a humorous image and headline to take the edge off the interruption.</p>
<h2>Key takeaways from these great display ads</h2>
<p>The above ad examples have a wide variety of characteristics—often mutliple per ad—that support a wide range of <a href="/blog/ws/2020/06/15/marketing-objectives">marketing goals and intentions</a>. To help you ensure you extract all the key takeaways, we&#8217;ve compiled a list of 20 strategies employed by these ads:</p>
<ol>
<li>Appeal to current trends.</li>
<li>Keep it simple; less is often more with display ads.</li>
<li>Use vibrant colors or high-contrast to grab attention.</li>
<li>Replace words or even letters with emojis.</li>
<li>Stick to one point of focus for each ad.</li>
<li>Match your ad creative to the add size, rather than squeezing one ad into a new format.</li>
<li>Succinctly communicate your value proposition.</li>
<li>Know what matters to your target audience.</li>
<li>Add animation or a video to the landing page associated with your ad.</li>
<li>Try an ad that focuses on your brand rather than a specific product.</li>
<li>Repurpose content for compelling visuals and a brand boost.</li>
<li>Test unique ideas against a conventional version.</li>
<li>Personalize your CTA to resonate more with your audience.</li>
<li>Try compelling and uniquely displayed copy as your ad creative.</li>
<li>With strategically placed copy and creative, your CTA may not even have to be a button.</li>
<li>Advertise an experience, not a product.</li>
<li>Animate your ads to convey more information.</li>
<li>Find unique ways to spruce up icons and stock photos.</li>
<li>Try adding humor to your ads.</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid of interstitial ads.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Test and optimize to find the best display ad for your business</h2>
<p>When you don’t know what you’re doing, display advertising is an easy way to waste your ad spend. But if you’re inspired by greatness (like the ads in this post) and follow tried and tested principles, you have a shot at success. But remember that your first idea is rarely the winner. Come up with a few different ideas, mix and match, and test the final ads against each other for the best results. Ongoing testing and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/24/google-ads-optimization">optimization of your Google Ads</a> is a reliable recipe for success.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://www.gotomeeting.com/webinar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.gotomeeting.com/webinar">GoToWebinar</a> hosts over 2.7 million webinar series for 50,000 clients each year.</p>
<p><strong>Pros: </strong>The platform makes it easy to produce a large number of webinars with replicable templates and their Simulated Live functionality. This enables marketers to schedule a webinar recording to appear across time zones. They also offer marketing support with GoToStage, a place that can act as a marketing channel to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/21/facebook-ads-for-events">promote your online event </a>for lead generation.</p>
<p><strong>Cons: </strong>There are some drawbacks to this webinar solution, such as the requirement of installing the GoToWebinar software in order to view the content. In addition, there are no unique attendee <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/30/social-media-engagement">engagement opportunities</a> offered beyond polls and surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing: </strong>A GoToWebinar subscription will cost in between $59-499/month depending on the number of participants and channel pages. Their best value is the Pro subscription for $249/month, allowing up to 500 participants and unlocking the pre-recorded webinar function.</p>
<h3>Best webinar platform #2: BlueJeans Events</h3>

</article>
</div>

<p><a href="https://www.bluejeans.com/products/events" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlueJeans</a> enables companies to produce webinars with BlueJeans Events, a webinar tool focused on <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/04/interactive-content">interactive</a> events and webcasts for your customers and prospects.</p>
<p><strong>Pros: </strong>BlueJeans Events enables companies to produce large-scale free webinar events with up to 150 presenters on different cameras. Plus, it integrates with a handful of software including Marketo, Facebook Live, Salesforce and lets users embed HTML code to host webinars on their website.</p>
<p><strong>Cons: </strong>BlueJeans originally started as an online <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/07/marketing-meetings">meeting</a> software, so it lacks some of the unique functionalities that webinar-specific platforms are built upon. These include landing page personalization, enhanced analytics and unique ways to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/26/how-to-do-a-webinar">drive attendee engagement</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing: </strong>The platform has a pay-per-webinar payment structure. It’s $499 per online event with up to 500 attendees. Enterprise plan pricing is available.</p>
<h3>Best webinar platform #3: On24</h3>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://www.on24.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>On24 is a platform that delivers “engaging, data-rich and interactive experiences” in the form of a live, recorded or hybrid webinar. <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/23/personalized-video-marketing">Personalization</a> is key when it comes to this webinar tool.</p>
<p><strong> Pros: </strong>The magic of On24 is in your ability to create engaging webinar interfaces with quizzes, polls, surveys, group chats, embedded Twitter feeds, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Cons: </strong>The only negative is that it seems to lack built-in <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/21/promotional-email-examples">promotional marketing</a> tools that teams can use to drive registrations. In addition, personalizing your webinar will take time. If you’re looking for a simple platform that sets up a webinar in a few seconds, this might not be it.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing: </strong>On24 offers custom pricing provided from a sales representative based on your needs.</p>
<h3>Best webinar platform #4: Demio</h3>

<p><strong>Cons: </strong>Demio’s major flaw is its limited integration offering. While it does have a Zapier integration that customers can use, it only offers a handful of formal integrations for popular software platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing: </strong>The service ranges between $49-239/month based on the size of the webinar. The $239/month plan allows 500 attendees per webinar.</p>

<p><strong>Pros: </strong>WebinarNinja’s core competency is its simplicity. It’s an all-in-one webinar system that generates custom <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/02/12/great-landing-pages">landing pages</a>, attendee messaging, and a webinar template in less than ten seconds. You can also upload presentations directly into the software and embed <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/05/14/how-to-get-more-views-on-youtube">YouTube videos</a> to make the webinar more engaging.</p>
<p><strong>Cons: </strong>WebinarNinja only offers forms for live webinars as opposed to recurring events. Within those forms, only minimal customizations are allowed. Customers have struggled to add extra fields for attendees to fill when they are registering.</p>

<p><strong>Pros: </strong>A major draw of using this platform is that it is so familiar and ubiquitous for many people. Zoom had over <a href="https://blog.zoom.us/a-message-to-our-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">200 million</a> daily meeting participants reported in 2020. The platform is great for large events with 100-10,000 view-only attendees and offers a unique virtual hand-raising feature for increased, controlled engagement.</p>

Their features and reporting on the starter plans are very basic; you’ll have to pay more to unlock more functionality.

You can also connect streams with multiple cameras seamlessly to Facebook and <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/27/youtube-live">YouTube Live</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The sign of a good marketer is not wasting any digital real estate. From your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/01/homepage-design">homepage</a> to your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/11/23/best-404-error-pages">404 page</a>, every part of your website should be doing <em>something</em> to help engage your customer.</p>
<p>The same rule applies to creating a coming soon landing page. These landing pages can announce new products or a new company—but the challenge is to create a landing page that gets your prospective customer’s attention without overwhelming them. Striking the right balance between revealing information and withholding it can be hard.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/landing20page20generation20speed20resized.png" alt="speed landing page generation" width="800" height="547" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>In this post, we go over what you need to know to create a coming soon page that helps you convert visitors into future buyers.</p>
<h2>What is a coming soon landing page?</h2>
<p>A coming soon landing page is a temporary landing page that’s announcing a new product or service. It’s meant to pique interest, but also to get your customer to act on something.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/coming-soon-landing-pages.jpg" alt="coming soon landing page example" width="800" height="428" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/create-coming-soon-landing-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>That’s right, it’s not enough if your coming soon landing page just announces your new service. You want it to also get a sign up (or some sort of action) from your customer. This means an email submission. Or downloading an ebook. Or registering for an event.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because launching your product or service is a party, and the coming soon page is the party invite.</p>
<p>That means there are also things you’ll want to avoid in your coming soon landing page. Here are two key things to keep in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t just put up a generic maintenance mode template. </strong>Every part of your website should be doing at least two things. By putting up a simple in construction template, you’re telling your customer that you&#8217;re in construction but nothing else. Stay away from coming soon landing page templates, and instead focus on making something that matches your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t over promise or over reveal. </strong>Remember, your coming soon landing page is like a movie trailer. You don’t want to give away the whole plot!</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we’re clear on what a coming soon landing page and what to avoid, let’s look at what makes a coming soon page a winner.</p>
<h2>5 tips for creating a winning coming soon landing page</h2>
<p>Here are our five best tips for creating compelling coming soon landing pages that will entice your prospects—and keep them coming back!</p>
<h3>1. Be compelling, not overwhelming</h3>
<p>With a coming soon landing page, less is more. The first message is: You’ll like this new product <em>because of X. </em>The second message is: To stay in the loop, <em>do Y</em> (as in sign up for our newsletter or product launch).</p>
<p>To do this, focus on your headline and a short descriptor. Both should speak to what you’re offering and how it’s going to help improve your customer’s life.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s look at how TeekTak does this in the example below.</strong></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/coming-soon-landing-page-example.jpg" alt="coming soon landing page TeekTak example" width="640" height="444" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/coming-soon-pages/"><em>Image</em></a><a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/coming-soon-pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em> source</em></a></p>
<p>The headline:<em> Your Freelance Business, Simplified</em>. This hits the right emotions. Any freelancer can tell you the hassle of logging hours and using different invoices for each client. And while that emotional resonance is felt right away, TeekTak adds just enough of a descriptor to put real-life examples in our head: Time tracking. Invoicing.</p>
<p>Then, TeekTak has a nice clean place to put your email address, with a clear <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">call to action</a> (&#8220;Join Waiting List&#8221;).</p>
<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4e3.png" alt="📣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Free guide</strong> &gt;&gt; </span><strong><a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download" class="waffle-rich-text-link">The 36 Best Call to Action Phrases (Ever)</a></strong><span><strong> </strong></div></div></span></p>
<p>Plus, customers who want more information can click on the CTA button “Play Demo Video.”</p>
<h3>2. Have only one form to fill out</h3>
<p>A coming soon landing page is different from a traditional landing page. A traditional landing page can get away with two or three forms to fill out.</p>
<p>But when you’re announcing the arrival of a new site or product, you want your customer’s focus to be laser-tight—because you’re only offering one thing: an email signup.</p>
<p>The more you give a user to register on your coming soon landing page the greater the risk of losing them. There are only so many things for a customer to do on the page. Let’s say you have a coming soon landing page up, plus your site has several other pages (About us, FAQ, Contact Us, etc). Companies have shown that <em>not</em> including those navigational links can increase conversion by <a href="https://vwo.com/blog/a-b-testing-case-study-navigation-menu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100%</a>.</p>
<p>This is because by cutting distractions the reader is focused solely on the core message of the coming soon page. So there should be social media buttons (more on this below) and there should be one form to fill out.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: Set up a splash page that triggers before the user leaves your page. You can set this to go off after a few seconds.</p>
<h3>3. Set a countdown</h3>
<p>While a coming soon landing page is unique, there’s still the same mechanics of getting someone who lands on your page to convert.</p>
<p>We’ve talked about how the  top 25% of landing pages can convert more than<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/17/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate#:~:text=going%20to%20go%3F-,But%20what%20is%20a%20good%20conversion%20rate%3F,rates%20of%2011.45%25%20or%20higher."> 5%</a> of their visitors. So don’t settle for other oft-quoted numbers, like 2% or 3%.</p>
<p>One way to help increase your coming soon pages conversion rate is to set a countdown. <strong>You can do this by setting an actual, physically changing countdown clock. </strong>Or, if you don&#8217;t know the exact date of launch,  you can be more general and say “arriving this fall” or “out in time for Christmas.”</p>
<div>
<div class="video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video"><iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NFWucjkKeRI?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
</div>
<p>The point is the same—a coming soon landing page can look stagnant and forgotten without a countdown. There is no context for the customer to understand how soon is soon.</p>
<h3>4. Make it shareable</h3>
<p>We like putting sharing social media buttons on coming soon pages for one specific reason.</p>
<p><strong>More than any other landing page, you’re trying to get the word out about your coming soon page.</strong></p>
<p>Your new product or site is likely solving someone’s problem, and so you want to create buzz about your new solution.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: Increase the number of social shares your landing page will get across key platforms by creating a giveaway. On this giveaway, customers can enter by sharing your page on Facebook, retweeting it on Twitter, or posting about it on Instagram.</p>
<h3>5. Make it mobile</h3>
<p>As of this year, over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50%</a> of all web traffic comes from a mobile device. That number may even be higher, depending on your industry.</p>
<p>But whether you’re targeting B2B or B2C customers, you want to think “mobile first” when you’re designing your landing page.</p>
<h2>Examples of killer coming soon landing pages</h2>
<p>One of the best ways to get ideas for creating your own coming soon landing pages is to check out great examples. Here are four killer landing pages that you can learn from!</p>
<h3>1. Arche Travel</h3>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/coming-soon-landing-page-arche-travel.jpg" alt="coming soon landing page Arche Travel example" width="650" height="438" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.seedprod.com/coming-soon-pages-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>Notice how the eyes go to the Subscribe CTA button in the middle of the screen? It’s great placement, because it keeps the user focused on both the intent (subscribe to our mailing list) and the message (take a vacation). If the CTA button was aligned on the right of the page, it’d take our focus off the ocean landscape. This landing page also has social sharing buttons, which is fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>How to improve this page:</strong> Incentives are important ways to convert people on your page. What incentive does the customer get by signing up for this newsletter?</p>
<h3>2. LandApart</h3>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/coming-soon-landing-page-landapart.jpg" alt="coming soon landing page LandApart example" width="662" height="511" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.canva.com/learn/coming-soon-pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>Here’s another striking landing page. Notice how these coming soon landing pages are very visually oriented?</p>
<p>If you’re launching a business or website, you likely don’t have very many images to share. Instead, you can use WordPress templates or plugins to create these very visually-first landing pages where the whole of the landing page is one crisp, clear, thematically relevant image.</p>
<p>One last thing about the image: Look at how the image matches the target audience. This is a site for people who want to camp—and when you get to this landing page, you know you’re in the right spot.</p>
<p>This landing page also touches on something we haven’t talked about yet: exclusivity. This is in a similar vein as setting a countdown. There’s urgency implied with exclusivity. One of the CTA buttons reads “Request invite.”</p>
<p>Now, LandApart may accept everyone who requests an invite, that’s not the issue or the point. The point is it creates urgency for the user, plus it gives more incentive to sign up. People want this, so I’m interested as well.</p>
<p><strong>Notice that this landing page has two CTA buttons</strong>.</p>
<p>You can request an invite (to join), or if you’ve already joined, you can proceed to the beta testing site. Think about, psychologically, the effect of this on the user.There are two doors that lead into a VIP lounge, one door leads to the VIP lounge where you want to be, and the other leads to the offices where you sign up for the VIP lounge.</p>
<p>These are mutually beneficial CTA buttons because the “Go to Beta” button serves as an incentive for the “Request an Invite” button.</p>
<p>There technically isn’t a countdown button on this landing page, but a countdown button isn’t needed. The same with social media sharing buttons. This landing page experience won’t be improved by being able to share it on Twitter or Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>How to improve this page:</strong> This is a highly-effective coming soon landing page. Well, <em>almost</em> nothing. It wouldn’t hurt to do a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/08/19/split-test">split test on the landing page</a> with different colors for the CTA buttons.</p>
<h3>3. LAB Petite</h3>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/coming-soon-landing-page-lab.jpg" alt="coming soon landing page LAB Petite example" width="650" height="474" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.seedprod.com/coming-soon-pages-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>We like LAB Petite’s coming soon page for several reasons.</p>
<p>First, look at the copy. “Are you ready for the best modern handmade goods for your little ones? From clothing to toys, we&#8217;re going to showcase modern makers from around the world who make great things for kids. Sign up below to be informed when LAB Petite launches.”This copy gets the point across, and it also directs the user to act.</p>
<p>Second, LAB petite uses a countdown clock on their page. We really like the countdown page here because who loves to be reminded how long until they can get what they want? Kids. It makes this site launch sort of an event for the family.</p>
<p>Third, this LAB Petite page has a strong CTA that resonates with its copy.</p>
<p><strong>How to improve this page: </strong>We notice LAB Petite is leveraging social media buttons, which is great. But to get a customer to share this on Twitter or Instagram, we think they need to offer an incentive. The incentive could be a coupon or a raffle or a limited offering of a gift with purchases over a certain amount.</p>
<h3>4. App Manager 5.0</h3>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/coming-soon-landing-page-app-manager.jpg" alt="coming soon landing page App Manager 5.0 example" width="650" height="419" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blog.wishpond.com/post/115675436858/coming-soon-page" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>This is a great example of a landing page when you don’t have a stock image that can be used, and you don’t want to just show someone with their phone. App Manager 5.0 created a simple, easy to understand graphic that illustrates the features of their app.</p>
<p>The CTA button is slightly exclusive: “<em>Get on the List!”</em></p>
<p>The copy offers an incentive: if you get early access, you’ll get perks that are only available for their early subscribers.</p>
<p><strong>How to improve this page:</strong> No recommendations here! This page has a great CTA. It has a clear and compelling copy. It offers an incentive and creates urgency with its countdown. A+</p>
<h2>What comes after the coming soon landing page?</h2>
<p>The coming soon page—in case it wasn’t obvious—is the very beginning of the relationship between you and your customer. You don’t just set up a coming soon page and call it a day. The point Is to attract interest, increase brand awareness, get new email subscribers, and more.</p>
<p>So what comes after the coming soon page? Emails.</p>
<h3>Email sequences to follow up on your coming soon landing page</h3>
<p>A coming soon page ought to get you some information from your customer. In this day and age, ideally you’ll get an email address. You want an email list of potential customers: <a href="https://www.salecycle.com/blog/stats/18-essential-email-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">59%</a> of customers said email marketing has motivated them to make a purchase.</p>
<p>Now you can communicate updates to your potential customer—customers who showed an interest. You can create an automated sequence that increases as the date gets closer and closer to the launch date.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/coming-soon-landing-page-email.jpg" alt="coming soon landing page follow-up email example" width="403" height="516" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.appcues.com/blog/product-launch-emails" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>You can share updates on construction (if you’re making a physical product). You can share updates on new features or added accessories.</p>
<p>By leveraging the information you got on the coming soon landing page, you can increase the likelihood of having a successful launch.</p>
<h2>Now, create your own killer coming soon landing page!</h2>
<p>We hope you enjoyed this guide on creating killer coming soon landing pages. To recap, you want to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Be compelling, not overwhelming</strong>. Your coming soon page is a short teaser, not a full commercial. Get to the main benefit quickly, but don’t oversell.</li>
<li><strong>Have only one form to fill out</strong>. Streamline the process and ask only for what’s most important—the customer’s email.</li>
<li><strong>Set a countdown</strong>. If you don’t want a physical countdown timer on your page, that’s fine. Just mention in the copy a general idea of when you’re launching.</li>
<li><strong>Make it shareable</strong>. Make sure your landing page is shareable. But, also give your customer an incentive to share it.</li>
<li><strong>Make it mobile</strong>. Make your CTA button big and appealing on mobile.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The average person will watch <a href="https://www.marketingcharts.com/digital/video-110520" target="_blank" rel="noopener">84</a> minutes of online video every day this year<em>. Every day. </em>With users consuming that much video, your marketing needs to stand out. That’s why personalized video marketing is key.</p>

<p>After all, <a href="https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-77/Accenture-Pulse-Survey.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">91%</a> of consumers are more likely to shop with brands that recognize them as individuals and provide relevant offers and recommendations. So whether you’re running a large B2B-SaaS company that helps with business intelligence and data analysis or managing an ecommerce store that sells comfy furniture at a fair price, you’re going to want to leverage personalized video marketing to complete your digital marketing strategies.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’re going to share six ways to leverage personalized video marketing to help you accomplish your overall goals while providing tips on how to scale personalization and how to do personalized video marketing on a budget.</p>
<h2>What is personalized video marketing?</h2>
<p>Personalized video marketing is when companies use data (whether from their analytics accounts, CRM accounts, or even more in-house data-sourcing strategies, such as customer satisfaction surveys) <strong>to market a video towards a specific customer or group of customers</strong>.</p>
<p>There are levels of personalization. Sometimes a video will feature photos, names, and locations of specific people.</p>
<p>Perhaps the clearest example of personalized video marketing is the Cadbury Glow campaign. Cadbury customers were able to create a personalized video “gift” that took their personal photos from their Facebook profile:</p>

<p>But personalized videos don’t need to be this complicated. They can be as simple as listing, at the very beginning of the video, “This video was made specifically for [Customer Name], who wants to [complete a buying action].”</p>
<p>By including this personalized intro, now the rest of the video feels personal, too.</p>
<h3>Benefits of personalized videos in your marketing strategy</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wyzowl.com/video-marketing-statistics-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">87%</a> of businesses use video as a marketing tool, so it makes sense that 90% of video marketers feel “the level of competition and noise has increased.”</p>
<p>But what are the benefits of personalized marketing?</p>

<p>Personalized video marketing is a fantastic tool because it marries two popular strategies: <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing"><strong>personalized marketing</strong></a><strong> and your overall </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/11/21/video-marketing-strategy"><strong>video marketing strategy</strong></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vedia.ai/blog/personalized-video-marketing-statistics-2020/#:~:text=More%20People%20Viewing%20Videos%20Than%20Ever&amp;text=At%20the%20moment%2C%2085%25%20of,personalized%20content%20on%20your%20screen." target="_blank" rel="noopener">85%</a> of the US internet audience watches videos online, yet 93% of internet users said they weren’t getting any relevant marketing communications.</p>
<p><strong>Personalized marketing uses the most popular medium (video), and leverages personalization to increase engagement, conversions, click-through rates, and more.</strong></p>
<h2>Personalized video marketing ideas for your business</h2>
<p>This is a great marketing tactic for all businesses, but it doesn’t work exactly that same way. B2B is a whole different world than traditional B2C marketing.</p>
<p>It’s because your target audience consists of professionals in their field. Plus, these professionals are likely getting cold pitched on a daily basis, whether through phone calls, email blasts, or just a steady stream of re-targeted ads.</p>
<p>Setting your service apart is essential. That’s why personalized video marketing in B2B isn’t just recommended, it’s essential: <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/au/blog/2018/06/new-report--5-ways-businesses-can-meet-expectations-of-the-conne.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>72%</strong></a><strong> of B2B buyers expect customization in the marketing they receive</strong>.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://www.vidyard.com/blog/video-email-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>Here are just some of the ways you can use personalized video marketing strategies for your business, and we’ve identified the strategies that might work better for B2B or B2C.</p>
<h3>1. Event invites</h3>
<p>When you’re planning your next event—whether it’s an online tutorial, webinar, or product launch—we recommend that you lean heavily on video personalization.</p>
<p>Here’s why: Personalized event invite emails have led to an <a href="https://marketingland.com/5-ways-use-personalized-video-next-marketing-campaign-193064" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8x</a> improvement on click-through rates<strong>. </strong>When Marketo used personalized video marketing to invite attendees to an event, they saw a <a href="https://www.vidyard.com/customers/marketo-video-enabled-business-case-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">36%</a> increase in open rates.</p>
<h3>2. Explainer videos</h3>
<p>This could work for both B2B and B2C companies, but it’s a particularly great strategy for B2Bs. An explainer video is a great way for a B2B company to talk directly to a prospect and explain or distill what makes the B2B’s service stand out. More than that, an explainer video is a tool a B2B business can use to show a prospect how their service can help.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/video-marketing-statistics-for-2020-infographic/566099/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">72%</a> of customers prefer to learn about a product through video. That’s a great reason to start explaining in personalized videos.</p>
<h3>3. Case study videos</h3>
<p>A case study is a way to boost your credibility. It’s a blueprint of how you achieved success for a previous client. Yet, the beauty of a case study is that no one reads them and thinks, “let’s just steal this idea,” because the execution is as important as the strategy.</p>
<p>What a good case study does is highlight your company’s strategic mindset, and show that you know how to measure value.</p>
<p>Case studies can also be long and boring. But converting your tired case study into video is a major win for your customer.</p>

<h3>4. “Thank you” videos</h3>
<p>Supporting customers after the purchase is key for B2B and B2C businesses. Retention makes sure your customer doesn’t jump ship and sign with one of your competitors, and satisfied, repeat customers go on to recommend your brand for some high-quality, word-of-mouth marketing.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://moosend.com/blog/automated-thank-you-emails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>Let’s face it: Your competitors are likely doing what you’re doing—cold pitching, offering promotions for new customers, and other aggressive marketing tactics.</p>
<p>The best defense is a good offense.</p>
<p>In our experience, touching base with a new customer just once isn’t enough but we recommend you start with two different videos.</p>
<p><em>The first video will be a simple thank you video. </em>This is where you can take your new customer’s information (their name, their business, what their business does, how they’ll use your service), and automatically upload it into a video template and send it.</p>
<p>This lets your company show appreciation while treating your new customer as an individual.</p>
<p><em>The second video can now be more instructional. </em>Depending on what you’re selling, there could be multiple levels or tiers of services, or multiple uses for a single product. There can also be some confusion on your customer’s end on how to best use your product.</p>
<p>Have a series of videos that walk your new customer through how your service can benefit their business.</p>
<h3>5. Facebook ads</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/10/social-media-video-marketing">Video is becoming more popular across all social media platforms</a>, but we’re going to focus on Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/01/30/facebook-advertising-tips">Facebook ads</a> are some company’s bread and butter. It’s easy to see why. Facebook collects a lot of data. That data is a great way to know about your existing (or potential) customers.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://buffer.com/state-of-social-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>Facebook itself has experimented with personalized video—end of the year montages and suggestions on memories. But we’re going to focus on video marketing that helps you convert.</p>
<p><strong>How to use personalized video marketing on Facebook</strong></p>
<p>When you want to focus on personalization with Facebook, simply focus on the data available to you through Facebook.</p>
<p>For example, you can use interests and demographics to cater your video to specific audiences. You can also use who has interacted with your page. You can target customers who have liked an ad by creating a personalized video that starts with, “We know you liked our last ad, and we’re excited to show you something new.”</p>
<p><strong>General tips on using personalized <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/28/facebook-video-marketing">video marketing on Facebook</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use strong visuals</strong>. <a href="https://www.renderforest.com/blog/video-marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">85%</a> of videos on Facebook are watched without sound. Storyboard your idea to make sure that your point can be understood (to a degree) without the sound on.</li>
<li><strong>Be aware of the running time</strong>. The rule of thumb is clear, the longer the video, the more likely the engagement will fall off before finishing it. This doesn’t necessarily mean you<em> must </em>create short videos, but it means it’d be strategic to put whatever is most valuable to your audience in the first quarter of the video, not the last quarter.</li>
<li><strong>Include a call to action</strong>. Every piece of advertising needs a call to action (CTA). Inviting your customer to take action is a critical part of guiding them down the sales funnel</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Email marketing campaigns</h3>
<p>Adding videos to your email content can boost click rates by up to <a href="https://www.martechadvisor.com/articles/marketing-automation-2/personalization-and-optimization-will-be-the-focus-for-email-marketers-in-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">300%</a>.</p>
<p>You can capitalize off that awesome click rates by adding personalized video in the body of the email.</p>
<p>This can also work perfectly with upselling and cross-selling. Whether you’re selling a product or a service, you can send personalized videos as part of your post-purchase email marketing campaign.</p>
<p>In these emails, your personalized videos (which are automated to reference the customer’s name and the products they purchased) can serve as demo videos or tutorials on other products in your catalog.</p>
<p>The benefits are twofold. By adding video to your email you’ll see more click through rates and by adding personalization to the videos you’ll see increased engagement.</p>
<h2>How to scale your personalized video marketing strategy</h2>
<p>As you grow, you might think personalization becomes more difficult. But with some built-in processes and automation, personalized marketing can actually be relatively easy (and cost-effective).</p>
<p>Both Amazon and Netflix are simple examples about personalization done on a large scale. Both platforms are huge, but when you log in to your account, they feel small. You see what Amazon and Netflix, from analyzing your data, thinks you want to see.</p>
<p><strong>The main requirement is data. </strong>Leveraging the data you have can help create marketing automation processes where your videos are personalized.</p>
<p>If you think you don’t have enough data you’re overlooking some easy wins.</p>
<p>Even if all you have is what your customer purchased, that’s still enough data to personalize your video marketing efforts. Now you can send videos or post videos catered to customers who already have your product.</p>
<p>Your video won’t start now with a generic intro, it’ll start by affirming that this video is for current owners of your product. That’s personalization.</p>
<p>When you scale your video marketing efforts, you’ll have more data to use but the process is the same.</p>
<h2>How about personalized video marketing on a budget?</h2>
<p>First, yes, let’s address the elephant in the room: <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/08/video-marketing-statistics">Video marketing</a> can be expensive. It can be very, very expensive. If you’re talking about hiring a film crew, doing takes, getting edits done. You’re talking a minimal investment of $10,000.</p>
<p>For small businesses who are used to running on a tight ad budget, that may seem like a deal-breaker.</p>
<p>But it’s actually easier to do personalized video marketing on a small budget than the broader video marketing because you’re leveraging the information you have to create a personalized video.</p>
<p>Plus, it’s important to remember <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/video-marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">66%</a> of video marketers report getting <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/08/lead-quality">more qualified leads</a> thanks to video, while 88% of video marketers are happy with the ROI from using video in their social media marketing.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/video-marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>By creating a personalized video, you connect to your target audience quicker and cheaper.</p>
<p>Here are two big tips to help.</p>
<p><strong>Storyboard your idea before you film anything</strong>.</p>
<p>No matter if you’re filming the video yourself on your iPhone (and yes, that’s a legitimate possibility thanks to ever-advancing smartphone technology) or hiring a crew to film it for you. You want to play your video down to the smallest detail before anyone hits record.</p>
<p><strong>Consider avoiding live-action</strong>.</p>
<p>Live-action is a little more difficult to accomplish on a budget because live-action doesn’t do well with templates or ready-made graphics. It’s easier to make video on a budget if you’re doing a screencast video or a text video over images. Live-action videos, on the other hand, require more edits (more time), better audio, and can look very amateurish if not done well.</p>
<h2>Boost engagement with personalized video marketing</h2>
<p>We hope this guide on using personalized video marketing in your digital marketing strategies was helpful. Personalized video marketing isn’t reinventing the wheel—it’s simply making it more effective. As we’ve seen in this post, more people are consuming content via video. This can be from Instagram Live stories or Facebook Ads or product demos. Both traditional consumers and B2B customers are starting to prefer video content to text or basic image content.</p>
<p>So there really isn’t (so far, at least) an argument against having a strong video marketing strategy. Personalized video marketing can be laid upon your digital marketing strategies to help increase engagement.</p>

</div>
<p>97.37% of your site&#8217;s visitors are just shopping around. And, given the cost of acquiring traffic these days, that is one ugly average.</p>
<p>But you don’t have to settle for average.</p>
<p>Understanding the <a href="/blog/ws/2021/04/22/how-to-personalize-ecommerce-customer-journey">customer’s journey</a> can help you optimize your digital marketing strategies and increase that conversion rate. In our experience, clients struggle to conceptualize the ecommerce <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/marketing-funnel">sales funnel</a> in a way that benefits the customer and their business. They see it as a streamlined process—an A to B—but picking it apart stage by stage is a much better method. In this post, we’re going to show you how understanding the typical customer journey will help you increase your ecommerce sales funnel&#8217;s conversion rates <em>and</em> customer retention rates.</p>
<p>We have a lot to cover, so let&#8217;s get started.</p>
<h2>What is an ecommerce sales funnel?</h2>
<p>An ecommerce sales funnel illustrates the process a person undertakes to go from a potential customer to an existing customer and beyond to retention.</p>
<p>A customer can go through the funnel in a blink of an eye (they see something, they want it, they buy it), or it can take months or even years for them to finally decide to complete the purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a simple example of an ecommerce sales funnel.</strong></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="cf2edba6-e3eb-409e-8079-d0d7b0114ec1" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://virtualvisibilitymedia.com/content-marketing-funnel-influence-buyers-journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image Source</em></a></p>
<p>There is quite a bit of variation in funnel design amongst marketers and industries. You may have heard of a conversion funnel or a marketing funnel or a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/10/22/demand-generation">demand-generation</a> funnel.</p>
<p>But while they take slightly different approaches, the concept is always the same: <strong>mapping the customer’s journey towards making the desired action</strong>.</p>
<h2>The 5 stages of an ecommerce sales funnel</h2>
<p>Another way to understand a funnel is to break it down into stages. Some companies do three or four stages; some do six. We like the five-stage ecommerce funnel, starting with brand awareness and ending with customer retention.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The awareness stage:</strong> In the awareness stage, customers in this stage are just learning of your brand. They’re learning about you through organic search, paid traffic, referrals, and other top-of-the-funnel marketing tactics.</li>
<li><strong>The consideration stage:</strong> Mid-funnel customers have shown interest in what you’re selling. But what worked on top-of-funnel customers won’t work on these customers. You got their attention; now, you have to keep it through customer testimonials, product descriptions, and more.</li>
<li><strong>The decision stage: </strong>Customers in this stage are evaluating their final choices. This is a great stage for showing off your customer service skills and using limited time only discounts to nudge the customer towards choosing your brand.</li>
<li><strong>The purchase stage: </strong>In this stage, you’ll find <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/01/bottom-funnel-conversions">bottom-of-the-funnel customers</a> who have decided to buy (in which case you focus on a frictionless checkout experience and account sign up) or have decided to not to buy (in which case you can focus on retargeting ads to the customer back into your sales funnel).</li>
<li><strong>The retention stage</strong><strong>:</strong> These are beyond-the-funnel customers. You’ll use email sequences, customer accounts, and loyalty programs to keep these customers back for add-ons, upsells, and cross-sells. The goal of stages one through four is to keep the customer moving deeper down the funnel toward becoming a customer. The goal of stage five is to keep the customer coming back.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we’ve outlined what an ecommerce sales funnel is and what the five stages of the funnel are, let’s start talking about how to improve each stage.</p>
<h2>How to improve the awareness stage of your ecommerce sales funnel</h2>
<p>Building out the strategy for the top of your ecommerce sales funnel can get overlooked (after all, the direct relationship between ad spend and revenue is hard to see this high up in the funnel), but the strategies you develop for top-of-funnel customers are critical for cultivating your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/15/audience-targeting">target audience</a>.</p>
<p>The goal during the awareness stage is to draw in as big of an audience as possible <strong>without losing sight of your ideal customer</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are three ways to do that.</p>
<h3>1. Use existing customer data to create lookalike audiences for Facebook ad campaigns</h3>
<p>Facebook lookalike audiences help you find potential customers that are almost identical to your existing audience. Imagine taking your existing client-base and hitting copy-and-paste. Okay, it isn’t that exact, but it’s close.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-lookalike-audiences">lookalike audience strategy</a> helps you increase your reach without losing your focus.</p>
<p>To build a lookalike audience, you can use:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Customer email lists. </strong>Take customers who have subscribed or entered your giveaways and use their emails to create a custom audience.</li>
<li><strong>Recently converted customers</strong>. Using data from your recently converted customers is a no-brainer. This way, you can take the attributes of those who have purchased and create a lookalike audience.</li>
<li><strong>Users who have engaged with your content</strong>. These could be potential customers who have liked your pages or viewed your videos. These people have shown an interest in your brand.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are three great ways to set up your lookalike audience for success, but there are also some more (see below).</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0aebb37f-75be-44ee-a2b3-26d45da91138" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Using custom lookalike audiences is like jump-starting the process to make sure the top-of-the-funnel customers you’re curating are more likely to move to stage two.</p>
<h3>2. Optimize your Google Shopping Feed with product groups and negative keywords</h3>
<p>Matching your products to customer queries is the goal behind optimizing your Google Shopping Feed.</p>
<p>That’s how you get results like this when you Google “travel backpack”:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="6678f1a4-5836-4d58-8be8-3f4e56d8ec1a" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ecommerce-sales-funnel-google-shopping-backpack-example.jpg" alt="Google Shopping results for backpack search" width="741" height="454" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Shopping campaigns aren’t led by keywords. Instead, <strong>the success of your Shopping campaign lives and dies by the product groups you&#8217;ve created</strong> <strong>in your product data feed</strong>.</p>
<p>When you start a Google Shopping campaign, all of the products in your product data feed are grouped together. If you leave it like that, you’re not going to see a significant <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/16/return-on-ad-spend-roas">return on ad spend, or (ROAS)</a>, because you’re giving all of your products the same bid.</p>
<p>But not all of your products are created equal. Some have a higher profit margin or come with a better conversion rate.</p>
<p>We recommend you narrow your products into specific groups based on these three metrics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Price</li>
<li>Profit margin</li>
<li>Conversion rate</li>
</ol>
<p>Try to put like with like. The closer you can get all of your products in one group to be equal across those three metrics, the better.</p>
<p><strong>Using negative keywords in Google Shopping campaigns should be the status quo in your digital marketing strategy.</strong></p>
<p>Product groups and product attributes are a great start to optimizing your Google Shopping campaigns, but<strong> you can’t overlook negative keywords</strong>.</p>
<p>Negative keywords tell Google what keywords you <strong><em>don’t</em></strong> want your product to be triggered for.</p>
<p>If you think about what Google Shopping Feed is doing, it’s trying to play matchmaker between your back-end product catalog and what the customer is searching for. You can use negative keywords to help make this process more accurate, so someone doesn’t get your product by mistake.</p>
<p>To help you get started on your list, we’ve actually put together a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/negative-keywords">negative keyword tool</a>.</p>
<h3>3. Create a referral program that matches your brand</h3>
<p>The theme between these tips so far is two-fold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increase your brand’s awareness</li>
<li>Focus on the right audience</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s what makes <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/06/referral-marketing"><strong>referral programs</strong></a><strong> a great tool to optimize the first stage of your ecommerce sales funnel</strong>. People don’t refer their friends to products that don’t make sense. You refer your friend to a product because you think they’ll like it.</p>
<p>In one of the more popular case studies, Dropbox incentivized their existing customers to refer a friend (incentivizing their current customers with extra storage) and saw a <a href="https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/dropbox-referral-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60%</a> increase in signups within 15 months.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/dropbox-referral-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image Source</em></a></p>
<p>This worked so well because it was a simple referral process that kept the focus on the brand. Dropbox offered increased storage, which means they were showing value while incentivizing referrals.</p>
<p>We’d make the argument that if Dropbox tried this same program but was offering Amazon gift cards as an incentive vs. more storage, it wouldn’t have been nearly as successful. But they tapped into what their existing customers wanted and showed them a clear way to get it.</p>

<h2>How to improve the consideration stage of your ecommerce sales funnel</h2>
<p>In this stage, the customer is evaluating what you’re offering.</p>
<p>Two areas we recommend you focus on are cultivating user-generated reviews or content and writing benefit-driven product descriptions.</p>
<h3>1. Encourage user-generated content</h3>
<p>We love to see user-generated content for three reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It allows your existing customers to speak directly to your potential customers</strong>. And while your company’s marketing team knows the product inside and out, your existing customer base can relate much more naturally to your potential customer base.</li>
<li><strong>UGC shows your product off in the real world</strong>. Whether you’re selling clothing or a camera or a service, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/13/ugc-instagram">UGC</a> helps potential customers see your product in action.</li>
<li><strong>It gives you valuable content that you can use throughout your marketing strategies</strong>. Whether you’re a small business or a large enterprise, content production isn’t cheap or easy. Even if you can afford a content marketing agency, it’s difficult to find writers who know your product inside and out. UGC can help fill that gap.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Here’s an example of a site soliciting UGC to help with content production:</strong></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="068ca10d-55ad-4876-bb93-5e030f1f7f45" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ecommerce-sales-funnel-user-generated-content.jpg" alt="user-generated content example" width="498" height="181" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://searchengineland.com/case-study-how-ugc-increased-organic-blog-traffic-228-330351" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image Source</em></a></p>
<p>CaringBridge, a non-profit with a limited marketing budget, capitalized on their emotional and unique user generated stories to help them create content that only they could create.</p>
<p>We like this example because it shows a brand taking a very active role in getting user-generated content, instead of just focusing on increasing online reviews and testimonials. This brand went after stories and turned those stories into relevant and value-driven content.</p>
<h3>2. Write benefit-driven product descriptions</h3>
<p><a href="https://amazonseoconsultant.com/ecommerce-product-descriptions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">86%</a> of consumers consider product content critical when making a buying decision. Yet, in our experience, some brands (both new and established) are so focused on branding themselves that they get a little carried away and brand in the wrong places.</p>
<p>Don’t get us wrong. Branding is important. But there’s a time and a place. And product descriptions are often not the place.<strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/06/26/product-descriptions">Product descriptions</a> should be written to help the customer understand the value of your product. </strong>You don’t do that by focusing on features because customers don’t immediately connect with features. Instead, focus on the benefits.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A feature is AI-powered machine learning layered onto Quickbooks. A benefit is being able to access all of your finances in one dashboard.</li>
<li>A feature is SuperCool<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Memory Foam. A benefit is a great night&#8217;s sleep.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to improve the decision stage of your ecommerce sales funnel</h2>
<p>We like to think of this stage as an informed customer weighing their two or three final choices. They know the brands that can help and are listing pros and cons of each.</p>
<p>And, remember, not buying is always an option.</p>
<p>When it comes to tipping the odds in your favor, we recommend offering excellent customer service and exit-intent pop-ups.</p>
<h3>1. Focus on customer service</h3>
<p>Your customer knows your brand, has read your benefit-focused copy, has seen your ads. They know a good chunk about what you’re offering. They might just need to hear it one more time, or they might have a question that isn’t on any available pages.</p>
<p>That’s where customer service comes in.</p>
<p><strong>Is your brand reachable? </strong>Brands can show their dedication to customer service by having these tools available:</p>
<ol>
<li>Live chat</li>
<li>Emails</li>
<li>FAQ and help desk pages</li>
</ol>
<p>These tools help bridge the gap between what the customer currently knows and what they need to know to make a purchase. If a customer is on your site but has a specific question about lead times, a quick live chat session can answer it for them, and move the customer further down to make a purchase.</p>
<p>No matter your industry, we want to see a clear way for a potential customer to contact your company and get a quick, value-driven response.</p>
<h3>2. Implement an exit-intent strategy</h3>
<p>At the beginning of this article, we told you more than 97% of your customers will leave your site without making a purchase.</p>
<p>Having an exit-intent strategy in place works off of those numbers. The fact is people are going to bounce off your page. We recommend using marketing to try and get something out of them before they go.</p>
<p>You do this by having an exit popup appear when a customer abandons your page. Here&#8217;s an example from headphone ecommerce company Skullcandy:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="d85ee236-47b7-4a9a-bbba-c92bcb64d4c2" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ecommerce-sales-funnel-exit-intent-pop-up.jpg" alt="exit intent pop-up example" width="800" height="576" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://blog.wishpond.com/post/115675437167/exit-intent-popups" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image Source</em></a></p>
<p>The whole strategy is to get the user to stick around or come back for more.</p>
<p>The average conversion rate of an exit pop up is <a href="https://wisepops.com/popup-stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3.93%</a>. That’s getting almost 4% of the 97% of customers who are otherwise abandoning your brand.</p>

<p><strong>Some marketers actually stop their funnel here</strong>. They think that once a customer has made a decision to buy (or not buy) that that’s the end of the sales funnel.</p>
<p>We don’t think that’s reflective of the customer experience—especially in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/18/ecommerce-marketing-strategies">ecommerce</a>. After a customer has decided to buy, they still need to checkout, which takes us to stage four: making a purchase.</p>
<h2>How to improve the purchase stage of your ecommerce sales funnel</h2>
<p>In traditional brick-and-mortar selling, once a customer has decided to buy, the ol’ wisdom was to shut up and take their money. Amateur salespeople could talk themselves out of a sale by offering the prospect unasked for information.</p>
<p>While the dynamic is different with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/31/2020-ecommerce-marketing-trends">ecommerce marketing</a>, there&#8217;s still some truth to getting out of the customer’s way once they have decided to buy. To do that, we recommend you <strong>create a friction-free checkout experience</strong>.</p>
<h3>1. Create a friction-free checkout experience</h3>
<p>Friction occurs at the checkout for various reasons.</p>
<p><a href="https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50%</a> of customers abandon their cart because of hidden prices (unplanned for shipping fees), but 21% leave because the checkout process was too long and complicated.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="51a2ad5d-81bb-4a8b-9247-52aac27aaa3c" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ecommerce-sales-funnel-check-out.jpg" alt="ecommerce sales funnel abandoned carts graph" width="720" height="516" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image Source</em></a></p>
<p>Plus, nearly one-quarter of people who leave your site are doing so because the checkout process is sloppy. That’s like losing a touchdown on a technicality.</p>
<p>It can take some work to figure out the best way for your company to create a truly friction-checkout process, but here are some general pointers.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reduce the number of form fields</strong>. Only ask for the information relevant to this purchase. If you ask for more information than you need, a customer can easily get frustrated or even just run out of time as they were trying to complete a purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t have any surprises after the customer starts the checkout process</strong>. Any extra shipping costs or fees should be or even lead times should be communicated to the customer before they start filling out your form fields.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to improve the retention stage of your ecommerce sales funnel</h2>
<p>In our experience, a rookie mistake is undervaluing existing customers. Maybe it&#8217;s because so much of marketing is about increasing brand awareness. Maybe even marketers are saturated with social media ads promoting new bands. Maybe we just like thinking in terms of “new” instead of “established.”</p>
<p>But as your business grows, you’ll see a larger piece of your daily sales being made by established or return customers.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="77897bac-c8c7-4162-aa62-3616d865e306" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://www.shopify.ca/blog/customer-retention-strategies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image Source</em></a></p>
<p>To increase customer retention, we recommend you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prompt customers to create accounts.</li>
<li>Use email sequences to boost upsells, cross-sells, and add-ons.</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Prompt your customers to create accounts</h3>
<p>While you want to be mindful of not slowing down the checkout process to the point where you see an increase in cart abandonment, you still want to encourage your customers to create accounts on your site.</p>
<p>Shopify recommends you get around this paradox by offering to let your customer create an account <em>after</em> they placed their order.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="cd8e651b-611e-4b75-a7e7-a14e829033cf" data-langcode="en">

</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/customer-retention-strategies#account" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image Source</em></a></p>
<h3>2. Implement upsells, cross-sells, and add ons</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/12/is-email-marketing-effective">Effective email marketing</a> is about continuing the conversation between your company and your customer. It’s a highly viable digital marketing strategy. In fact, nearly <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60%</a> of marketers say email marketing is their biggest source of ROI.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="1684fb0d-8634-4b62-8a87-e3b0274994a6" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ecommerce-sales-funnel-upsell-crossell-image.jpg" alt="upselll vs cross sell graphic" width="700" height="353" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>We like to use email marketing to offer upsells, cross-sells, and add ons.</p>
<p>What you’re effectively doing is reaching out to customers who you know have an interest in your company and are making targeted and specific recommendations based on their previous transaction history.</p>
<p>You can send your customer an email for any reason, but we like it’s relevant to the customer’s personal journey with your product. For example, sending a customer a post-purchase email to offer add-ons to the core product they purchased is a great way to increase the average ticket order.</p>
<p><strong>But emails don’t need to be sent immediately after an order is placed to have value</strong>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a great example from Asana:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e3992009-fcab-4991-ab29-035d0ae87baa" data-langcode="en">

<h2>Optimize your entire ecommerce sales funnel</h2>
<p>Mapping your customer’s journey to the ecommerce funnel is a great way to recalibrate your digital marketing strategies.</p>
<p>Too often we see jarring changes between building awareness and increasing consideration. This disunity in an ecommerce strategy can hurt your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/19/conversion-rate-benchmarks">conversion rates</a>, but by creating marketing strategies with your sales funnel in mind, you can create a seamless journey that works to propel your potential customer into not only an existing customer but a returning customer.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even before COVID-19 drastically changed how we connected, virtual events were on the rise. Companies and brands may have different reasons to host a virtual event, but there are two overarching benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>Virtual events take less of a budget to host.</li>
<li>Virtual events are more accessible.</li>
</ol>
<p>Involving more people and spending less money sounds great, right? But it doesn&#8217;t make hosting engaging virtual events easier than hosting live events. Just like hosting an in-person event, you need to consider how the right platform and message work together. Plus, you need to strategically plan ways to increase engagement and accomplish the event’s primary and secondary goals.</p>

<p>In this post, we’re going to cover six tips on hosting engaging virtual events:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understand the goal of your virtual events</li>
<li>Promote your virtual events</li>
<li>Incentivize event attendance</li>
<li>Be prepared for tech issues</li>
<li>Promote the event <em>during</em> the event</li>
<li>Get feedback from attendees</li>
</ol>
<p>But first, let’s make sure we’re on the same page.</p>
<h2>What counts as a virtual event?</h2>
<p>A virtual event is an online event that uses a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/18/best-webinar-platforms">platform</a> where participants (or hosts) can interact with attendees or an audience.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="7167c3d5-87a2-42af-86bd-88bc62438fb9" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/virtual-events-definition.jpg" alt="virtual events graphic" width="747" height="260" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://navidmoazzez.com/virtual-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image Source</em></a></p>
<p>That means a virtual event can be a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/05/webinar-marketing">webinar</a>, a behind-the-scenes tour of your brand, a conference, or anything else that connects participants over a virtual medium. It can be as simple as live-tweeting a product reveal, or as complex as hosting a multi-person webinar panel with a Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>When it comes to hosting virtual events, some events work better than others.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conferences. </strong>A virtual conference is an interactive virtual event that should usually have unique, downloadable content for its attendees. These are generally paid events, and virtual conferences are becoming more and more popular due to the size and the cost of traveling.</li>
<li><strong>Training, workshops, and courses. </strong>These are virtual “hands-on” events. You may be making downloadable content, like a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/growth-academy">marketing course for your business or agency</a>. So it may be live or recorded and re-sold. Either way, it’s generally a paid event, and it’s expected that the attendee will be doing work in tandem with the course.</li>
<li><strong>Webinars</strong>. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/26/how-to-do-a-webinar">Webinars</a> are generally more intimate than conferences, where it’s expected that a virtual attendee can interact with the speakers or presenters.</li>
<li><strong>Tours. </strong>Tours can be either informal or formal virtual events where you’re giving your audience a view behind-the-scenes of production. Ahrefs did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m1rZ2KTLIQ&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virtual tour</a> of their Singapore office and posted it on YouTube. These are generally free events.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual meetups. </strong>The most informal virtual event on our list, these are great for remote businesses (or businesses working from home) who want to engage and interact with their team. These are free, laid back events.</li>
<li><strong>Fireside chats.</strong> Popular within the startup community, a fireside chat, as the name implies, is a more relaxed virtual event between a few peers. These are generally free events.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are more types of virtual events than this, but these are the more common types of virtual events that we see people holding.</p>
<h2>6 tips for hosting engaging virtual events</h2>
<p>Like I said earlier, hosting a virtual event may cost less and be open to more people, but it still takes planning in order to be effective, just like a live event. Here are six tips to make sure your next virtual event is your best yet.</p>
<h3>1. Understand the goal of your virtual events</h3>
<p>When planning your virtual event, you want to <strong>match the medium to your goal</strong>. Don’t just pick a free virtual event platform because it saves you money or is popular.</p>
<p>For example, if your goal is to get your remote team to have some face-to-face time, you’re looking at a virtual meetup, which can happen over a common tool like Zoom. Or maybe your goal is to demo your new product or service to your ideal customer base. That goal involves more steps to pull off correctly, including having an event page, targeted PPC campaigns, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/12/07/amplify-email-marketing-with-ppc">email marketing efforts</a>.</p>
<p><strong>To understand the goal of your event, brainstorm your ideal virtual audience: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Are you looking for an audience of your peers?</li>
<li>Are you looking for an audience of your existing customers or new customers?</li>
<li>Are you looking for an audience of people who want to participate in the event, or simply observe?</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’re able to define the goal, you’re ready for step two, which handles the promotion of your virtual event.</p>
<h3>2. Promote your virtual events</h3>
<p>Using your existing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/25/networking-strategies">marketing network</a> is going to help you increase the number of virtual attendees who show up and participate in your event.</p>
<p>A virtual event is like any other product or service your business has offered in the past—it needs to be marketed towards your target audience.</p>
<h4>Step #1: Look within your existing network</h4>
<p>Share the event with employees, partners, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/03/21/social-media-influencers">social media influencers</a> who can help you co-run or promote the event.</p>

<h4>Step #2: Use content marketing to increase virtual event sign-ups</h4>
<p>If your blog has subscribers, then publishing a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post">blog post</a> about the event is a great way to increase attendance. Plus, if you’re able to play your event in advance, you can adjust your content schedule to post articles that are about topics that will be relevant during the actual event.</p>
<h4>Step #3: Talk about the event on your podcast</h4>
<p>Podcasts are a great way to reach your audience without competing for attention. With email blasts and PPC ads, you’re always one of many. But with a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/06/10/best-marketing-podcasts">podcast</a> mention, you have your customer’s attention.</p>
<h4><strong>Step #4: Run ads</strong></h4>
<p>Using demographic targeting in Google Ads and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/01/facebook-audiences">lookalike audiences in Facebook ads</a> make it easy for your business to run targeted ads towards bottom-of-the-funnel prospects. But remember, you need to try this ad like any other ad. It needs compelling copy, excellent visuals, and a clear CTA (such as register for this virtual event!).</p>
<h4>Step #5: Create a virtual event landing page</h4>
<p>Your podcast, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/06/04/5-content-marketing-statistics">content marketing</a>, and PPC strategies are all about getting your customer to your virtual event landing page. This is where they can make the decision to register for your event.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>You want to promote any event to get attendees, but the more informal the event, the less work you need to do to promote it.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re only running an Instagram story, you don’t need a virtual <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/08/event-landing-pages">event landing page</a> or (most likely) a PPC strategy. Instead, you’ll leverage your Instagram network to attract attendees. Below is an example of an organic social media post that promotes an upcoming event.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e34f62e0-73cc-4279-89e0-afdf092ec971" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p><strong>What makes this post great:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It gives us a hashtag</strong>. Hashtags let your attendees post about the event and connect with other attendees. And <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">Instagram hashtags</a> also help create a virtual event within a virtual event. People who were interested in your event but couldn’t make it can now learn about the event by reading what attendees have posted.</li>
<li><strong>There’s a link to the event landing page.</strong> We give this link a B+. We would have preferred if it were positioned as a more clear CTA, with copy directing the user to take action.</li>
<li><strong>Video marketing</strong>. Video ads are a great way to slow down fast-scrollers who are steamrolling through their feed. Plus, if you have <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/03/video-marketing-ideas">video marketing</a> that shows users footage from your last event, that makes great material for a virtual event ad.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3. Incentivize event attendance</h3>
<p>Ask yourself why someone should attend your event, and don’t let the answer be “because we&#8217;re awesome.”</p>
<p>There are several ways to incentivize event attendance, from offering free swag (see below) to teasing the kind of value-driven information that the event will cover.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="7aec29c3-bebe-4993-9393-a2272000de99" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/virtual-events-swag.jpg" alt="virtual event swag" width="768" height="303" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://www.benlcollins.com/spreadsheets/sheetscon-2020-online-conference-lessons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image Source</em></a></p>
<p>How much you need to incentivize will depend on whether your event is free or if there’s an admission fee.</p>
<p><strong>If it’s a free event, leverage the event itself as the incentive.</strong></p>
<p>For example, if you&#8217;re hosting a workshop for small businesses on how to set up their Google Analytics account, then the incentive is the information you’re going to cover within the event.</p>
<p>The ad copy or blog copy for that event would be something like this: &#8220;<em>Calling all small business owners. Join us this Friday on </em><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/30/instagram-live"><em>Instagram Live</em></a><em>, where we show you how to set up a Google Analytics and Google Search Console account for your ecommerce site.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>If attendance costs anything, we recommend you create some materials that are unique to the event</strong><em>. </em></p>
<p>This could be as simple as a PDF guide or ebook that the attendees download after registering. If you’re using the event to sell a product or service, you can also offer a coupon code or extended free trial for all virtual event attendees.</p>
<h3>4. Be prepared for tech issues</h3>
<p>One of the more popular virtual event fails was the <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/boxing/news/ufc-neulion-sued-over-failed-live-stream-outage-mcgregor-mayweather/fop7nddug5j91gmtehudfqg9i" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mayweather and McGregor Live Stream fail</a>. The boxing event was billed as one of the major sporting events of the decade, but the event didn’t go as planned. Attendees had registered for the event, paid for the event, prepared for the event, but when the night of the event came, the live stream failed due to tech issues.</p>
<p>When you’re planning your event, have some contingency plans in place.</p>
<p><strong>What will you do if &#8230;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your live stream fails? </strong>Depending on the severity of the issue, you can have backup dates to reschedule or a backup platform ready-to-go.</li>
<li><strong>Your guest speaker doesn’t show? </strong>Whether this is a big issue or a minor one, depends on the type of event. If it&#8217;s a fireside chat and one of the chatters doesn’t show up, that’s a problem. If your guest speaker wasn’t the main attraction, it’s possible to recoup by having the event host cover the material the guest speaker was going to cover.</li>
<li><strong>You get more (or less) participants than expected? </strong>With adequate preparation, this issue can quickly become a non-issue. We recommend having multiple plans for the event. If more participants than expected arrive, just adjust your plans to be less detailed, so as to allow for more of a Q/A. If fewer participants than expected show up, re-adjust your strategy to create a more intimate virtual event.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Promote the event <em>during</em> the event</h3>
<p>Social media is your friend before the event, as well as during the event.</p>
<p>You can use hashtags on Twitter to encourage your attendees to live-tweet the event. Live-tweeting is a great way to increase engagement. Plus, it’s free publicity, as the message of your event goes out to new audiences.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="a6413708-8ae6-48a1-b8d3-1a734239a162" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/virtual-events-wordstream-live-tweet.jpg" alt="Francine's tweet during WordStream Live" width="589" height="592" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that live-tweeting should be encouraged during paid events. An attendee isn’t going to be able to cover your entire event, which means that they will be promoting just enough information to get their followers interested in your brand/service.</p>
<h3>6. Get feedback from attendees</h3>
<p>Always be thinking ahead.</p>
<p>To help you plan your next event and to help you determine if this virtual event or the event platform you chose worked for your audience, you need to follow up with each participant.</p>
<p>This can be as simple as an email follow up a day or two after the event is over, but don’t wait too long, as you want their feedback when it’s fresh and clear in their mind.</p>
<p>In fact, you don’t even have to wait at all. For example, SheetsCon—a virtual conference about <a href="https://sheetscon.com/">Google Sheets</a>—polled its attendees throughout the event. This was the first-ever SheetsCon event, and they knew feedback was critical.</p>
<p>By polling throughout the event, they were able to gauge their attendees&#8217; experience of the event and mine important data for their next event.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="9578e2b3-07f8-441a-a118-d127fe096378" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/virtual-events-poll-attendees-sheetscon-example.jpg" alt="attendee poll example" width="758" height="582" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://www.benlcollins.com/spreadsheets/sheetscon-2020-online-conference-lessons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image Source</em></a></p>
<p>However you get feedback from your attendees, make sure to review it and make your next virtual event even better.</p>
<h2>Host engaging virtual events</h2>
<p>Virtual events have benefits for the event organizers (less upfront cost, a higher rate of attendance), and for the participants (easy to work around your schedule, lighter on your wallet, higher engagement between you and the presenters).</p>
<p>Whether it’s as recurring as a weekly <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/07/marketing-meetings">virtual meeting</a> or if it&#8217;s a larger virtual conference, the first step is understanding the goal of the event and the target audience. From there, follow our tips on how to host a virtual event that’s great for your business and offers clear value to attendees.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Looking to put some structure around your business growth? In this post, you will learn about what marketing objectives are, how they are different from marketing goals, and how to create objectives for sales, leads, website traffic, churn, trial signups, and more.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/15/marketing-objectives">Everything You Need to Know About Marketing Objectives</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of us want to know what our goal is before we start a project. But when it comes to business, too many marketers fly by the seat of their pants—and that&#8217;s a huge mistake. Why? Because marketers who create a clear, documented strategy are <a href="https://coschedule.com/marketing-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">313% more likely to be successful</a>.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marketing20objectives20documented20strategy.png" alt="Marketing objectives documented strategy" width="800" height="261" /></div>
<p>Creating marketing strategies before defining your marketing objectives is putting the cart before the horse.</p>
<p>That’s why today we are going through everything you need to know to make sure you’re setting your business up for success with actionable, effective marketing objectives. Here’s what we’ll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>What marketing objectives are</li>
<li>How they are different from marketing goals</li>
<li>How to create marketing objectives for your business</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h2>What are marketing objectives?</h2>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-objectives-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marketing objectives</a> are actionable targets designed to provide not just overall direction, but clear and specific actions. They are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-based (These are often called <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/12/15/adwords-smart-goals">SMART goals</a>, an acronym you’ve likely heard before!).</p>
<p>Marketing objectives should be tied to the overall success of the company, not just an arbitrary number.</p>
<p>For example, a marketing goal might be to increase website traffic by 50%.</p>
<p>But how will you get there and what will the purpose of that traffic be? When do you want to hit that number?</p>
<p>Objectives outline more than just a specific number, but also how you plan to reach that number and what impact that endpoint will have on the company as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Give it to me straight—what&#8217;s the difference between a marketing objective and a goal? </strong></p>
<p>Goals and objectives are two sides of the same coin. In general, business goals define the endpoint, while objectives are a more specific outline of how your marketing team will get there.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marketing20objectives20objectives20vs20goals.png" alt="Marketing objectives goals vs objectives" width="800" height="417" /></div>
<p>These terms are often used interchangeably and may have different definitions at different companies. For digital marketers, however, they have distinct differences:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marketing objectives</strong> are specific, measurable objectives designed to provide both instruction and targets.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing goals</strong> are broader destinations designed to outline how your business can benefit from digital marketing efforts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why do marketing objectives matter so much?</h3>
<p>Without defined objectives, your marketing goals will lack clarity and follow-through.</p>
<p>Peter Druker, a well-known management writer, once said: &#8220;If you can&#8217;t measure it, you can&#8217;t improve it.&#8221; And while the phrase may or may not have been original, the truth of it stands the test of time.</p>
<p>When digital marketers don&#8217;t take the time to outline objectives and measure their impact, they can&#8217;t tell if their efforts have had any impact.</p>
<h3>What are the key features of effective marketing objectives?</h3>
<p>Marketing objectives should follow the SMART philosophy to be effective. This means they need to be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-based.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marketing20objectives20SMART20goals.png" alt="Marketing objectives SMART goals" width="800" height="348" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/smart-goals-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image Source</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Specific:</strong> Specific metrics should be used in your marketing objectives. Don&#8217;t just say you want to increase sales—say how much you want to increase sales by, either in a percentage or a dollar amount.</p>
<p><strong>Measurable: </strong>Objectives must be measurable, and you should outline how you will measure success. Your goal might be to increase <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">brand awareness</a>, but your objective must include how you will measure it—for example, by measuring an increase in organic brand searches, social mentions, or social followers.</p>
<p><strong>Attainable: </strong>You might want to increase sales by 200%, but is that objective really attainable? Make sure the benchmarks you set are reasonable and attainable—and outline what steps are required to reach that objective.</p>
<p><strong>Relevant: </strong>One of the major drawbacks of goals is they outline the destination, but not how reaching that benchmark will impact the overall marketing strategy as a whole. Objectives should be relevant to the overarching purpose of your business.</p>
<p><strong>Time-Based: </strong>Finally, objectives should include a reasonable time frame for reaching the specific benchmark. Most marketing objectives are based on year or financial quarter, but that may vary based on the objective and how much work is required to reach the benchmark.</p>
<h2>Marketing objective examples</h2>
<p>All of this sounds great, but how do marketing objectives work in real life? Below, we&#8217;ve outlined several marketing objectives—including how those objectives will be tracked. These examples can be used as inspiration when creating your own objectives.</p>
<h3>Increase sales</h3>
<p>If you sell products or services, you might want to focus on increasing sales to increase revenue. For example, your objective might be: &#8220;Increase sales by 15% in the next six months by increasing new signups by 10% and increasing average customer orders by 20%.&#8221;</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marketing20objectives20sales20objectives.png" alt="Marketing objectives sales objectives" width="974" height="431" /></div>
<p>Then, outline how you will get there—perhaps by increasing lead generation content production or automating your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/06/29/email-marketing-statistics">email marketing</a> to suggest related products.</p>
<h3>Increase leads</h3>
<p>If you offer an expensive product or are in the B2B market, you might want to increase the number of people who land in your sales pipeline so you can work to convert those folks over time.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marketing20objectives20leads20objectives.png" alt="Marketing objectives leads objectives" width="800" height="292" /></div>
<p>Your objective might be &#8220;Boost the number of clients by increasing the number of leads by 25% in the next year by launching two new lead generation funnels on our website.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Grow brand awareness</h3>
<p>If you are a new company or are launching a new product or service, you may be interested in growing your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/05/brand-awareness-campaigns">brand awareness</a> to increase sales. This goal can be difficult to track without a clear objective.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what your objective might look like: &#8220;Increase market share by improving brand awareness in the next 12 months, as measured by an increase in organic brand name search by 50% through social media saturation, social media ads, and an influencer campaign.&#8221;</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marketing20objectives20brand20awareness20objectives.png" alt="marketing objectives brand awareness" width="800" height="326" /></div>
<p>Note that this objective not only outlines the target to increase brand awareness but also how you will measure it—through an increase in organic searches of your brand name.</p>
<h3>Decrease churn</h3>
<p>Maybe you are a well-established company and have a decent <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/12/06/sales-funnel-stages">sales funnel</a>—but you have a hard time keeping customers. Since it is cheaper to keep customers you&#8217;ve already earned than bring in new customers, you might create an objective to decrease customer turnover.</p>
<p>Your objective might look like this: &#8220;Decrease customer churn by 5% in the next quarter by decreasing customer service wait times by 15%, and nurturing customers through email automation.&#8221;</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marketing20objectives20churn20objectives.png" alt="marketing objectives decrease churn" width="800" height="361" /></div>
<h3>Increase trial signups</h3>
<p>If you are a SaaS company, a key performance indicator is likely how many trial signups you get per month. An objective for trial signup might be: &#8220;Increase trial signups by 25% over the next six months by increasing guest posts and using retargeting to push social followers to sign up for a trial.&#8221;</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marketing20objectives20trial20signups20objectives.png" alt="marketing objectives trial signups" width="800" height="345" /></div>
<p>Your overall goal might be to increase sales, but your objective is to increase signups over the next six months.</p>
<h3>Increase website traffic</h3>
<p>Businesses just getting started or looking to increase their market share may be looking to drive website traffic in an effort to increase brand awareness, sales, and overall growth.</p>
<p>An objective focused on increasing website traffic might have an executive summary that looks like this: &#8220;Increase unique website visitors by 20% by the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 through guest posts, social promotion, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/link-building-strategy">link building</a>.&#8221;</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marketing20objectives20web20traffic20objectives.png" alt="Marketing objectives web traffic objectives" width="800" height="308" /></div>
<p>A fully developed plan would likely include details about how many guest posts, what types of social promotion, and link building strategies.</p>
<h2>5 steps to create actionable marketing objectives</h2>
<p>Now that you understand what marketing objectives are and why they matter, you are ready to create your own. But what does the creation process look like? Should you create a strategy or figure out what your objective is first?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve created a five-step process to help create useful, measurable marketing objectives.</p>
<h3>Step #1: Outline your main marketing objective</h3>
<p>What is the main outcome you are looking for? Do you want to increase sales, improve customer retention, get better quality leads?</p>
<p>Remember that your objective should be specific and measurable, not just a generic declaration.</p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
<p>Get more website traffic X</p>
<p>Increase website traffic by 20% in 6 months ✓</p>
<p>Grow sales X</p>
<p>Increase sales to $100,000 in 1 year ✓</p>
<p>Get more customers X</p>
<p>Reach 25,000 signups 6 months after launch✓</p>
<h3>Step #2: Set short-term goals</h3>
<p>What short-term goals are going to help you reach your marketing objective? Will you set time-based benchmarks? Increase specific actions, such as creating more content? How will you measure if your marketing objectives are attainable in six months?</p>
<p>For example, your objective might be to reach 25,000 signups for your SaaS company six months after launch. Where do you expect to be at one, two, or three months? Have you accounted for the time it may take for SEO or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/06/04/5-content-marketing-statistics">content marketing</a> efforts to be effective?</p>
<h3>Step #3: Outline your marketing strategy</h3>
<p>You know where you are going, but how will you get there? This step is where you outline the strategies you will use to reach your objectives.</p>
<p>So, if your objective is to increase website traffic by 20% in six months, your marketing strategy might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an SEO-driven content marketing plan.</li>
<li>Write and publish three or four guest posts per month.</li>
<li>Use Facebook ads to drive traffic to your website.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step #4: Coordinate your objectives and long-term goals</h3>
<p>This step is about reflection—do the strategies you have outlined match your main objective and your short term goals? Do you have buy-in from executives or department managers, and are there any holes in your current strategy?</p>
<p>Most marketing strategies are not created by a single person—or even a single department. A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/03/brainstorming-techniques">brainstorming</a> session can be helpful, but it can also pull your objectives off target if you don&#8217;t take the time to ensure every step of your strategy makes sense for your main objective.</p>
<p>Finally, make sure your objective and strategy support your business&#8217; long-term goals for growth.</p>
<h3>Step #5: Measure your results</h3>
<p>To complete this step, you first need to determine how you’re measuring the results. Are you using Google Analytics to measure traffic or another tool? Will you use WordStream to track the success of your Facebook campaign or another tool? Will you use UTM links to track social traffic, or do you need to create a goal in Google Analytics?</p>
<p>Decide how you will measure, what you will measure, and how often you will take these measurements. Get clear on these before you launch your campaign—otherwise, you risk having data you can&#8217;t accurately compare.</p>
<p>For example, if you track unique site viewers for the first month, but then switch to overall traffic the second, it will be more difficult to tell what efforts are making a difference because you are comparing different data sets.</p>
<h2>Set yourself up for success with marketing objectives</h2>
<p>Effective marketing starts with clear, measurable marketing objectives that are relevant to short-term <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/smart-goals-examples">goals</a> and tied to marketing strategies. When you know where you are headed, your team is better prepared to measure success as you go and make necessary adjustments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/consumers-are-influenced-by-brands-on-social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">86%</a> of marketers in the U.S. advertise on Facebook, and it’s easy to see why. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/10/share-of-u-s-adults-using-social-media-including-facebook-is-mostly-unchanged-since-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">74%</a> of Facebook users visit the site at least once a day, and more than half of them visit it multiple times a day.</p>
<p>So the question isn’t <em>if </em>you should run ads on Facebook, but <em>when</em> is the best time to run ads on Facebook. If you run a great campaign at the wrong time, it’s like putting up a beautiful billboard on a freeway that doesn’t get any traffic.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20time20to20run20ads20on20facebook20billboard_0.png" alt="best time to run ads on facebook billboard" width="800" height="449" /></div>
<p>But finding out when to run Facebook ads isn’t as simple as we’d like it to be.</p>
<p>In the post, we will look at how to choose the best times to run Facebook ads for your business. Plus, we will cover the types of Facebook ads available, the best way to budget your ad campaigns, and how to track their progress.</p>
<h2>What is the best time to run Facebook ads?</h2>
<p>Let’s get this out of the way: Just like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/06/best-time-to-post-on-facebook">the best time to post on Facebook</a>, there is<strong> no one ideal time to run Facebook ads</strong>. If there were, the answer would be apparent, and this post would be over before it has even begun.</p>
<p>Most marketers have heard recycled, anecdotal wisdom. Things like, “It’s best to run your ads on the weekend when most people are at home,” or “Run your ads during the early evening after people get home from work but before they eat dinner.”</p>
<p>But remember, the <strong>plural of anecdote isn’t data</strong>. Just because a specific time slot worked for one business doesn’t mean it’ll work for yours.</p>
<h3>So should you run Facebook ads on the weekend?</h3>
<p>There is a ton of data online from companies sharing when <em>they’ve</em> had the most successful ad campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>It might look a little something like this</strong>:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><strong>Engagement</strong></td>
<td><strong>Conversion</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Consumer Goods</strong></td>
<td>Wednesday noon and Friday at 1 p.m.</td>
<td>Friday at 3 p.m.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Media</strong></td>
<td>Weekdays between noon and 6 p.m.</td>
<td>Thursday and Friday at 2 p.m.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Tech</strong></td>
<td>Weekends between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m.</td>
<td>Monday at 7 p.m.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>B2B</strong></td>
<td>Weekdays between 10 a.m. and noon</td>
<td>Weekdays at 5 p.m.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now, this might look clean and accurate, but it’s likely oversimplified and potentially misleading.</p>
<p>But if you took this table to heart and you were selling socks, you might be tempted to run an ad at 3 p.m. on a Friday. But what if Friday at 3 p.m. is wrong for your ad and your business?</p>
<p>The issue with this approach to running Facebook ads is that you aren’t getting granular enough with your company’s valuable data.</p>
<p>You want to<strong> run your Facebook ads at the right time for your target audience</strong>. This strategy isn’t new to online advertising—you wouldn’t run TV commercials aimed at high-income full-time employees during the workday. And you wouldn’t run the commercial on the cartoon channel—which brings us to our main point:</p>
<p><strong>Run your Facebook ad with your ad’s intent and your audience insights in mind</strong>.</p>
<h2>Use analytics to find the best time to run your Facebooks ads</h2>
<p>Okay, so we want you to use your data to create, schedule, run your next Facebook ad campaign. But where do you start?</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20time20to20run20facebook20ads20use20analytics.png" alt="best time to run facebook ads use analytics" width="800" height="821" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center">(<a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/facebook-analytics-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source</a>)</p>
<p>Well, the first three things you’ll want to use are:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li><strong>Facebook Analytics</strong>: Check to see which of your posts have been getting the most engagement. While engagement doesn’t necessarily correlate to conversions, it does give you a benchmark of when users are interacting with your posts. You can also use Facebook Analytics for a wide variety of other metrics that can help you create the most effective ad campaigns possible.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook Pixel</strong>: A pixel is a snippet of code that allows you to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/10/11/facebook-conversion-tracking">track conversions on Facebook</a> (as you define the term) and shows the value of your ads. Using the Facebook Pixel helps you see your actual conversion rate.</li>
<li><strong>Google Analytics: </strong>Google Analytics is a great tool, especially if you’re newer to Facebook ads. If you haven’t collected a significant amount of data on Facebook (or other social media platforms), use Google Analytics to mine your website’s data. While website data isn’t the same as social media data, it can still provide you with insight. For example, check the pageview rate of your “thank you page” (or whatever page you have set up to appear after a customer has made an actionable decision) to see when most of your customers are converting.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using these three tools will give you a solid foundation for determining the best time to run Facebook ads for your business.</p>
<p>But you might be asking yourself how to run a successful Facebook ad and how to schedule those successful ads once you’ve nailed down the best time for your company.<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/06/best-time-to-post-on-facebook"></a></p>
<h2>How do I run a good Facebook ad?</h2>
<p>That’s a fair question.</p>
<p>When you start creating an ad, ask yourself these two questions:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li><strong>What is the primary goal of the ad? </strong>Is the ad trying to get someone to your product page or e-mail sign up page? Are you a B2B company looking to get professionals scheduled for a demo?</li>
<li><strong>Who is the target audience? </strong>Knowing your target audience helps guide the entire ad process, from ideation to scheduling.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below is an example of two ads run by the same company at the same time. While the ads are run by the same company and at the same time, they have different goals and a different audience</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20time20to20run20facebook20ads20different20goals20different20audience.png" alt="best time to run facebook ads different goals different audience" width="800" height="429" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=all&amp;country=US&amp;impression_search_field=has_impressions_lifetime&amp;view_all_page_id=158468347517152" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image Source</em></a></p>
<p>You can see that while the ads are similar; they are trying to elicit a different emotional response from the user.</p>
<p>The ad on the left (Ad A) uses the “Learn More&#8221; button. The copy is going after the pain of saving time, but is doing so more generically.</p>
<p>The ad on the right (Ad B) uses the “Sign Up” button. It is more blatantly asking viewers to sign up for its service. That’s why its copy is more pointed. It tells, in short sentences, the features and the benefits.</p>
<p>With Ad A and Ad B, you can see Quickbooks is testing if catering towards more specific pain-points translates to a higher CTR when combined with the “Sign Up” button.</p>
<h3>Creating a Facebook ad checklist</h3>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li><strong>Did you segment your target audience?</strong> You can create custom audiences or further segment by location, gender, behaviors, connections, and interests.</li>
<li><strong>Does your copy go with your image?</strong> You’d think this be a given, but don’t forget users are scrolling through content when they see your ad. You want them to get a unified post that, with the copy and the image, conveys the key message.</li>
<li><strong>Do you have a clear CTA? </strong>Is your ad promoting a product at 20% off or is it trying to get a customer to sign up for a weekly newsletter? Spoiler: It can’t be both.</li>
</ol>

<h2>What kind of Facebook ads should I be running?</h2>
<p>There isn’t just one type of Facebook ad, and not all ad types have the same goal.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20time20to20run20facebook20ads20ad20types.png" alt="best time to run facebook ads ad types" width="500" height="284" /></div>
<p>You can choose from lots of different <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/01/30/facebook-advertising-tips">ad types</a>, but here’s what I recommend most often:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook video ads</strong>: Millions of videos are watched on Facebook every day, making <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/25/facebook-video-ads">Facebook video ads</a> a great way to reach your customers. Most data supports that if a video is 15 seconds or less, it gets watched by a user to the end.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook carousel ads</strong>: Display multiple products or multiple features in a carousel fan, allowing the user to swipe through images.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook canvas ads: </strong>Use several ad types (video ads + single image ads + carousel ads) all at once. Note: This ad type is exclusive to mobile.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook lead ads</strong>: Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/24/facebook-lead-ads">lead ads</a> for lead generation. Get your customers to sign up for a newsletter, claim a deal, or request a follow-up call all without leaving Facebook.</li>
</ul>
<p>Running the right kind of ad will depend on what it is you’re trying to accomplish.</p>
<h2>Should I schedule my Facebook ads?</h2>
<p>You’ve taken a look at the available data. Your ad is engaging and something that would resonate with your audience. It’s ready to post then, right?</p>
<p>Not so fast. Facebook ad scheduling can have a significant impact on your ROI.</p>
<h3>Daily budget vs. lifetime budget</h3>
<p>The first (and simplest) question is: Should I use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/19/facebook-ads-daily-vs-lifetime-budgets">daily budget or lifetime budget</a> for my campaign?</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20time20to20run20facebook20ads20daily20budget.png" alt="best time to run facebook ads daily budget" width="800" height="338" /></div>
<p><strong>A daily budget is easy to set up, and it tells Facebook to only spend up to X dollars per day. </strong>So each day, you know exactly how much money you’re spending. And, if you’re planning on changing the budget on a given campaign, daily budgets give you flexibility. However, on this budget, we’ve seen that Facebook works to spend the entire daily budget even if performance is low.</p>
<p>Here is what we mean: Facebook will do what it needs to do to make up your daily allotted ad spend, even if it isn’t in your best interest.</p>
<p>The most significant drawback, however, is that with <strong>daily budgeting, there is no option for ad scheduling</strong>. As we discussed above, not every hour in the day is created equal. If you’re looking to optimize your ad’s performance, based on the data collected through Facebook Insights and Google Analytics, a daily budget isn’t the tool you need.</p>
<p>Using <strong>a lifetime budget means you give Facebook an approved budget, and you choose the date the ad set should end on</strong>. The budget gets used up before that date, though not necessarily evenly across each day.</p>
<p>But flexibility is a double-edged sword. By using the perks of a lifetime budget, you also sign up for budgets that change daily. Facebook will use ad performance to justify increases and decreases to daily spend.</p>
<h2>How long does it take to see results from Facebook ads?</h2>
<p>Let’s start at the beginning.</p>
<p>Facebook reviews your ad before it is published. Facebook just wants to make sure your ad isn’t in violation of its Advertising Policies. Facebook says they review most ads within <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/204798856225114?id=649869995454285">24 hours</a>.</p>
<p>After Facebook approves the ad (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/16/facebook-ad-not-approved">your Facebook ad approval survival guide here</a>), it goes live (per the scheduled time you set).</p>
<p>From there, you can use <a href="https://www.facebook.com/login.php?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fads%2Fmanager">Facebook Ad Manager</a> to track key metrics. Just narrow down the dashboard by campaigns, and filter through CTR, cost per conversion, and other KPIs.</p>

<h2>Look at your data for the best time to run Facebook ads</h2>
<p>It’s tempting to want to find what are the best times to run Facebook ads for other businesses. And, if you don’t have any data of your own, that might be the place to start. But if you’ve been doing digital marketing and have data to use, it’s best to use it.</p>
<p>By taking insights from Facebook Analytics and Google Analytics, you can set parameters on when is the best time to run Facebook ads for your business.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s a process. Track and monitor your progress. Set up A/B testing. Make sure your copy is persuasive and written to convert.</p>
<p>Use our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-advertising?cid=Web_BX_Exit_FacebookBlog_StopWastingMoney_FacebookGrader">Facebook Ads Performance Grader</a> to see if your Facebook ad campaigns are fully optimized (scheduled to run at the right time, using the right CTAs, and more).</p>
<p>We will tell you how you stack up against the competition, highlight key opportunities for increased ROA, and show you any audiences you may be missing with your social media campaigns.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the world of marketing, a webinar can be one of the most powerful tools in your arsenal. There&#8217;s a simple reason for that. <strong>Webinars allow you to connect directly with your audience, establishing your credibility in the field and associating your business with that topic in the minds of your prospective customers. </strong></p>
<p>By running a webinar for your audience, you accomplish three things.</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Command the attention of your audience</li>
<li>Educate them on your industry</li>
<li>Build a relationship with prospects</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these factors build trust as you present your product in a transparent manner.</p>
<p>While this sounds all great, what if nobody shows up?</p>
<p>Even the world&#8217;s most prolific webinar host needs an audience. Without an audience, there&#8217;s really no point. It&#8217;s the proverbial tree falling in the woods with no one around to hear it.</p>
<p>The good news: You can skyrocket your attendees by using a customized webinar landing page that is specifically designed to encourage visitors to register. Five key steps go into creating a high-converting webinar landing page, and we’ll be covering all of <a>them.</a></p>

</div>
<h2>1. Define your target audience</h2>
<p>Figuring out your target audience for your webinar can be identified through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/31/detailed-demographics">demographic research</a>.</p>
<p>Ask things like:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>What is the age range I’d like to target?</li>
<li>Is there a certain gender this would resonate with?</li>
<li>Where do they live?</li>
<li>What are the pain points that I&#8217;m trying to alleviate for them?</li>
<li>Are there any interests my target audience has in common?</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you know the answers to these questions, you&#8217;ll be able to reach out to them in more targeted ways.</p>
<p>One strategy for getting noticed by your intended audience is through search engine optimization, or SEO, but results from SEO take time. With webinar promotion, time isn’t always available.</p>
<p>If you want a more immediate return, consider running paid ads through Facebook or Google. Not only do these services push your content out immediately, but they also give you advanced targeting criteria, which allows you to zero in on your preferred audience. You can target by age, gender, geographic location, interests, and more.</p>

</div>
<p>Sounds great, right? But don’t get too excited yet—we’re just getting started.</p>
<h2>2. Optimize your headers</h2>
<p>The headlines and subheads on each landing page are essential to your success. Keep in mind that although <a href="https://copyblogger.com/magnetic-headlines/">80% of people</a> may read your headline, <a href="https://copyblogger.com/magnetic-headlines/">only 20%</a> continue to read the rest.</p>
<p>That means your headline needs to be dynamic, and your subheads should continue to pull the reader down the page. Remember, if your headline hooks the reader, they are more likely to skim down to your offer.</p>
<p>So <em>how</em> do you create an engaging headline?</p>
<p>Employ some of these proven tips.</p>
<ul>
<li>Include numbers in your headline. Think &#8220;7 Secrets&#8221; or &#8220;The Top 10,” or even “5 Steps” like yours truly put up here.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be salesy. Highlight the problem you&#8217;re trying to solve and do just that. No one’s coming to hear your sales pitch.</li>
<li>Make your headline a question. This is not only great for search queries but it also captures the attention of the audience.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to subheaders, you want to make sure that you&#8217;re clear regarding your subject matter. You&#8217;re trying to encourage the reader to continue, but it&#8217;s also a perfect opportunity to sneak in some keywords.</p>
<p>Subheads also help your overall readability. Breaking the copy up makes it easier to digest. When you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/01/02/5-web-writing-tips">outline your content</a> (you should be outlining your content before drafting), be sure to include your subheads.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a great example from the retail giant Best Buy.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="52fe3f5e-1855-4cb5-a3ca-1b739b6591a6" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/better20webinar20landing20pages20best20buy20example_0.png" alt="better webinar landing pages best buy example" width="800" height="1009" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>As you can see, the headline is not only effective, but it is branded with their instantly recognizable logo. The subheads help to create a visible hierarchy of content, drawing the subject down the page effortlessly.</p>
<h2>3. Write quality copy</h2>
<p>If you can move people past the headline, you may have won the battle, but the war is still far from over. If your landing page copy is stale, dry, or full of errors, you&#8217;ll lose the reader.</p>
<p>Don’t oversell the webinar as the be-all-end-all of information. That&#8217;s going to come off like a sales pitch, and you don&#8217;t want that. Do emphasize your unique <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">value proposition</a>. Why is it important for them to attend your webinar? What will they get out of it?</p>
<p>Try to be consistent with your messaging throughout the entire page. You want to keep your benefits and selling points the same throughout the webinar landing page. Remember, you are selling one thing: the webinar.</p>
<p>The webinar landing page is also a great place to include some social proof. If you have customers who have attended your webinars in the past who are willing to provide you with a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/19/customer-testimonial-examples">glowing testimonial</a>, make sure that you use it. Website visitors will believe the word of a peer over the word of a business any day.</p>
<p>Remember, the copy should feel conversational. It should feel like a one-way conversation that you&#8217;re having with the reader. Don&#8217;t be afraid to lean into that connection by using words like &#8220;you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Make sure you&#8217;re <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/06/content-editing">editing</a> and proofreading your copy to catch any significant errors. Use a service like Grammarly, or another specialized checking tool to ensure that your content grammatically correct—and that you have not committed any cases of unintentional plagiarism.</p>
<p>Finally, while we&#8217;ve talked a lot about using keywords effectively, you don&#8217;t want to force them into your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/02/landing-page-copywriting">landing page copy</a>. Keyword stuffing not only makes your text awkward; it is something that Google looks explicitly for when penalizing a website&#8217;s SEO score.</p>
<p>This example from Forrester showcases quality copy in action.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="309d0168-84cf-449c-96ef-4a198b49b2c5" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/better20webinar20landing20pages20forrester20example_0.png" alt="better webinar landing pages forrester example" width="800" height="852" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>The paragraphs are short and easy to read. Bullet points break up the copy, too; the structure provides a clear description of the webinar and what it will be covering.</p>
<h2>4. Use images and videos</h2>
<p>No one wants to look at a massive block of text. You have to use some style and flair in your page&#8217;s design. Media, like images and teaser videos, can do a lot to pull a page together.</p>
<p>Now, we&#8217;re not saying to fill your page with a cluster of images or videos. When creating a landing page, it&#8217;s best to keep them limited. However, the photos or videos that you do use should pop to draw the reader in.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a classic case of quality over quantity: Your media should be relevant and speak to the wants and needs of the customer. A video of the presenter explaining your webinar could also go a long way toward establishing credibility. Headshots of your speakers are another great inclusion.</p>
<p>For a prime example of compelling imagery, check out this example from HCL Tech.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="8bd6af54-161e-4516-baf8-b9663708c3f5" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>The header image sets the tone for the audience. After all, reviewing information on a mobile tablet while sipping coffee is something most business professionals can relate to. Right?</p>
<p>The professional black and white headshots of the speakers help to convey authority and helps to complement the overall page.</p>
<p>This example from Network Marketing Pro shows how to use video effectively.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="2855a4d4-fd40-4ac4-9dfc-9ead5e314fc7" data-langcode="en">

</div>
<p>As you can see, the teaser video takes up a large amount of space on the page. Since people digest video content more easily, this makes for a bold, yet effective approach. Combine this with a compelling headline, date and time, minimal copy, and an effective call to action, and you’ve got a recipe for success.</p>
<h2>5. Include a strong call to action</h2>
<p>Your call to action, or CTA, is perhaps the most critical element of your webinar landing page. The CTA button is what allows potential attendees to join the webinar and say, “yes, I’m in!” A strong CTA is essential to increasing your click-through rate.</p>
<p>As such, you have to make sure that the CTA button is large enough to be noticed without dominating the page. If someone likes the idea of your webinar but can&#8217;t find the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/20/call-to-action-buttons">CTA button</a>, you&#8217;re not likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Consider using a contrasting color for your Call To Action to make it stand out against the page. This will draw the customer&#8217;s eye to the button, which should feature copy written in the customer&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a good idea to include a sign-up form on the page, with required form fields highlighted.</p>
<p>These CTA tips can help you achieve a higher conversion rate:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CTA button should be large and link to your opt-in form.</li>
<li>Ensure that the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/03/website-color-scheme">color scheme</a> pulls attention but doesn&#8217;t clash with the rest of the webinar landing page design.</li>
<li>Place the CTA button above the fold. That means the reader should not have to scroll down the page in order to see the button and access your webinar registration form.</li>
<li>Consider adding some subtle clues such as an arrow pointing to the button.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t try to shoehorn your services into the call to action. Products and offers can come at a later time. The landing page intends to get people to sign up for your webinar. Don&#8217;t scare them off by trying to pitch a product at the eleventh hour.</li>
</ul>
<p>This example from Mastin Kipp shows some masterful calls to action.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e2a2bcc6-5477-435d-be7e-9eb87e4066b3" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/better20webinar20landing20pages20mastin20kipp20example_0.png" alt="better webinar landing pages mastin kipp example" width="800" height="1033" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>As you can see, there&#8217;s more than one cooperative CTA. They work together to convert the visitor at the beginning and end of the page. Also, they use some copy with an arrow right above the second CTA to pull the reader&#8217;s attention further.</p>
<h2>Get registrants with killer webinar landing pages!</h2>
<p>Landing pages are a key component of a solid <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/05/webinar-marketing">webinar marketing strategy</a>. If you want to create a perfect webinar landing page that will have a positive impact on your conversion rate, you need to make sure that you&#8217;re keeping these five steps at the forefront of your mind.</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Target your audience</li>
<li>Optimize your headline and subheads</li>
<li>Write quality copy</li>
<li>Use images and videos wisely</li>
<li>Include a powerful call to action</li>
</ol>
<p>By doing this and understanding how these steps fit together, you will be able to draw in a larger audience for your upcoming webinar and leverage that attendance into lead generation and positive growth for your business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Does creating a website feel like a daunting task?  Are you putting off building a website for your business, non-profit, or portfolio because it just seems like too much work? If learning to code, sourcing photographs, and figuring out how to create forms sounds overwhelming, I&#8217;ve got great news.</p>
<p><strong>You don&#8217;t need to know how to do any of that to build a basic website. </strong></p>
<p>The days when you needed an expensive designer or web developer to build a simple website are long gone. Today, all you need is an afternoon and (depending on the tools you use) between $20 and $100.</p>
<p>And here is the thing: If you want to build and grow a successful business, a website is a must.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.adaptivemarketing.us/97-of-consumers-search-for-local-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">97% of people</a> search the internet when they are looking for a local business.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/basic-website-intro-graph.jpg" alt="graph of users searching for local businesses" width="768" height="462" /></div>
<p>So in this post, we’ll walk you through everything you need to do to set up a basic website:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define your site&#8217;s purpose</li>
<li>Choose a website hosting company</li>
<li>Choose your site builder</li>
<li>Outline your web pages</li>
<li>Optimize your website</li>
<li>Set up a payment processor</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h2>1. Define your site&#8217;s purpose</h2>
<p>Before diving into actually <a href="https://localiq.com/products/websites-landing-pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creating your website</a>, you need to take the time to define what your website&#8217;s purpose will be.</p>
<p>Understanding your website&#8217;s function will be important as you consider which tools to use.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/basic-website-define-purpose.jpg" alt="image of website planning with papers, lap top, coffee, and pens on a desk" width="791" height="528" /></div>
<p><strong>Before getting started, answer these questions about your website: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is the main purpose of your site?</strong> Are you looking to drive foot traffic, <a href="/blog/ws/2016/02/03/increase-sales-online">sell products online</a>, share a weekly menu, accept online orders, or something else entirely? The answer to this question will impact what host you choose, the site builder you use, and every other decision you make.</li>
<li><strong>How do you currently market your business?</strong> Your marketing strategy will impact the tools you need. For example, if email marketing is important to your business, you are going to need to add an <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/11/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups">email sign-up</a>. If Instagram drives tons of traffic, you might consider embedding your Instagram feed on your site.</li>
<li><strong>What functions does your site need? </strong>Are you selling products online? You need to choose a <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/08/how-to-build-an-ecommerce-website">site builder</a> and host that specializes in ecommerce. What about digital products? You will need the ability to send files automatically. Do you want to provide direction to your store&#8217;s physical location? Make a list of features and functions you need. You will refer to this list as you consider which web host or site builder to select.</li>
<li><strong>Where do you see your business in the next few years?</strong> What features or <a href="/blog/ws/2020/11/02/promote-your-business">marketing strategies</a> would you like to explore? If you have plans to use paid ads, for example, you may want to make sure the host you choose can support a large increase in traffic and the easy creation of landing pages.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Choose a web hosting company</h2>
<p>Setting up a website requires three main components:<strong> a host</strong> (which stores your website files and delivers them when users request them), <strong>a domain name</strong> (which serves as the online location of a site), and<strong> a site builder</strong> (which is the tool used to create pages, add copy, upload images, and so forth).</p>
<p>These three features are often offered within all-in-one packages from web hosts such as GoDaddy, BlueHost, and SiteGround. There are dozens of web hosts, and each offers a variety of packages, which can make choosing a host complicated.</p>
<p><strong>Here is how to choose the right web host for your website: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Decide what type of hosting you need:</strong> Shared or cloud hosting is cheaper and will be sufficient for most small business websites. High traffic or large ecommerce brands should consider dedicated or VPS hosting.</li>
<li><strong>Pay attention to uptime:</strong> If your site is unavailable, you are going to lose money. Look for a web host that offers at least 99.9% uptime and will refund a portion of your fees if they fail to meet their guarantee.</li>
<li><strong>Consider security:</strong> Hosts are tasked with keeping your web files secure, so you want a host that cares about security. Look for features such as an included SSL certificate, firewall, and malware protection.</li>
<li><strong>Think of the future:</strong> If your site is for informational purposes, a cheap, shared hosting plan may be fine. However, consider whether traffic will increase substantially as your business grows and look for a hosting provider with plans that will grow with you.</li>
<li><strong>Look at features:</strong> Hosts often offer a wide range of other products, including site builders, SSL certificates (which give your site the https prefix), free domain names, marketing credits, and email hosting. Choose a host that offers what you need, not a more expensive plan that includes “free” features you will never use.</li>
<li><strong>Pay attention to pricing details:</strong> Many hosts offer discounts on the first year or a “free” domain name that renews at a much higher rate. Before you buy, check on the renewal price for your second year of hosting service.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, read reviews of each hosting platform before you make a purchase. While moving hosts isn&#8217;t impossible, it can be complicated. Reading reviews can help you avoid the hassle. <a href="https://www.whoishostingthis.com/hosting-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Who Is Hosting This</a> and <a href="https://hostingfacts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hosting Facts</a> both publish in-depth reviews and compare and contrast the most popular hosting options.</p>
<h2>3. Choose your site builder</h2>
<p>In the past, building a website was a complex process that could take weeks. Today, with the help of templates and drag-and-drop site builders, you can build a functional site in just a few minutes.</p>
<p>Your first step should be to see what your host offers. Many hosting providers include a proprietary site builder or access to a third-party builder with your hosting plan.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.siteground.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siteground,</a> for example, offers free use of Weebly or WordPress with every hosting plan.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a quick look at the most popular site builders on the market.</strong></p>
<h3>WordPress</h3>
<p>As the most popular content management system on the internet, you have likely heard of WordPress.</p>
<p>There are two options: <a href="https://wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress.com</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress.org</a>. WordPress.com is a paid service that provides hosting and helps keep your site secure. WordPress.org refers to the free files you can download to your hosting provider.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/basic-website-choose-host-wordpress.jpg" alt="basic website by WordPress image" width="778" height="370" /></div>
<p>WordPress can be as complex or simple as you like, and there are a variety of themes to choose from. If you plan to expand your site, WordPress is an excellent option.</p>
<h3>Squarespace</h3>
<p>Squarespace is a template-based site building tool and an all-in-one platform. They offer hosting, domains, a site builder, and even ecommerce features.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Squarespace</a> sites are quite flexible, but options are slightly limited compared to WordPress.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/basic-website-choose-host-squarespace.jpg" alt="a basic website by Squarepace option" width="799" height="368" /></div>
<p>Template selections include sites for restaurants, portfolios, events, weddings, bands, and online stores.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to mess with building your Squarespace site yourself, you can <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/designer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire a Squarespace designer</a> who can build the site for you.</p>
<h3>Weebly</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.weebly.com/">Weebly</a> is a super easy to use, template-based site builder with drag and drop features.</p>
<p>Adding features and even a store is super simple; however, Weebly does limit your ability to customize. For a simple site, though, limited customization may be fine.</p>
<p>Weebly also offers domain names, if you haven&#8217;t already purchased one.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/basic-website-choose-host-weebly.jpg" alt="basic website by Weebly image" width="751" height="371" /></div>
<p>Weebly has been growing in popularity, particularly for small businesses that do not need a site with complex functionality. It is an affordable option, but businesses looking to expand will quickly outgrow Weebly.</p>
<h2>4. Outline your web pages</h2>
<p>Once you have your host and your site builder, it is time to get to work writing and creating the pages of your site. While the number of pages will vary drastically based on your business, there are a few pages that every website should have.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, users should not have to dig to find information. If a page is important, be sure to list it in the main navigation bar (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/27/website-header-examples">website header examples here</a>) or the footer.</p>
<p><strong>Here are a few main website pages every site should include: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Home page: </strong>This is your elevator pitch, your first impression. Explain who your company is and your values. Include a CTA to other pages, such as contact us and products or services. For homepage ideas, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/01/homepage-design">head here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Service or product pages: </strong>Include one page for each major service or product line your business offers.  For example, a bakery might separate pages for cakes, pies, and catering. You can find <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/06/26/product-descriptions">product description tips here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>About us page: </strong>This is a look at the history and the people behind your company. What is your founding story? What background do you want to share? Are you a veteran, a former police officer, do you have a family?</li>
<li><strong>Contact page: </strong>How can site visitors reach you? Your contact page may include an online form, phone number, address, hours, and embedded Google map.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy statement:</strong> This is the page where you explain what information you gather from site visitors and what you do with the information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure to include a call to action, or CTA, on every page. For example, at the bottom of every LOCALiQ page, there&#8217;s a form for getting started:</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/build-basic-website-CTA-LQ.png" alt="build-basic-website-CTA-LQ" width="800" height="514" /></div>
<p>Depending on your business model, you might use the CTA to direct site visitors to your email list, contact page, or your product page. For more ideas and inspiration, check out our collection of some of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/14/website-examples">best website examples</a> we could find.</p>
<h2>5. Optimize your website</h2>
<p>Once your website is online, how will users find it?</p>
<p>Most users locate the information they need by typing (or speaking) a search into Google. For example, a family looking for a children&#8217;s clothing store might type in &#8220;kids clothing near me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google uses more than 200 ranking factors to determine what site to show, and optimizing your site will give it a better chance of ranking well for your industry and location. The tools you use to optimize your site will depend on both the site builder and the host you use. Here are a few to consider.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you use WordPress, download the <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yoast SEO plugin</a>.</li>
<li>If you use WordPress.org, make sure you download JetPack and use <a href="https://wordpress.com/support/seo-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their SEO guide</a> to optimize your site.</li>
<li>Squarespace users can use<a href="https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002090267-SEO-checklist" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> this checklist they provide.</a></li>
<li>Learn more about <a href="https://www.weebly.com/uk/features/seo">SEO features on Weebly here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And this <a href="http://wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/30/seo-basics">guide to SEO basics</a> provides more information on how to optimize your site to <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/19/get-on-first-page-google">rank higher on Google.</a></p>
<h2>6. Set up payment processor (if needed)</h2>
<p>If you plan to sell products online or allow for online ordering, then your site will need a way to accept payments.</p>
<p>Popular payment options include<a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/home"> PayPal</a>, <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe</a>, and <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Square</a>, though there are plenty of <a href="https://marketingland.com/top-10-payment-processing-companies-world-175913" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other payment processor options.</a> The host you choose may provide an ecommerce option, as well.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a quick rundown of three of the most popular payment processor options: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Stripe</strong> is an online payment API that works well for e-commerce companies. <a href="https://stripe.com/partners/collect-for-stripe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Collect</a> for Stripe will also allow you to accept in-person payments.</li>
<li><strong>PayPal</strong> is one of the most popular online payment processors. They offer online checkout, invoicing, and payments that work well for most ecommerce businesses.</li>
<li><strong>Square </strong>offers a variety of POS systems, online checkout, and invoicing that works well for both online and brick-and-mortar businesses.</li>
</ol>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/basic-website-payment-processor-square.jpg" alt="image of a store with Square payment processor" width="750" height="361" /></div>
<p>When selecting a payment processor, consider how your target audience prefers to pay and also how much each processor charges.</p>
<h2>Stick to the basics</h2>
<p>If you own a small business, you have likely heard how important having at least a simple, basic website can be, but actually creating a website can feel overwhelming. With the wide range of tools and solutions on the market today, getting your business online no longer requires knowing how to code or spending thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>Using the tools and walkthrough above, your business can be ready to connect with the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4.33 billion internet users</a> in just an afternoon.</p>
