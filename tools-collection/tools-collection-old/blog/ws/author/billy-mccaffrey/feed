<p>Oh, if only that were true. However, now that you’re thinking about the proper way to motivate someone, let’s talk about the mighty call to action (CTA).</p>
<p>A CTA is the most important element in most marketing messages. Whether you want people to place an order, set an appointment, or subscribe to your email, CTAs are the final step in making it happen.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-duedil.jpg" alt="call to action - example CTA from Duedil" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76599 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-duedil.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-duedil-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Look at that blue call-to-action button telling us what to do next.</em></p>
<p>But how do you write a good call to action?</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll show you how to craft the type of CTAs that jump off the screen and get people to do the one thing you really want them to do. Maybe you won’t get a million dollars directly, but with your new CTAs at the ready, you’ll generate a lot more business. And that’s almost as good.</p>

<h2>What is a call to action in marketing?</h2>
<p>In marketing, a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/07/call-to-action-marketing">call to action</a>, or CTA, is a word or phrase that tells your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/09/18/beginners-guide-to-target-markets">target audience</a> what to do next. They can be plain copy, but they’re often clickable links either in text or in a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/20/call-to-action-buttons">CTA button</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-barkbright.jpg" alt="call to action - screenshot of a landing page from brand Bark Bright" width="923" height="348" class="aligncenter wp-image-76600 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-barkbright.jpg 923w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-barkbright-480x181.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 923px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You can use CTAs in just about any type of marketing message. In fact, a customer might see several CTAs as they move from unaware prospect to repeat buyer.</p>
<p>For example, someone might click a “learn more” button on your Facebook ad, then click a “subscribe now” button on your landing page, then click a “buy now” CTA button from your newsletter.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Boring CTAs won’t cut it.

<h2>Benefits of a good call to action</h2>
<p>A call to action is a signpost that leads people down the road of becoming a customer. It helps to keep prospects moving toward that goal so they don’t veer off and get distracted.</p>
<p>These examples show the influence of a great call to action:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emails with a single CTA increased clicks by <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/06/10/digital-marketing-stats">371%</a> and sales by 1617%.</li>
<li>CTAs on a landing page increased clicks by <a href="https://www.bnpengage.com/blog/call-action-cta-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80%</a>.</li>
<li>Adding well-placed CTAs increased revenue from blog posts by <a href="https://www.brafton.com/blog/content-marketing/where-to-place-ctas-for-an-83-increase-in-blog-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">83%</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at how to create these types of irresistible CTAs.</p>
<div id="how-to-write-a-call-to-action"></div>
<h2>How do you write a good call to action?</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-pros-write-calls-to-action">good call to action</a> will attract attention and make it hard to resist taking the next step in ads, emails, landing pages, and more. Read on to learn how to write CTAs that drive conversions no matter where they are (see what we did there?).</p>
<h3>1. Use a strong verb to start your CTA</h3>
<p>You don’t have a ton of space to get your point across. Don’t dilly or dally. Let your audience know exactly what you want them to do by leading each <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/20/call-to-action-buttons">CTA button</a> with an action verb.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-lockin.jpg" alt="call to action - screenshot of a call to action page promoting free gift" width="936" height="571" class="aligncenter wp-image-76601 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-lockin.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-lockin-480x293.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There are different action verbs depending on the type of business you run and what you want your customer to do. Here are a few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For an ecommerce website:</strong> Start your CTA with words like “buy,” “shop,” or “order”</li>
<li><strong>If you’re promoting a newsletter or piece of content:</strong> Start your CTA with words like “download” or “subscribe”</li>
<li><b>For a service-based business:</b> Try CTAs that begin with “call now” or “book your appointment.”</li>
</ul>
<p>What you don’t want is to simply say something exists. “Our newest fashions are available” won’t stir people to action, whereas “click here for the latest trends” feels kinetic and is more likely to improve your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/click-through-rate">click-through rate</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Include words that provoke emotion or enthusiasm</h3>
<p>If you want more clicks and conversions, you need to elicit a strong response from your audience. An enthusiastic CTA that taps into <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotional copywriting</a> is just the thing to get it done.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-donedone.jpg" alt="call to action - screenshot of a landing page from brand Done Done" width="817" height="583" class="aligncenter wp-image-76602 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-donedone.jpg 817w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-donedone-480x343.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 817px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Let’s say someone is looking to book a trip with their family. They come across a CTA like “plan your dream vacation today!” That’ll get them hyped and thinking about what their dream vacation looks like. They’ll eagerly click the link in your ad.</p>
<p>Some other ways your CTAs can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/01/13/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing">tap into emotion include</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reducing risk and insecurity</li>
<li>Building trust</li>
<li>Creating urgency</li>
<li>Communication value</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t forget punctuation. Add an exclamation point to the end of your CTA to max out the excitement. It’ll make your CTA pop and give it a little extra kick.</p>
<h3>3. Give your audience a reason to act</h3>
<p>In other words, tell people what’s in it for them if they click. Will it help them do their jobs better, lose weight, or save money? This will tie in heavily with your value proposition, or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/07/unique-selling-proposition">unique selling point</a> (USP). Your USP is arguably one of the most important pieces of acquiring new leads, so creating a nice USP/CTA mash-up is a great way to increase clicks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-slider.jpg" alt="call to action - screenshot of landing page with CTA from brand slider" width="842" height="589" class="aligncenter wp-image-76603 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-slider.jpg 842w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-slider-480x336.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 842px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>A good <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/13/call-to-action-examples">example of a call to action</a> here would be something like “call us to start saving money today!” Not only have you stated the action you want the user to take (call today), but you have also provided them with a reason why they should take that action (save money).</p>
<h3>4. Take advantage of FOMO</h3>
<p>This is actually one of my favorite tactics when it comes to a successful CTA. Fear of missing out, otherwise known as <a href="http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2011/04/14/fomo-addiction-the-fear-of-missing-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FOMO</a>, is an extremely effective motivator. When people think they might lose out on an opportunity that might not come around again, they’ll be mighty quick to hop on the bandwagon.</p>
<p>One of the best uses of FOMO in your CTA is to mention a sale or promotion that your company is holding, and which won’t last forever.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-curbside-1.jpg" alt="call to action - Screenshot of an ad with CTA for shop now" width="370" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76604 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-curbside-1.jpg 370w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-curbside-1-185x300.jpg 185w" sizes="(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px" /></p>
<p>You probably get emails with this sort of messaging all the time, I know I sure do. I’m talking about messaging like “Shop today! Sale ends on Monday,” perhaps during a three-day weekend. Or even “buy now while supplies last!” during the holiday season. It’s tough to ignore a prompt like that, especially during a time-sensitive, under-the-gun type of situation (e.g. the Christmas season).</p>
<p>Similar to provoking enthusiasm as we discussed earlier, provoking fear of missing out in your CTA is sure to get you some additional clicks.</p>
<h3>5. Match CTA to device type</h3>
<p>Creating a killer call-to-action is important, that’s no secret. But I also urge you to consider customizing your CTA based on the device being used by your audience. Google considers <a href="http://searchengineland.com/the-real-reason-why-google-is-dropping-the-tablet-vs-desktop-distinction-its-the-user-context-stupid-149738" target="_blank" rel="noopener">desktop and tablet as the same device</a>, since the screen sizes are roughly the same. People also use them for search in similar scenarios.</p>
<p>For example, someone sitting on the couch at night sees an ad on TV for a product they’re interested in. It’s common for them to grab their laptop or tablet and search for more information on it. It might be best to lead them with a “learn more” or “shop now” CTA.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/18/mobile-ad-strategies">mobile devices tend to have different user behavior</a> and search intent than desktop/tablets. Since <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/local-seo-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80%</a> of searches for local business on mobile devices convert, it’s prudent to tailor your CTA based on device..</p>
<p>One big difference between desktop and mobile is that on mobile, people have the ability to place a call from the device they’re shopping with. My advice is to create more phone call-centric CTAs that appear on mobile devices, especially for service-based businesses. This lawn care company has a clickable phone number on their landing page.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-landscape.jpg" alt="call to action - screenshot of a landscapers website with clickable phone number" width="356" height="595" class="aligncenter wp-image-76605 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-landscape.jpg 356w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-landscape-179x300.jpg 179w" sizes="(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px" /></p>
<p>Some possible <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/powerful-call-to-action-phrases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CTA phrases</a> to try could be “call now to get started” or “call us today for more information” to guide your target audience to take the action you want them to take.</p>
<h3>6. A/B test your CTAs</h3>
<p>A good, old-fashioned <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/09/25/a-b-testing">A/B test</a> is a great way to identify which CTA’s bring you clicks, and which CTA’s bring you frowns. While your tried and true <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/20/call-to-action-examples">calls-to-action</a> like the ones we’ve already discussed are always good to use, you really never know how they’ll perform in your account until you actually use them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-dewalt.jpg" alt="call to action - Comparision of two ads from Dewalt" width="926" height="384" class="aligncenter wp-image-76606 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-dewalt.jpg 926w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-dewalt-480x199.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 926px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Digital marketing is definitely a game of trial and error (which is why it can be frustrating!), and your calls-to-action are no exception to the rule. Something could look great on paper, or may sound great when a colleague recommends it to you, but the only way you’ll absolutely know for sure if something will work for your account is if you test it out.</p>
<p>Your target audience may not respond well to what could be considered a “surefire CTA,” which is enough to make you pull your hair out. By A/B testing, you can trial some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2010/09/29/unusual-effective-calls-to-action">creative CTAs</a> and compare them to your old standards. If your target audience isn’t responding well to your ads, you might as well try to think outside the box a bit!</p>
<p>Start with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out today’s deals!</li>
<li>Fill out a form to get started</li>
<li>Call today for more information</li>
</ul>
<p>And test against:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tons of deals at your fingertips</li>
<li>A healthier life starts now!</li>
<li>Don’t miss out, call us today!</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Add numbers when possible</h3>
<ol start="7"></ol>
<p>We consumers respond well to seeing numbers such as pricing, discounts, promotions, incentives, etc. It helps us to determine whether or not it’s worth splurging on items we desperately want, but probably aren’t essential to everyday life. So when the opportunity arises, why not appeal to your target audience that way?</p>
<p>I am always a big proponent of including pricing information in your ad copy in general, and that includes your CTA. If a user sees your pricing information in your ad, and decides to click through to your site, then you know they are still interested in the product or service you are offering. Now you know you have yourself a valuable click, and an increased chance at generating a conversion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-luna.jpg" alt="call to action - landing page from brand Luna with subscribe CTA" width="557" height="584" class="wp-image-76607 size-full aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-luna.jpg 557w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-luna-480x503.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 557px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But, if you don’t include your pricing information in your ads, someone may click through to your site, excited about your products/services, but then get scared off by your prices. Now you have yourself a less than desirable situation. This leads to the dreaded wasted spend in your account, and who wants to deal with that?</p>
<p>Try experimenting with your pricing information in your CTA, as well as any other applicable numerical information. A CTA such as “Shop today for TVs under $300!” not only shows a user how little they will pay for a TV, but it also hits on the FOMO element as well (pretty sneaky huh?).</p>
<p>If you run a special promotion for shipping, you could try something like “order by Sunday for 1-day shipping.” Maybe you are an auto body shop looking to incentivize your audience with a discount; your CTA might look something like “Book today! 15% off your next visit.”</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="👋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Want more tips on creating ads that convert?

<h3>8. Be bold in your CTA copy</h3>
<p>This can be a little risqué, but adding a dash of brash to your CTA copy can be pretty effective in catching someone’s eye.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-unspam.jpg" alt="call to action - screenshot of an ad for a conference with a bold CTA" width="789" height="587" class="aligncenter wp-image-76608 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-unspam.jpg 789w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-unspam-480x357.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 789px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>One option that can be tough to pull off is using negative words to motivate a person to change something they are self-conscious about. For example, if I was on Google looking to lose weight and saw a call-to-action such as “end your crappy diet today,” I might just want to click. Sure, it’s a bit over-the-top, which is why I recommend using this technique sparingly, but it definitely commands attention.</p>
<p>Here’s another example. Say I want to fix the brown patches in my lawn. I’m perusing Google and see an ad with a CTA like “your yard sucks, let us fix it.” Not only would I probably chuckle, but I would also probably click just to see exactly what that lawn company could do for me. You’re walking a fine line with this technique, but it can pay off.</p>
<h3>Boost conversions with strong calls to action</h3>
<p>Whether it’s on your website, social media ads, search engine listings, or newsletter, a well-written call to action will get more people to take the next step toward making a purchase.</p>
<p>Remember these eight tips to write a good call to action:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use a strong verb to start your CTA</li>
<li>Include words that provoke emotion or enthusiasm</li>
<li>Give your audience a reason to act</li>
<li>Take advantage of FOMO</li>
<li>Match CTA to device type</li>
<li>A/B test your CTAs</li>
<li>Add numbers when possible</li>
<li>Be bold in your CTA</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever heard the expression “less is more”? I find this to be extremely true when it comes to the keywords in your PPC account. Now, depending on who you ask, you’ll hear a different response for the age-old question: “How many keywords should I have in my Google Ads account?” When it comes to ad groups, the typical answer is somewhere in the 20-25 keyword range, and definitely no more than <a href="/blog/ws/2014/04/24/ppc-performance">30 keywords per ad group</a>. Keep in mind that this is a loose guideline, and isn’t anything that is set in stone. The important thing at the end of the day is that the keywords in each ad group are closely related to one another, so that you can create super-specific ad copy.</p>
<p>I’m here to tell you that it doesn’t serve you to bloat your PPC account with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/17/google-ads-issues">too many keywords</a>. There is definitely no need to strain yourself attempting to reach that 30-keyword mark in each ad group; it is actually perfectly okay to have an ad group with less than 30 keywords. In fact, chances are, if your campaigns contain ad groups with less than 30 keywords, then you’ve organized your account efficiently and can create that all important relevant ad copy. I have worked with plenty of clients whose ad groups contain no more than four or five keywords, and they have generated strong results.</p>
<p>Having too many keywords in your PPC account is actually consistently listed as one of the <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/224325">most common PPC mistakes</a>. I’m serious, just a little bit of <a href="http://www.bizible.com/blog/bid/327555/The-Top-5-AdWords-Mistakes">PPC research</a> showed me that having <a href="http://www.semsamurai.com/2010/03/are-you-making-these-7-google-adwords-mistakes-mistake-1/">too many keywords per ad group</a> is one of the <a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/6-reasons-why-small-businesses-often-fail-with-adwords/64012/">most frequent PPC errors</a>.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/too-many-adwords-keywords-1.jpg" alt="Too many AdWords keywords " width="500" height="281" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>The ugly result of bloating: Violet Beauregarde</em></p>
<p>There are three reasons why I recommend against having too many keywords in your PPC account.</p>
<h2>#1. Not enough room in your daily budget</h2>
<p>Let’s imagine you run a campaign with a daily budget of $25. Let’s also imagine the campaign has 25 keywords, each with an average CPC of $1. On average, this allows the campaign the opportunity to generate 25 clicks per day. Your keywords have maintained a strong, competitive average position, and you’re generally happy with the way your daily budget is being spent.</p>
<p>Now let’s say you utilize <a href="/blog/ws/2013/09/18/best-keyword-research-tools">keyword research tools</a> to identify some new keyword opportunities, all with an average CPC of $1 (if only it were that simple!), and you find 15 keywords that you think would be effective. You’re not exactly sure which keywords would be best though, so you add all of them.  Now, all of sudden, you have 40 keywords running at an average CPC of $1, each vying for a slice of that $25 daily budget. In order to get one click for each keyword in a single day, you would need a daily budget of $40. Your daily budget simply can’t support the demand from your keyword list. This is a problem!</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/do-i-have-too-many-ppc-keywords-1.jpg" alt="Too many AdWords keywords Bilbo Baggins" width="500" height="380" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Bilbo Baggins knows what it’s like to be stretched too thin</em></p>
<h2>#2. Your campaigns will turn off once your daily budget has been exhausted</h2>
<p>This ties directly into the first reason. For those of you who don’t know, once a campaign’s daily budget has been exhausted, that campaign is “turned off” by Google until the following day. What this means is that Google will not allow your keywords to trigger with search queries once the campaign’s daily budget has been exhausted until the next day. This could potentially be very harmful to your keywords’ performance!</p>
<p>Let’s use our imaginations again, and head back to our example campaign. If one of those 40 keywords typically converts in the evening hours, but now the campaign turns off around noon because of additional keyword clicks, then your high-performing keyword can’t generate conversions for you because of a depleted daily budget. It won’t even get the opportunity to enter the <a href="/blog/ws/2011/11/16/how-adwords-works">ad auction</a> – yikes.</p>
<p>There are always measures you can take to avoid these situations if you decide that you want to test the new keywords at least for a short period of time. There’s the obvious “increase your daily budget,” but that’s not always wise if you want to maintain profitability and strong return on ad spend, or if you simply don’t have the extra money to spend. You can also think about reducing your keyword bids, to allow some flex room within your campaign’s daily budget, but this is also risky. Reducing bids will help you free up your budget a bit, but you could also risk losing out on your competitive ad rank.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/too-many-keywords-in-ppc-1.png" alt="Too many AdWords keywords play this game" width="538" height="275" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Reducing keyword bids is definitely a gamble, just ask Professor Moriarty.</em></p>
<h2>#3. It’s just plain difficult to maintain a large account</h2>
<p>Managing your Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords) account is a time-consuming process, regardless of its size. Think of all of the tasks that go into a well-maintained account. Optimizing ad copy, adding negatives, and maintaining bidding and budgets are just a few things you should consistently be doing in your account. Tacking on more and more keywords just compounds all of that. Eventually, things will start to fall through the cracks and your account will suffer for it.</p>
<h2>It’s A-OK to test new keywords though!</h2>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, it’s a good practice to test new keywords. But it’s important to maintain a solid balance of keywords in your campaigns. <strong>When you add new keywords, remove some underperforming ones to make room for the new ones.</strong> This will allow you to test new keywords without having to increase your budget if you aren’t in a position to do so.</p>
<p>One of the best resources for identifying keyword opportunities is your <strong>search query data</strong>. While standard keyword research tools can definitely be helpful, your search query data provides more accurate insight as to what you can expect from your potential new keywords. Keyword research tools can give you estimates like average CPC, total cost, and search volume, but your search query data will give you the actual CPC, cost, and volume for that keyword opportunity, among other metrics. Check out my colleague Phil Kowalski’s blog post for more detailed <a href="/blog/ws/2013/02/20/search-query-filters">search query report strategy</a>.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/too-many-keywords-80-20-1.jpg" alt="Too many AdWords keywords Pareto principle" width="450" height="252" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>The 80/20 rule: it never fails</em></p>
<p>One way I like to approach my keyword list is by using <a href="/blog/ws/2013/08/21/pareto-principle-primer">the 80/20 rule</a>. For those of you who aren’t familiar with the rule, it basically states that roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. Translated to your PPC account, <strong>roughly 80% of your results will come from roughly 20% of your keyword list</strong>. So you can add keywords and more keywords, but at the end of the day you are simply still going to get your results from roughly 1/5 of your keywords. So while testing keywords is definitely a healthy practice, remember that less is more when it comes to your keyword list.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many times I have seen instances where clients pause keywords because they aren’t generating click or impression volume. While pausing is certainly one method for acting on low-performing keywords, I typically recommend pausing only as a last resort. There is plenty to consider when it comes to diagnosing why a keyword isn’t generating volume, and one often overlooked, yet informative metric is <strong>impression share</strong>.</p>
<p>Impression share is the number of impressions you&#8217;ve received divided by the estimated number of impressions you were eligible to receive. Eligibility is based on your current ads&#8217; targeting settings, approval statuses, bids, and Quality Scores. You can view impression share data at the campaign, ad group and keyword levels.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ready to find out why you&#8217;re losing impression share to your competitors? <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Get your free Google Ads performance grade and start optimizing today</a>!</strong></em></p>
<h2>Types of Impression Share in Google Ads</h2>
<p>There is more to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/07/impression-share">impression share</a> than just a simple number; there are different facets that you can use to get an even greater depth of analysis. The different breakdowns for impression share are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Search impression share</strong> – your impression share strictly for impressions generated through the Search Network.</li>
<li><strong>Display impression share</strong> – your impression share strictly for impressions generated through the Display Network.</li>
<li><strong>Search lost impression share (budget)</strong> – the percentage of impressions you lost out on for the Search Network due to an <a href="/blog/ws/2013/06/19/google-adwords-limited-by-budget">insufficient budget</a> (this is available at the campaign level only).</li>
<li><strong>Display lost impression share (budget)</strong> – the percentage of impressions you lost out on for the Display Network due to an insufficient budget (this is available at the campaign level only).</li>
<li><strong>Search lost impression share (rank)</strong> – the percentage of impressions you lost out on for the Search Network due to low <a href="/blog/ws/2013/10/24/adwords-ad-rank-algorithm">ad rank</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Display lost impression share (rank)</strong> – the percentage of impressions you lost out on for the Display Network due to low ad rank.</li>
<li><strong>Search exact match impression share</strong> – your impression share from the Search Network for search queries that matched your keywords exactly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Impression share is important because it can give you a great indication of why a keyword may not be performing. Based on the data breakdowns mentioned above, you can use it to identify if your keywords aren’t performing due to bidding or budget-related issues, which are two important items to keep in mind when assessing performance.</p>
<p>If your keyword bids are too low, you might risk your ads not appearing on the first page, which may lead to missed opportunities for impressions, clicks, and even conversions. Ensuring that your bids are high enough that your ads are appearing in competitive positions will greatly improve your chances of capturing impressions and clicks, and generating traffic to your site. You will definitely want to use this metric in conjunction with the average position of your keywords. You may notice that the average position for your keywords is high, but that your impression share is low. This can tell you that when your ads appear, they appear in high positions, but because your impression share is low, those ads aren’t getting as much exposure as they could be in those high positions.</p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, Google will stop displaying your ads for the day once your daily budget is exhausted. If your campaigns have a low daily budget, and that budget limit is reached early in the day, your ads will not be shown later in the day.  So again, your ads may be generating impressions for you, but they can only generate those impressions for as long as your budget can allow for. Increasing your budget can allow Google to run your ads more frequently throughout the day, and allow you to increase that impression share.</p>

<h2>How to Improve Your Google Ads Impression Share</h2>
<p>Take a look at the impression section of the WordStream dashboard graph for a client I have been working with. When they signed onto WordStream at the beginning of September, their impression count was 12,839. The client was focused on how exactly they could improve that impression share, so we worked together to examine their metrics and construct a plan of action. As all things in the PPC world, the improvement didn’t happen overnight, but within just a couple of weeks, their impression level jumped up to 38,331 – that’s almost a 200% increase.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-adwords-impression-share-data-compressor-1.png" alt="Quality Score Impression Share" width="1452" height="603" /></div>
<p>So as you can see, impression share can be improved, using the techniques we have discussed. There are also some additional strategies you can use to increase your impression share:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adjust geo-targeting settings</strong> – If you decrease or restrict your location settings, you may see a spike in impression share. Targeting one specific location or area only will allow you to focus all efforts on that one area, and allow you more control over a specific target. While you will be serving your ads to a smaller area in general, you can take steps to ensure your ad is shown to as much of that area as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Improve your ad quality</strong> – As mentioned earlier, ad quality can also have an impact on impression share. If you can take steps to <a href="/blog/ws/2012/09/06/10-tips-writing-better-ppc-text-ads">improve your PPC ads</a>, then Google will display those ads more frequently by virtue of quality score. Try improving your ad text by making it as specific and relevant as possible to the keywords in their respective ad groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find impression share under the Columns button in Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords). You will want to choose “customize columns,” then “competitive metrics,” where you will find all of the different impression share metrics (again, don’t forget that lost impression share due to budget is only available on the campaign level).</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/impression-share-select-metrics-compressor-1.png" alt="Impression Share Quality Score" width="919" height="708" /></div>
<p>Impression share can really give you a great indication of how you can act on low-performing keywords. Whether it is increasing<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/19/bids-versus-budget"> bids or daily budget</a>, improving the overall quality of your ad and keywords, or using search terms to identify new keywords and negatives, you have many options for improvement before considering pausing a keyword. If you have questions about how to interpret impression share, leave a comment or reach out to your Customer Success rep.</p>

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/first-position-adwords-1.jpg" alt="Best Ad Position" width="399" height="400" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>A common assumption about paid search is that position #1 is the ultimate goal. Advertisers clamber over each other to ensure their ads make it into the top position, because they think that’s what’s necessary to be successful for their campaigns.</p>
<p>However, I’d like to go on the record and make a bold statement: <strong>Position #1 isn’t always going to be the best ad position for your business</strong>. Yes, while position #1 certainly can’t hurt from an impression/visibility standpoint, it might not be the optimal position from a conversion/ROI standpoint. <a href="/blog/ws/2011/11/16/how-adwords-works">Google’s bid auction</a> ensures that the higher you bid, the more likely you are to appear in a higher position. (Notice I said <em>more likely</em>, not guaranteed – the <a href="/blog/ws/2013/03/26/google-quality-score">Quality Score system offers discounts</a> for relevance.) But, are you bidding (and ultimately paying) too much to appear in those premium positions? It’s possible. That’s why shooting for position #1 isn’t always the best strategy.</p>
<p>If your business is a mom and pop store selling hardware supplies, and your competition is a big corporation like Home Depot or Lowe’s, chances are they have a much larger wallet and can easily bid as high as you without even breaking a sweat. You don’t want to exhaust your budget trying to compete with the big kids – you’ll never turn a profit!</p>
<p>Just because your ads aren’t appearing in position #1, doesn’t mean they aren’t being clicked on or that potential customers aren’t coming to your website and considering your products or services. Remember that the top of the search results page contains three ad positions, so even if your ads have an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/14/goodbye-average-position">average position</a> of 2 or 3, your ads will more than likely receive clicks and you will generate website traffic. Even if your ads appear in position 4 or 5, they will still be close to the top of the search results page; on the side of the search results page. So there is a solid chance your ads will be seen. People using paid search are typically in more of a research stage, so they are probably going to click on more than one ad before making any serious purchase decisions.</p>
<p>(<strong>More:</strong> <a href="/blog/ws/2013/02/22/click-through-rate-by-ad-position">When Is 2% Not a Good CTR? The Relationship of Click-Through Rate &amp; Ad Position</a>)</p>
<p>Something else to keep in mind is the industry that you are advertising in. The more competitive the industry, <a href="/blog/ws/2011/07/18/most-expensive-google-adwords-keywords">the more expensive the clicks will be</a> (think of the insurance or legal industry). This goes back to my point just above about shopping around. You can feel pretty confident that if your ads are in positions 3, 4, or even 5 in a competitive industry, they will be clicked on.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it comes down to maintaining and hopefully growing your profitability. You don’t want to bid too much, to the point where your ROI is being negatively affected. Only you know where that line is though. It’s important to play around with positioning. If your ads are in a position that is providing profitability, but you still have some budget to spare, try increasing your bids a bit to land in a higher position. Conversely, if you can spend more, but are not seeing the desired ROI, trying decreasing your max CPC bids.</p>
<p>If you are unsure how much to adjust your max CPC bids by, start with 25%. As with any change in paid search, the adjustment should be relatively small, for the sake of monitoring; this applies for <a href="/blog/ws/2013/04/09/combined-bid-adjustments">bid adjustments</a> as well. Something else to keep in mind is that you can view the first page bid estimate and the top of page bid estimate for each of your keywords. This will also give you an idea as to how much you need to bid for your ads to appear in the desired position of the search results page.</p>
<p>It all comes down to defining the point at which you will become profitable or not.</p>
