										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A paid media strategy is like any recipe. You have the freedom to customize different ingredients to your liking, but forget one key ingredient and the whole outcome is impacted&#8230;</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cookies-without-baking-soda.png" alt="cookies missing baking soda" width="388" height="268" class="aligncenter wp-image-56748" /></p>
<p>In this post, I&#8217;m going to cover the six essential ingredients you need in your paid media strategy this year if you want to avoid failure. They include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Review and reset benchmarks</li>
<li>Build a first-party-first strategy</li>
<li>Stay on top of advanced tracking technology</li>
<li>Test more paid media channels</li>
<li>Be a steward of automation</li>
<li>Master responsive search ads</li>
</ol>
<h2>The 6 essentials of a strong paid media strategy</h2>
<p>If 2020 was the beginning of what seems like an eternity of “unprecedented times” and 2021 was the year of big shakeups, there’s no telling what&#8217;s in store for 2022. But based on the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/13/digital-marketing-trends-2022"> marketing trends so far</a>, here are the six ingredients we know you&#8217;ll need.</p>
<h3>1. Review &amp; reset benchmarks</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s a best practice to review benchmarks and set goals on a regular basis, sure. But it&#8217;s time to look beyond the recurring analysis that we frequently do to monitor campaign performance and do it at a macro level.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, 2020 was the beginning of what seems like unending “unprecedented times” in the sense that most things are still not quite back to normal. Most of us have found a “new normal,” to use another cliché, and advertisers have trudged forward, but many businesses’ purchaser trends have changed over the past few years.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/paid-media-strategy-consumer-changes.png" alt="paid media strategy - consumer behavior COVID chart" width="563" height="428" class="aligncenter wp-image-56741" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/paid-media-strategy-consumer-changes.png 563w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/paid-media-strategy-consumer-changes-480x365.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 563px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/us-consumer-spending-after-covid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>With new variants on the rise, we could see another totally unique year or we might see trends that resemble prior years, whether that be 2021 or pre-COVID times. The reality is that most of us do not yet know what to expect, so we make use of the data that we have and we revisit it frequently.</p>
<p>This year, advertisers need to seek out firmer, more established trends. This will be a year of revisiting what we thought we knew vs. what we saw in 2020 and 2021, while adding external annotations, to try to project what to expect on a go-forward basis.</p>
<h3>How to do it</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conduct quarterly reviews. </strong>This doesn’t mean you’re off the hook with weekly <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/07/ppc-reporting">PPC reporting</a>. You should be doing that too. But at the end of each quarter you should take a look at the broader trends going on with your performance and identify anything to improve, harness, or nix for the quarter ahead.</li>
<li><strong>Visualize your data. </strong>Tools like Google Data Studio can help you achieve a better and more actionable understanding of your performance. <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/gallery?category=marketing&amp;search=google%20ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Data Studio offers pre-made templates</a> to choose from, and you can find more in our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/10/free-google-ads-tools">round-up of free Google Ads tools</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Use benchmarks. </strong>In addition to comparing against your own benchmarks, check your performance against industry benchmarks to make sure you’re staying competitive.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/paid-media-strategy-benchmarks.png" alt="paid media strategy - benchmark data example" width="397" height="497" class="aligncenter wp-image-56740" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/13/search-advertising-benchmarks">Check out our latest search advertising benchmarks here.</a></p>
<h3>2. Build a first-party-first strategy</h3>
<p>The goal to eradicate third-party cookies across all browsers is clear, so big tracking and targeting changes are on the horizon. Because of this, there’s no doubt there is a high premium on first-party data.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/zero-first-second-third-party-data.png" alt="zero, frist, second, third-party data" width="720" height="467" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57202" /></p>
<h3>How to do it</h3>
<p>To <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/12/first-party-data">collect more first-party data</a> from your audience, follow these tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/15/lead-magnet-ideas"><strong>lead magnets</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Offer free guides, free tools, and free consultations on your website—anything of enough value that your relevant visitors will fill out a form for.</li>
<li><strong>Run lead form ads. </strong>Try out <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/26/generate-leads-facebook-ads-ios14">Facebook lead ads</a> or Google lead form extensions. You can also customize your questions to collect the information you need.</li>
<li><strong>Have a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/13/content-marketing-strategy">content strategy</a>. </strong>Not only can useful content be repurposed into all kinds of lead magnets (guides, webinars, checklists, etc.) but consistently being the go-to resource for your audience builds trust, and the more trusted you are, the more information your audience members will be willing to share with you about themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/paid-media-strategy-first-party-data-source-list.png" alt="" width="720" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56743" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/paid-media-strategy-first-party-data-source-list.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/paid-media-strategy-first-party-data-source-list-480x267.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>3. Stay on top of advanced tracking technology</h3>
<p>For similar reasons, it&#8217;s also imperative that you increase your investment in tracking technology—technology that gives you access to the data you need to propel you ad strategies and report on their effectiveness, but that also maintains the privacy of the prospects being targeted.</p>
<p>Facebook <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/privacy-enhancing-technologies-and-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it would be investing in a multi-year initiative focused on privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) in collaboration with other organizations including the Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media (PRAM), the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), and World Federation of Advertisers (WFA). One such technology is private lift measurement, which it has been testing and plans to roll it out to advertisers this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/privacy-enhancing-technologies-and-ads/"><em><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/paid-media-strategy-privacy-enhancing-technologies.png" alt="paid media strategy - privacy-enhancing technologies" width="720" height="405" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56744" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/paid-media-strategy-privacy-enhancing-technologies.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/paid-media-strategy-privacy-enhancing-technologies-480x270.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/privacy-enhancing-technologies-and-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>Facebook is calling on the industry to work together, collaboratively, noting that it will only work if there is a shared set of standards. It has open-sourced its framework for private computation to allow any developer to create privacy-centric measurement products.</p>
<p>I tend to agree with Facebook that it would likely benefit most parties to have a shared set of standards versus a sea of different tracking mechanisms and standards between different devices, browsers, and ad platforms. The crossover with those three areas gets messy quickly—not to mention the different legislation by geography.</p>
<p>Facebook is not the only large company doing its due diligence, of course. We are seeing it with Google’s Topics API and Microsoft’s Parakeet, as well.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/google-topics-api-flowchart.jpg" alt="google topics api - flowchart of topic assignment process" width="720" height="247" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56560" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/google-topics-api-flowchart.jpg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/google-topics-api-flowchart-480x165.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Image source<a href="https://www.tremplin-numerique.org/en/microsoft-prefers-their-parakeet-to-google-floc"></a></p>
<p>And I anticipate other companies to have their own testing in motion. It will be really interesting to see what lies in store for us on this front.</p>
<h3>How to do it</h3>
<p>Unless you’re a Facebook or Google Developer, there’s not a whole lot to do here except stay informed on what’s being built. However, you can start adopting tools that have already been made available to us.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Implement the Facebook Conversions API:</strong> The power of the Facebook Pixel is dwindling. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/06/facebook-conversions-api">Start using the Facebook CAPI</a> now to minimize gaps in your reporting.</li>
<li><strong>Import your offline conversions: </strong><a href="https://ocihelper.withgoogle.com/">Google’s OCI helper tool</a> walks you through the process of getting your offline conversion data into Google Ads so you can find similar, high quality leads. Provide your information and it will put together a customized implementation plan with a progress dashboard and everything.</li>
<li><strong>Set up Google ads enhanced conversions:</strong> This is Google’s way of providing cross-device conversion tracking without cookies. You can set it up manually with Google Tag Manager or sitewide tagging, or via API. Learn how it works <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/10/google-ads-updates">in our coverage here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-enhanced-conversions.png" alt="best marketing strategies 2022 - how enhanced conversions work in google ads" width="720" height="449" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55689" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-enhanced-conversions.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/best-marketing-strategies-2022-enhanced-conversions-480x299.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>4. Test more paid media channels</h3>
<p>Events of 2020 and 2021 created instances where certain platforms either underperformed or exceedingly overperformed most benchmarks. When those opportunities or issues arise, the advertisers that are prepared to take control of their circumstances are those that have already been proactively testing multiple channels.</p>
<p>Single-platform advertisers, on the other hand, or advertisers that have the majority of their eggs in one bucket, struggle to be agile. In instances where that platform does not perform as well as it used to, it is hard to heavily reinvest elsewhere until you have had a chance to test and gather data.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/paid-media-strategy-facebook-outage.png" alt="paid media strategy - facebook outage" width="1055" height="286" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56746" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/paid-media-strategy-facebook-outage.png 1055w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/paid-media-strategy-facebook-outage-980x266.png 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/paid-media-strategy-facebook-outage-480x130.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1055px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Likewise, if another platform is suddenly performing really well, it is hard for advertisers to fully capitalize on it without knowing exactly <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/13/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-world">which targeting options will perform well</a>.</p>
<p>For example, with many advertisers scaling back budgets in the wake of COVID in 2020 while social usage was increasing at the same time, CPMs dropped significantly for advertisers that stayed the course <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/11/lower-facebook-ads-cpm">(how to combat rising CPMs here)</a>. It was tough for advertisers that had not previously had a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-increase-social-media-presence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social presence</a> to determine whether they should transition budget or stay in their current channels, because they did not have a benchmark.</p>
<blockquote><p>Having a diverse media mix makes advertisers more nimble and tougher to disrupt, even in the wake of big changes.</p></blockquote>
<h3>How to do it</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to create a strong <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/10/15/multi-channel-marketing">cross-channel marketing</a> strategy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Always be testing out new <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-channels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing channels</a>.</strong> You don’t have to invest heavily in them, but make sure you know how they work for your business, which offers perform best on them, and what your benchmarks are so that should you need to fall back on it, you won’t be upstream without a battle.</li>
<li><strong>Employ a mix of paid and organic strategies.</strong> Head to our list of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/18/best-marketing-strategies">19 best marketing strategies for 2022</a> and you should be covered.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t promote the same offer on every channel. </strong>This is one of our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/24/cross-channel-marketing-mistakes">cross-channel marketing mistakes</a>. Find out what offers do best on which channel and then harness that for your strategy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Be a steward of automation</h3>
<p>Not unlike tracking changes, there has been a clear and concerted effort to move advertisers into more automation. This is evidenced with the rollout of Performance Max, an ongoing push to automated bidding, and a push toward <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/01/google-ads-auto-applied-recommendations">auto-applied account changes</a> from both Google <a href="https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/60121/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and Bing</a>, where the platforms will automatically make updates—unless advertisers opt out.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-ads-auto-applied-recommendations-list-of-recs-1.png" alt="paid media strategy - google auto applied recommendations list" width="936" height="846" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8187" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-ads-auto-applied-recommendations-list-of-recs-1.png 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-ads-auto-applied-recommendations-list-of-recs-1-480x434.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Not to mention changes to Google Partner standards requiring premier partners to achieve a minimum of a 70% optimization score, which is a well-intentioned-but-mostly-meaningless score that truly only measures whether or not you mindlessly implement Google’s (often self-serving) suggestions. This change was scheduled to roll out in 2020 but was pushed back in the midst of COVID, and is now officially set to roll out in 2022.</p>
<h3>How to do it</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Test.</strong> Personally, I have seen success in automated bidding strategies and Performance Max campaigns, when used in the right instances and at the right times. You have to test them and give them time, as they don’t always work right out of the gate.</li>
<li><strong>Become a steward of automation. </strong>Sometimes automation feels like a power struggle. Plus, the lack of visibility makes it hard to trust that something is working optimally. But it can be helpful in many cases. Find things that automation can do well and use it there to free up time on what you need to manage manually.</li>
<li><strong>Educate yourself. </strong>Of course, if you’re not familiar with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/04/google-ads-automation">Google Ads’ automation features</a>, get yourself up to speed! You can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/19/google-ads-automated-bidding">learn the pros and cons of every automated bidding strategy in Google here.</a></li>
<li><strong>Try out AI. </strong>Automation, machine learning, and AI all come hand-in-hand. Check out these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/15/ai-marketing"> practical examples of AI in marketing</a> to see where you can get started.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Becoming a steward of automation still takes less time than full manual implementation and can lead to better outcomes in many cases. It is not man (or woman) versus machine, but rather man and machine!</p></blockquote>
<h3>6. Master responsive search ads (RSAs)</h3>
<p>Last but not least, the Google Ads portion of your paid media strategy needs to include RSAs. Though advertisers can continue to use existing expanded text ads (ETAs), including pausing and reactivating existing ETAs, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/02/google-sunsetting-expanded-text-ads">new ETAs cannot be created after June 2022.</a></p>
<p>Many advertisers noticed Google giving precedence to RSAs over ETAs at auction time in 2021, so it did not come as a surprise to most when Google announced RSAs would become the only option for new ads in the future.</p>
<p>This also ties closely to the trend toward more automation (especially by Google) in 2021. Some advertisers have noted they do not find as great of performance with RSAs and so, it is no surprise that some have held off on fully jumping into RSAs. At this point, though, the transition is inevitable so it benefits advertisers to place a heavy focus on creating and improving RSAs to ensure that they are putting their best foot forward.</p>

<h3>How to do it:</h3>
<p>Start creating RSAs, of course! Use our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/10/responsive-search-ads">responsive search ad guide</a> and follow these tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Establish RSA benchmarks now: </strong>RSAs tend to have higher click-through rates than ETAs, but conversion performance varies. Get RSAs active in every ad group now so you can have clear expectations for what performance will look like after June.</li>
<li><strong>Diversify your copy: </strong>Each headline and description should be different so Google can mix and match. At least two headlines should include keywords and at least three should not include keywords.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t abandon ETAs! </strong>Your existing ETAs will still run after June 30, 2022, you just won&#8217;t be able to edit them. So test and create ETAs now that you can pause or unpause in the future.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="tag__text">If you’ve been using Facebook Ads for a while, you may be accustomed to frequent disapprovals—sometimes accurate, other times erroneous. If you’re new to Facebook Ads, it may be a lingering frustration, trying to understand what is approved and what isn’t.</div>
<div class="column">
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/facebook-ad-not-approved-meme.png" width="500" height="272" alt="facebook ad disapproval meme" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s advertising policies, with all its nuances, can be pretty overwhelming. But in this guide, we&#8217;re going to help you understand the Facebook ad approval process, how long it takes, and then share with you:</p>
<ul>
<li>What to do if your Facebook ad is not approved.</li>
<li>How to prevent, fix, or appeal a Facebook ad disapproval.</li>
<li>Common reasons for disapprovals.</li>
<li>What to do if your account is disabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read on to learn how to get your Facebook ads approved as quickly as possible.</p>
<h2>How long does it take for Facebook to approve an ad?</h2>
<p>This all depends on the content of your ad, your business category, and more. For some ads, it could take <strong>2-3 hours</strong>. For others, <strong>a day,</strong> and for others, especially in restricted categories, up to <strong>2-3 days</strong>.</p>
<p>This is because the Facebook ad review process is a mix of man (or woman!) and machine. Once you hit publish on your ad, it enters into an <strong>algorithmic review</strong> where a computer will look for the basics like image/text ratio, banned or prohibited content, improper grammar, broken links, and more.</p>
<p>During this stage, some ads get approved and published; some get sent back to the advertiser to edit; but many (<a href="https://www.leadpages.com/blog/facebook-ad-disapproved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60-70%</a>) move on to a <strong>manual review</strong> process.</p>
<p>In the manual review process, a person looks at the ad and assesses the content in terms of things like context, implications, and quality. From there, your ad can then either get published or rejected.</p>
<p>So this is why one ad can get approved in minutes while others take days.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/facebook-ad-review-kermit-meme.png" width="400" height="223" alt="facebook ad pending review meme" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<h2>Was your Facebook ad not approved? Here’s what to do</h2>
<p>If your Facebook ad gets disapproved, you’ll get a notification referencing which policy you violated, with a link to that policy, and then oftentimes a [very unhelpful] recommendation on how to fix it. (Like “Don’t violate this policy.”) Other times, it will be very vague.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/facebook-ad-not-approved-ad-cant-run.png" width="500" height="202" alt="facebook ad not approved - ad can't run: Update website URL(s) notification" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>Fortunately, most ads are disapproved for small details that you can easily edit and resubmit for a quick review and approval.</p>
<p>Be sure to read the policy carefully and then review your ad thoroughly. Then make your tweaks to the copy, targeting, images, etc. You’ll now have to wait for approval, which could take another day.</p>
<h2>How to appeal Facebook ad disapprovals</h2>
<p>If you are sure that the ad is absolutely following the policy and that edits won’t improve the likelihood of approval, you can appeal the disapproval and request another review.</p>
<p>To do this, select the ad that has been disapproved (unfortunately you can only select one at a time) and click the edit button.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/facebook-ad-not-approved-edit.png" width="720" height="254" alt="facebook ad not approved: edit button" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>At the top right-hand side of the screen, just above the ad preview, you should see the option to click “Request Review”. A popup will appear where you will confirm your request for a second review (by a human).</p>
<p>In the “Describe your problem” section, keep it concise. No need for an essay! Reference the exact rule you got dinged for and then make your argument. For example, “This ad does not violate the policy of _____. It actually ____ and contains ___ to show ____. Please review, thank you.”</p>
<p>Keep in mind that<strong> you can only appeal an ad once for the same disapproval,</strong> so do a thorough check to make sure it truly does not violate the policy in any way.</p>

<h2>How to prevent or fix a Facebook ad disapproval</h2>
<p>You&#8217;ve followed all our <a href="/blog/ws/2014/01/30/facebook-advertising-tips">Facebook advertising </a>tips and even put some of our <a href="/blog/ws/2021/11/11/facebook-advertising-strategies">post iOS strategies</a> in place. You want your ad up and running stat! Use these general rules of thumb to save time and increase the likelihood of your ad being approved as quickly as possible.</p>
<h3>1. Keep an eye out for disapprovals</h3>
<p>The tricky thing with Facebook ad disapprovals is that between email addresses connected to the account and delays in the notification center, they can sometimes be easy to miss. So make it a habit of checking for disapprovals “manually” using Ads Manager or Facebook Business Suite.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/facebook-ad-rejected-business-manager.png" width="600" height="396" alt="facebook ad rejection in business manager notification center" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://revive.social/facebook-ads-rejected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<h3>2. Read the policy carefully</h3>
<p>If your Facebook ad is rejected, make sure to read the broken policy in full before resubmitting for approval—there are nuances to consider and there are humans reviewing your ad!</p>
<h3>3. Play it safe</h3>
<p>Yes, being bold and different is one way to <a href="/blog/ws/2021/07/06/how-to-write-copy-that-sells">write copy that sells</a>. But if you want to get your ad up fast, don’t take risks. If it has something that you sort of think might possibly be <em>potentially offensive</em>, not inclusive, or even erroneously disapproved, don’t try it.</p>
<h3>4. Check your ad copy quality&#8230;</h3>
<p>Sometimes, the more time you spend on a piece of content, the harder it is to identify mistakes. So if you double-check your ad and don&#8217;t see anything wrong with it, you should still have someone else review it just in case. Even better, run it through Grammarly for a contextual review.</p>
<h3>5. &#8230;and quantity</h3>
<p>Even though Facebook&#8217;s 20% text limit (and the tool to check for it) has been removed, it&#8217;s still a best practice to keep your text to a minimum. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/980593475366490?id=1240182842783684" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook talks about it here</a>. Social media feeds are largely visual, so you should let your imagery be the loudest. Check our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/29/best-facebook-ads">9 Tips to Write the Best Facebook Ads Ever</a> for more help with your copy.</p>
<h3>6. &#8230;<em>and</em> tone</h3>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s ad disapprovals can be quite nuanced—remember, a large portion of Facebook ads get reviewed by humans. So keep the &#8220;fine lines&#8221; in mind when you&#8217;re going for clever, bold, or compelling ads. Avoid being super detailed about personal attributes that could feel like an invasion of privacy to a user, or sarcasm that could accidentally be misunderstood.</p>
<h3>7. Target appropriately</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re in a restricted category (and even if you&#8217;re not), make sure you&#8217;re not targeting underage groups or other demographics or psychographics for whom your offering would be inappropriate.</p>
<h3>8. Check your landing pages</h3>
<p>If needed for your category, make sure your landing page includes your terms of service, a link to your privacy policy, and any other required information. Also, follow general <a href="/blog/ws/2020/01/15/landing-page-best-practices">landing page best </a>practices like continuity between ad and landing page, and keeping the copy clear, honest, and free of anything potentially misleading. And of course make sure the page link is not broken!</p>
<h3>9. Check mobile</h3>
<p>Landing page experience is a factor in the Facebook ad approval process, and it&#8217;s not uncommon to see accidental popups, glitches, or unexpected movements and shifts on mobile. So make sure to test your landing pages on mobile.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/facebook-ad-not-approved-non-functional-landing-page-URL.png" width="600" height="295" alt="facebook ad not approved: website URL doesn't comply notification" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<h3>10. Boost posts</h3>
<p>For those in the restricted category, you could try <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/15/facebook-sponsored-posts">boosted posts</a>. If the post is informative rather than commercial, it could get approved.</p>
<h2>Why was your Facebook ad not approved? Common reasons</h2>
<p>No matter your industry or what you are promoting, your campaigns and ads AND landing pages must follow the below guidelines. But please note that <strong>this is a very abridged list</strong>, intended for general understanding only. <strong>Please refer to </strong><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/policies/ads/">Facebook’s official ad policy page</a></strong> for exact details.</p>
<h3>Standard policy violations</h3>
<p>This is just the term we’re using to cover the policies that you would expect. This includes content that contains profanity or infringes on third parties (think trademarks and copyright); or that is discriminating, controversial, violent, disrespectful, unexpected, disruptive, irrelevant, poor quality, exploitative, inaccurate, misleading, or dishonest.</p>
<p>Think golden rule here, and use common sense to maintain respect, integrity, and authenticity with your ads.</p>
<h3>Personal attributes</h3>
<p>Personal attributes here refers to race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, financial status, physical abilities, mental or physical health, income, and (much) more. Your content cannot make implications about any of these attributes, nor can you ask for information like this in your<a href="/blog/ws/2018/09/26/facebook-lead-ads"> lead ads. </a></p>
<p>Imagine how creeped out you might be if an ad highlighted a medical condition that you were getting treated for? It would feel so intrusive! So it’s important that advertisers don’t exploit any personal attributes that they might have access to.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/facebook-ad-not-approved-personal-attributes-income.png" width="600" height="278" alt="facebook ad can't run notification due to personal attributes policy" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<h3>Personal health</h3>
<p>This policy restricts advertisers from using “before-and-after” images or images that contain unexpected or unlikely results. Ads also must not attempt to generate negative self-perception in order to promote healthcare, diet, or weight loss products.</p>
<h3>Non-functional landing page</h3>
<p>This could mean your page is 404ing, has disruptive or malfunctioning popups, or any element that makes it difficult for a user to navigate away from the page.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/facebook-ad-disapprovals-non-functioning-landing-page.png" width="720" height="238" alt="facebook ad not approved-non-functional landing page notification" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<h3>Nonexistent functionality</h3>
<p>Don’t fake it. Your ads or landing pages can’t have elements that look like clickable buttons, checkboxes, and other functionalities that don’t actually work. Often ads that are disapproved for this policy need some small tweaks before they’ll be eligible to run.</p>
<h3>Circumventing systems</h3>
<p>A policy to prevent circumventing policies! No tactics or tricks, like disguising content, intended to circumvent Facebook’s ad review process.</p>
<p>I have found that this policy is often the cause of incorrect ad disapprovals. If you break this policy and truly haven’t intended to bypass review processes, all you can do is request an appeal!</p>
<h3>Using Facebook brand assets</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/a/ad-review-process" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a>, this is one of the most common reasons for disapproval (in addition to age-restricted material and too much text in the image).</p>
<p>If you mention Facebook or Instagram, there are specific rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can’t imply endorsement from Facebook, Instagram, or any other entity owned by Facebook.</li>
<li>You can&#8217;t mention them in a way that represents the brand more dominantly than the business or product itself.</li>
<li>Platform and interface screenshots must be accurate and honest.</li>
<li>You can&#8217;t manipulate logos or trademarked terms or interface appearance.</li>
</ul>

<ul></ul>
<h2>Prohibited and restricted categories</h2>
<p>Of course, there are prohibited and restricted business categories, most of which are common sense. Read on for a<strong> general overview</strong>, but again, be sure to check the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policies/ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full policy details here </a>for exact terminology and specifics of every rule.</p>
<h3>Prohibited categories</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, if your business falls into one of the prohibited categories, you won’t be able to use the Facebook Ads platform.</p>
<p>Some of the more obvious categories are body parts, weapons, illegal products or services, tobacco, recreational drugs, malware, or deceitful practices.</p>
<p>Some that you may not be aware of include payday loans, paycheck advances, bail bonds as well as vaccine discouragement, multi-level marketing schemes or get rich quick opportunities.</p>
<h3>Restricted categories</h3>
<p>These categories are eligible to be advertised but have special requirements and extra restrictions:</p>
<p>Alcohol, branded content, dating services, health and medicine, cryptocurrency, online gambling, politics and social issues, cosmetic procedures, finance and insurance, subscription services.</p>
<p>For many of these, you’ll have to request permission with a specific form and then there will be certain requirements for your ads or landing pages. For example, displaying your terms and conditions, sometimes with a check box, linking to your privacy policy, and making sure important details are clear and prominent.</p>
<p>Here are some of the forms for these categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online pharmacies, telehealth, and prescriptions must obtain<a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/794928850913577" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> written permission here</a>.</li>
<li>Addiction centers <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/1912438085452884" target="_blank" rel="noopener">must use this form</a>.</li>
<li>Cryptocurrency advertisers <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2314096455500556?id=595195347635322">can request approval here.</a></li>
<li>Online gambling and gaming advertisers require <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/691814950897009" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written permission in advance</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/facebook-ad-not-approved-cryptocurrency-policy.png" width="600" height="290" alt="facebook ad disapproval due to cryptocurrency policy" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<h2>What to do for repeated or large volumes of Facebook ad disapprovals</h2>
<p>It’s important to stay on top of ad rejections, not only for the obvious reasons, but also because they signal to Facebook whether your account maintains a good standing.</p>
<p>When ads are being rejected in bulk, I recommend reaching out to support when several ads are disapproved at once. The appeal process must happen one single ad at a time and therefore, it can be really difficult to manage for large volumes of ads. Normally, if you open a chat with support, you can share the campaign ID and request that they review all disapproved ads in the campaign.</p>
<p>I’ve unfortunately also had clients that had ads regularly rejected, erroneously. It got to the point that we would automatically reach out to support as soon as new campaigns or ads were activated. I wish there were a better way but unfortunately, that was the best process that I’ve found.</p>
<h2>What to do if your Facebook advertising account is disabled</h2>
<p>When your Facebook Ads account is disabled, it’s easy to feel a bit helpless. Often there aren’t many reasons given for the disablement. Unfortunately, if you reach out to support, they typically are not allowed to discuss disabled ad accounts or give any details as to why your account has been disabled.</p>
<p>If your account has repeatedly broken the policies above, there’s a good chance that it will not be reinstated, but accounts are often disabled by mistake. In fact, a few years ago, Facebook had a glitch wherein they disabled a large volume of ad accounts over the course of a few days.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if your account was disabled by mistake, your only recourse is to request a review. You can do this by visiting the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/accountquality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Account Quality page</a> within your account. From there, you’ll be able to follow the steps to request a review.</p>
<h2>What to do if your Facebook user login is restricted from advertising</h2>
<p>Separate from ad account disablements, individual user login accounts can also be restricted from advertising. This isn’t any less stressful than advertising account disablements, unfortunately.</p>
<p>When it comes to support, well, it’s even tougher to get support for individual user logins – likely because individual user logins aren’t directly tied to revenue, in the platform’s eyes.</p>
<p>Likewise with Ad Account restrictions, if a user is seen as having repeatedly broken policies, there’s a good likelihood that that user won’t be reinstated with advertising capabilities.</p>
<p>However, if the account was erroneously restricted, it is likely that it will be reinstated after a review. To request a review, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/accountquality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visit the account quality page and request a review</a>.</p>
<p>While losing advertising access isn’t common, it also isn’t *uncommon*, so it is important to be prepared. I bring this up because advertisers should be aware of this. If there are no other users on the account, or especially if there are no other admins, it could mean no one has access (or no one has administrative access) to an ad account that is currently running. Yes, it has happened and no, Facebook support doesn’t work any harder to help you regain access in these instances.</p>
<p>While you shouldn’t be required to have multiple admins on your ad account, it should be considered a best practice in the sense that users are sometimes restricted from advertising erroneously frequently enough for this to be a real issue.</p>
<h2>How to get your Facebook ads approved fast [recap]</h2>
<p>Again, &#8220;fast&#8221; is relative. Fast for an ad in a restricted category might mean two days instead of three, while in other categories or circumstances, it could mean less than an hour. Either way, here are the tips and best practices to get your Facebook ad approval as soon as possible:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check regularly for disapprovals.</li>
<li>Read the policy you violated carefully.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t take risks with ads you want published fast.</li>
<li>Proofread your ad copy.</li>
<li>Minimize text in images.</li>
<li>Keep your tone friendly.</li>
<li>Target appropriately.</li>
<li>Check your landing pages for all requirements.</li>
<li>Make sure your ad is mobile-optimized.</li>
<li>Try boosting posts if you&#8217;re in a prohibited or restricted category.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>As of January 2022, FLoC is no more! Learn more in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/27/google-topics-api">our coverage on its replacement, Topics API</a>.</em></p>
<p>With a focus on a more private browsing experience, Google has announced that it will deprecate third-party cookies. Not long after, it announced the concept of Federated Learning of Cohorts, or FLoC, to create solutions and alternatives for advertisers while maintaining privacy for users. The concept of FLoC isn&#8217;t easy to grasp, and it has raised a lot of questions and concerns.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0ef914e1-6bcd-4343-b656-eed2973eaf2f" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">

</article>
</div>
<p>So in this post, I&#8217;m going to help you understand what FLoC means for advertisers by answering seven key questions and the goal of this post is to help answer some of those common questions. If you’ve ever wondered what FLoC is, how it will work, or why it was developed, this post is for you. You&#8217;re going to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>What Google FLoC is and how it relates to third-party cookies.</li>
<li>How FLoC works and why it&#8217;s gotten backlash.</li>
<li>What you can do to stay on top of advertising in a cookieless world.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1. What is Google FLoC?</h2>
<p>FLoC stands for Federated Learning of Cohorts. Currently, Google plans to roll out FLoC as a means to bridge the gaps in targeting and tracking that advertisers will face from the deprecation of third-party cookies.</p>
<h2>2. What are third-party cookies?</h2>
<p>To understand third-party cookies, let’s compare them to first-party cookies.</p>
<h3>First party cookies</h3>
<p>First-party cookies track the direct engagements with an organization.</p>
<p>For example, adding something to the cart. This would be like bringing something to the cashier – there is no way to execute that action without the organization knowing that you want to purchase something from them. First-party cookies are not on the chopping block currently.</p>
<h3>Third-party cookies</h3>
<p>Third-party cookies store data about a consumer’s journey as they surf the web.</p>
<p>This would be like if you left one store and then you walked through the mall to other stores and they kept track of each store that you visited (and maybe even showed up to remind you that you had not completed your transaction at their store).</p>

<p>So while first-party cookies capture data about a person’s engagement with your own site (login information, purchase history, items in cart, etc.), third-party cookies capture data about a user on *other* websites.</p>
<p>Many of the most common PPC practices are powered by third-party cookies, such as:</p>
<ul>

<h2>3. Why are third-party cookies going away?</h2>
<p>The goal of deprecating these cookies is to keep browsing data with the user. In recent years, the topic of privacy has been at the forefront of tech conversations and, well, lawsuits and legislation.</p>
<p>It is no secret that tech companies have lost some trust from consumers because of the way that data is handled and monetized.</p>

<p>Google’s move toward a cookieless future is with the goal of creating an experience that prioritizes privacy.</p>
<h2>4. But isn’t FLoC just another way to track users?</h2>
<p>You might be wondering, “So Amy, if the goal is to protect user data, then why is Google introducing a different way to track users?” Great question!</p>
<h3>The point is to be able to continue targeting</h3>
<p>Google’s goal with the creation of FLoC was to create something that advertisers could use to define targeting options in the absence of third-party cookies.</p>
<h3>Because other platforms will inevitably come up with solutions</h3>
<p>Of course, with Google owning a huge ad network, it behooves them to provide new solutions to replace those that would be impacted by the deprecation of third-party cookies. However, it would also be undeniable to anticipate that, in the absence of other options, advertisers or advertising platforms would look for ways to create their own tracking systems.</p>
<h3>And Google is trying to avoid invasive tracking</h3>
<p>Google has repeatedly condemned the idea of using digital fingerprinting to track users. Digital fingerprinting is the use of specific information gleaned from your browsing data such as information about the device and browser that you are using in order to better understand your identity.</p>
<p>Learnings can include things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your IP address</li>
<li>Timestamps</li>
<li>Your browser plugins</li>
<li>Your timezone</li>
<li>Your location</li>
<li>Device information, and more.</li>
</ul>

<p>I tested my own digital fingerprint and I was found to be unique among other recent testers. Meaning that if this data were being used to fuel an ad network, out of the 200,000+ folks in their pool – my information appeared to be unique.  A little creepy, right?</p>

</div>
<p>The goal of FLoC is to circumvent the need for more invasive tracking, such as fingerprinting, while still offering publishers and advertisers a way to monetize and promote themselves respectively.</p>
<h2>5. So how does FLoC work?</h2>
<p>Instead of allowing various organizations access to user browsing data, the browsing data would be stored in that person’s individual browser.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each user would be assigned to a cohort, based upon their recent browsing history.</li>
<li>Again, that data would live within the browser.</li>
<li>Using an API, the browser would be able to feed that cohort to sites that the user visited.</li>
<li>But they would only receive the cohort identifier for the user and no further information about the user’s browsing history.</li>
<li>Users would be reassigned to cohorts each week based upon their recent browsing data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. What impact will FLoC have on advertisers?</h2>
<p>The impact that FLoC will have on advertisers is not entirely clear yet, but there are some things we know.</p>
<h3>Third-party audience creation will go away</h3>
<p>In early trials, Google claimed that FLoC performed similarly to existing third-party audiences, such as affinity audiences and <a href="/blog/ws/2014/06/17/in-market-audiences">in-market audiences</a>.</p>
<p>Google has not yet announced *exactly* what will go away once FLoC is rolled out but it is safe to say that the third-party audiences would be replaced with cohorts.</p>
<h3>We’ll lose some conversion tracking metrics</h3>
<p>Currently, there are elements of tracking that also rely on third-party cookies, such as <a href="/blog/ws/2010/03/25/view-through-conversion-tracking">view-through conversions</a>. Google has alluded to tests that they are running in order to improve tracking, which could include conversion modeling, to help bridge tracking gaps.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>How Google’s consent mode conversion modeling works. </em><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10548233?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>(Image source</em></a><em>)</em></p>
<h3>Targeting options will be limited</h3>
<p>It’s also important to keep in mind that FLoC lives in Chrome. In other words, there’s no way for Google to force other browsers to use FLoC and, in fact, pretty much all of the other browsers have already said that they won’t. This means that ad networks that have relied on third-party cookies will possibly be left to marry together data from different browsing sources to try to create targeting options for advertisers.</p>
<h2>7. Why is there so much pushback on FLoC?</h2>
<p>If you have heard of FLoC, you have probably also heard that it has received quite a bit of backlash.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="ee60dbca-1c77-4ac2-aaca-50e92b69a357" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-floc-backlash.png" alt="news reel of google floc backlash" typeof="foaf:Image" width="550" height="545" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>The main reason is because FLoC has some flaws that pose risks. For example:</p>
<h3>Organizations could combine FLoC data with digital fingerprinting</h3>
<p>The biggest flaw is that there’s nothing currently stopping someone from using the data FLoC combines in conjunction with the more evasive forms of tracking that it aims to circumvent.</p>
<p>For example: fingerprinting is currently acknowledged as one of the most invasive digital tracking mechanisms. Now, imagine if an organization were able to develop a digital fingerprint for a user and then combine it with a cohort provided by FLoC. Now they have that much more information helping them to isolate individuals with data, in a way that could create an experience that was even less private than current standards.</p>
<h3>Opportunities for bias and discrimination</h3>
<p>Some organizations have raised concerns that this data could not only be too invasive but it could lead to opportunities for bias and discrimination. For example, targeting housing or credit ads toward only specific individuals and purposefully excluding others.</p>
<h3>It can bypass Google Ads policies</h3>
<p>For those of you out there who are familiar with <a href="/blog/ws/2021/06/23/google-ads-disapprovals">Google Ads disapprovals</a>, you may be thinking, “Well, they couldn’t do that anyway because that would break policy.” And you’d be right!</p>
<p>The problem is that FLoC lives within Chrome—not Google Ads—meaning it will be fueling targeting options for a host of ad networks, some of which might use the data in unethical ways. As a result, many large players in the tech industry have spoken out about the use of FLoC, including companies such as WordPress who proposed that sites should treat FLoC as a security concern.</p>
<h2>7. What should advertisers do to prepare?</h2>
<h3>Hone in on first-party data</h3>
<p>First things first (pun intended), advertisers should focus on <a href="/blog/ws/2021/04/12/first-party-data">building up their first-party data sets.</a> First-party data will be more valuable than ever. Drive email subscriptions, track site engagement, and build audiences. Here are some resources to help you with that:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2014/08/05/increase-email-signups">22 Tips on How to Get More Email Signups</a></li>

<li><a href="/blog/ws/2021/04/12/first-party-data">4 Ways to Collect Valuable First-Party Data in a Cookieless World</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Set up tagging</h3>
<p>If you haven’t already placed the Google Ads tag on your site, now would be a good time. The Google Ads tag is the tag that is used to track first-party data. For instance, many advertisers use this tag for <a href="/blog/ws/2021/05/24/google-ads-conversion-tracking">conversion tracking</a> and remarketing.</p>
<p>Even if you set up conversion tracking and audiences through an import, such as Google Analytics, Google still recommends placing the universal pixel on your site as well. To set up your tag:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Tools &amp; Settings &gt; Shared Library &gt; Audience Manager</li>
<li>On the left, click Audience Sources</li>
<li>Choose “Google Ads Tag” to set it up.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Collaborate in the Privacy Sandbox</h3>
<p>If you’re interested in contributing to discussions and testing, Google welcomes collaboration in the Privacy Sandbox.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there’s not much that advertisers can do to prepare besides staying abreast of the news and monitoring Google’s announcements and rollout schedules!</p>
<h2>Google FLoC and third-party cookies recap</h2>
<ul>
<li>Third-party cookies are used to track user behavior across the web and are going away by the end of 2023 (unless otherwise informed).</li>
<li>This impacts our ability to effectively target, track, and report on ad performance.</li>
<li>FLoC is Google’s current solution for ad targeting in the absence of third-party cookies, and it stands for Federated Learning of Cohorts</li>
<li>It works by keeping browsing data within a user’s browser and creating anonymized cohorts that advertisers can target.</li>
<li>However, this solution comes with many risks and has received a lot pushback.</li>
<li>To prepare, focus on collecting first-party data, place the Google Ads tag on your site, and (if you’re interested), collaborate in the Privacy Sandbox.</li>
