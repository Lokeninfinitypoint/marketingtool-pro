<h2>Introducing the Facebook Ads Grader</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-advertising?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FBGrader_FBGrader">Facebook Ads Grader</a> is the newest member in our club of free analytics tools built to help you understand exactly where you stand with your online advertising efforts.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with <a href="/wordstream-graders">our other graders</a>, the Facebook Ads Grader (FBG) is a report-based tool that analyzes your Facebook Business account performance. It uses a combination of best practices and recent performance data (including account activity, performance by audience and ad performance) and compares your results against those of other Facebook advertisers in similar industries, with similar monthly budgets. That earns you your grade, but more importantly, identifies existing inefficiencies and surfaces new opportunities.</p>
<p>Use your report’s insights to find out where you stand today; then optimize your Facebook account so you can earn more sales and leads through your Facebook Advertising!</p>
<p>The Facebook Ads Grader:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shows you how well your Facebook campaigns are actually performing</li>
<li>Gives you a sense of how you fit into the competitive landscape</li>
<li>Provides advice for improving your score and your results</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out this sample report below:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="500f2a6d-9feb-43f1-9f26-f5bde7bd8d9a" data-langcode="en">

<h2>Why did we build the Facebook Ads Grader?</h2>
<p>We know Facebook’s ad platform gives you a wealth of information on your potential customers and dozens of ways to reach them. It’s a great place to introduce your business to prospects you’d never have found otherwise, as well as sell to the ones who already love your brand.</p>
<p>But Facebook is certainly not without its challenges. With its growing number of <a href="/blog/ws/2016/06/27/facebook-ad-targeting-options-infographic">targeting options</a> and <a href="/blog/ws/2016/07/13/facebook-ad-types-cheatsheet">ad types</a>, and an <a href="/blog/ws/2017/12/19/year-in-facebook">ever-changing interface</a>, Facebook ads can be frustrating, especially for novices. It’s easier than you’d think to waste your advertising spend, chalk it up as a failed experiment and walk away from all that potential.</p>
<p>We don’t want to see you miss out on an opportunity to grow your business by confidently leveraging this platform. That’s why we created the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-advertising?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FBGrader_FBGrader">Facebook Ads Grader</a>, to help any business using Facebook ads run a quick and free audit on their account.</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>The Facebook Ads Grader is designed to help advertisers and agencies better understand their Facebook performance. From ad sets to audience creation, conversion tracking to bid optimization, this free analytics tool provides a baseline for both current account health and future optimization.</p>
<p>If you’re currently advertising on Facebook, we can securely access and assess your activity (with your permission) to generate a report that details the areas in which you’re succeeding and where your account could use some work.</p>
<p>Points of analysis include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account activity </strong>– AKA how often are you making changes in your Facebook ads account?</li>
</ul>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="d2e8a903-40a3-4d70-a0c6-7ed95fe545af" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance by audience</strong> – How much do your Key Performance Indicators differ based on who you’re advertising to?</li>
<li><strong>Ad performance</strong> – What are your best and worst performing ads, and how do they stack up to your competition?</li>
</ul>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="26fce882-d822-4b92-83a5-b411f8fec2be" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wasted spend</strong> – Are your Facebook ads being over-served to the wrong people? Are you paying too much per click?</li>
<li><strong>Best practices</strong> – Do your campaigns, ad sets, and ads adhere to the industry standards established by Facebook? Are you making the most of your Facebook budget?</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll see a score in each of these five areas, with each section’s score contributing to a single, overall report score that summarizes the health of your Facebook account.</p>
<p>Throughout the report, we also provide competitors’ average performance data based on <a href="/blog/ws/2017/02/28/facebook-advertising-benchmarks">other advertisers in your industry</a> with similar budgets. This will help you see how your Facebook campaigns stack up against other advertisers targeting similar potential customers.</p>
<p>The Facebook Ads Grader integrates with Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, making it easy to share results with your team or brag to your frenemies.</p>
<p>BTW: WordStream will only use your personal information and Facebook credentials to analyze your account, and we will never share your Facebook data for any reason (see our Privacy Policy).</p>
<h2>Try it today and tell us what you think!</h2>
