We'll walk you through how to optimize your account now, prepare for tomorrow, and start ramping back up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN">Last month, Facebook hit a new record of 2.6 billion monthly users. Research is also showing that <a href="https://www.globalwebindex.com/coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">47% of consumers</a><span lang="EN"> have increased social media usage during the pandemic. With more people online, and data suggesting that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/05/04/ppc-rebound-covid-19-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PPC accounts are rebounding</a><span lang="EN"> after the initial impact of COVID-19, it’s time to start thinking about your strategy for reactivating Facebook advertising. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">We can’t predict when the pandemic will end or when the economy will rebound, but we do know how to prepare your online advertising accounts to respond to the current state and then how to ramp back up (when you’re ready). Today, I’ll be focusing on Facebook advertising, and here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll cover:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">How to prioritize your spend for ROI today</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Tips to audit your existing Facebook ads account </span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Steps to scale your account back up</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">What to keep in mind as you scale</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">If you read my previous blog post on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/05/06/google-ads-account-recovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads recovery</a><span lang="EN">, you’ll notice that the steps to Facebook ads recovery follow a similar process—but just because the steps look similar doesn’t mean the details are. As an advertiser, you know that these are two really different platforms. </span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">So let’s get started with the Facebook-specific account recovery.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">Prioritize your spend for ROI today</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Consumers are using social media more during the pandemic, and this shift in behavior has led to a record-breaking active user count on Facebook, which is evident in their Q1 earnings report.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">While active user counts grow, advertising revenue has declined.</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="16d60e57-3aaa-4bae-afbc-c7f8d96fd21f" data-langcode="en">

<p><span lang="EN">The opposite trendlines in active user count and revenue shows us that advertisers are pulling back their investment in Facebook advertising as they navigate this time—which is a common trend across advertising platforms.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">However, while ad spend is reduced and user activity has increased, advertisers are seeing a reduction in their cost KPIs during this time. This trend is beginning with a decrease in CPM (cost per one-thousand impressions)—we’re seeing a 35% reduction within our customer base. In tandem with CPM, CPA (cost per acquisition) is decreasing for advertisers; we’ve seen a 23% decrease in CPA.</span></p>

</div>
<p><span lang="EN">So what does this mean? It means that if you’re able to continue advertising on Facebook during this time, <strong>you can generate more results from your investment today</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">While the current trends and uncertainties are outside of our control, let’s focus on what advertisers <em>can </em>control during this time—the actions you take in your account to maximize ROI from your ad spend today. </span></p>

</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Once you feel like your account is in good health in its current state, let’s shift your focus toward <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/05/20/when-to-ramp-up-ad-spend-during-covid-19">ramping your account back up</a>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">To reinforce the importance of these next few steps</span></strong><span lang="EN">, let’s use a quick analogy to running a marathon. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Say you ran a marathon six months ago, and since then, you’ve decreased your weekly mileage by 70%. Now, you’ve decided you’re ready to take on another marathon. Would you be prepared to complete this marathon at the same or better time if you tried to tomorrow? </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Highly unlikely. You would need to take the time to check in on your current fitness level and devise a plan to scale your mileage back up to run well in your marathon.</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="5af1336e-dd7e-4a59-8b97-99b2d992b148" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">The same process goes to ramping your Facebook advertising spend backup—you should check in on your current state and devise a methodical plan. These next steps will walk you through the crucial steps to ensuring that you can scale up your Facebook advertising while maintaining (or even improving) your account’s benchmarks and KPI performance. </span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">Check in on your Facebook ads foundation</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">The first step in this process is auditing your account foundation and making sure you’re following current best practices. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">The key components in this phase are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Accurate conversion tracking</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Campaign objectives</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Conversion event and optimization settings</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Creative excellence</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Adherence to best practices</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Let’s talk more about what you need to check in on these components.</span></p>
<h3>1. Conversion tracking</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">I listed this step first because <strong>conversion tracking</strong> is pivotal to your success with Facebook ads. Why? Because conversion tracking tells the algorithm what success looks like in your account. Having accurate conversion tracking allows you to provide the signals that Facebook needs to optimize the delivery of your ads toward your objective and goals.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">To get started, you need to confirm that your pixel is firing properly. To review your status, navigate to the events manager.</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="a91688f7-b22b-43b4-8941-8a9c63efb8cc" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">And within the data sources section, you should look for an active signal, like this (in yellow):</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="2b5953be-ef2e-4df6-abd3-370c6679a5b7" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Once you’ve confirmed that your pixel is firing, navigate to “custom conversions” and audit your existing conversion actions. </span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="992cacea-2d4f-40b9-85ea-b659c7470281" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">After laying out all of your current conversion actions, you should ask yourself:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Are there any conversion actions currently being counted that aren’t valuable?</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Does the current set up match the business value of that action?</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Are there any missing conversion events that should be tracked?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Use your audit to prioritize any changes you need to make to your conversion tracking moving forward. </span></p>
<h3>2. Campaign objectives</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">While conversion tracking tells Facebook what success looks like in your account, your objectives tell Facebook what your goal is (AKA what you’re looking for the algorithm to accomplish for you). When it comes to delivering to your selected goal, I can confidently say that the Facebook algorithm is a great listener—which is why selecting the right objective is important. </span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><strong><em><span lang="EN">Facebook’s options for objectives when setting up your campaign</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN">As you can see above, Facebook offers a wide range of options for advertisers to select depending on their goal. While reviewing your existing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/26/facebook-objectives">campaign objectives</a><span lang="EN">, you should look for alignment with your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/21/facebook-funnel">marketing funnel</a><span lang="EN"> and goals. </span></span></span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="9e8d03cf-1b49-4ba8-b9c4-fb97343bfd35" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Not only should your objective be aligned with your marketing journey, but it should also line up with your business goal in each stage. To help you get started, here are a few examples of objectives pairings.</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="a2e10d78-57d0-4e96-aab0-5f3ca2dd3754" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">While each business is unique with different objectives and goals, this should help guide you as you check in on the strength of your current objective selections. </span></p>
<h3>3. Conversion event and optimization setting</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">The final piece to equipping the algorithm with the information it needs to deliver to your goals are your <strong>conversion event </strong>and <strong>optimization for ad delivery </strong>selections. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">While conversion tracking lays the groundwork for information gathering, the conversion event tells the algorithm the key indicator for success in your ad set. And your optimization for ad delivery selection informs the algorithm how to optimize ad delivery according to these signals and objectives. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Just as you did with objectives, use this time to audit your current settings and ensure that they are in line with your goals. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">For more on your objectives and settings, check out <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/26/facebook-objectives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Campaign Objectives: What Every Advertiser Needs to Know</a><span lang="EN">.</span></span></p>
<h3>4. Ad creative excellence</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Your <strong>ad creative </strong>can make or break your Facebook advertising success. If your ad creative isn’t scroll-stopping, you’ll never have the opportunity to engage your target audience to take action on your ad.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Take this time to audit your existing ad creative and understand where you can improve to achieve creative excellence. Here’s how to get started:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Limit the text in your ad creative:</span></strong><span lang="EN"> Images with less than 20% text perform better and are favored by Facebook. Use <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/tools/text_overlay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook’s text overlay tool</a><span lang="EN"> to review your ads.</span></span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Use video/animation in your creative: </span></strong><span lang="EN">Video is proven to drive higher engagement than static ads. Learn <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/4-ways-to-turn-still-image-ads-into-video-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four ways to turn still images into video here</a><span lang="EN">.</span></span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Optimize your creative for different placements and devices: </span></strong><span lang="EN">User behavior and content consumption is different across placements and devices. Review <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1044825198987622?id=369787570424415" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook’s documentation</a><span lang="EN"> on asset customization.</span></span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Optimize your video creative for sound off viewing:  </span></strong><a href="https://buffer.com/resources/social-media-video-marketing-statistics?utm_content=buffer69c9f&amp;utm_medium=buffer_social&amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=buffer_updates&amp;fbclid=IwAR0-cefOyNY2MeQzq4hwApBFuK8Txbdcm4L3sa4p_XZBJ0Xo1dVUTHy-GTg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Studies</a><span lang="EN"> show 85% of Facebook videos are watched without sound.

<p><span lang="EN">While I reviewed the foundational best practices in the first four steps, this stage should be the cherry on top for your Facebook account.</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="a7b6dad1-6cf6-4e05-87e6-397fc2afcf97" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Okay, now that we’ve reviewed what to do now and how to check in on your current foundation, it’s time to prepare to ramp up.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">Prepare your Facebook advertising account for ramping back up</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Once you’ve confirmed that your account structure is correct and up-to-date, there are three steps to preparing for ramping up. You’ll need to:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span lang="EN">Review performance</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Assess the competitive landscape</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Review your recent changes</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="EN">Let’s go over why each of these are so important and how to prep your account.</span></p>
<h3>1. Review performance</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Whether you’re preparing to increase your spend or not, you should be reporting on where your Facebook ads account stands today and how that’s evolved during the pandemic. As a spreadsheet-loving marketer, I can get carried away in this stage—pulling every metric possible and plotting each and every trend. This isn’t the best use of my time or yours. At the end of the day, we want to tell a clear story of how performance has evolved on Facebook. To accomplish this, I’d recommend focusing your initial analysis on the core platform metrics:</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">How has spend evolved:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Average daily spend</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">How are prospects engaging with your ads:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Average click-through rate (CTR)</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Average engagement rate </span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Average conversion rate (CVR)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">How have your costs evolved based on new trends:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Average cost per click (CPC)</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Average cost per action (CPA)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">By grouping and comparing these KPIs over time, you can start telling the story of how your account has evolved. To help you dig in further and analyze your Facebook advertising results, check out these resources:</span></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>2. Assess the competitive landscape</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">As you review the changes you’ve made and how performance has evolved, you should look at how your competitive landscape may have impacted your delivery. You can use the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library">Facebook ad library</a><span lang="EN"> to search your competitors, see their offers, and review their most recent ad activity.</span></span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="f8ddb92f-b702-44dd-aa9d-7a1bdb84e746" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><strong><em><span lang="EN">Here’s an example of what it looks like if you search Instacart.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN">While your direct competitors’ strategies have an impact on your performance, it’s also important to note that you’re competing for ad slots with all advertisers that overlap with your targeting. And while you prepare for your Facebook ads recovery, keep in mind that other advertisers are doing the same. As advertisers ramp their spend back up, competition in the auction is likely to increase. This means that the drop in CPM (shown earlier) is likely to revert, making it crucial that you follow the right steps to your account recovery during this period to maximize ROI.</span></p>
<h3>3. Review your recent changes</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Google Ads makes this stage a bit easier for advertisers—with labels and change history, you can quickly review your most recent and significant account changes. While you can’t access a change history on Facebook, you can look at how your account makeup has evolved. Get started by adjusting your date range with a comparison.</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="daaa67a8-10fb-4b66-a996-fe37d0be265f" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Here, you should be looking for newly paused campaigns or ad sets and significant changes in spend. As you identify the largest changes, ask yourself a few leading questions:</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">Was this change applied because your campaign is limited by budget?</span></strong></p>

<li><span lang="EN">If so, you should consider reverting the change to enable greater freedom in ad delivery as your budgets increase.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">For example, you may want to re-enable an ad set that was performing to your CPA goals but paused due to limitations in budget.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">Was this change implemented because it was an outlier in performance?</span></strong></p>

<li><span lang="EN">If so, you should break these changes out based on the distance from your average KPI.</span></li>

<li><span lang="EN">Reviewing your account foundation </span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Preparing your account for ramping up spend</span></li>

<h2><span lang="EN">Ramping up your Facebook ads account</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">This might be the final step in the process, but that doesn’t mean it’s as easy as boosting your spend and getting back to normal. There are few more things you need to do in order to ramp up spend:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Understand the spend growth in your budget: </span></strong><span lang="EN">For example, if your monthly budget was $10,000 and you’re looking to grow to $50,000—your average daily spend will need to scale from $322 to $1,612. The level of scale you’re planning for will drive your next steps.</span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Review and revert the appropriate changes to your account: </span></strong><span lang="EN">As noted above, as you are scaling spend, you should review recent changes and determine which should be reverted or re-introduced as you ramp back up. </span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Start by increasing your campaign/ad set’s budget: </span></strong><span lang="EN">Depending on whether you’re using CBO (campaign budget optimization) or not, your budget allocation will happen at either the campaign or ad set level.  Based on the growth of your budget and allocation across your account, you should map out where and how you’ll increase your budgets.</span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Set yourself up to scale: </span></strong><span lang="EN">Increasing your spend isn’t as easy as simply increasing your budgets. You need to check in on your account to ensure you’re set up for scale. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Here are a few key ways you can set your account up for scale:</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN">Whether you’re an agency or an advertiser, there’s a good chance that your online advertising budget has been reduced as your business or client’s businesses navigate the current COVID-19 pandemic. In early April, we were seeing average daily budgets reduced across the board, with variance by industry. But as of early May, we&#8217;re starting to see <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/05/04/ppc-rebound-covid-19-data">strong signs of a rebound</a>. Facebook hit a new record of 2.6 billion monthly users. Google Ads users saw paid search conversions return to 89% of pre-COVID levels. </span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">While we can’t predict when the pandemic will end and how the economy will recover, we do know how to prepare your online advertising accounts to respond to the current state and then how to ramp back up (when you’re ready). Today, I’ll be focusing on Google Ads, and here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll cover:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>How to prioritize your Google Ads account for ROI today</li>
<li>How to check in on your Google Ads account foundation</li>
<li>How to prepare your Google Ads account for ramping up</li>
<li>How (and when) to start ramping up your Google Ads account</li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Let’s get started.</span></p>
<h2>Prioritize your optimizations for ROI today</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">We can’t know what’s going to happen and there are a lot of factors outside of our control right now, so first let’s talk about what we can control right now—which is the stability and cost efficiency of our Google Ads accounts in the current environment.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">When you’re managing an account during a pullback period, it’s important to identify <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/24/google-ads-optimization">quick-win optimizations</a> that will cut out inefficiencies and allow you to deliver the most value from the budget you have. From search terms to ad scheduling and ad copy, use this checklist as a guideline to optimize your results during this period.</span></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN">Pro tip:</span></strong><span lang="EN"> While making changes to your account during this state, remember that labels are your friend.</span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">If you’re using labels, you can always filter and reference account components that you may have paused or significantly changed during this time. (Teaser: This will make your life much easier when you get to the last section of this guide.)</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Now that you’ve run through this checklist and prioritized how you’re getting the most from your budget today, start to shift your focus to how you build things back up, which starts with your foundation. </span></p>
<h2>Check in on your Google Ads foundation</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">If you were thinking about scaling your house with a new addition—how would you approach it? Would you knock down your whole house and start over again, or would you look for ways to build onto what’s existing? While neither approach is wrong, the latter is more cost-effective and allows you to maintain your housing while you work on your scale. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Now, why am I talking about construction? Because the analogy applies to your Google Ads account structure. As you’re looking to scale your account back up, it’s important to leverage your current foundation instead of starting completely fresh. That’s because it gives you a strong base to work off of while leveraging your historical data, current performance, and maintaining delivery during the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/05/20/when-to-ramp-up-ad-spend-during-covid-19">ramp up period</a>.</span></p>

<h3>Conversion tracking</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">While your account structure is the core of your Google Ads foundation, conversion tracking is the most critical step in this process. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Your conversion tracking tells the algorithm what success looks like in your account. Even if you have the perfect account structure, you won’t be able to reach your business goals without the right conversion actions and settings.

<p><span lang="EN">Okay, now that we’ve reviewed what to do now and how to check in on your current foundation, it’s time to prepare to ramp up.</span></p>
<h2>Prepare your Google Ads account for ramping back up</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">As account managers, we know that ramping spend back up isn’t as simple as turning on a switch and increasing your daily budgets. We also know that it’s going to take expectation setting with your key stakeholders—sharing current performance, forecasting the impact increased ad spend has on business results, clearly communicating the variables, and much more. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">To help you prepare, let’s get into it.</span></p>
<h3>First, analyze current performance</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Whether you’re preparing to increase your spend or not, you should be reporting on where your Google Ads account stands today and how that’s evolved during the pandemic. While there are endless metrics to review, I’d recommend prioritizing and grouping your core PPC metrics, as follows:</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">How has spend evolved:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Average daily spend</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">How are prospects engaging with your ads:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Average click-through rate (CTR) </span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Average conversion rate (CVR) </span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">How have your costs evolved based on new trends:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Average cost per click (CPC) </span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Average cost per action (CPA) </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">By grouping and comparing these KPIs over time, you can start telling the story of how your account has evolved. To help you dig in further and analyze your results, check out these resources:</span></p>

</ul>
<h3>Second, understand consumer behavior</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">While shifts in performance are impacted by the change in the competitive landscape, it is most significantly impacted by the changes in consumer behavior.  While some of these shifts in behavior are temporary during the pandemic, it’s likely that there are new norms that are developing for your consumers. To review how the shifts in consumer behavior have impacted your business, check out these resources:</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">To get started, take the time to review any significant changes you’ve applied to your account during this down period. Use this checklist to cover your bases.</span></p>

</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Now that you’ve revisited your changes, you should review whether they should be reverted or not. To guide your decisions, you should ask yourself:</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">Was this change applied because your campaign is limited by budget?</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em><span lang="EN">If so</span></em><span lang="EN">, you should consider reverting the change to enable greater freedom in ad delivery as your budgets increase.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">For example, you may want to re-enable a campaign that was performing to your CPA goals, but paused due to limitations in budget. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">Was this change implemented because it was an outlier in performance?</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em><span lang="EN">If so</span></em><span lang="EN">, you should break these changes out based on the distance from your average KPI. </span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">For example, you may want to re-enable a keyword that had a 5% higher CPA than your account average, while keeping a keyword with a 40% higher CPA paused. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">At this stage, you’ve now completed the following: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Optimized your foundation</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Analyzed performance</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Reverted appropriate changes</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">The next steps to scaling your Google Ads account are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Understand the spend growth in your budget:</span></strong><span lang="EN"> For example, if your monthly budget was $10,000 and you’re looking to grow to $50,000—your average daily spend will need to scale from $322 to $1,612. The level of scale you’re planning for will drive your next steps.</span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Start by increasing your campaign’s budget</span></strong><span lang="EN">: Based on the growth of your budget and allocation across your account, you should map out where and how you’ll increase your campaign-level budgets.</span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Spend more by adjusting your bids: </span></strong><span lang="EN">Now that you’ve given Google the go ahead to spend to your new budget, you need to adjust your bids to increase your competitiveness—prioritize and determine how to increase your bids by gauging your current impression share and cost/conversion. </span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Broaden your keyword match types to be eligible to spend in more auctions: </span></strong><span lang="EN">While spend was pulled back, it’s likely you focused your match types on exact / phrase match versus broad. Review the differences and what it means for your eligibility for the different ad auctions <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-match-types">here</a></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">By taking these steps and reverting appropriate changes, you’ll begin to see Google accelerate your daily spend. However, it’s important to understand the barriers that you’ll likely experience during this ramp up period.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">What to expect during your ramp up period</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Like I mentioned earlier, communicating and setting clear expectations is extremely important as you navigate this ramp up period—especially as you experience some disruptions to performance during this time. While setting expectations during this period, you should:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Expect the learning period: </span></strong><span lang="EN">Keep in mind that it will take time for your account to learn and scale back up to optimal delivery at this new level of spend. You can learn more about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/13/learning-period">navigating the learning period here</a><span lang="EN">.</span></span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Closely monitor results:</span></strong><span lang="EN"> Track and report on performance regularly as you work through this ramp up period. </span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Evaluate search demand</span></strong><span lang="EN">: As consumer and search trends evolve, there’s a chance that your search demand may not return to previous levels. If you’re noticing a limit in the scale of your Google Ads account, you should consider expanding in other channels, such as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/05/31/how-to-advertise-on-facebook">Facebook Ads</a><span lang="EN"> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/03/differences-between-google-ads-and-microsoft-ads">Microsoft Bing Ads</a><span lang="EN">. </span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Follow these key steps to ramp up your Google Ads account</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">There’s a lot to consider when preparing to ramp up your Google Ads account—and there’s a lot to be done before jumping right in to increase your budgets. Overall, you should follow these steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span lang="EN">Optimize for now.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Review your foundation.</span></li>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN">Looking back at my time at WordStream, I’ve learned A TON. Most noteworthy, I’ve furthered my paid search and social advertising expertise, backed by over $10 million in ad spend managed. Yup, over <strong><em>$10 million</em></strong>—that means I’ve reviewed a LOT of performance data. </span></p>

</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">How I feel as an acquisition marketer and our resident data fanatic.</span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">And here at WordStream, we aren’t just spending online to spend; we have aggressive goals to generate quality leads and new business for the company. With aggressive goals come significant account activity—constant analysis, optimization, testing, and strategizing. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">So, in today’s blog post, I’m going to share my top lessons learned spending over $10 million, which estimates to over 90M impressions and 4M clicks captured. That’s a lot of reach. Here are the five most important lessons I’ve learned:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span lang="EN">Intent, intent, intent</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Master the algorithm</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Optimize for quality</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Tracking and alerts are crucial</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Make your channels work together</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#8217;s get started.</p>
<h2>1. Intent, intent, intent</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/26/intent-marketing">Intent marketing</a><span lang="EN"> is any kind of marketing that aims to meet an end user or prospect’s intent—that is, what they really want or need in that moment. Most of the time when we talk about executing on “intent marketing,” we’re referring to using a known audience parameter, such as a search query, remarketing list, or a prospecting audience. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Driving your advertising strategy based on intent is a concept that should never retire. But, over time, with changes in the industry, it’s become even harder to nail down a prospect&#8217;s intent solely by the parameters I listed above. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Applied example: Here you can clearly define the intent on the left, but how do we know what someone is looking for on the right?</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="230926cb-598c-433c-8f80-f3bea7492736" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-and-facebook-ads-lessons-intent.jpg" alt="intent keywords" width="727" height="154" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">For example, just in August, Google <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/31/phrase-match-broad-match-modifier-close-variants">released changes to broad match modifier</a><span lang="EN">. This update meant that advertisers would now start to match new close variants to their BMM (broad match modifier) keywords. This makes it tricky to be confident in the intent that your targeted keyword will trigger, as Google has more freedom to determine which queries are relevant to your keywords.</span></span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="b4752ce9-2eee-495b-bc5d-1650dbfb493d" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">My biggest lesson here? That you have to trust and work together with the algorithms to capture the intent you’re looking for. Here are a few recommendations to accomplish this:</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">For paid search:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Leverage long-tail keywords where you can clearly define the intent behind the query.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Maintain a strong account structure built on intent.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Use automated bidding for broad keywords where you can’t see the intent behind the query.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Add observed audiences to tell how valuable particular audiences pair with your keywords, and be sure to use remarketing lists for search ads, or RSLAs, in these audiences.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">For paid social: </span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Leverage custom audiences—particularly website visitors and Facebook sourced engagement audiences. </span></li>
</ul>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="749a3836-f6ec-4290-8c80-04059852c944" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-and-facebook-ads-lessons-custom-audiences.jpg" alt="custom audiences" width="633" height="571" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Build lookalike audiences off of lists with high intent signals—adjust your lookalike size based on the level of intent you are looking to capture (1% for the highest intent, 10% for the broadest match of intent). </span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Select <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/26/facebook-objectives">the right objectives &amp; campaign settings</a><span lang="EN"> so the algorithm optimizes for your intent goals. </span></span></li>
</ul>
<h2>2.  Master the algorithms</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Both the Google and Facebook ad auctions are run by an algorithm. And while there is training and documentation that explains the best practices for the auction, neither of the platforms releases the secrets of how the algorithm runs and makes decisions. With uncertainty about how the algorithm is delivering your account comes confusion about what you should be doing in your account. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">It’s taken time, but after managing over $10 M in ad spend, I’ve come to figure it out (as close as one can I guess). And now that we’ve unlocked our keys on how to master the algorithm, this lesson has become the <strong>backbone to success</strong> for how we manage our accounts.  </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">So how can my lesson be applied to your account?</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">For paid search:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Don’t be afraid of automated bidding. </span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Avoid significant changes that put you in the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/13/learning-period">learning period</a><span lang="EN"> (which impacts your delivery and takes time for the algorithm to get back up to it’s efficiencies).  That means don’t make greater than a 20% change to any campaign’s budget, limit bulk actions in campaigns with automated bidding all at once, and be methodical about when / how you make updates to your conversion actions.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">For paid social: </span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Give the algorithm the freedom it needs to reach peak delivery by enabling automatic placements and trying to use <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/153514848493595">campaign budget optimization (CBO)</a><span lang="EN">.</span></span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Be deliberate with your optimization event decisions.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Provide a significant volume of your selected optimization events so the algorithm has enough data to learn. Facebook requires 50 optimization events in a 7-day period to exit the learning phase. </span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Don’t “define” your audience too much.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0569c58d-1b6b-4175-b50c-c59521d0cd85" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Just like I said in the first point, you need to “trust and work together with the algorithms” to enable your advertising success. </span></p>
<h2>3.  Optimize for quality</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">For most lead gen advertisers, the goal isn’t to just drive reach or conversions, it’s typically about driving quantity and quality leads for your business—which is the same for our accounts here at WordStream. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Before working in an in-house role, I was client-facing at a marketing agency. So, if my clients didn’t provide reports or feedback on what was happening after the “conversion,” I was blind to optimizing their account for quality. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Right off the bat when I started in this in-house role at WordStream, I onboarded to how we track custom parameters from the ad platforms into our CRM. Immediately, I was able to take my traditional account optimization to the next level by gaining insight into what campaigns and offers were driving not only qualified leads but also demos and eventually new customers. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">However, we soon realized that while we were gaining these insights and using them to make decisions, the process was flawed in two ways:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span lang="EN">It was a lot of manual work—which takes time.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">The algorithms can’t see these reports and learnings we were gathering. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="EN">So what did we do? We set up an integration that connects our CRM data with our Google Analytics account. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Now, not only have we brought new signals to the algorithms, but we’ve gathered more data to build audiences and optimize our account management. </span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">While this lesson requires sophisticated tracking to follow, there are still plenty of actions you can take in your account to be successful in optimizing for quality:</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">For paid search:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Stay on top of your search terms report and flag poor quality queries as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/06/negative-keyword-guide">negative keywords</a><span lang="EN">.</span></span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Set up your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/08/13/adwords-conversion-tracking-guide"> conversion tracking</a><span lang="EN"> as far down the funnel as possible.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">For paid social: </span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Create <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/255483958155378?id=1769156093197771">block lists</a><span lang="EN"> to control which placements and sites you don’t want your ads to show.</span></span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Set up your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/10/11/facebook-conversion-tracking"> conversion tracking</a><span lang="EN"> as far down the funnel as possible, just as you would in Google Ads.</span></span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Review your comments and reactions to understand the sentiment of your ad viewers.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Overall, furthering your ability to drive quality leads from your paid advertising will drive a better return on your ad spend—and serve as proof to why you should scale your budgets.</span></p>
<h2>4. Tracking &amp; alerts are crucial</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">With over $10M in ad spend, comes a lot of information to track—at times, it can be impossible to stay on top of it all manually. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">And I’m not afraid to admit, we’ve had our fair share of mistakes and tracking outages. But we’ve made each of these mistakes into a lesson learned, so we can come out more prepared for the future. Here a few examples of systems we’ve put in place:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Creating custom alerts for new trends or patterns in Google Analytics.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="3fb8b2e6-9eff-407c-954d-9f6524e0da32" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Building automated rules in Google Ads to trigger emails when particular conditions occur.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Generate automatic reports and dashboards that keep your key metrics visible at all times.

<li><span lang="EN">Defining a cadence and accountability to review reports to discuss and highlight noteworthy, new trends.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Make your channels work together</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Now, I’ve talked a lot about how to make your channels work smarter, but what I haven’t talked about yet is how to make your paid channels work <strong>together</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Here at WordStream, Google &amp; Facebook Ads are at the core of our paid channel stack. We’ve found that not only do these channels help balance out our spend towards both quantity and quality, but that we constantly leverage insights from one to bring into the other. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">So why is a cross-channel strategy important? Lots of reasons! But to name just a few:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Helps push your prospects down the marketing funnel by reach them across the internet.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Drives consistency for your prospects at each touch.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Maximizes your return on ad spend.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Just like there are countless benefits of a cross-channel strategy, there are a ton of ways that you can get started to make your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/09/facebook-plus-google">Facebook &amp; Google Ads work better together</a><span lang="EN">. </span></span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">For paid search:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Use RLSA (remarketing lists for search ads) audiences to target new keywords and/or control your bidding</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Customize your ad based on their previous interaction. (Pro tip: Try targeting an RLSA audience of users who interacted with a Facebook ad and personalize your ad message on search.)</span></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In May, Google announced its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/14/google-marketing-live">newest changes at Google Marketing Live</a>. And now that the dust has settled, I’m here to talk about what I believe to be the unsung hero of the day—the newest bidding control, <strong>campaign-level conversion setting</strong>.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="97907e1b-84b3-47bf-8227-cb464905a0ff" data-langcode="en">

</div>
<p>In this guide, I’m going to go over everything you need to know about this new bid setting. But before getting into what’s new, let’s do a quick refresh of the pre-announcement conversion tracking era.</p>
<h3>What is conversion tracking?</h3>
<p>Conversion tracking is the method advertisers use to identify and record valuable actions to their business within their Google Ads account. By setting up conversion tracking, advertisers give the Google algorithm the information it needs to understand what drives success in an account.</p>
<h3>How does the algorithm gather these signals?</h3>
<p>Advertisers set their conversion tracking up within the measurement section in Google Ads:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="bf9d049f-4043-47a1-983c-5d9bebe20510" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/campaign-level-conversions-tracking-google-ads-1.jpg" alt="conversion tracking in Google Ads" width="780" height="214" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>These conversion actions can either be imported from Google Analytics or tracked via the Google Ads pixel. And regardless of how you track your conversions, advertisers can add as many actions they find valuable. Once these conversion actions are defined in the platform, Google will record a conversion each time a user completes one of those actions.</p>
<h3>What does the algorithm do with these signals?</h3>
<p>As your account builds up conversion data, the algorithm starts to learn about these successful signals. And as these learnings are significant, the algorithm optimizes your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/21/google-sunsets-accelerated-delivery">ad delivery</a> as you are eligible for placements in the ad auction. Without this conversion data, the algorithm is blind to the information most advertisers care most about—growing their business or client’s account by optimizing their delivery from Google Ads.</p>
<p>Now, there’s one thing that will never change: <a href="/blog/ws/2021/05/24/google-ads-conversion-tracking">Conversion tracking</a> is crucial to a successful Google Ads account. However, there has always been a missing piece to the puzzle with the account level conversion setting: the ability to tell Google which conversion action is <strong>most important </strong>to a given campaign.</p>
<h2>Enter campaign-level conversion setting</h2>
<p>“<a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9339301" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New bidding controls to help meet your goals</a>” was one of the 10 announcements at Google Marketing Live. This announcement encompasses a few innovations, but <strong>campaign-level conversion setting </strong>stood out to me immediately.</p>
<p>So why did Google introduce this change to bidding? Google states that over <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9339301" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70% of their advertisers are using automated bidding today</a>. And to that stat, they say:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><span lang="EN">“And while many of you have told us that Smart Bidding has helped drive better performance, you’ve also asked for more flexibility to reach your business goals.”</span></em></p></blockquote>
<h3>What is campaign-level conversion setting?</h3>
<p><strong>Campaign-level conversion setting</strong> is a way for advertisers to select which of their conversion actions the algorithm should track and optimize towards for a campaign.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="a90b2f52-71b5-4a52-9a0e-2f2cd10fef8f" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<h3>So what’s different?</h3>
<p>As I touched on above, with the account-level conversion setting, each of the conversion actions in a given account add together to populate your conversion metrics. Now, with the campaign-level conversion setting, Google is giving advertisers the ability to specify which action(s) should populate your conversion data. Meaning that this new setting simply gives Google <strong>more information about which conversion actions are most relevant to track and optimize towards.</strong> This means you can tell Google what’s more important for your business and your business goals.</p>
<p>Let’s take a scenario from our account to compare the two settings. Here’s an example of one of our ads with the goal to drive &amp; convert prospects into a free trial:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="ccd990a8-69ae-404f-b9e5-cc2c3965e984" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/campaign-level-conversion-ad.jpg" alt="ad example" width="353" height="131" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Imagine a user clicks on this ad, visits our landing page, but navigates back to the site and converts on a whitepaper. With the <strong>account-level conversion </strong>setting, we would register one conversion—just the same as if the user converted on a trial. On the other hand, if we were using the <strong>campaign-level conversion </strong>setting with our free trial action, we would not count this behavior as a conversion. With campaign-level conversion setting, we are only giving the algorithm successful signals if a user completes a free trial.</p>
<p>Now, let’s take a look at this with a real-life reference: I have the objective to exercise with a sub-objective to run marathons. And yes, every time I set this objective I get this reminder from our very own <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/mikayla-wyman-3980">Mikayla Wyman</a>:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="5067d027-d888-40b0-a00b-f365525096d5" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/campaign-level-conversion-marathon-tweet_0.jpg" alt="tweet about marathoners" width="499" height="235" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>To achieve my main objective (exercise), I start to plan and track a variety of exercises as part of a training plan. These workouts include yoga, weight lifting, soccer, spin, kickboxing, and running. However, to make progress towards my sub-objective (marathon), I need to follow a specific calendar centered around my long-distance runs. While the variety of workouts will be beneficial during my training, completing my long-distance runs are the <strong>most crucial action</strong> influencing my ability to be prepared for the marathon.</p>
<p>Now, you might be asking &#8230; how does this relate to conversion tracking? Well, what I’m trying to get to is that while I am training for my marathon, it is most valuable to track my runs as progress. If I track every work out—yoga, soccer, spin, <em>and</em> running—as a conversion, I’m not getting an accurate depiction of how prepared I am for the marathon. Therefore, while working towards this sub-objective, I want to operate under the <strong>campaign-level conversion </strong>setting—exclusively tracking and improving upon my runs.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Overall, while you may lose the quantity in conversions by switching over to the campaign-level conversion setting,  you should see an improvement in the ability to deliver the conversion action that you find most relevant for the campaign.</p>
<h3>Setting up campaign-level conversion tracking</h3>
<p>To start leveraging this new setting, you can navigate to your campaign settings and click into the conversion drop down:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="3a10d714-8b99-4fc0-81a2-470409ee40ad" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Once you select to “choose conversion action for this campaign,” you will see all of your conversion actions pop up with the ability to select the specific action(s):</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="38b59c0e-cfa8-4e52-9f74-376c28945c83" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<h2>How does this new bid optimization perform?</h2>
<p>If you can’t already tell, I was excited about the potential of this new setting and how it could perform with our account. So, right away, we put together a few experiments and I have some data to share.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: I am not disclosing the campaign/conversion action details, but this data is pulled straight from the respective tests in our account.</em></p>
<h3><strong>Campaign #1</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Experiment</strong>: Campaign-level conversion setting with conversion action ABC</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong>:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Campaign:</strong></td>
<td><strong>Conversion action:</strong></td>
<td><strong>CPA</strong></td>
<td><strong>CNVR</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Original</td>
<td>ALL</td>
<td>$28</td>
<td>6.35%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Original</td>
<td>Conversion action ABC</p>
<p><em>Segmented campaign by conversion action</em></td>
<td>$62</td>
<td>2.9%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Experiment</td>
<td>Conversion action ABC</td>
<td>$42</td>
<td>3.31%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: The new setting is beating the original by delivering a $20 lower CPA for the conversion action we’re optimizing for—these results are significant!</p>
<h3><strong>Campaign #2</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Experiment</strong>: Campaign-level conversion setting with conversion action XYZ</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong>:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Campaign:</strong></td>
<td><strong>Conversion action:</strong></td>
<td><strong>CPA</strong></td>
<td><strong>CNVR</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Original</td>
<td>ALL</td>
<td>$104</td>
<td>4.2%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Original</td>
<td>Conversion action XYZ</p>
<p><em>Segmented campaign by conversion action</em></td>
<td>$165</td>
<td>2.6%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Experiment</td>
<td>Conversion action XYZ</td>
<td>$178</td>
<td>2.3%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: As you can see, with this campaign, the new setting is not beating the original campaign. However, we have yet to reach significance and we’ve seen the experiment improve overtime as we set it up. Therefore, we plan to continue watching our experiment until we reach a confident significance.</p>
<h3>What can you expect with campaign-level conversions?</h3>
<p>As you’ve read and seen in our performance, you can expect this setting to have the potential to improve your results. But, before jumping right into this new setting, you do need to consider the impact that the change will have on your account performance. The most noteworthy changes we’ve seen with the setting are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slow down in delivery:</strong> Because <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/15/smart-bidding">smart bidding</a> requires significant data to deliver to your goals, the algorithm will enter a “learning period” for such a significant change. This means that the algorithm will need roughly 7 days to restart it’s data gathering and understand how this new signal impacts performance &amp; it’s knowledge of success.</li>
<li><strong>Change in CPA: </strong>as expected, with this new setting, you will only be recording conversions for your selected action(s). Meaning that you will record fewer conversions than you were before—which is likely to increase your CPA and decrease your conversion rate for your campaign. However, you should expect that as this campaign evolves it’s learning from the new setting, your conversion metrics should regulate.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Campaign-level conversions: What you need to know</h2>
<p>Google’s new bidding control has the ability to improve the effectiveness of your campaigns using smart bidding.  While smart bidding is driving results for advertisers—you still need to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">review your account to identify opportunities to improve</a>. Here’s what you need to keep in mind using campaign-level conversion setting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consider the volume of conversions for your selected action(s): </strong>Advertisers need to maintain a significant volume in conversions for the algorithm to effectively learn.</li>
<li><strong>Adjust your bids:</strong> As noted above, it is likely that your CPA will increase with this new setting. You should consider increasing your bids to start and then lowering as you start to see performance regulate and improve.</li>
<li><strong>Test it out in an experiment first: </strong>Without understanding how this change will impact your campaign performance, you can test the change in an experiment to minimize the impact on delivery. That’s what we’ve down in our in-house campaign, which has allowed us to maintain delivery while understanding if this setting is right for us.</li>
<li><strong>You can’t leave it all to the algorithm: </strong>Even though you are using smart bidding with this setting, it doesn’t mean you can leave your campaign untouched. You still need to manage your campaign effectively and make optimizations to improve results.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN">A while back, one of our blog readers <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/06/real-estate-facebook-ads#comment-4277145154">posted a comment</a><span lang="EN"> asking for targeting guidance in their industry. As an in-house acquisition marketer, I love a new challenge and opportunity to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/10/common-facebook-ads-issues">think outside the box when it comes to Facebook Ads</a>. So, after responding back to this visitor, I had the idea for my next blog post: recommending creative targeting options for a variety of industries. </span></span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="f62bac38-c910-4b45-9247-fe5a15a6fd03" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">To get started, I enlisted the help of the one and only <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/conor-bond-3724">Conor Bond</a><span lang="EN">. I asked him to challenge me with 11 industry and target audience combos to find creative, effective targeting strategies to work around <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/03/facebook-removes-more-targeting-options">Facebook’s recent changes</a><span lang="EN">. And from there, I plopped down into my bean bag and got to digging through audience manager.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Before we get started, let’s do a quick recap of the state of Facebook advertising:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Potential reach: </span></strong><span lang="EN">Recent <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies</a><span lang="EN"> show that there are 2.32 billion monthly active users on Facebook. Now that’s a whole lot of reach—and a whole lot of potential for advertisers to reach the wrong audience.</span></span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Advertising: </span></strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/07/facebook-statistics">Facebook reported</a><span lang="EN"> an advertising revenue of $9.16 billion in the second quarter of 2017, a 47% year-over-year increase.</span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Targeting: </span></strong><span lang="EN">Despite the changes to Facebook’s targeting options over the past year, there are still so many <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/10/facebook-ad-targeting-options">options for advertisers to find their target audience</a><span lang="EN">.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Within these targeting options, there are three types of audiences: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Custom audiences</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Lookalike audiences</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Core audiences</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Since I am not able to get in the back end of each reader’s analytics account or CRM data, I will only be providing core audience recommendations throughout this post. However, I highly recommend that all Facebook advertisers leverage <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/27/facebook-custom-audiences">custom audiences</a><span lang="EN"> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-lookalike-audiences">lookalike audiences</a><span lang="EN"> for targeting in their campaigns.</span></span></span></p>
<p>Okay, now that we’ve done some housekeeping, let’s take a look at new <strong>Facebook targeting strategies for these 11 industries looking for these 11 specific audiences.</strong></p>
<h2>1. Automotive industry: People in the market for new cars</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">According to a <a href="https://b2b.autotrader.com/agame/pdf/2016-car-buyer-journey.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study from Autotrader</a><span lang="EN">, car buyers spend 59% of their car buyer’s journey researching online. This means that this audience is likely to engage with pages posting content that helps with car research. To capture this behavior, I would recommend leveraging interest targeting toward company pages that fall into this category. Here are a few I came up with:</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Interests → search for</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Kelley Blue Book</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Autotrader</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">CarMax</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Car Gurus</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Conveniently enough, there is an entire section dedicated to vehicles in the interest section of Facebook’s core targeting options.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Hobbies &amp; activities → vehicles</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e7a30aea-04f0-47c5-aa91-544472d1f3f3" data-langcode="en">

</div>
<p><span lang="EN">So, depending on what type of car you are promoting, you can layer in one of these options to personalize your offer to individuals who have an interest in this car type. </span></p>

</div>
<h2>2. Education: People who want a master’s degree</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">If you know the story of Facebook’s origin, you’ll know that this platform first started out tailored to college students. As the platform evolved and the user base expanded, the idea stuck close to its roots—connecting individuals with others in their educational, professional, and personal network. </span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="c7bc900a-2bed-4874-85d5-1b15c4f98466" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Because the platform started out geared towards this collegiate network, educational information remains a featured part of user profiles. And with this information, Facebook is able to offer advertisers education-level targeting. This is the perfect starting point for any higher education account looking to target an audience interested in pursuing a master’s degree. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Demographics → education → education level</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">College grad</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Associate degree</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">In college</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Demographics → education → school years</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Undergrad years</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">However, when you drill into it, Facebook estimates over 69 million in potential reach for users with a college degree (just looking at the US). </span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">Again, that’s a whole lotta reach, and not something advertisers should target alone—especially if you’re looking to spend your budget efficiently. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">To optimize your audience relevance, I would recommend layering in additional targeting options. Now, to get there, let’s get more specific and say we’re a business school looking for potential MBA students:</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Demographics → work → industries</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Business &amp; finance</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Sales</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Management</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Demographics → education → field of study</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Business management</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Business administrator</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Business consultant</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Interests → pages that aid in GMAT studies</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">GMAT+</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Graduate management admission test</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">The official GMAT exam</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Travel and hospitality: People who want to take vacations</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Once I got started with this challenge, I found that there are a lot of ways to approach your targeting for travel and hospitality businesses. This gives advertisers in this space the flexibility to personalize their targeting according to their offer and iterate by testing new audiences to improve ad relevance and performance.</span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">To get started, you can layer in broad interest options, such as:</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Interests → hobbies &amp; activities → travel</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Vacations</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Tourism</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Air travel</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Interests → pages that serve content around travel</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Trip Advisor</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Kayak.com</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Booking.com</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Interests → airline pages</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Jet Blue</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Delta airlines</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">United airlines</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Behavior → travel</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Frequent travelers</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Frequent international travelers</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Returned from travel 1 week ago</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Returned from travel 2 weeks ago</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Like I said, this broad targeting is great place to start. Next, you’ll want to consider other information that informs decisions to travel or interest in travelling. I considered life events that could infer that a user would be in-market to travel soon:</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Demographics → life events</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Newly engaged (1 year)</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Newly engaged (3 months)</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Newly engaged (6 months)</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Newly wed </span></li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Dating and personal services: People interested in romantic relationships</h2>
<p>This is a tricky one because there are an estimated 36+ million users that have “single” as their relationship status on Facebook in the US.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="9cbea68b-abef-48a0-acf4-650dd0040e27" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>But not all of these people are accurately reporting this information and, even if they are, single doesn’t necessarily mean interested in a relationship. Instead, let’s consider additional signals that could infer the user is looking for a romantic relationship:</p>
<p>Demographics → relationship status:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single</li>
</ul>
<p>Interests → family and relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dating</li>
</ul>
<p>Interests → pages that serve content around dating:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bumble</li>
<li>Hinge</li>
<li>Christian Mingle</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from the individual’s characteristics, this industry can consider the impact a user’s friends may have on their behavior. There’s nothing that makes you want to start swiping like an influx of save the dates from all of your friends.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="69449f69-4c68-41c9-8e67-dffcfcb7a4ea" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Here’s how to target based on this demographic:</p>
<p>Demographics → life events → friends of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Friends of newly engaged people</li>
<li>Friends of newly weds</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Arts and entertainment: People who want to see live shows</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">As mentioned in other sections, <strong>audience layering is a strategy all advertisers should leverage to improve the relevancy of their ads. </strong>By paring down broad targeting options, you can find smaller pockets within your target audience that are more interested or more likely to be interested in your current promotion. So, for this industry, I will give two examples of how pivoting your strategy by promotion can make a considerable difference. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">First, let’s say I am an advertiser with a goal of selling tickets to a live Cardi B concert. Here’s how I would target my ideal audience based on interests:</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Interest → entertainment → live events</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Interest → Cardi B</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Interests → entertainment → music</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Hip hop music</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">I’d also use radius location targeting around the venue to reach any people who might be persuaded by proximity or looking for last-minute tickets.</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="4e8b8e73-7207-4320-9229-830ee3a9d9a1" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">And in the next campaign, I am looking for individuals who would be interested in the live tour of Wicked:</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Interest → entertainment → live Events</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Interest → entertainment → musical Theatre</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Interest → Wicked the Musical</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">I’d use radius location targeting around the venue here, too. You never know when someone’s in the market for last-minute tickets to Oz.</span></p>
<h2>6. Finance and insurance:<strong> P</strong>eople who need help financial planning for retirement</h2>
<p>If you’re in the financial and insurance business, you know that your target audience for retirement planning is varied. You can’t narrow down by age or occupation, because most adults in most jobs <em>could</em> be interested in planning for retirement.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="50184439-60aa-4e18-a02d-6b1f9035adf7" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>No, not just planning to move to the beach or start each day running in the water.</em></p>
<p>Here’s how you can target people who are likely to be considering their financial plans for retirement:</p>
<p><span lang="EN">Demographics → parents → all parents</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Parents (all)</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Parents with adult children (18-26 years)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Interests → business &amp; industry → personal finance</span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Once I got started, I found that there is quite a range of options to infer home ownership to target your home and garden promotions, including an entire section for “home &amp; garden.” </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Here’s what I’d suggest starting with:</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Interests → hobbies &amp; activities → home &amp; garden</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Home improvement</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Do it yourself (DIY)</span></li>

<h2>8. Retail: People who want to buy shoes online</h2>
<p>Let’s be real, who isn’t always in the market for new shoes? Especially our in-house analyst, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/14/employee-spotlight-patrick-henry-carrera">Patrick Henry</a>—I don’t think I’ve never known someone who loves shoes more than this guy.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>Here’s how I would use behavior and interest targeting to reach someone looking to buy new shoes:</p>
<p><span lang="EN">Behaviors → purchase behavior</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Engaged shoppers</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Interests → shopping &amp; fashion → clothing</span></p>
<ul>

<li><span lang="EN">ShoeDazzle</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>9. Real estate: People interested in selling their homes</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">The Association of Real Estate License Law Officials (ARELLO) estimates that there are about <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/quick-real-estate-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 million active real estate licensees in the United States</a><span lang="EN">. Now, that’s a lot of professionals looking to find people who are in the market for real estate services, making this a highly competitive industry for advertisers. </span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">My first thought when approaching this industry was to use life events that suggest an individual may be looking to make such a purchase:</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Demographics → life events</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Newly engaged</span></li>

</article>
</div>
<p>To target people interested in personal training sessions, I’d suggest narrowing down your audience based on fitness interests that closely align with custom personal training sessions, like high-intensity classes and high-end fitness apparel.</p>
<p>Here’s how:</p>
<p><span lang="EN">Interests → fitness and wellness:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Physical exercise</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Physical fitness</span></li>

<h2>11. B2B:<strong> B</strong>usinesses that need a new payroll software</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Now, this was a different challenge. </span></p>

But you always have the option to combine demographic <em>and</em> interest-based targeting to narrow down your search to find a potential prospect.</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Demographics → job titles</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Payroll manager</span></li>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As promised in my <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/26/facebook-objectives">previous post</a>, I am back with part two on how to leverage Facebook objectives to create a cross-funnel campaign strategy. If you didn’t have the chance to catch part one, here are the main points you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook offers three campaign objective options for advertisers: awareness, consideration, and conversion.</li>
<li>It is <em>crucial</em> that you don’t overlook your objective, optimization settings, bid strategy, or budget selections upon campaign creation.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/07/goal-talk-episode-9">Facebook ad auction</a> relies on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/13/learning-period">algorithmic learning</a> around these settings to make decisions. You need to identify the right signals and track significant data to enable this algorithm to efficiently optimize according to your marketing goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now that we are up to speed with part one….</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-funnel-next-level.jpg" alt="next level meme" width="400" height="334" /></div>
<p>For part two, I will walk you through the six key steps to building out your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/22/facebook-sales-funnel">full-funnel advertising strategy on Facebook</a>. Let’s get started!</p>
<h2>Step #1: Understand how your marketing funnel works</h2>
<p>Before we get into tactics on Facebook, let’s quickly talk about the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/07/marketing-funnel">marketing funnel</a>.  This funnel is the path that users take during their journey with your marketing activities. There are various ways to define and break down your marketing funnel, but it typically looks something like this:</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-funnel-example-of-marketing-funnel-1.jpg" alt="diagram of a marketing funnel" width="315" height="380" /></div>
<p>It’s important to recognize and understand what your marketing funnel looks like in order to optimize your cross-funnel strategy. To get there, start by asking yourself these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the sources and channels of brand discovery for your prospects?</li>
<li>What are the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/21/customer-journey-mapping">milestones in your prospect’s journey</a>? Here, think about number of touchpoints you are having with your prospects (website visits, form fills, types of actions, etc.).</li>
<li>What offers can you pair to these milestones? To match your prospect’s intent through your marketing funnel, it’s extremely valuable to have different types of offerings. Consider a white paper for new prospects versus a free trial for those further down the funnel.</li>
<li>How long does it take for a prospect to travel from top of funnel to bottom of the funnel?</li>
<li>Where are the leaks in your marketing funnel? Consider areas where you could lose your prospect.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve thought through each of these questions, you’ll be in the right mindset to get started.</p>
<h2>Step #2: Structure your Facebook Ads account</h2>
<p>Now that you’re thinking about how your marketing funnel is structured, it’s time to talk about your Facebook account. The way you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/30/facebook-ads-account-structure">structure your account</a> can make or break your ability to effectively manage and optimize your campaigns to your business goals.</p>
<p>To get started, let’s do a quick refresh. Here’s an example of what a Facebook ad account looks like:</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-funnel-account-structure.jpg" alt="Facebook funnel account structure chart" width="500" height="411" /></div>
<p>Think of your Facebook campaigns as the shell for your ad sets. Aside from your objective, the majority of decisions are made at this ad set level on Facebook. This includes your targeting, optimization settings, bid strategy, and budget. And within each ad set, you have your ads, in which you can differentiate your offer, creative, and messaging.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this post, you’re interested in targeting prospects across your funnel through Facebook so we’ll talk through an account structure that matches your marketing funnel. In order to accomplish this, I would recommend building out your campaigns in accordance to each stage in your marketing funnel. Depending on what your marketing funnel looks like and how granular you want to get, the number of campaigns will vary. To give you an idea of what this would look like, I’ll provide a simple example:</p>
<p><strong>Campaign 1</strong>: Top of funnel (TOF)</p>
<p><strong>Campaign 2:</strong> Middle of funnel (MOF)</p>
<p><strong>Campaign 3: </strong>Bottom of funnel (BOF)</p>
<p>With this structure, your first view in ads manager will be a clear representation of how much you are investing and how your relative KPIs are tracking across each stage of the funnel. Next, within your campaign, you should use your ad sets to test your offers and audiences. Here’s an example:</p>
<p><strong>Ad set 1:</strong> Offer 1 &amp; Audience 1</p>
<p><strong>Ad set 2: </strong>Offer 1 &amp; Audience 2</p>
<p><strong>Ad set 3:</strong> Offer 2 &amp; Audience 3</p>
<p><strong>Ad set 4:</strong> Offer 3 &amp; Audience 4</p>
<p>Now, within your ad set view, you can compare performance to understand how you should adjust your budget allocation or test new offers and audiences within that funnel stage.</p>
<p>Lastly, within each ad set, you have your ads. This is the perfect place to test out different creative, ad formats, and messaging within your ad set. For example:</p>
<p><strong>Ad #1: </strong>Offer &gt; Creative Variation 1 &gt; Copy Variation 1</p>
<p><strong>Ad #2:</strong> Offer &gt; Creative Variation 1 &gt; Copy Variation 2</p>
<p><strong>Ad #3: </strong>Offer &gt; Creative Variation 2 &gt; Copy Variation 1</p>
<p><strong>Ad #4: </strong>Offer &gt; Creative Variation 2 &gt; Copy Variation 2</p>
<p>As evident in my examples above, your naming convention will also be key to transparent reporting and effective account management. By clearly naming your campaigns, ad sets, and ads, you will be able to easily identify the component and make decisions without having to drill into each ad set or ad.</p>
<p>In summary, a well-organized ad account is crucial to successfully getting started with your cross-funnel strategy on Facebook.</p>
<h2>Step #3: Set objectives based on the funnel</h2>
<p>Now, that your campaigns are mapped out by funnel stage, you should be able match up the proper objective as offered by Facebook:<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/facebook-ad-campaign-objectives.png" alt="facebook campaign objectives" width="720" height="528" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60456" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/facebook-ad-campaign-objectives.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/facebook-ad-campaign-objectives-480x352.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /><br />
Here is a guide to reference when making your objective decisions based on your marketing funnel:<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/facebook-ad-objective-funnel.png" alt="facebook ad objectives based on funnel stage" width="720" height="421" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60766" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/facebook-ad-objective-funnel.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/facebook-ad-objective-funnel-480x281.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>Step #4: Select your targeting types</h2>
<p>In order to reach your campaign’s objective, you need to understand what targeting types and audiences are most appropriate for each ad set. Thankfully, Facebook offers a multitude of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/10/facebook-ad-targeting-options">targeting options</a> for advertisers. These options enable you create audiences that range from broad to specific:</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-funnel-targeting.jpg" alt="audience targeting" width="1047" height="231" /></div>
<p>These audiences can be sourced directly from Facebook’s core audience options (demographics, interests, behaviors) or from your own data (website visitors, custom audiences, lookalike audiences or LAL, etc). As your prospect moves down the funnel, your targeting should become more segmented as you are targeting more qualified users.</p>
<p>To help you decide which audiences to use in each funnel stage, here are a few recommendations:</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-funnel-targeting-per-funnel.jpg" alt="audience per funnel stage" width="1043" height="369" /></div>
<p>As you can see in the chart above, there is crossover across funnel stages. It’s important to note that the key here is to narrow down your audience. Take the lookalike recommendations, for example. At the TOF, you should widen up your audience range, allowing the algorithm to target a larger base of potential prospects. Then, when you get to MOF ad sets, you should narrow down your range to ensure that you have a closer group of qualified, potential prospects.</p>
<p><strong>You should also consider employing exclusionary audiences across your ad sets. This way, as the prospect moves through the funnel, they are not continuing to see the ads from their previous stage.</strong> This will help you control wasted spend and improve the prospect experience.</p>
<h2>Step #5: Leverage engagement audiences</h2>
<p>What better way to move prospects through your marketing funnel on Facebook than using engagement audiences? <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1707329062853572" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engagement audiences</a> allow you to reach people who have previously interacted with your page. Facebook currently offers six options for your engagement audience:</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-funnel-create-audience.jpg" alt="audience targeting options" width="554" height="742" /></div>
<p>Here’s an example of how you can use engagement audiences to boost your funnel strategy from start to finish:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Using an awareness campaign objective and broad audience targeting, reach potential prospects with an engaging video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Using a consideration campaign with a lead generation objective, target the individuals who engaged with the video in step 1 by promoting a piece of content through a lead-gen ad.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Build out a conversion campaign to target the users who completed this lead ad and entice them to convert on a product-centric offer, moving them to the bottom of your funnel.</p>
<p><strong>Added bonus: Engagement audiences are the perfect targeting type to leverage your organic reach within your paid campaigns.</strong> This provides an opportunity to collaborate with your team and pair your organic and paid efforts. Within our very own campaigns, we’ve found that engagement audiences lead to a lower <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/10/cac-vs-clv">cost per acquisition</a>.</p>
<h2>Step #6: Optimize settings &amp; conversion events</h2>
<p>As I mapped out in part one, you won’t be able to achieve your marketing goals if you’re not implementing the right settings, which includes your conversion event and optimization for ad delivery settings.</p>
<p>The<strong> conversion event </strong>is only applicable for your ad sets that fall under a conversion campaign. This is because a conversion objective relies on outside signals (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/10/11/facebook-conversion-tracking">through your pixel</a>) to fuel optimization. Therefore, when it comes to your TOF campaign, you don’t need to set a conversion event as the algorithm is able to deliver based on internal signals.</p>
<p>However, for your MOF and BOF campaigns that are set to conversion, you will be asked to select a conversion event. You should ensure that you select the appropriate conversion event based on your objective and offer. If you are promoting a whitepaper in your MOF campaign, you should select a conversion event that registers a successful download. On the other hand, you are likely promoting a higher value offer in your BOF campaign, which means your conversion event should reflect this goal. For advertisers alike, it’s not always easy to drive a significant volume of BOF leads. Therefore, if you are struggling to reach your goals, you should consider selecting a leading signal for your conversion event so that the algorithm receives sufficient signals during its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/13/learning-period">learning</a> period.</p>
<p>The <strong>optimization for ad delivery setting </strong>is where you tell the algorithm what you see as success for your ad set. As we’ve talked about through this post, your goals vary across each funnel, so it’s important to make this known within your optimization for ad delivery. Here’s an example of the appropriate settings depending on your funnel stage:<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/facebook-ads-optimization-for-ad-delivery.png" alt="facebook ads optimization for ad delivery" width="720" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60769" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/facebook-ads-optimization-for-ad-delivery.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/facebook-ads-optimization-for-ad-delivery-480x280.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>See results with your funnel-based Facebook strategy</h2>
<p>Facebook provides an excellent opportunity for advertisers to capture new prospects and move existing leads through your marketing funnel. By following the six steps mapped out in this post, you will have a promotional strategy that delights prospects and maximizes your advertising results.</p>
<p>Once you are running with your cross-funnel strategy, you should continue to iterate by testing new audiences, offers, and creative to optimize and scale your account.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Often, Facebook advertisers put so much focus on their creative, message, and targeting that they overlook their settings. While, yes, creative may be the most important part of your advertising strategy on Facebook, it won’t drive the results you’re looking for if you don’t implement the proper objectives and settings for your campaign.r</p>
<p>Put it like this: overlooking your Facebook Ads objective is like Tom Brady showing up on game day and forgetting all of the plays (which we all know would never happen, but hopefully you get the point).</p>

<p>In this guide, I will break down Facebook’s ad objectives and settings so that you know exactly what features to focus on during set up. I’ll also provide insights on how to set your next campaign up for success.</p>
<p>PS: Did you know that the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/17/facebook-click-to-call-ads">click-to-call option is now available for Website Traffic </a>campaigns?</p>
<h2><span lang="EN">Selecting your Facebook ad objectives and settings</span></h2>
<p>As we know, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/07/goal-talk-episode-9">Facebook’s ad auction</a> relies on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/13/learning-period">algorithmic learning</a> to make decisions. From who’s seeing the ad to where and when an ad shows to how much it costs, the algorithm requires a significant amount of information to make decisions. You provide some of this information when you set up your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/27/facebook-ad-targeting-options-infographic"> Facebook audience targeting</a>. But what other settings does the algorithm consider while making these decisions?</p>
<ul>
<li>Objective</li>
<li>Optimization settings</li>
<li>Bid strategy</li>
<li>Budget</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s get started with your Facebook ad objectives.</p>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>You’ll see that <strong>objective</strong> is at the top of this list. That’s because this is the first, most crucial decision you’ll make when creating your new campaign. When selecting your Facebook ad objective, you will be given three options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Awareness</li>
<li>Consideration</li>
<li>Conversion</li>
</ul>
<p>While the ad objective names are relatively straightforward, it’s important to understand what your first decision will tell the algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Awareness:</strong> Look for opportunities to increase my reach and drive brand awareness.</li>
<li><strong>Consideration:</strong> Find delivery opportunities that drives engagement and web traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Conversion:</strong> Deliver my ads when there is an opportunity to drive conversions.</li>
</ul>
<p>After you’ve chosen your Facebook ad objective, you’ll have a list of subcategories to choose from depending on your goals:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="17cd60fd-76d6-467f-bb27-020ebe024e97" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-objectives-selection.jpg" alt="Facebook objectives selection" width="865" height="470" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Once you’ve made your selection, the Facebook algorithm will review your ad objective and match your goal up to the relevant KPIs, looking something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Awareness:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Impressions</li>
<li>Reach</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Consideration:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Clicks</li>
<li>Engagement</li>
<li>Video Views</li>
<li>Messages</li>
<li>App Installs</li>
<li>Lead generation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conversion:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Conversions</li>
<li>Sales</li>
<li>Store Visits</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to understand what metrics the algorithm will favor, because this will be reflected in your campaign performance.</p>
<h3>Optimization settings</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve selected your Facebook ad objective and named your campaign, you’ll head into your ad set. This stage is all about your <strong><em>optimization settings, </em></strong>which will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimization event</li>
<li>Optimization for ad delivery</li>
<li>Bid strategy</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/139628083350822?helpref=search&amp;sr=4&amp;query=optimization%20event" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimization event</a> is a key indicator of success for the algorithm. This is a critical decision, because your choice will tell the algorithm what you count as success for your selected ad objective. Over time, the algorithm will learn from this signal and begin to understand the optimal path in ad delivery for your selections.</p>
<p>In the example below, each advertiser’s conversion objective is to drive whitepaper downloads from their campaign. Here’s what they choose for their optimization event:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertiser 1 selects their “download” conversion event</li>
<li>Advertiser 2 selects their “viewed landing page” conversion event</li>
</ul>
<p>Which advertiser will drive more conversions? That would be Advertiser 1.</p>
<p>For Advertiser 1, the algorithm will look to deliver their ads to users that are likely to complete their download. On the other hand, for advertiser 2, the algorithm will optimize by delivering their ads to users likely to visit their landing page. The signal gap between a landing page visit and a download will make the algorithm less efficient in driving conversions for Advertiser 2.</p>
<p>With your ad objective and optimization event set, you’ll need to select your ad delivery settings. This will range from impressions to landing page views up to conversions:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="4d785995-43bf-48a4-aac9-a1a621451a8c" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-objectives-ad-delivery.jpg" alt="Facebook objectives ad delivery setting" width="576" height="220" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Here, you should select your primary goal and make sure it ties back to both your initial ad objective and your optimization event.</p>
<h3>Bid strategy and budget</h3>
<p>After you’ve established your goals and translated them into your settings, you need to tell the algorithm how much you’re willing to spend. This is controlled by your <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1619591734742116?helpref=search&amp;sr=3&amp;query=bid%20strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bid strategy</a><strong>:</strong></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="6142d869-765e-43ef-9a70-25e50d337d23" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>It’s also dependent on your budget:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="eea68d6c-cfde-4598-a11d-dd51c41fc6d7" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Each of these settings for your ad set will advance the algorithm’s ability to succeed. Following set up of your ad set, the algorithm goes from understanding how to drive volume for your ad objective to understanding how to <strong><em>efficiently drive</em></strong> volume for your ad objective.</p>
<h2><span lang="EN">The Importance of Facebook Ad Objectives</span></h2>
<p>Maybe the importance of taking time to carefully define your Facebook ad objectives and settings is best explained with an analogy to Target…because who doesn’t love a good trip to Target?</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="f88b8735-7f65-4bae-ba2a-82d6ba6cd2d5" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-objectives-target-analogy.jpg" alt="Facebook objectives target lady" width="530" height="460" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><strong>Scene:</strong> On a whim you’ve arrived and walked into the door of Target. You have no purchase intentions, so you walk in without a shopping list or goal in mind. Read: you’re missing your <strong><em>objective.</em></strong></p>
<p>You’re immediately drawn into the clothing section, because let’s be honest, who can pass up a new sweater or bathing suit (even if it is November)? After adding a few items to your cart, you head right into the shoes section, and you start trying on a few pairs. Throwing your new shoes into the cart, you venture back into the aisle. You continue aimlessly, walking through the kitchen supplies and contemplating that Magic Bullet you’ve seen in all those commercials, and then you find yourself in the home decor section. Three more items later, and your cart is starting to overflow. You look down at your watch and realize you’ve wasted an hour walking up and down every aisle.</p>
<p>Because you never set your <strong><em>objective, </em></strong>you didn’t have the chance to select your <strong><em>optimal path</em></strong> to completing your shopping trip at Target in an efficient manner.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve exhausted each aisle and you have a full cart, you head over to checkout. You place your items on the belt, and the cashier begins scanning your items in. Your new shoes scan through and you see the price:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="dfab0072-bf53-478f-885f-793382f6b021" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-objectives-blinking.jpg" alt="Facebook objectives blinking man" width="1000" height="500" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Because you didn’t set an objective or optimal path of your shopping trip, you’re spending way above your typical <strong><em>target cost</em></strong> for a pair of shoes. The items continue to scan through, and your grand total continues to add up. Hundreds of dollars later, you realize you’ve spent way too much because you never set yourself a <strong><em>budget.</em></strong></p>
<p>Now, I know this took a while to get to, but what I’m trying to tell you is this: When you don’t consider your campaign settings important, the Facebook algorithm could perform just like this unplanned trip to Target, aimlessly delivering your ads and frivolously spending your budget.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you use any kind of automation in your Google Ads or Facebook Ads account, you may have asked yourself recently: What does it mean when Google or Facebook says it&#8217;s &#8220;Learning,&#8221; and how can you avoid it?</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/learning-period-google-ads-facebook.jpg" alt="learning period in google ads and facebook advertising" width="681" height="445" /></div>
<p>Trust me, I get it – and I was searching the same thing just a few months ago. After extensive research and sifting through support docs, we’ve built up a strong understanding of what the learning period is, why it exists, when it occurs, and how you can navigate the negative implications that come with it.</p>
<p>So, with this blog post, I hope I can answer your questions and save you some time on your quest to navigate the learning period.</p>
<h2>First things first&#8230;what is the learning period?</h2>
<p><strong>Google’s definition: </strong>“After you make a change to your bid strategy, it takes time for Google Ads to gather the performance data it needs to optimize your bids.”</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-ads-learning-period-2.png" alt="google ads learning period" width="237" height="130" /></div>
<p><strong>Facebook’s definition:</strong> “After you create a new ad set or make a significant edit to an existing one, our system starts learning who to show ads to. This learning isn&#8217;t a change to the way our system works, but we&#8217;re showing the status to let you know when performance is still stabilizing.”</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ads-learning-period.png" alt="facebook ads learning period" width="225" height="140" /></div>
<p><strong>In short: </strong>The learning period is the time it takes for the platform’s algorithm to learn from recent, significant changes.</p>
<h2>When and where does the learning period occur?</h2>
<p><strong>Google Ads: </strong>While on Facebook you will incur a learning period across any bid strategy, on Google, you will only provoke a learning period for an automated,<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/15/smart-bidding"> smart bidding strategy</a>. These bid strategies include: Target CPA, Target ROAS, Maximize Conversions, and Enhanced CPC (eCPC). The learning period will be noticeable in the status column at your campaign level.</p>
<p>NOTE: As of April 2021, Target CPA and Target ROAS are being retired. <a href="/blog/ws/2021/03/31/google-retiring-tcpa-troas">Learn more here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook:</strong> Since budget and settings are created at the ad set level (aside from the new feature <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/153514848493595">campaign budget optimization</a>), you will see the learning status in the delivery column of your ad set.</p>
<h2>How long does the learning period last?</h2>
<p><strong>Google: </strong>On Google Ads, the learning period typically lasts 7 days since the last significant edit to that campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook: </strong>The learning period will last until your ad set reaches 50 optimization events within a 7-day period since the last significant edit.</p>
<p><strong>The difference? </strong>Facebook’s algorithm requires a threshold of data to re-learn, while Google requires a set timeframe for the learning process.</p>
<h2>What types of changes can trigger the learning period?</h2>
<p><strong>On Google Ads: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Implementing a new smart bidding strategy</li>
<li>Change in the settings for the bid strategy</li>
<li>Change to conversion actions: updating an existing action or creating a new one</li>
<li>Large changes in budget or bid</li>
<li>Significant changes to the campaign’s composition</li>
</ul>
<p>Typically, changes to keywords, ad groups, or ads will not trigger a learning period. However, if you introduce bulk changes to several of these components, you may incur the learning period to your campaign.</p>
<p><strong>On Facebook:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Any change to your audience targeting</li>
<li>Large changes in budget</li>
<li>Significant changes to creative (changing existing or creating new ads)</li>
<li>Any change to your settings (e.g. optimization event, conversion window)</li>
<li>Pausing and then re-enabling your ad set/campaign after 7 days has past</li>
</ul>
<h2>What happens during the learning period?</h2>
<p>For both Facebook and Google Ads, you should expect delivery and efficiency to go down throughout the learning period. <strong>Yes, this means that you are likely to see the campaign’s daily spend decrease while the CPA (cost per acquisition) increases and conversion rate decreases.</strong></p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/learning-period-say-what.jpg" alt="algorithmic learning period" width="666" height="500" /></div>
<p>Yup, I get it, it’s not the ideal scenario. However, you can’t just sit on your hands and avoid optimizing your campaigns in fear of the learning period. Instead, you need to learn how to control the implications and allow your campaign the time to re-learn and improve with the changes you’ve made.</p>
<h2>So, why does the learning period happen?</h2>
<p>As we know, the ad auction systems on Facebook and Google Ads are dependent upon the platforms’ algorithms, which are built from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/28/machine-learning-applications">machine learning technology</a>. Just as Google needs your Quality Score and bid to determine when you show up in the ad auction, Google also needs to understand what delivers the results (conversions) you’re asking it to optimize for. In summary, the algorithm needs the time to work with the signal and understand what is proven to work and drive results.</p>
<p>Google’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1eYniJ0Rnk">DeepMind video</a> offers the perfect analogy for the learning period. In the video you’ll watch machine learning technology play its first game of Atari, with zero training or understanding of how to play. After several failures and just about 240 minutes of training, the technology finds the <strong>fastest and most effective way</strong> to beat the game.</p>
<p>This is exactly what the algorithm is doing while your campaign is in a learning period. It’s digesting the new information and learning how it can drive the results you’ve optimized it towards. During this time, the algorithm learns from each delivery. And as the impressions build up, the algorithm gathers the significant data it needs to make decisions and understand how it can more effectively deliver to the goals you’ve selected.</p>
<h2>Recommendations to Minimize the Learning Period’s Impact</h2>
<h3>In Google Ads</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bid Strategy: </strong>Consider the best bid strategy for you. As mentioned above, there are only four bid strategies that are associated with this learning period. If you are looking to test out smart bidding, I would recommend setting up an <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6261395?co=ADWORDS.IsAWNCustomer=false&amp;hl=en">experiment</a> first. This way, you can assess the performance in a controlled environment with less negative impact.</li>
<li><strong>Budgeting</strong>: Follow the 20% rule: Avoid budget changes larger than 20% of your current budget.</li>
<li><strong>Settings: </strong>Give Google the right signals. For example: If your goal is to drive conversions, but you don’t have any conversions set up, you can’t expect a smart bidding strategy to drive any conversions. This is because the algorithm doesn’t know what it’s supposed to find.</li>
<li><strong>Conversions: </strong>Be careful about your changes to conversion actions! If you know you need to make several changes to your conversion actions, you should plan ahead and schedule these changes in bulk. This way, you will only incur one learning period rather than several within a similar time frame.</li>
</ul>
<h3>In Facebook Ads</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Selecting your optimization event: </strong>As I’ve mentioned above, Facebook requires 50 “optimization events” to move out of the learning stage. If you are struggling to reach 50 optimization events, I would highly recommend testing a higher funnel optimization event. For example: You have your ad set optimizing towards a form fill, but you can’t reach 50 form events within the 7-day period. Instead, you could test landing page views as the optimization event. This will tell the algorithm to find people in your audience that are likely to click and successfully reach your landing page. While this is not the final result you are looking for, it’s a leading signal and will give the algorithm the sufficient data it needs to find your audience and reach optimal delivery.</li>
<li><strong>Review your optimization and ad delivery settings: </strong>Strategically think through your selection for optimization and the associated conversion window. For example: If your conversion window is set to 1 day, you are giving the algorithm 7 days to gather 50 optimization events that happen within 1 day of the ad click. If you find this slowing down your learning progress, you should try a 7-day click window.</li>
</ul>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ads-learning-period-optimize-settings.png" alt="facebook learning period" width="607" height="277" /></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budgeting</strong>: Similar to Google Ads, you should keep in mind the 20% rule when navigating budget changes on Facebook. Avoid budget changes larger than 20% of your current budget. For example: if you budget is at $500, don’t change it to anything over $600 or less than $400. Over time, you can implement these 20% changes incrementally to maintain delivery and reach the budget you are aiming for.</li>
<li><strong>Creative: </strong>Avoid bulk changes to your assets. For example: If you pause out one ad, or create one new one, most likely, you will not incur a learning period.</li>
<li><strong>Making changes: </strong>Schedule and plan out your significant changes in intervals. For example, if you want to create a new exclusionary audience and apply it to all your ad sets, you should do so in intervals. This can be done by adjusting one ad set at a time, waiting until the learning status is removed, and then moving onto the next. This will help you maintain your overall, account-level delivery.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Final Takeaways</h2>
<p>Fear the learning period no more! Just follow these guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Think before you implement!</li>
<li>Give the algorithms the right signals</li>
<li>Give the algorithms enough data</li>
<li>Be patient! Let the algorithms take the time they needs to learn, because it will pay off in the long run.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p><strong>Free</strong> leads of course! So when I learned about an overlooked tactic that allowed us to start funneling our Facebook page traffic into leads at zero cost, you can imagine how I excited I was.</p>
<p>Today I’m going to walk you through the steps to building out a Facebook lead form to pin at the top of your business page. Spoiler alert: getting free leads for your business through Facebook is incredibly simple!</p>
<h2>Before You Generate Free Leads, You Need Traffic</h2>
<p>As we’ve talked about over the past few months, Facebook has made <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/12/facebook-news-feed-changes">major changes to their news feed</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/02/facebook-ad-transparency">advertising transparency</a>. Going back to Mark Zuckerberg’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104413015393571" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement post</a>, we remember his statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>“As we roll this out, you&#8217;ll see less public content like posts from businesses, brands, and media. And the public content you see more will be held to the same standard – it should encourage meaningful interactions between people.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span lang="EN">While this seems scary at a first glance, the keyword here is <strong><em>less</em></strong> – Facebook isn’t going to get rid of the revenue they make from advertisers, they are simply going to limit the quantity and demand more quality from their business pages. Therefore, more than before, it’s crucial for advertisers to create <em>meaningful </em>content and build up engagement with their page on Facebook.</span></p>
<h2>How to Generate Free Leads on Facebook</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">By posting engaging content on Facebook, you’ll grow your organic following and start driving more visits to your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/16/facebook-business-page">Facebook business page</a> than before. Now, here’s your opportunity to funnel this page traffic into free leads for your business.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Your Facebook business page should be treated like your website’s homepage&#8230;and you wouldn’t leave your homepage without a compelling call to action, would you?</span></p>

<h3>8 Steps to Creating Your Pinned Lead Ad on Facebook</h3>
<p>While this may look like a long list of steps, trust me, it only takes roughly 10-20 minutes to get done. That&#8217;s a small time investment for free leads!</p>
<h4><span lang="EN">Step 1: Navigate to your forms library. </span></h4>
<p><span lang="EN">Go to your Facebook page, select “publishing tools” and then navigate to “forms library” on the left sidebar:</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="61d1c593-3aed-4c10-9526-13da5a784e39" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<h4><span lang="EN">Step 2: Create the lead form.</span></h4>
<p><span lang="EN">Starting out in the content section: name your form, add an introduction and list out your questions. By sure to add your privacy policy and include a link to your thank you page. </span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="524b6488-4e55-458b-88a1-40825f9f6e4f" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<h4>Step 3: Review your settings.</h4>
<p>Once the content section is complete, review the settings. In order to complete this process, you’ll need to adjust the form configuration settings from restricted to open:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="9542a45d-8884-46ee-870b-85e4d0289dbc" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Now your form is ready!</p>
<h4>Step 4: Create the campaign.</h4>
<p>Navigate to Ads Manager to create your lead generation campaign:</p>

</article>
</div>
<h4>Step 5: Set up your campaign.</h4>
<p>There’s no need to specify your targeting or adjust the default campaign settings as your ad will only show in your page’s pinned post position. However, to ensure that this will be a non-paid tactic, make sure you set up your campaign with the following settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily budget: $5</li>
<li>Schedule: Set the end date to 24 hours after you publish the campaign.</li>
</ul>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e238d5ea-692d-43e5-9f3d-4654085771a2" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Since we’ll need the campaign to be reviewed before pausing it out, this will ensure that you will spend no more than $5 from the campaign in total.</p>
<h4>Step 6: Publish!</h4>
<p>Publish the campaign and navigate to page posts to find your ads post:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="3a04825c-8311-465b-905c-8ec09e50a0d4" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Pick the right ad post and select “publish” in the actions drop down.</p>
<h4>Step 7: Pin the post.</h4>
<p>Now, head to your business page and<a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/235598533193464?helpref=search&amp;sr=1&amp;query=pin%20post"> pin your new post.</a></p>

</div>
<h4>Step 8: Pause the ad campaign.</h4>
<p>Finally, head back to ads manager and pause out your campaign.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paid search conquesting has always been a controversial topic in the pay-per-click world. This is because the tactic is notorious for starting bidding wars. During a bidding war, both parties can be negatively impacted as their brand name visibility is threatened and their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/cpc">CPCs</a> increase. However, aside from the controversy, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/26/competitive-ads">competitive search campaigns</a> can be a new source to capture brand visibility and awareness among a highly relevant audience.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this article I will be discussing ways to mitigate the risks and reap the benefits of a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/09/competitor-keywords">competitive search</a> campaign. Throughout this discussion, I will map out the intent scale of brand search behavior and share strategies on how to apply this scale to optimizing your own <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/04/google-competitive-ad-policy">competitive search campaigns</a>.</p>
<h2>The Intent Scale of a Branded Search</h2>
<p>Whether you’re structuring your campaign with keywords of your own brand or a competitor’s brand name, it’s crucial to identify the intent behind each keyword and its potential search terms. In order to do so, I put together an intent scale that classifies four segments ranging from “researcher” to “at-risk customer”:</p>

</div>
<p><em>Note: This scale may not be the appropriate organization for every advertiser. However, I am introducing this as a way to classify the strategies discussed throughout the remainder of this post.</em></p>
<p>To review this methodology and visualize real-life examples, I decided to analyze a highly competitive ad auction: the meal plan delivery industry. Focusing on the SERP for Plated, this section will map out five different search scenarios and identify their place on the intent scale.</p>
<h3>Scenario #1: Broad brand search</h3>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="861da081-0ad3-44f8-8784-e0571f22a6d9" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/broad_brand_search_800x_0.png" alt="broad brand search" width="800" height="632" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>The broad version of a competitor’s name alone is a difficult query to classify. Due to the limited information, this searcher could be classified as any one of the four segments:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="6bd9d384-2a93-4c0a-abb8-de536f215b86" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<h3>Scenario #2: Navigational query</h3>
<p>Next, I searched for “plated.com”:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="7bf570e6-9e31-425a-b2e8-02daf917d734" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/navigational_query_800x.png" alt="navigational query" width="800" height="666" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>While the addition of “.com” is a minor tweak of my first search term, the intent is completely different. When I purposely seek out Plated’s website, the likelihood that I would click (expected click-through rate) on a competitor’s ad in this scenario drastically drops.</p>
<p>Although the intent behind the query becomes more targeted, the keyword alone does not allow us to classify the scenario in just one of the four segments:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="d62c1338-3a88-418d-a336-cc2e39a40b5d" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/searcher_classifications_800x_1.png" alt="searcher classifications" width="800" height="135" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<h3>Scenario #3: “Consideration” modifier</h3>
<p>Now here’s an example of a search query from someone who identifies themselves as a prospect in the consideration stage:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="d0471b74-2148-4d64-bb1f-111e20d42319" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/consideration_modifier_800x.png" alt="consideration modifier" width="800" height="651" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>With the intent to find reviews, we can safely say that this user has narrowed down their consideration set and is looking to gather further information. Therefore, this query allows us to identify the searcher as a prospect:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="b5327dab-0035-4fce-a47a-956532a65ae2" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/prospect_searcher_800x.png" alt="prospect searcher" width="800" height="145" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<h3>Scenario #4: Customer query</h3>
<p>Next, I identified myself as an active Plated customer by searching for a login page:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="c56eb662-cae9-4bb7-96b8-3a2d499fa00d" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/customer_query_800x.png" alt="customer query" width="800" height="535" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>While there are other factors in the ad auction (such as Quality Score, bid, budget, etc.), it’s safe to assume that Home Chef and Blue Apron have added “sign in” as a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/06/negative-keyword-guide">negative keyword</a> in their campaign or ad group containing the brand name “Plated.” Since this user has an active account to sign into, we would classify them as a customer in the intent scale:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="467b6ee9-8a95-4b19-bcd8-b3607b177a4c" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/customer20searcher.png" alt="customer searcher" width="899" height="163" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<h3>Scenario #5: At-risk queries</h3>
<p>Lastly, I identified as an “at-risk” customer by looking for an alternative option:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="000283a6-814c-4b68-8078-0f3efeae4de6" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/at-risk20queries.png" alt="at-risk queries" width="596" height="429" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>In the first three examples, I am conducting searches to exclusively find Plated. On the other hand, in the example above, I am performing an inclusive search, showing that I am open to exploring other options. Here, it’s evident that Plated’s competitors realize my behavior change, as they quickly take over the top of the SERP. While I chose to identify as an at-risk customer for this search, this query could also be classified as a prospect:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="3185edcc-e172-43e5-bd03-2c93739c6823" data-langcode="en">

<h2>How to Use the Intent Scale for Competitive Campaigns</h2>
<p>So, as I just mapped out, there is a wide range of intent and value behind each type of brand search. In this section, I am going to introduce four strategies that you can employ at each <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/23/shopping-campaign-optimization">level of intent</a> to help improve the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/10/04/adwords-roi">ROI</a> of your competitive search strategy.</p>
<h3><span lang="EN">1. Broad Branded Search</span></h3>
<p>As I introduced with our first search query example, “Plated”, it’s difficult to understand the intent behind this searcher. Was I looking to login? Visit their website? Buy from Plated? Read more information? Consider alternative options?</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="698451d1-176f-4629-b36d-0c1be0864c8e" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/broad20brand20search20intent.png" alt="broad brand search intent" width="512" height="341" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>With the extent of unknowns in this scenario, leveraging remarketing lists for search ads is a unique way to maintain position in your prospect’s consideration set while spending your budget on more qualified clicks. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/03/12/remarketing-lists-for-search-ads">Remarketing lists for search ads (RLSA)</a> is a targeting feature that allows advertisers to target past website visitors on the search network. For this broad query, I would recommend utilizing the “targeting” audience option:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="3218471f-a5f4-46ba-9cb7-d81748879183" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/targeting20audience20option.png" alt="targeting audience option" width="767" height="125" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>This will ensure that you only enter the ad auction on broad competitor terms when the searcher has been to your site. While we would use targeting in this scenario, it would be highly recommended to utilize observation audiences across the rest of your competitive segments. This will allow you to understand your website visitor’s interest in your competitors while employing more conservative or aggressive bid strategies when appropriate.</p>
<p>By pairing these broad, brand keywords with your past website visitors, you are in a better position to plead your case and influence the prospect:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0c7660ba-2487-4594-8c91-e11efa1e1967" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/boost20ad20relevancy.png" alt="boost ad relevancy" width="512" height="277" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Not only will this strategy impact your consumer journey, but it will boost the relevancy of your ads and ultimately improve your expected click-through rate. As we talked about earlier, a stronger expected CTR = higher Quality Score, better ad rank, lower costs, and a healthier search account.</p>
<h3><span lang="EN">2. Competitive Research Search Intent</span></h3>
<p>A <a href="https://www.inc.com/craig-bloem/84-percent-of-people-trust-online-reviews-as-much-.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study by Forbes</a> reports: “91 percent of people regularly or occasionally read online reviews, and 84 percent trust online reviews as much as a personal recommendation.”</p>
<p><span lang="EN">With this in mind, in the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/31/in-market-audiences-for-search"> paid search world</a>, we should expect that our company’s and competitor’s prospects will be taking to search to read reviews and make their purchase decision. This makes for an opportune intent segment to capture in your conquest campaign. To get you started, here are a few additive keywords that could fall under this segment:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Compare</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Similar to</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Versus</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Reviews</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span lang="EN">3. Competitor’s Customer Search Intent</span></h3>
<p>As mapped out in scenario #4, bidding on common customer-centric searches of your competitors may lead to wasted spend and low ROI. To avoid this scenario, here is a list of <em>negative</em> keywords that you can add to your competitive search campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Sign in</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Login</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Customer service</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Contact</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Support</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">This will prevent your ads from showing up on very low-intent searches.</span></p>
<h3>4. Competitor Customer Churn Search</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Lastly, leveraging the “<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/05/12/customer-churn">churn</a><span lang="EN">” search behavior of your competitor’s customers and prospects is a powerful way to enter the consideration phase and capture quality leads. Here are a few additive keywords you can leverage for this tactic:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Cancel</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Alternative         </span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Competitor</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Quick Review</h2>
<p>As we reviewed through this post, competitive search campaigns have their downfalls and benefits. In order to control your wasted spend, it’s important to map out the potential intent segments.</p>
<p>Once you understand which keywords fall under which intent segment, you will be able to execute a conquest campaign that employs the right strategy at the right time while producing ROI.
