<h2>General holiday marketing tips and guidelines</h2>
<p>Before we dive into specific tactics and campaigns to run, let&#8217;s first cover some general guidelines that will help you stand out above your competitors and boost the success of your efforts.</p>
<h3>1. Get your preparations right</h3>
<p>While July to September is the ideal time for businesses to start preparations for <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/08/holiday-advertising-best-practices-2020">holiday season sales</a>, it is certainly not too late to start now. As a smaller business and equipped with the tips in this post, you still have plenty of time to come up with a campaign or program to boost your revenue.</p>
<p>Here’s what to consider when preparing your business for the holiday season:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Product inventory: </strong>Will you need to stock up on particularly popular items? Bring new items onboard for gift-wrapping or seasonality?</li>
<li><strong>Marketing strategy:</strong> What channels will be most effective in communicating with your audience, and what is the overall message you want your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/2020-holiday-marketing-strategy-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holiday promotions</a> to convey?</li>
<li><strong>Promotional materials:</strong> How will you get the word out? Online ads and social media posts? <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing/what-is-print-advertising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Print ads</a> or in-store flyers?</li>
<li><strong>Sales and offers:</strong> What can you offer to customers that will appeal to their current desires and needs?</li>
<li><strong>Budget:</strong> Do you have any advertising budget you can use? Will you need to cut back on some tactics from last year? What can you afford to offer discounts on?</li>
<li><strong>Your customers: </strong>What is different about your customers at this time? How can you appeal to their adjusted wants and needs?</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Choose the right marketing channels</h3>
<p>Choosing the right marketing channels to promote your holiday campaigns will help you to ensure the time, money, and energy spent are all worth it. It will also help you to better target your audience and cater your messaging, ensuring more success and sales. There are a number of channels to choose from, including (but not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social media:</strong> organic posts and paid ads on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Twitter, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Search engines:</strong> Google and Bing Ads, SEO blog posts, <a href="/blog/ws/2020/06/08/what-is-google-my-business">Google business profile</a> posts.</li>
<li><strong>Email marketing: </strong>run a holiday email series or include holiday deals in your regular newsletters.</li>
<li><strong>Offline marketing: </strong>local newspaper ads, in-store flyers, radio and TV ads, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every marketing platform is unique and has a different kind of audience, and not all of them are going to be the best fit for your business. Take a look at your marketing metrics from this past year and see if you can pinpoint your top-performing channels. This can help you prioritize the implementation of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/10/15/holiday-marketing-tips">holiday marketing tips</a> in this guide.</p>

<h3>3. Create unique and seasonal landing pages</h3>
<p>Many businesses make the mistake of not creating separate landing pages for their product and service offerings. Not only are campaign-specific landing pages a must (for any time of the year), but it can also be helpful to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/11/27/seasonal-landing-pages">give your landing pages a holiday theme or flare</a>. Make it clear that you&#8217;re offering something special for this specific time.</p>
<p>With a landing page for each product or service, you can provide customers with a clear picture of each of your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/13/sales-promotion-examples">special offers,</a> and since they will have all of the details and a single call to action on one page, your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/10/holiday-shopping-statistics-2018">holiday conversion rates are likely to increase</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some important tips to create <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/08/event-landing-pages">high-converting landing pages</a> for your sales:</p>
<ul>
<li>The page must be well-thought-out in terms of user experience.</li>
<li>Don’t include too much text on your page; just provide the essential details.</li>
<li>Make the page scannable so your customers can easily identify what’s in it for them.</li>
<li>Use a suitable <a href="/blog/ws/2021/10/05/best-call-to-action-phrases">call to action</a>, strategically placed on the page.</li>
<li>Make it crystal clear as to how users can buy &amp; apply discounts.</li>
<li>Clear the path for your customers so they can complete the desired action in a few simple steps.</li>
<li>Use countdown timers to add excitement and a bit of a scarcity effect.</li>

<h3>4. Start early but end later</h3>
<p>People go crazy to shop for the holidays and are eagerly looking for discounts and offers, so, you can easily win the match if you <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/when-should-you-start-holiday-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">start your holiday marketing</a> before the competition does, and even extending your promotions to go on longer than that of your competition. I have used this strategy myself in previous years and it has helped me to generate six-figure results before the official &#8220;arrival&#8221; of the holiday season. You can use the same strategy to boost your revenue too!</p>

<h3>5. Ensure your business can handle increases in demand</h3>
<p>Before launching your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/08/holiday-advertising-best-practices-2020">holiday marketing and advertising campaigns</a>, do a final check to ensure that everything is ready according to the plan and that you can handle a boost in orders and sales. This includes making sure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have enough inventory so there is no shortage of products, or a backup plan for if you do run out.</li>
<li>Your staff is prepared and trained for higher demands than normal (packaging, shipping, support, etc.)</li>
<li>Your website is able to manage sudden spikes in traffic. You may need to contact your website host to confirm this.</li>

<h2>Must-try holiday marketing tactics</h2>
<p>The tips above form the foundation of any successful holiday marketing plan. Now lets get into the tried-and-true tactics.</p>
<h3>6. Run time-limited sales</h3>
<p>Running popup online sales is another way to boost your sales during holiday shopping time. With this method, you increase your discount or offer an exclusive deal just for a few hours, such as by increasing a 45% off discount to 50% off for one hour only. You can even do this 2-3 times in a day and multiple times during the sale. <a href="https://www.dotcomonly.com/hostgator-black-friday/">Hostgator</a> uses this strategy to generate millions of revenues during its Black Friday sales. Here are some more tips for using hourly or time-limited sales:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use pop-ups and countdown timers to alert users about your limited-time sales.</li>
<li>Use different discount coupons for each sale to track particularly popular deals or time slots.</li>
<li>Promote the sale on your website and through social media and email.</li>

<h3>8. Offer freebies</h3>
<p>Offering something free is a great strategy to boost sales because customers love to get things for free. During the holiday season, people are in shopping/money-spending mode, so offering something free will be like a breath of fresh air to them, and may even encourage them to buy from you! You can give free gift cards, free products, or free shipping to your customers.</p>
<p>Free shipping is almost a must for holiday sales. Consumers are attracted to that kind of offer and chances are, your competitors are offering it, so don’t give them a chance to steal your customers!</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="fe72574c-e562-499d-8a37-86959cc1976b" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">

</article>
</div>
<p>If you’re <a href="/blog/ws/2014/10/01/marketing-ideas-for-small-businesses">budget-conscious</a>, just make sure you do the math so that your offers are valuable to your customers as well as ultimately profitable for you. You’ll need to calculate your product cost and profit margins to create offers like “Buy 3 and Get 1 Free” or “Spend $100 and get $15 Off.”</p>

<h3>9. Run referral discounts</h3>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2019/05/06/referral-marketing">Referral marketing</a> is always a successful strategy but it works really well during the holidays. Encourage your customers to refer your products to someone else (their friends, relatives, etc.) by offering a discount. For example, you can give 10% extra or $20 extra discount if the customer refers you to someone.</p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="3d96a514-b8de-4700-865c-50b270e58414" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">

<h3>10. Try out virtual reality</h3>
<p>As you know, the world is showing unprecedented online behavior due to social distancing. So, if you’re an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/08/holiday-marketing-tips">ecommerce business looking for holiday success</a>, you may want to lean on virtual reality features to enable consumers to tour and browse your products from the safety of their homes.

<h2>Channel-specific holiday marketing strategies</h2>
<p>The above tactics can help you to increase sales during the holidays and give your 2021 revenue a lift, but how will you get the word out about them? As mentioned in the first section of this guide, there are many channels to choose from, and the best channel will vary from business to business. In this section, I&#8217;ll cover tips for the channels that tend to perform well across industries.</p>
<h3> 11. Run a Google Ads campaign</h3>
<p>Running Google Ads during the holidays can help you get discovered by and win over new customers. Think about the terms consumers in your target audience are searching for when they go onto Google during this season. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;best christmas gifts for dads in 2021&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;carpet cleaning specials&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;best black friday laptop sales&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8230;and many others.</p>
<p>Bid on the queries your customers are typing into the Google search box as they look to prepare for, shop for, and celebrate the holiday season. This may include products, services, brand names, and roundups. Keep in mind also that consumers aren&#8217;t only thinking about the holidays during the holidays, but also about more logisitcal needs for the upcoming year, such as health insurance.</p>

<p>Also, make sure you know how to <a href="/blog/ws/2013/11/26/holiday-promotions">manage Google Ads promotions, budget, and bids for the holidays</a> and that you have <a href="/blog/ws/2021/05/24/google-ads-conversion-tracking">conversion tracking</a> set up in your Google Ads account.
