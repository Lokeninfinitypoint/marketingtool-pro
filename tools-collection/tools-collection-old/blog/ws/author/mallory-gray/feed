<h2>What are Instagram Highlights?</h2>
<p>Instagram Story Highlights, also known simply as Instagram Highlights, are collections of pictures, videos, and posts that you’ve posted to your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/instagram-story-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram Story</a> in the past. These curated collections are often referred to as “albums,” and these albums are usually different categories of topics.</p>
<p>Unlike<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/16/instagram-stories-analytics"> Instagram Stories</a> which vanish after 24 hours, Instagram Highlights live permanently on your profile, allowing you to add or delete content from them at any time. These albums sit right underneath your profile bio section and above your regular feed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-shea.jpg" alt="Instagram Highlights - Shea Whitfield instagram profile page" width="468" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76761 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-shea.jpg 468w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-shea-234x300.jpg 234w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></p>

Let’s keep this growth train rolling with this <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite30BestWaysToPromote.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Marketing_The30BestWaysToPromoteYourBusiness_Download">list of 30 ways to promote your business</a>!</p>
<div id="how-to-create-and-add-instagram-highlights"></div>
<h2>How to create and add Instagram Highlights</h2>
<p>Before you can start sharing great content on your Highlights, you must first learn how to create them! The first step to this process is to make sure that Instagram’s auto-archiving feature is turned on. This feature automatically archives and saves each Story you post to your Instagram feed or story to the cloud, eliminating the worry of losing any valuable content. Once this feature is turned on, you can share and repost any content that you’ve posted even after it disappears from your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/07/instagram-story-ads">Instagram Stories</a>. To locate the archive feature, follow these steps:</p>
<h3>1. Navigate to the settings of your Instagram account</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-settings.jpg" alt="Instagram Highlights - instagram settings page" width="410" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76762 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-settings.jpg 410w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-settings-205x300.jpg 205w" sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px" /></p>
<h3>2. Click on the “Story” button</h3>

<h3>3. Make sure the “Save to Archive” button is turned on</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-story-controls.jpg" alt="Instagram Highlights - instagram privacy screen" width="419" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76763 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-story-controls.jpg 419w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-story-controls-210x300.jpg 210w" sizes="(max-width: 419px) 100vw, 419px" /></p>
<h3>4. Create an Instagram Highlight</h3>
<p>After you’ve made sure the “Save to Archive” button is turned on, your next step is to create an Instagram Story Highlight! To do this, go to your profile and tap the “Story Highlights” button below your username and bio.</p>

<p>Click “New” and pick the Stories you want to add to your Highlight.</p>
<h3>5. Add cover and title</h3>

<p>Tap “Done” or “Add” and you’re all set!</p>

<h2>9 ways to use Instagram Highlights to grow your business</h2>
<p>You could just include all your Instagram Stories in an Instagram Story Highlight, but that isn’t very appealing to your followers, and it certainly won’t encourage customer <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/07/customer-engagement-strategy">engagement</a>. This feature is much more effective if you have multiple highlights that feature the different types of Instagram Stories you create. So here are nine Instagram Highlights ideas you can use to get your followers and customers engaged.</p>
<h3>1. Showcase your products</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to promote your business and engage with your customers is by creating an Instagram Story Highlight promoting your products or services.</p>
<p>According to Instagram, <a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/500000-advertisers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">75% of users take an action</a>, such as visiting a website or making a purchase, after looking at <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-ad-copy">ads on the platform</a>. Whether or not active Instagram users have engaged with your business before, if they’re browsing your profile and see a highlight dedicated to “Products,” they might be more likely to click through the content included in your highlight versus scrolling through your entire feed.</p>
<p>Your highlight will be an easier and faster way to find information about your offerings, and you can direct customers to your website, to sign up for a newsletter, or, ideally, to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/26/instagram-stories-shopping">make a purchase via Instagram</a>. By tagging products in your highlights with the Instagram Stories stickers (interactive elements that you can add to engage with your followers), you can showcase your products more creatively and in less direct or salesy ways.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at how <a href="https://www.letterfolk.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIjMq6hLj16gIVCo7ICh1WWQ5VEAAYASAAEgIQD_D_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Letterfolk</a>, a home decor company that offers unique paper goods and gifts, showcases its products.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-letterfolk.jpg" alt="Instagram Highlights - letterfolk instagram profile" width="370" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76767 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-letterfolk.jpg 370w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-letterfolk-185x300.jpg 185w" sizes="(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px" /></p>
<p>Letterfolk organizes its Instagram Story Highlights to showcase different products they offer—tile mats, calendars, ABC prints, and more. This allows users to find more information about the specific products they’re interested in. This is a good way to make separate product highlights focused on seasonal collections, new releases, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">product promotions</a>, and more. Using a similar approach, depending on how many products your business offers, you might combine all product-related stories into a single album.</p>
<p>A great way to include a CTA in these stories is to use the “See More” link, engaging with your followers and directing them to find more exciting information about your offerings on your website.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlight-everyday.jpg" alt="Instagram Highlights - example of an instagram story highlight" width="397" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76768 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlight-everyday.jpg 397w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlight-everyday-199x300.jpg 199w" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Letterfolk uses the “See More” link on their “New” Highlight.</em></p>
<h3>2. Promote events</h3>
<p>As we all know, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business">social media</a> is a great place to promote events and build brand awareness, especially because users look for information there. se the Stories feature to showcase past events, promote upcoming ones, and help raise awareness about others. This will allow followers to get a better idea of what the events your business actually hosts are like—and increase interest for future ones!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-boston.jpg" alt="Instagram Highlights - boston women instagram page." width="373" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76769 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-boston.jpg 373w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-boston-187x300.jpg 187w" sizes="(max-width: 373px) 100vw, 373px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://bostonbusinesswomen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boston Business Women</a> has a highlight showcasing all events organized by the group.</em></p>
<p>If your business hosts events, workshops, or training experiences (all can be virtual, too), dedicating an Instagram Story Highlight exclusively to event promotion is a strategic, fun, creative way to share more of your brand’s personality while also increasing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">brand awareness</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-events.jpg" alt="Instagram Highlights - example of an event story highlight" width="369" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76770 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-events.jpg 369w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-events-185x300.jpg 185w" sizes="(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px" /></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to include your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/st-patricks-day-greetings">holiday events</a>!</p>
<h3>3. Show what you’ve been up to</h3>
<p>Keeping clients informed is always one of the most important <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/15/marketing-objectives">objectives</a> of businesses, and offering a behind-the-scenes look at what your business has been up to is a great idea for an Instagram Story Highlight.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlight-chobani.jpg" alt="Instagram Highlights - Chobani example" width="386" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76771 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlight-chobani.jpg 386w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlight-chobani-193x300.jpg 193w" sizes="(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Chobani shows off interesting ways to use its containers.</em></p>
<p>With Stories like these, your followers—and your customers—are able to picture people at your company or new initiatives, and both of these help <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/12/23/humanize-brand">humanize</a> your brand.</p>
<p>Here are some great ways your business can do this today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tease viewers by giving them an inside look at some of your new products.</li>
<li>Share pictures, videos, or screenshots taken during company meetings.</li>
<li>Show where your employees have been working recently.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Interact with customers using interactive polls</h3>
<ol start="4"></ol>
<p>Using ad interactive polls on your Instagram Stories not only allows you to engage with customers, it also allows you to collaborate with customers. You can gain a greater understanding of your audience and insight into their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points">pain points</a>, as well as ask them fun, different sorts of questions, inviting them to interact with your brand.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-farmrich.jpg" alt="Instagram Highlights - farmrich example" width="314" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76772 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-farmrich.jpg 314w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-farmrich-157x300.jpg 157w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /></p>
<p>Even more, the results you get from Instagram Story polls can help you reframe your marketing and advertising campaigns more effectively. Creating a highlight including all the ad polls you’ve posted on your Instagram Stories is a great way for followers and users to see that you’re interested in their opinions and feedback on your products or conversations.</p>
<h3>5. Answer your followers’ questions</h3>
<p>Another interactive feature you can use to capture your followers’ attention is an Instagram Story Highlight with answers to common questions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-remote-year.jpg" alt="Instagram Highlights - Remote year story highlight" width="403" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76773 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-remote-year.jpg 403w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-remote-year-202x300.jpg 202w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Remote Year’s Q&amp;A Instagram Story Highlight.</em></p>
<p>A good place to start is by asking common questions about business hours, new products, features, or location, and begin by answering those. Put yourself in your customers’ shoes and think of what you’d like to know if you clicked through your business Q&amp;A highlight. A restaurant may ask, “What’s something you’d like to see on our menu? Or an agency might ask, “What’s your favorite social ad we’ve created for you?” Or a realtor could ask, “Is proximity to mass transit important to you?” Users can also type an answer instead of asking a question.</p>
<h3>6. Feature product tutorials</h3>
<p>Creating an album specifically for tips and tutorials for using your product or service helps to establish your credibility and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/27/trust-signals">build trust</a> in your brand. Part of the album can be showcasing actual customers using your product or service to demonstrate the ease of product use.</p>
<p>This Instagram Story Highlight also allows you to show a more in-depth look at the functionality of your product or service and gives customers an inside look, an idea of what to expect when they (hopefully) make a purchase.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlight-tagwalk.jpg" alt="Instagram Highlights - Tagwalk instagram highlight" width="397" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76774 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlight-tagwalk.jpg 397w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlight-tagwalk-199x300.jpg 199w" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Tagwalk has a collection of “How to Guides” in one of their Highlights.</em></p>
<p>For businesses selling higher price points or lesser-known brands, there’s a longer <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/04/nurture-marketing">consideration phase</a> before people buy. You can cut straight to the chase with your prospects (or at least try to) by giving them a sneak peek of what they get when they buy!</p>
<h3>7. Highlight your customer testimonials</h3>
<p>We all know the importance of sharing <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/get-google-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer reviews</a>, so be sure to share your company’s reviews with your followers, too! Creating a highlight dedicated to reposting screenshots or testimonials of your customers’ experiences using your product, service, or brand, and highlighting these on your Instagram account is a great way to share the stories of your happy customers. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/19/customer-testimonial-examples">Customer testimonials</a> are valuable to emphasize the benefits customers have received from your products or service.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-supplyhouse.jpg" alt="Instagram Highlights - supply house instagram story" width="506" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76775 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-supplyhouse.jpg 506w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Instagram-highlights-supplyhouse-480x569.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 506px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Supply House uses an Instagram Highlight to show off its great </em><i>reviews.</i></p>
<p>These customer testimonials are also a great opportunity to use the “See More” button, allowing followers to swipe up and shop the product your customers were raving about.</p>
<p>Just be sure to ask customers if they’d be willing to be featured on your business’s Instagram profile, but hopefully you’ll have trust built with them already and they’ll say yes!</p>
<h3>8. Share sales and discounts</h3>
<p>One of the most effective ways to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/05/instagram-ecommerce">boost sales on Instagram</a> and attract followers to engage with your content in some way is through offering discounts or giveaways.</p>
<p>Offering discounts and sales on your products provides greater visibility to your brand and has the potential to increase sales, generate leads, and boost traffic to your website.</p>
<p>Creating an Instagram Story Highlight dedicated to sharing current sales, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/21/ecommerce-discounts">discounts</a>, and promotions is a great idea. Discounts or giveaways naturally attract prospects, prompts them to engage with the content on your Story, and then encourages them to buy your product or services.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Sales promotions are a fantastic way to drum up new business.

<h3>9. Start a series</h3>
<p>You’ve now read many tips on how to promote your products and services, advertise your events and highlight past ones, and communicate sales and discounts you’re having right now.
