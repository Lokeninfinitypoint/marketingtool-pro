										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being a good PPC agency isn’t just about creating campaigns that perform well. It’s also about effectively communicating that performance to your clients in a way that educates them and relates to their business goals.</p>
<p>This is what quarterly business reviews (QBRs) are for. And when conducted properly, they serve to reassure your clients, convey your value, and strengthen the overall relationship.</p>
<p>Read on to learn how to conduct a QBR that not only impresses your clients but also keeps them satisfied, engaged, and eager to continue working with you. Plus, we’ve got a quarterly business review PowerPoint template and copy-and-paste outline coming your way!</p>

<div id="what-is-a-qbr"></div>
<h2>What is a quarterly business review?</h2>
<p>A quarterly business review (QBR) is a comprehensive assessment that agencies conduct every three months for their clients, to evaluate performance, address concerns, and set goals. It can be done in person or over a conference call, and it’s accompanied by a visual presentation, usually a slide deck.</p>
<div id="why-is-a-qbr-important"></div>
<h2>Why QBRs matter</h2>
<p>Quarterly business reviews are paramount for ensuring mutual success for both your agency and clients. Here are a few reasons QBRs matter:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong></strong><strong>Strategize.</strong> While <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/07/ppc-reporting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weekly and monthly PPC reporting</a> informs tactical decisions and catches issues or anomalies early, quarterly check-ins use broader data sets to inform the bigger strategy.</li>
<li><strong></strong><strong>Showcase.</strong>QBRs are also an opportunity to demonstrate the value you bring to your clients’ business, not just in terms of KPIs and revenue but also in the education you provide and how you compare to competitors.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthen</strong>. Quarterly check-ins are the best way to demonstrate transparency and make sure you’re aligned with their goals and expectations—which is <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/21/build-client-relationships" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how you build lasting client relationships</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div id="what-does-a-qbr-review"></div>
<h2>What to review in a QBR</h2>
<p>A quarterly business review is more than just a run-down of the numbers. As I said above, it’s a <strong>comprehensive</strong> assessment of all of the aspects of your work with your client. Here are the key things to review in a thorough QBR:</p>
<h3>Performance metrics</h3>
<p>First and foremost, you’ll want to do an overview of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/19/ppc-metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PPC metrics</a>, including click-through rates (CTR), conversion rates, cost per click (CPC), cost per acquisition (CPA), return on ad spend (ROAS), and overall campaign performance.</p>
<p>Because you’re looking at a broader data set, you can identify patterns, surface any external factors or<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-trends-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> industry trends</a>, and identify both areas of success and opportunities for improvement.</p>
<p>It’s also a good idea to compare your performance to industry benchmarks.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-benchmarks-2024.webp" alt="google ads benchmarks - 2024 google ads averages chart of all metrics" width="1098" height="925" class="aligncenter wp-image-82731 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-benchmarks-2024.webp 1098w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-benchmarks-2024-980x826.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-benchmarks-2024-480x404.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1098px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>You’ll also want to revisit the goals you established at the beginning of the quarter. Did you achieve them? Why or why not? Of course, ideally, you’ll want to have achieved them but it’s also okay if a few areas fell short. When <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/21/how-to-run-google-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running PPC campaigns</a> there will always be factors outside of your control, and not every campaign is going to run perfectly. What matters is that you’re transparent and that you have clear explanations.</p>
<p>You can then use this information to make adjustments to these goals or to the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/15/marketing-objectives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">objectives</a> that tie into them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/quarterly-business-review-qbr-goals-examples.webp" alt="qbr - example quarterly business review goals chart" width="664" height="415" class="aligncenter wp-image-83806 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/quarterly-business-review-qbr-goals-examples.webp 664w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/quarterly-business-review-qbr-goals-examples-480x300.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Campaigns</h3>
<p>Once you’ve gone over the overall metrics and goals, it’s time to dive into the individual campaigns. In addition to reviewing the breakout metrics for these campaigns, you’ll also review individual ads, keywords, targeting settings, ad extensions, and more.</p>
<p>This is where you can get into more specifics about what worked and what didn’t, and propose <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/24/google-ads-optimization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimizations</a> based on the data and your expertise.</p>
<p>Optimizations can involve <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/03/how-to-write-exceptional-ppc-ad-copy">ad copy</a> and creative, account structure, budget allocation, and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/google-ads-account-structure-graphic.webp" alt="google ads account structure graphic" width="902" height="599" class="aligncenter wp-image-76239 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/google-ads-account-structure-graphic.webp 902w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/google-ads-account-structure-graphic-480x319.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 902px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/26a1.png" alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Is your (or your client&#8217;s) Google Ads account set up for success?</strong> Download now &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLAccountStructure.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_LastAccountStructureGuide_Download">The Last Guide to Google Ads Account Structure You&#8217;ll Ever Need</a></p>
<h3>Budget</h3>
<p>Here is where you review how you spent your client’s budget, which may refer to how you allocated budget to different ad networks, to different campaigns within those networks, to different ads within those campaigns, or even keywords.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you’ll want to convey that you’re <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/14/ppc-budgeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">managing your client’s budget wisely</a>, so be sure to illustrate the return on investment.</p>
<p>You can then discuss adjustments based on performance and shifts in the clients’ business priorities.</p>
<h3>Competitive analysis</h3>
<p>Don’t forget to assess what your client’s competitors are doing with their marketing and advertising strategies and share these findings. This may include their brand voice, the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/01/competitor-keyword-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keywords they’re targeting</a>, the products or services they’re advertising, and more.</p>
<p>You can then propose optimizations or changes in things like ad copy and targeting to help your client maintain unique and advantageous positioning in the market.</p>
<p>We have lots of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/21/competitive-analysis-templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">competitive analysis templates</a> you can use here as well as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/16/competitive-advertising" target="_blank" rel="noopener">competitive advertising strategies</a> you may want to try.</p>

<h3>Strategy planning</h3>
<p>Finally, propose a strategy for the next quarter, with clearly defined goals and measurable objectives, based on the data and insights you just shared. Gather feedback and input from your client and iterate on the strategy accordingly to make sure it’s aligned with their priorities and goals. This is also a good time to surface new trends, features, campaign types, and ideas that they may be interested in.</p>
<h3>Feedback and Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>You should invite feedback and questions after every slide during the QBR. But you should also have one final slide at the end for overall feedback and questions. The goal here is to make sure the client is satisfied not just with the deliverables and performance but with the overall service and customer experience. This is also a time for questions about the contract and any expectation setting.</p>
<p>And once that is done, you will find yourself wrapping up a very productive, very rewarding quarterly business review with a very happy client! Nice work.</p>
<div id="qbr-tips"></div>
<h2>Final tips for conducting great QBRs</h2>
<p>Before we get to the template, here are some final tips for running a QBR that keeps your clients coming back:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prepare: </strong>Preparation is key to conducting an effective QBR. Prior to the meeting, gather all relevant data including:</li>
<li><strong>Communicate clearly:</strong> Provide easy-to-understand data, clear explanations, and invite questions after every slide. Don’t be afraid to reveal mistakes and areas of improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Share the deck afterward: </strong>Don’t share the deck before the meeting. Use the meeting to walk them through it so they can get the information in the right context. Then, send it out after for their records and reference.</li>
<li><strong>Keep it connected: </strong>Consider each QBR to be a chapter in the overall story with your client. Each one should connect back to the previous quarter’s goals and look forward to the next quarter.</li>
<li><strong>Make it a narrative: </strong>As I just mentioned above, this is a story. Present it that way, with your client as the hero of their own narrative, and you’ll have an engaging QBR that leaves an impression.</li>
</ul>
<div id="qbr-template"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a marketing agency profitability consultant, I see it time and again. An agency’s chief says they’ve never been busier but don’t have the cash flow to show for it.</p>
<p>It’s common to see agencies hit this growth ceiling, having figured out how to get clients but struggling with cash flow and profitability.</p>
<p>In this post, I’ll walk you through the most telling agency metrics I’ve used to lead clients to improved profitability, show their progress, and hone their strategy.</p>
<p>For each agency metric, you’ll see what it is, why it’s important, how to measure it, and a benchmark to aim for.</p>

<h2>5 agency metrics that will boost your profitability</h2>
<p>There are dozens of ways to measure a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-a-marketing-agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing agency’s</a> operational and financial efficiency. The five agency metrics listed here are best at surfacing the biggest bottlenecks and leak points.</p>
<div id="Utilization-rate"></div>
<h3>1. Utilization rate</h3>
<p>If you have an internal team that delivers work to clients, utilization rate will be the first and most foundational metric to start paying attention to in terms of profitability.</p>
<h4>What is utilization rate?</h4>
<p>Employees who interface with clients can split their working hours into billable and non-billable hours. Billable hours are those spent on client projects or directly working with clients, while non-billable hours are those spent not directly on the client, such as with internal projects and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/07/marketing-meetings"> meetings</a>.</p>
<p>Utilization is defined as the percent of your employees’ billable total time. To increase your agency’s profitability, you need to make sure your team has enough work to do for clients to keep a threshold of billable hours.</p>
<h4>Why is utilization rate important?</h4>
<p>Understanding your utilization rate helps you avoid situations where you’re paying a salary to the team but not earning any revenue in return. If the team isn’t busy, optimizing for profitability is not much point because the time recouped from increased efficiency can’t be transferred to other revenue-earning opportunities.</p>
<p>Suppose you primarily lean on contractors or outsourced partners to do work for clients. In that case, you may not need to worry about utilization as much since you’re not paying those contractors when the agency isn’t busy. Your contribution or gross margins may be lower, but if you haven’t figured out how to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/01/16/get-more-clients"> predictably acquire clients</a>, keeping your workforce more elastic might be a good idea until you’ve<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/07/marketing-funnel"> sorted out your funnel</a> and acquisition channels.</p>
<h4>How do you calculate utilization rate?</h4>
<p>Use the following formula to calculate utilization rate:</p>
<p><em>Gross capacity / Billable hours = Utilization rate</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-utilization-rate.webp" alt="Agency metrics - graphic of utilization rate calculation" width="936" height="339" class="aligncenter wp-image-83182 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-utilization-rate.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-utilization-rate-480x174.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gross capacity:</strong> The total number of available billable hours (most employees are 40 hours per week for 52 hours per year less time off, or 2080 hours maximum).</li>
<li><strong>Billable hours:</strong> The amount of time spent doing work for clients (regardless of whether you’re billing hourly or not).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Utilization benchmarks</h4>
<p>On a week-to-week basis, you generally want your “pure” producers (designers, developers,<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/16/free-copywriting-resources"> copywriters</a>, etc.) to be utilized between 75% and 90%.</p>
<p>On an annual basis, you should aim to have your production team hit a utilization rate of between 65% and 80%.</p>
<p>With utilization above 65%, you should achieve healthy margins as a business, so long as you’re earning your revenue efficiently (more on that next).</p>

<div id="Gross-margin"></div>
<h3>2. Gross margin</h3>
<p>There are two primary ways digital marketing agencies track how efficiently they earn revenue: gross margin and average billable rate. I’ll break down the pros and cons of each to help you determine which metric is best for measuring and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/15/ppc-agency-pricing/"> improving your agency’s profitability</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s start with gross margin as the first of two metrics you can use to help track your revenue-earning efficiency.</p>
<h4>What is gross margin?</h4>
<p>Gross margin is a tried-and-true method for determining production profitability. Simply put, it means calculating the profit margin on a per-client or per-project basis by subtracting time and material costs from whatever the client has paid you.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-gross-margin-model.webp" alt="Agency metrics - graphic of grow margin factors" width="849" height="419" class="aligncenter wp-image-83187 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-gross-margin-model.webp 849w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-gross-margin-model-480x237.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 849px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This method is generally more accurate but can be more expensive and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/16/spend-less-time-in-google-ads"> time-consuming</a> to calculate since it usually happens in an accounting tool. And without an aggressive bookkeeping schedule, this may be something you can only ever look at retroactively.</p>
<h4>Who should use gross margin?</h4>
<p>I recommend the gross margin metric to mature agencies with a bookkeeper who updates biweekly or weekly and agencies that work with many contractors.</p>
<h4>Why is gross margin important?</h4>
<p>Being able to hit gross margins in this range consistently means your delivery systems are efficient enough to scale profitably, allowing you to cash-flow<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/16/grow-your-digital-marketing-agency"> your agency’s growth</a>.</p>
<h4>How do you calculate gross margin?</h4>
<p>Use the following formula to calculate gross margin:</p>
<p><em>Adjusted gross income – (COGS/Labor costs) = Gross margin</em></p>
<p><em>Gross margin / Adjusted gross income = Gross margin %</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-gross-margin.webp" alt="Agency metrics - graphic of gross margin calculation" width="936" height="342" class="aligncenter wp-image-83183 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-gross-margin.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-gross-margin-480x175.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adjusted gross income (AGI):</strong> The amount of revenue left over for the agency to earn after pass-through expenses are paid (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/21/ad-spend-pacing">ad spend</a>, print budgets, equipment rentals, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>COGS and labor costs:</strong> The costs associated with the people you’ve brought on to work on this project, be they internal team members or external contractors.</li>
</ul>
<p>To calculate your<a href="https://parakeeto.com/blog/how-to-accurately-calculate-your-agencys-billable-employee-cost-per-hour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> employee cost per hour</a> for internal team members, you’ll need to take their salary + benefits and divide it by their gross capacity. For most employees, this comes to 2080 hours per year (40 hours x 52 weeks).</p>
<h4>Gross margin benchmarks</h4>
<p>To run a highly profitable, scalable agency, you’ll want to aim for a 50-70% gross margin per client or per project.</p>
<p>That should set you up to hit a margin of 40-60% agency-wide at the end of the year, leaving you enough room to carry normal overhead levels and accommodate<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing/marketing-during-slow-economy-recession/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> slow times</a> without compromising net profitability.</p>
<p>One way to increase efficiency and improve gross margin is using<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency"> AI marketing tools for agencies</a>.</p>
<div id="Average-billable-rate"></div>
<h3>3. Average billable rate (ABR)</h3>
<p>Average billable rate is often a much simpler, more accessible way to get an idea of your revenue-earning efficiency and benchmark different clients or projects against each other.</p>
<h4>What is ABR?</h4>
<p>ABR helps us understand the average rate we’re earning per hour based on the amount of time it actually takes us to earn our revenue. This method is generally a bit less accurate, but it is much faster and easier to calculate and doesn’t require a bookkeeper or accountant to figure out.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-ABR-model.webp" alt="Agency metrics - Graphic of ABR model." width="787" height="274" class="aligncenter wp-image-83188 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-ABR-model.webp 787w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-ABR-model-480x167.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 787px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Who should use ABR?</h4>
<p>I generally recommend using the ABR metric method for<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/02/manage-social-media-accounts"> smaller agencies</a> that may just be getting started with tracking metrics and for agencies that tend to work with fewer contractors and keep most of their labor in-house.</p>
<h4>Why is ABR important?</h4>
<p>For the same reasons mentioned about gross margin, if you hit ABR <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/smart-goals-examples">goals</a>, you can grow profitably. ABR is a gut check for both the profitability of a client and the efficiency with which you can deliver the service.</p>
<h4>How do you calculate ABR?</h4>
<p>You can use the following formula to calculate average billable rate:</p>
<p><em>Adjusted gross income / Hours worked = ABR</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-ABR.webp" alt="Agency metrics - graphic of ABR calculation" width="936" height="343" class="aligncenter wp-image-83184 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-ABR.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-ABR-480x176.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adjusted gross income (AGI):</strong> The amount of revenue left over for the agency to earn after pass-through expenses are paid (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/21/ad-spend-pacing">ad spend</a>, print budgets, equipment rentals, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hours worked</strong>: The total time your team spent completing the work for your client.</li>
</ul>
<h4>ABR benchmarks</h4>
<p>The target for the average billable rate is the same as the gross margin. When we look at our average cost per hour for production labor, we want to be in the 50-70% margin range.</p>
<p>Usually, that means aiming for around 2.5x your average employee cost per hour or whatever contractor rates you’re paying the team.</p>
<p>For example, if the cost per hour to pay someone to do the work for us is $50, we’d want to target an average billable rate of $125 (which is 2.5 x $50 and equates to a gross margin of 60%).</p>
<div id="Scoping-accuracy"></div>
<h3>4. Scoping accuracy</h3>
<p>The riskiest part of any service business is that many of its critical functions rely on assumptions made every day when scoping work.</p>
<h4>What is scoping accuracy?</h4>
<p>The information we use to determine<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/15/ppc-agency-pricing"> how much to charge for work</a>, when to hire employees, how to resource a plan, and how to assign team members all comes down to what we believe is required to complete the deliverables we’ve promised our clients—aka the scope of the work.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-scoping-accuracy-model.webp" alt="Agency metrics - bar graph of a project scope." width="873" height="423" class="aligncenter wp-image-83192 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-scoping-accuracy-model.webp 873w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-scoping-accuracy-model-480x233.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 873px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Why is scoping accuracy important?</h4>
<p>Without feedback about how accurate those assumptions are, building out the systems required to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/28/resilient-digital-agencies-2020"> scale our agency</a> and our team’s profitably is difficult. That’s why installing a feedback loop is essential to help us understand whether the assumptions behind our pricing are accurate.</p>
<h4>How do you calculate scoping accuracy?</h4>
<p>Scoping accuracy can be easily calculated by the following formula:</p>
<p><em>Estimated time and cost / Actual time &amp; cost = Scoping accuracy (%)</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-scoping-accuracy.webp" alt="Agency metrics - graphic of scoping accuracy calculation" width="936" height="346" class="aligncenter wp-image-83185 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-scoping-accuracy.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-scoping-accuracy-480x177.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Estimated time and cost:</strong> The amount of time or money we estimated it would take to complete the work.</li>
<li><strong>Actual time and cost:</strong> The amount of time or money we spend to complete the work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually, this will be divided into “buckets” like design, development, and project management. To learn more and avoid<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/03/07/common-agency-mistakes"> common agency mistakes</a> in this area, check out my guide on<a href="https://parakeeto.com/blog/how-to-track-time-with-marcel-petipas-episode-42/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> choosing the correct structure for your estimates and actuals</a>.</p>
<h4>Scoping accuracy benchmarks</h4>
<p>An acceptable margin of error is under 20% of the anticipated budget, with going over being more of a concern.</p>
<p>However, at scale, we should consistently aim to keep our margin of error under 10%. This should become achievable over time as we collect more data and install more processes to close the gaps between our assumptions and reality, thereby creating our own<a href="https://parakeeto.com/blog/the-agency-profitability-flywheel-marcel-petipas-episode-40/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> agency profitability flywheel.</a></p>
<div id="Overhead-percent"></div>
<h3>5. Overhead percent</h3>
<p>Once you’ve gotten a grip on utilization, earning efficiency, and scoping accuracy, you should already be head and shoulders above the competition.<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/28/resilient-digital-agencies-2020"> Your agency will feel more stable</a>, you won’t be worried about cash flow, and planning for growth won’t feel so obscure.</p>
<p>The last piece of the puzzle for really dialing in your agency’s profitability is paying attention to your overhead spending—making sure it’s balanced relative to your income.</p>
<h4>What is overhead percent?</h4>
<p>Overhead costs are expenses that support your agency but are not directly tied to creating a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product"> specific product or service</a>. They are the ongoing and necessary expenses of running your business that do not generate revenue. The three main overhead spending categories we’ll discuss in this post are administrative, facilities, and sales &amp; marketing.</p>
<p>Overhead percent is the amount you’ve spent on overhead expenses as a percentage of your adjusted gross income.</p>
<h4>Why is overhead percent important?</h4>
<p>Landing in the acceptable ranges for each area should allow you to meet your agency’s needs relative to its size while maintaining healthy profit margins.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that through periods of<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/06/02/growth-hacking"> aggressive growth</a>, you may find yourself spending out ahead of scale. For example, you may sign a lease on an office much larger than what is necessary for your current team, anticipating having to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/27/how-to-scale-an-agency"> make a lot of hires</a> in the coming months.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with this, so long as you’re making these investments consciously and with a plan to level your expenses back into a healthy relative range eventually.</p>
<h4>How do you calculate overhead percent?</h4>
<p>The percentages of overhead spending for each of the different areas below may shift depending on your accountant’s guidance on where to place expenditures that fall into “grey areas.”</p>
<p>Use the following formula to calculate overhead percent:</p>
<p><em>Overhead spending / Adjusted gross income = Overhead %</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-overhead-percent.webp" alt="Agency metrics - graphic of overhead percent calculation" width="936" height="350" class="aligncenter wp-image-83186 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-overhead-percent.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-overhead-percent-480x179.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overhead spend: </strong>Any expense related to admin, facilities, or sales and marketing (further defined below).</li>
<li><strong>Adjusted gross income (AGI):</strong> The amount of<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/21/revenue-operations"> revenue</a> left over for the agency to earn after any pass-through expenses are paid (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/16/return-on-ad-spend-roas">ad spend</a>, print budgets, equipment rentals, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Overhead percent benchmarks</h4>
<p>The general rule of thumb is that total overhead spending should be about 20-30% of your adjusted gross income (AGI). Within overhead, there are three primary categories to pay attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Administrative expenses:</strong> Administrative expenses include accounting, legal fees, a receptionist, part or all of the director’s or owner’s salary, and more. The target for administrative expenses should be <strong>8-12%.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Facilities expenses:</strong> These include any costs related to providing the team with a proper working environment, such as a building (rent), parking, and utilities. The target for facilities expenses should be <strong>4-6%</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Sales and Marketing expenses:</strong> Sales and marketing expenses include costs related to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/26/prospecting-strategies-ppc-agencies"> bringing in new business</a>, like marketing spend, sales software, and the sales and marketing team’s salary. The target for sales and marketing expenses should be <strong>8-14%</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>These agency metrics will have a big impact on your profitability</h2>
<p>If there’s one thing I’d urge you to take away from this post, it’s that it doesn’t take much to start measuring the simple numbers that will make a big impact on your profitability. What I’ve learned from working with hundreds of agencies over the last few years is that most of them don’t do this stuff well (if at all)—so even <a href="https://www.link-assistant.com/news/top-search-engines.html">reviewing</a> just part of it can help you set your agency apart from your competitors, and position you to outlast or outgrow them in the long term.</p>
<p>The peace of mind that comes with having good cash flow, efficient systems, simple yet clear-cut numbers, and visibility into your progress can make running your agency much easier and more enjoyable for you and your team.

<p>That applies to tons of marketing agencies I’ve encountered, especially the small to mid-sized agencies. When was the last time you worked on marketing or advertising for your own firm?

<p>Focus on these four growth tactics to ease your anxiety and consistently book new business.</p>
<div id="build-a-strong-website"></div>
<h3>Build a strong website</h3>
<p>No matter what avenues you pursue to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/01/how-to-get-clients">attract new clients</a>, you’ll always need a strong website to ensure you can convert folks from interested visitors to customers. This is likely where they’ll learn the most about you, your team, your abilities, and how you can help them, so make sure it hits all the highlights.</p>
<p>Think of your website as the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/12/04/adwords-remarketing-best-practices-guide">remarketing</a> portion of the buyer funnel. We’ll attract them in the next section, but you should build remarketing lists ahead of time to capture all potential customers.</p>
<p>Although all agencies are unique and want to highlight themselves differently, here are a few things to include on your site:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy conversion options: </strong>This should be a no-brainer, but if you’re going to send people to a website, make sure <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/website-conversion">they can convert</a>. This could be a form fill, a phone call, a service purchase, or scheduling a meeting. It’s the dealer’s choice, really. We don’t let our clients get away without strong <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action#:~:text=Here%20are%20a%20few%20ideas,or%20%E2%80%9Cbook%20your%20appointment.%E2%80%9D">calls to action</a>, so why should you?</li>
<li><strong>Overview of services:</strong> Every marketing agency is different. Some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/16/grow-your-digital-marketing-agency">specialize in one area</a>, and others are jacks of all trades. Which are you? Highlight all of your services on your site so your potential customers know how you can help them grow their business.</li>
<li><strong>Case studies:</strong> Personally, I don’t love <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/03/how-to-write-a-case-study">case studies</a>, but that’s a personal rant. Many agencies use case studies to attract potential clients, and many prospects like to see proof of success in their work. Including these can be an easy way to convince someone of your expertise and warm the lead a little before they even reach out.</li>
<li><strong>Digestible language:</strong> This one is a personal pet peeve of mine. So often, when I visit an agency’s website (or almost any tech solution anymore), I find that the entire thing is filled with industry jargon. Do you use proprietary software and machine learning to 10x your ROAS and send your results to the moon? Cool. So does everyone else. But also, your customers likely don’t know what most of that means. That’s why they’re not in advertising and need your services. Keep it simple. Explain how you’ll impact their business and keep the jargon out of it.</li>
<li><strong>Show off your accolades:</strong> If you’ve been successful, show it off. Did you recently win an industry award? That goes on the site. Do you have killer <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">customer reviews</a>? That also goes on the site. Your website is the one and only place where you control what is said about you. Put your best foot forward and show off why you’re so awesome.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you have a strong website that people can engage with after learning about you, it’s time to start attracting new users—the prospecting portion, if you will. Here, I have two main categories to focus on.</p>

<div id="grow-your-thought-leadership"></div>
<h3>Grow your thought leadership</h3>
<p>First, no one will know if you’re an expert at something unless you prove it by sharing your thoughts, experiments, and findings. Even if public speaking isn’t your thing, there are tons of ways to start showing off a little and making a name for yourself as an expert in any field.</p>
<p>I know it might sound counterintuitive, but the more knowledge you give away, the more people want to work with you. Don’t worry; it surprised me too.</p>
<p>I used to think, “But if I give away all my secrets, then won’t people just do it themselves?” Some prospects will. And while that stings a little, there’s a good lesson to be learned here: if someone will take your ideas and do it themselves, they likely won’t be a great client anyway.</p>
<p>Great clients trust in your expertise and work with you to see good results. They don’t try to minimize your impact on their business by doing it themselves. Additionally, if someone’s business is going really well, they likely don’t have time to do it themselves. You’re now an integral extension of their team that helps them stay busy in their business while you work on it.</p>
<p>So, with all of that out of the way, here are some ideas to get you started sharing your thought leadership.</p>
<h4>Write engaging content in various forms</h4>
<p>The easiest way to get started with thought leadership is just to write. Everyone can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post#:~:text=Keep%20Sentences%20Short%20and%20Paragraphs%20Shorter&amp;text=It%27s%20a%20common%20mistake%20for,making%20your%20audience%27s%20job%20easier.">write a blog post</a>, whether it’s on a personal site, your agency site, or as a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/06/21/guest-posting-dos-donts">guest blogger</a>. The same is true for ebooks or longer-form content like an industry <a href="https://www.link-assistant.com/news/top-search-engines.html">report</a> or guide.</p>
<p>Write about best practices, wins you’ve had, frustrations, or your strategies. Find a niche that works for you and stick to it. There are tons of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-copywriting-tools">tools</a> out there to help you get started with ideas, so do some quick Google searches and see what you can come up with.</p>
<h4>Speak at industry events</h4>
<p>Whether you focus on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/19/agencies-sell-more-ppc">PPC</a>, SEO, CRO, or some other alphabet soup, look up the shows in your industry and start pitching to them. In my experience, they’re always looking for fresh faces with new ideas, so don’t be shy about throwing all your ideas at them.</p>
<h4>Start a podcast</h4>
<p>Who doesn’t have a podcast nowadays? It seems like there are tons out there, and you might think, “I’m too late to the game.” Well, surprise again: you’re not. You don’t have to have a huge audience to see success and expand your customer base.</p>
<p>How can you differentiate yourself? Do you want to focus on Google Ads or highlight landing page tests that worked or didn’t work? Great! What about advertising in your specific industry or location? Also great. Find what works best for you and make it happen.</p>
<h4>Post on social media</h4>
<p>Many moons ago, I got my first job in PPC right out of college. After an upstart period, I wanted to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/12/free-training-resources-for-agencies">level up my skills</a>. At that time, the best place to go was Twitter (now X, but I’m too old to call it that). Within a pretty short period of time, Matt Umbro started the first #ppcchat, and that really had a world of impact on my career.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/How-to-promote-my-digital-marketing-agency-wordstream-Twitter.webp" alt="How to promote you digital marketing agency - PPC chat post on X (formerly twitter)" width="524" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-82497 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/How-to-promote-my-digital-marketing-agency-wordstream-Twitter.webp 524w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/How-to-promote-my-digital-marketing-agency-wordstream-Twitter-480x550.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 524px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Use #PPCchat on X to connect with other agency professionals.</em></p>
<p>I met so many people and learned new tactics, but I also started building out an entire timeline of posts that showed off my expertise at that time. More than once, potential clients reached out because they were trying to find an answer to a problem, and my X feed was the solution.</p>
<p>We all know that social media <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/15/youtube-algorithm">algorithms</a> pay attention to our behaviors on other sites. So, if a business owner is looking for marketing services and they hit up the Instagram Explore page, it might not be a bad idea to have an Instagram feed full of helpful marketing nuggets for them to find.</p>
<h4>Submit for industry awards</h4>
<p>Remember those accolades I told you to show off on your website? Well, you have to submit to industry award shows to win an industry award. They don’t just hand them out. Do some quick searching and see if there are awards for your specific industry or niche of services and apply to them. Then, if you happen to be good enough (and lucky enough) to win one, shout it out on your site!</p>
<h4>Choose the right thought leadership topics</h4>
<p>One last tip for this section before we jump into the next focal area. Make sure your thought leadership focuses on things you actually like doing.</p>
<p>If you don’t like Facebook Ads, you probably shouldn’t write blogs or make a podcast about Facebook Ads, even if there’s tons of potential traffic and interest around those terms. Remember, you’re trying to articulate your expertise in an effort to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/01/how-to-get-clients">generate new business</a>. If you’re shouting from the rooftops how good you are at Facebook, then you’re going to generate new Facebook clients. Don’t promote the aspects of your services that you don’t enjoy doing!</p>
<div id="build-and-leverage-your-networks"></div>
<h3>Build and leverage your networks</h3>
<p>The previous section focused on promoting “what you know,” but this section is about growing and leveraging “who you know.”</p>
<p>I mentioned getting started in #ppcchat early on. While that was helpful for client acquisition, it was 100 times as powerful for building out my network. I met folks there that have had immeasurable impacts on my life. Through this network, I found new jobs and a new business partner, made inroads to speaking at industry events, wrote for multiple industry publications, made friends all over the world, and so much more. How can you leverage your network to help market your agency?</p>
<h4>Partner with non-competing agencies</h4>
<p>Even if you fit into the jack-of-all-trades category, there’s likely a company out there that works with the same types of clients you want to work with and that you could partner with.</p>
<p>An easy example is a PPC firm partnering with an SEO shop. You two likely have a similar book of business, but your disciplines are complementary, not competitive. Finding a partner agency is a great way to build both of your shops. You can trade client referrals and work together on projects. Not only will you generate new business, but you’ll also deliver well-rounded results for your clients.</p>
<h4>Consider referral fees</h4>
<p>I say “consider” on this one because some folks really love referral fees while others do not. In my mind, both make sense.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/how-to-promote-your-digital-marketing-agency-wordstream-referrals-1.webp" alt="How to promote you digital marketing agency - graph of top sources of clients." width="878" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-82504 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/how-to-promote-your-digital-marketing-agency-wordstream-referrals-1.webp 878w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/how-to-promote-your-digital-marketing-agency-wordstream-referrals-1-480x328.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 878px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Referrals are by far the </em><a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite2023AgencyIndustryReport.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_StateoftheAgency2023_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=2023SOTA&amp;utm_content=compare_pricing&amp;utm_term=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_StateoftheAgency2023_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incontent_links&amp;utm_content=2023SOTA"><em>largest source</em></a><em> of new clients.</em></p>
<p>Referral fees are an amount of money (or a benefit) you give to someone who refers you to new clients. The added incentive to share your name can get you into conversations you might not otherwise have. I find these work well for people who may or may not have worked with you directly before, and they can be great to offer your employees as well.</p>
<p>On the other hand, many people think referral fees create an inauthentic recommendation. If they’re getting paid for suggesting that brand, or if the agency has to offer referral fees for new accounts, they might not be that great. These folks want the business to deliver great results to get the recommendation, not pay them.</p>
<p>The thing is, there’s no right or wrong answer on this one. Some people have very strong beliefs one way or the other, but neither is inherently better than the other, and each approach can work.</p>
<h4>Collect customer reviews</h4>
<p>Similar to the industry awards on your site, you can’t <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/24/customer-feedback">share customer reviews</a> until you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/16/get-more-google-reviews">get customer reviews</a>. There are lots of software tools out there that can help you do this, but I’ve also found a quick email can do the trick. Don’t overcomplicate it.</p>
<p>This first-hand account of working with you is great for your site and also helps to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/04/client-retention-tips">strengthen the relationship</a> with the client giving the review. Similar to the folks who want to refer out based on great work, customer reviews can give prospective clients an insider’s opinion on your agency and help them decide if they should choose you or another shop.</p>
<div id="deliver-great-results"></div>
<h3>Deliver amazing results</h3>
<p>The last piece is a bit of a cheat, but I think it deserves its own section because it fuels all the others. If you deliver great results, you’ll drive more business in one way or another.</p>
<p>If you’re seeing great client results:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Share it on your website: </strong>Show off the awesome case studies you’re seeing and build a compelling case for how you can help other businesses do the same.</li>
<li><strong>Write, present, or talk about it:</strong> Write a guest blog for an industry publication that reaches a lot of folks. Submit a speaking proposal around your work and highlight your strategies at industry events. Start a podcast that discusses your approaches to the work and how you’re hitting client KPIs.</li>
<li><strong>Ask for referrals:</strong> Your clients will be so pleased that they’ll be happy to write you customer reviews and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/06/referral-marketing">refer you</a> to anyone looking for marketing help, whether you’ve paid a referral fee or not.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Use these tactics to promote your digital marketing agency</h2>
<p>Delivering great results for clients is hugely important, as evidenced by my last point. But if you’re only thinking about the health of your client’s businesses, who is thinking about the health of yours?</p>
<p>Spend some time developing plans to expand your business. First, ensure you have a solid website for people to land on. Then, share your expertise and leverage your network to attract users to that site and eventually onto your client list.</p>
<p>Here are several more resources you can use to get new clients and maximize revenue for your agency:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some agencies manage to build a steady client base that strengthens over the years, while others ride roller coasters and eventually close up shop. What’s the difference? Client relationships. Strong client relations make for greater success with projects and campaigns, loyal clients who stay with you longer and refer new clients, and a better reputation for your brand. Even better, they make everyday work more enjoyable for all.</p>
<p>So what makes for a strong client relationship? The same traits that define any good relationship: awareness, communication, empathy, dependability, accountability, honesty, and the list goes on.</p>
<p>In this post, I’ve compiled 11 ways your agency can demonstrate the above and more to achieve the best possible outcomes for you and your clients. I’d say happy endings, but good relationships don’t really end.</p>

<h2>Why are client relationships important?</h2>
<p>It’s easy to skim over the importance of creating a strong relationship with your clients—you know you have to do it. But when you dig into how it helps your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/02/strategies-to-grow-your-digital-marketing-agency">agency grow</a>, you can be more strategic about it.</p>
<h3>Reduces churn</h3>
<p>It can be <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/09/customer-retention-strategies">25 times</a> more expensive to acquire a new customer than to keep an existing one. You also have a much higher probability of selling a new agreement to a current client than closing a deal with a new one.</p>
<p>A strong client relationship helps you weather rough patches and identify clients who are at risk of leaving. Both will help you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/08/reduce-churn">reduce customer churn</a>.</p>
<h3>Increases referrals</h3>
<p>Customer referrals are an extremely important source of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/01/how-to-get-clients">new clients</a> for your agency. That’s because referred customers are more likely to buy, are more loyal, and spend more on average than non-referred customers.</p>
<p>When you have a strong relationship with your clients, you can ask them to give reviews and refer other businesses. That’s especially helpful if your agency <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/16/grow-your-digital-marketing-agency">serves a niche industry</a> where everyone knows everyone else.</p>
<h3>Provides opportunities to learn</h3>
<p>Have you ever wanted to know how a new regulation would affect your clients? Or how to best <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/19/agencies-sell-more-ppc">sell a service like PPC</a>? When you have a rock-solid relationship with your clients, you can ask them.</p>
<p>It takes time to build that sort of comfort, but when you do, your best clients become your agency&#8217;s de facto advisers.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4e3.png" alt="📣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Learn how 300 marketing agencies manage services, pricing, and challenges in our <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite2023AgencyIndustryReport.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_StateoftheAgency2023_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=2023SOTA&amp;utm_content=compare_pricing&amp;utm_term=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_StateoftheAgency2023_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incontent_links&amp;utm_content=2023SOTA">State of the Digital Marketing Agency report</a>.</p>
<h2>How do you build client relationships that last?</h2>
<p>In the following list, you’ll find actionable ways to improve client satisfaction and build mutually beneficial partnerships, with input from PPC agency experts like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/author/mark-irvine">Mark Irvine</a>, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/author/francine-rodriguez">Francine Rodriguez</a>, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/author/akvile-defazio">Akvile DeFazio</a>, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/author/susie-marino">Susie Marino</a>.</p>
<div id="Gather-“hard”-and-“soft”-information"></div>
<h3>1. Gather “hard” and “soft” information</h3>
<p>A strong agency-client relationship starts before the client even becomes one. You know that you need as much information as possible about your client to come up with a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/11/business-proposals">winning proposal</a>. But the solution you come up with isn’t going to establish a meaningful connection between you and your potential client. It’s how you present that solution with respect to both the business’s goals and the personalities and values of the team you’ll be working with.</p>
<p><strong>This means collecting “hard” information like:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">Products and services</a> they offer</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">Target audience</a> and the end-users of their product or service</li>
<li>Top three <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/18/ppc-competitor-analysis">competitors</a></li>
<li>Prioritized list of goals and challenges</li>
<li>Strategies that have worked and not worked in the past</li>
<li>Software are they currently using</li>
<li>Budget</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But also “soft” information like:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What they define as success</li>
<li>Their future hopes or anticipations, like scaling, adding on new offerings, etc.</li>
<li>The company’s mission, beliefs, and values, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/unique-selling-proposition">unique selling proposition</a></li>
<li>What makes them different from their competitors</li>
<li>Hobbies, interests, and preferences of the individuals you’ll be working with</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/strengthen-client-relationships-left-vs-right-brain-1.jpeg" alt="strengthen client relationships emotional vs logical intelligence" width="1000" height="542" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Think with <a href="https://www.thegreatcoursesdaily.com/solving-the-mystery-of-the-left-brain-and-right-brain-myth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">both sides of your brain</a> when gathering information about your client.</em></p>
<p>Building <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotional</a> intelligence about the team you’ll be working with will help you to make communication more personalized as you move through these initial phases of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/21/customer-journey-mapping">journey</a> together.</p>
<p>Side note: Be prepared to answer <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing/5-questions-to-ask-your-marketing-partner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their questions</a> too! Even their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/30/ppc-client-business-questions">non-PPC questions</a>.</p>
<div id="Internalize-that-information"></div>
<h3>2. Internalize that information</h3>
<p>This is the information you’ll be not only including in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/13/marketing-proposal">proposal</a>, but applying throughout your actual execution and ongoing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/02/client-communication">communication with your client</a>. Take the time to really internalize it so that it shines through organically in everything you do.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gather the information in person (or video):</strong> Body language and facial expressions tell a lot. Take note of what gets them excited (and not so excited). Also, be sure to send out a list of the questions you’ll be asking far in advance so the client can have time to think about answers and produce follow-up questions.</li>
<li><strong>Iterate back:</strong> As you listen, iterate back to your client what you have interpreted so you can make sure you’re crystal clear on the information you’re receiving. Remember, incorporating the tiniest details into your proposal and execution is what will give your clients confidence that you truly understand their needs.</li>
<li><strong>Templatize:</strong> Have an internal templated document where you can collect all of the information you’ve gathered in one place. This gives every team member something to continually refer back to, and the uniformity makes it easier to internalize.</li>
</ul>
<div id="Go-above-and-beyond-with-your-proposal"></div>
<h3>3. Go above and beyond with your proposal</h3>
<ol start="3"></ol>
<p>From a project standpoint, your proposal shows what you’re going to do to achieve your client’s <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-plan-goals-objectives-for-small-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goals</a>. From a relationship standpoint, it’s your opportunity to reinforce, once again, that you have a deep understanding of your client—both the business and its team members. Speak to both the client’s business goals as well as the more personal pain points and desires of its employees.</p>
<p>To do this, think in terms of “what,” “why,” and “so that.”</p>
<ul>
<li>The what refers to what you’ll be doing from a process standpoint.</li>
<li>The why ties the process to one of the business’s specific goals.</li>
<li>The “so that” speaks to the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points">pain point</a> it will address for the business’s team members.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, we’d like to ramp up ad spending in the latter half of the month to drive more signups so that your sales team isn’t scrounging for leads. Just be sure to use the language that your clients used in the initial information-gathering process.</p>
<p>This strengthens that <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-lead-management-digital-marketing/5-cool-things-marketing-partner-can-do-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnership</a> feel. You’re not just looking to achieve goals, you care about the individuals impacted by them.</p>

<div id="Have-an-onboarding-process"></div>
<h3>4. Have an onboarding process</h3>
<p>This is one of our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/09/customer-retention-strategies">customer retention strategies</a> as well. Once you get started, there will be more points of contact added to the roster for both sides. A streamlined onboarding process will set the stage for the clear communication and seamless execution needed for a strong and long-lasting client relationship to form. During this process, you may want to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mail them a welcome kit:</strong> Send along some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/giveaway-ideas">giveaways</a> like branded swag, a greeting card, and additional goodies based on the more personal information you’ve collected.</li>
<li><strong>Take care of housekeeping:</strong> Make sure each of you has the access needed for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/06/digital-marketing-tools">tools</a>, accounts, and dashboards.</li>
<li><strong>Have a kickoff meeting:</strong> This is to ensure everything is lined up for perfect execution. You’ve also become pretty familiar with one another at this point. This is a good time to have a more informal atmosphere.</li>
</ul>

<div id="Treat-clients-like-partners"></div>
<h3>5. Treat clients like partners</h3>
<p>Treating your client like a business will make your relationship purely transactional (i.e., no relationship at all). Treating them like family leaves too much room for miscommunications and unmet expectations.</p>
<p>Treating your clients like partners, on the other hand, sets the stage for a healthy mix of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/08/personal-branding">personal</a>, purposeful, and transactional encounters where both your and your client’s identities are preserved, and each of you supplies the essential ingredients for success.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Embrace the truth: </strong>Remember that at the end of the day, both of you are businesses that want to make money. There’s no need to skirt around that. They need your service to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/18/best-webinar-platforms">generate revenue</a>, and you need their continued business to generate yours.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain structure with some fluidity:</strong> Keep deliverables clear and stick to the intended plan as much as possible, but always leave the door open for input and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/24/customer-feedback">feedback</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Let them in: </strong>While some of your tools and processes may be proprietary, give them access to dashboards and data when possible. Let them in on (non-confidential) tidbits about your agency that “outsiders” wouldn’t know. Their earning your trust is just as important as you earning theirs.</li>
<li><strong>Stay honest:</strong> This means giving pushback on your client’s desires or requests that may not be best for long-term success (wants vs needs). A <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-to-look-for-in-a-digital-marketing-partner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good partnership</a> is not one where both parties constantly agree; it’s one where the two parties come together with different perspectives to bring to the table, resulting in better output than either one could have achieved on their own.</li>
</ul>
<div id="Be-proactive-rather-than-reactive"></div>
<h3>6. Be proactive rather than reactive</h3>
<ol start="6"></ol>
<p>Akvile DeFazio, President of AKvertise, makes this a priority with clients.</p>
<p>Her team makes sure to proactively:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share ideas and propose new campaign strategies.</li>
<li>Forewarn about upcoming <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/10/modified-broad-match-going-away">platform changes</a> and any action required.</li>
<li>Educate the client to empower them further.</li>
</ul>
<p>“This shows care and builds trust, and our clients share that they appreciate our diligent proactivity,” she says. “When we work with clients, we aim to be a seamless extension of their team and genuinely embed ourselves as so. When they win, we win, and proactive communication is the key to success for all.”</p>
<div id="Be-empathetic-rather-than-defensive"></div>
<h3>7. Be empathetic rather than defensive</h3>
<p>This recommendation from Mark Irvine, Director of PPC at Search Labs Digital, ties back to the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/search-marketing/5-things-youre-missing-out-without-search-marketing-partner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnership</a> mentality in tip #5. The scenario here is that your agency is doing great work.<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/marketing-performance-metrics"> Performance metrics</a> continue to climb. But the client is upset. They aren’t seeing new business come in.</p>
<p>“A wrong response here is to dig your heels in,” Mark says. “Telling them that their business is doing fine is at best tone-deaf. Instead, let them talk it out and listen to them. This may even lead them to discover the problem is in their other marketing or sales teams.”</p>
<p>If this ends up being the case, Irvine recommends that you take yourself out of the problem to prevent it from becoming an “us versus them” situation. Take the approach of teaming up together to come up with a solution. Use language like:</p>
<ul>
<li>“I see what you’re talking about.”</li>
<li>“This is a valid concern.”</li>
<li>“That really is frustrating, we’re glad you brought this up with us.”</li>
<li>“Let’s make a plan to review this and report back with some solutions to remedy this.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Position yourself as a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/seo/working-with-seo-partner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partner</a> in their campaigns. Value their feedback. Even if you’re an expert, allowing them to work with you will help build a long, trusting <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/09/crm-for-small-business">relationship</a>.</p>
<p>“And remember,” Mark adds, “if you dismiss or fight their concerns, there’s an agency sales rep somewhere else who will be happy to listen to them vent about you all day.”</p>
<div id="Establish-structure-around-communication"></div>
<h3>8. Establish structure around communication</h3>
<p>Brett McHale, founder of Empiric Marketing, LLC, provides some great tips around communication and setting boundaries:</p>
<h4>Stay away from being “always available</h4>
<p>Being always available, whether through Slack or other forms of direct communication, blurs the ever-important work-life balance. It can also distract you away from other clients.</p>
<h4>Hold regular meetings with actionable takeaways</h4>
<p>Instead, establish weekly or bi-weekly meetings to check in, review performance, and answer questions. “I always have some takeaway or action item from those meetings,” Brett says. “This keeps me accountable, and when I deliver on things that I say I’m going to do, it helps build trust with the client.”</p>
<h4>Use email and instant messaging</h4>
<p>Brett says, “Email can be very robotic, and I try not to be too professional or polished all the time. Communicating with clients directly via a messenger helps to build rapport and have a more laid back ‘human-to-human’ relationship.”</p>
<p>He suggests designating instant messaging for urgent matters and email otherwise. This cuts out the back-and-forth emailing and also reassures your clients that while you may not always be available, you will never leave them hanging.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/strengthen-agency-client-relationships-communication-1.jpg" alt="how to strengthen relationships with clients the seven c's of effective communication" width="512" height="528" /></div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/ocw/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=98509&amp;section=_unit2.5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<div id="Share-your-concerns-early"></div>
<h3>9. Share your concerns early</h3>
<p>This suggestion from Mark Irvine is particularly relevant to the many <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/05/state-of-the-digital-marketing-agency-2023">changes happening in the advertising realm</a> lately. The scenario here is that your client has big plans and aspirations, and you want to say yes to everything they want. But in the back of your mind, you’re not sure if they can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/19/google-custom-audiences">create that audience in Google</a> or build that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/25/bings-ads-vs-google-adwords">campaign on Bing</a>. You’re unsure of how the new iOS updates will impact their Facebook targeting.</p>
<p>“Don’t nod, say yes, and then stress,” Mark says. “You lose trust with your client if you say you can do something and then can’t, even if that’s not your fault.”</p>
<p>Instead, show your expertise by sharing your concerns. Practice saying:</p>
<ul>
<li>“That’s a really good idea. I know that some ad policies might come into play as we explore it, so let me double-check those first.”</li>
<li>“This new change could pose some challenges to us. I’ll keep an eye on it as it changes over the coming days.”</li>
<li>“It’s tough to say what this means for us yet, but I wanted to make sure we all knew about it in advance.”</li>
</ul>
<p>If you really have to put your foot down, try something like:</p>
<p><em>“We agree that this is a great idea, but we can’t in good conscience proceed with it until we know that it won’t cost you in the long run.”</em></p>
<p>Be transparent and ask them for their trust. Most of the time, you’ll come out as the person who helped them navigate through uncertainty, and they won’t forget that.</p>
<div id="Embrace-the-small-talk"></div>
<h3>10. Embrace small talk</h3>
<p>Small talk often gets a bad rap, but Susie Marino, WordStream’s Senior Content Marketing Specialist and former Customer Success Specialist, has found that it actually helps with building strong client relationships.</p>
<p>“I know it can feel cringey or uncomfortable at first, but just go for it,” she says. “You’d be surprised at how receptive clients are. Next thing you know, you’ve got a great rapport going, and the banter at the beginning of meetings becomes more meaningful.”</p>
<p>“People love to talk about themselves, and clients are no different,” Susie adds. “When you ask them about how that home garden is coming along, they’ll be pleasantly surprised. These conversations reveal how much you truly care.“</p>
<p>Clients are people who like to work with real people who also have personalities and personal lives. If you don’t show a touch of personality with small talk, it will be harder to stay connected and to demonstrate your genuine care, outside of campaigns and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/17/content-marketing-kpis">metrics</a>.</p>
<div id="Have-quarterly-business-reviews"></div>
<h3>11. Establish quarterly business reviews</h3>
<p>Francine Rodriguez, former Senior Manager of Customer Success at WordStream, believes that quarterly business reviews are essential for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/04/client-retention-tips">client retention</a>.</p>
<p>“I think all agencies get into a cycle of monthly reporting and proving that deliverables were completed,” she says. “It is important to take that step back once a quarter and have a focused conversation on high-level strategy.”</p>
<p>The QBR allows the agency and the customer to reflect on new goals, the efficiency of strategies taken in the past, and what needs to pivot for the future.</p>
<p>It is also a time to allow your customer to provide insight into how their business goals are changing and perhaps what strategies outside of the agency’s scope they are also planning in the near future. Having that dedicated time to talk without existing action items on the table is a great way to strengthen the relationship, create trust, and become better partners.</p>
<p>It may also lead to surprising discoveries, where an agency could find opportunities to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/30/cross-selling-upselling">upsell</a> its customers into new services. If your agency is doing QBRs now and your conversations don’t look any different from your regular monthly check-ins, it is time to change the format!”</p>
<h2>Start cultivating strong relationships with your clients today</h2>
<p>Strong agency-client relationships are built on virtues like trust, reliability, transparency, and personability, and they result in greater outcomes for everyone involved. If you find that you’re lacking in productivity, loyalty, or the overall feel of harmony with your clients, see if you can adopt or improve any of these strategies for your agency:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gather “hard” and “soft” information about your client</li>
<li>Internalize that information</li>
<li>Go above and beyond with your proposal</li>
<li>Have an onboarding process</li>
<li>Treat clients like partners</li>
<li>Be proactive rather than reactive</li>
<li>Be empathetic rather than defensive</li>
<li>Establish structure around communication</li>
<li>Share your concerns early</li>
<li>Embrace the small talk</li>
<li>Have quarterly business reviews</li>
</ol>

<h2>What are the benefits of an AI tool for your marketing agency?</h2>

<h3>Brainstorm ideas</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-ai-tools">AI writing tools</a> and search engines can spark new ideas for your marketing content and campaigns.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/08/chatgpt-prompts">Prompt an AI tool</a> with questions like, “What are 20 B2B pain points companies face in the [input] industry?”. Or try, “Give me 50 campaign ideas to attract new customers in the [input] industry.”</p>
<p>While you have to verify accuracy and weigh different ideas, it’s a great starting point to get in a creative flow.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency-wordstream-prompt.webp" alt="AI tools for marketing agency: Screenshot of a prompt and response from ChatGPT." width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-80946 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency-wordstream-prompt.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency-wordstream-prompt-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>Automate repetitive tasks</h3>

<p>You can save precious hours you would have spent doing grunt work and instead use them to strengthen your marketing strategy and produce more materials.</p>
<h3>Reach new markets</h3>
<p>AI platforms can identify <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/04/customer-segmentation-models">audience segments</a> you hadn’t thought of before. You can also reach more markets by automating your process and easily repurposing different content mediums for new platforms.</p>

<h2>Top AI tools for your marketing agency</h2>
<p>Most AI marketing tools are built for a specific purpose, like writing new copy or automating a workflow. That’s how we’ve categorized this list, based on the primary challenge each tool tackles.</p>
<div id="AI-tools-for-content-creation"></div>
<h3>AI tools for content and copy creation</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-copywriting-tools">AI copywriting tools</a> have received the most spotlight in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/24/technology/ai-technology-progress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent years</a>. That’s helped fuel the creation of innovative <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/05/generative-ai-in-digital-marketing">generative AI</a> tools with a growing list of useful features.</p>
<p>Since content isn’t all copy, we’ve included platforms that help you create and edit video and image assets, too.</p>
<h4>1. ChatGPT</h4>
<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT-3.5</a> and ChatGPT-4 (Open AI continues to create new versions) have led the AI writing craze by offering one of the most accessible copywriting tools.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency-wordstream-chatgpt.webp" alt="AI tools for marketing agency - ChatGPT homescreen. " width="870" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-80947 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency-wordstream-chatgpt.webp 870w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency-wordstream-chatgpt-480x331.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 870px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://chat.openai.com/auth/login" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>The platform is excellent for brainstorming. If you’re working on an email newsletter, social media campaign, or blog article, you can ask for ideas, outlines, lists, and many other starter materials to help you save time.</p>
<p>Some marketing agencies use it for content development, though there are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/28/ai-for-marketing">risks in trusting</a> its accuracy. Plus, the output often feels “AI-written.” But it’s a great trusty sidekick to get projects started and boost your marketing efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> ChatGPT-3.5 is free to use, ChatGPT-4 starts at $20 per month.</p>
<h4>2. Jasper</h4>
<p><a href="http://jasper.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jasper</a> is another great AI writing solution built for teams and creative workflows.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency-wordstream-jasper.webp" alt="AI tools for marketing agency - Jasper homescreen." width="847" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-80948 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency-wordstream-jasper.webp 847w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency-wordstream-jasper-480x340.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 847px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.jasper.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>You can efficiently work with the platform for quick project creation and execution. The tool offers <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-prompts-for-social-media">prompts</a> and automates the “human” part of AI writing by incorporating your brand voice.</p>
<p>The tool also helps you write more factually (compared to ChatGPT) and on-brand.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Plans start at $59 a month (billed annually).</p>
<h4>3. Copy.ai</h4>
<p>An alternative to Jasper, <a href="http://copy.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Copy.ai</a> helps marketing teams automate blog briefs, create copy (like scraping URLs for AI ad copy), and accelerate other writing tasks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency-wordstream-copyai.webp" alt="AI tools for marketing agency - Copy.ai homescreen." width="846" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-80949 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency-wordstream-copyai.webp 846w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency-wordstream-copyai-480x340.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 846px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.copy.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Copy.ai has many prompts and tools to help guide your writing queries for better results.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Copy.ai is free to use with limited words. Upgrade to unlimited words for $36 monthly (annual plan).</p>
<h4>4. LocaliQ&#8217;s Google Ads AI Copy Tool</h4>
<p>For being so short, Google Ads are mighty tough to write sometimes. You either get stuck in the rut of using the same words, or you just don&#8217;t have time.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can’t grow a digital marketing agency without acquiring new clients. And while you may be doing all the things to promote your shop, there’s one simple-but-powerful way to scale growth without spending a dime: verticalization.</p>
<p>Verticalization is simply the process of making your agency industry-specific. So instead of serving ecommerce, healthcare, and home services clients, you pick one and go all in on it.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at why narrowing your market focus is a sneaky smart way to grow your agency faster. And more importantly, let’s see the plan to do it efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f575.png" alt="🕵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> 300 of your agency competitors told us how they choose services, set pricing, and think about challenges. Download the <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite2023AgencyIndustryReport.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_StateoftheAgency2023_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incontent_links&amp;utm_content=2023SOTA">State of the Digital Marketing Agency report</a> to learn what they had to say.</p>
<h2>How does verticalization help your agency grow?</h2>
<p>In sports, athletes specialize in skills that help them become the best at a given event. A sprinter that spends time training for the shot put won’t win many races.</p>
<p>Likewise, a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/17/how-to-start-a-digital-marketing-agency">marketing agency</a> that becomes the expert in a single vertical will outperform an unfocused generalist. With that success comes the reputation as the go-to agency for other businesses in the same vertical, creating a flywheel of growth.</p>
<h3>Get more relevant referrals</h3>
<p>Why would a SaaS prospect care about the results you’ve driven for a brick-and-mortar client? They really don’t.</p>
<p>When you work exclusively in one market, your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">reviews</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/05/customer-testimonials">testimonials</a> come from businesses very like the ones you’re trying to sign. Your prospects see feedback from people who have the same challenges they do and feel comfortable that you can solve them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Agency-growth-verticalization-testimonial.webp" alt="Screenshot of a testimonial from a healthcare PPC agency" width="936" height="477" class="aligncenter wp-image-79025 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Agency-growth-verticalization-testimonial.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Agency-growth-verticalization-testimonial-480x245.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Verticalized customer testimonials are perfect decoration for your website and landing pages.</em></p>
<h3>Increase lifetime value</h3>
<p>The keys to increasing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/10/cac-vs-clv">client lifetime value</a> are offering more services and keeping clients around longer.</p>
<p>As you gain insider knowledge of a target industry, you’ll be able to apply it to other services. That gives you an opportunity to grow through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/30/cross-selling-upselling">cross-sell</a> and add-ons.</p>
<p>Say you run <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/pay-per-click-campaign">PPC campaigns</a> for real estate professionals. You’ll gain a ton of knowledge about real estate marketing that’s applicable to organic social media or content creation.</p>
<p>Those additional services will also make your agency more important to each client, which means less churn. It’s a lot easier to grow when you’re not replacing lost clients with new ones.</p>
<h3>Build trust through expertise</h3>
<p>It’s a lot easier to become an expert in all things <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/11/ecommerce-ppc">PPC for ecommerce</a> clients than to do the same for multiple verticals. That means you’ll know exactly how to describe the problems and solutions each of your prospects has in terms they understand.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Agency-growth-verticalization-tiktok.webp" alt="screenshot of a tiktok from a PPC educator" width="422" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-79027 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Agency-growth-verticalization-tiktok.webp 422w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Agency-growth-verticalization-tiktok-211x300.webp 211w" sizes="(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Show your expertise by sharing knowledge on social media platforms.</em></p>
<p>Plus, you’ll confidently know how to solve each prospect’s challenges. Your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/13/marketing-proposal">marketing proposals</a> will become so much more convincing.</p>
<h3>Scale more efficiently</h3>
<p>If you’re managing and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/07/agency-profitability-metrics">measuring</a> PPC spend for clients in several industries, you’re going to be implementing widely different strategies for each one. A SaaS client needs to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/04/nurture-marketing">nurture prospects</a> through a long sales cycle, where a retail store needs you to ramp up ads in Q4.</p>
<p>Representing businesses from only one vertical lets you replicate <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/05/02/adwords-account-structure-guide">account structures</a> across clients. Onboarding new clients is more efficient, and you deliver better results faster while reducing the overhead to do it.</p>
<h3>Reduce your competition</h3>
<p>There are a lot of multi-vertical agencies. There are considerably fewer agencies that only serve restaurant chains or home repair and maintenance businesses.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Agency-growth-verticalization-real-estate.webp" alt="screenshot of a Google ad for restaurant PPC agency" width="936" height="362" class="aligncenter wp-image-79028 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Agency-growth-verticalization-real-estate.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Agency-growth-verticalization-real-estate-480x186.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Your agency will stand out in the crowd when you target a specific vertical.</em></p>
<p>Plus, now that you’re the go-to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-digital-marketing-agency">agency</a> in your industry, you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/15/ppc-agency-pricing">charge a premium</a> for your services over your competitors..</p>
<h2>How to verticalize your agency in seven steps</h2>
<p>The good news is that verticalization isn’t a huge undertaking. The hardest part is committing—it’ll feel weird turning down clients outside of your niche.</p>
<p>Once you set your mind to it, just follow these seven steps and you’re on the way to the riches that come from niches.</p>
<h3>1. Pick a vertical</h3>
<p>This is the most difficult step for many agencies for two reasons. First, you’ll inevitably experience FOMO when opportunities in a different industry pop up. And second, this step requires a good bit of research.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-research">Keyword research</a> is your best friend here. Why? Because if people are searching for an agency in a specific vertical, there’s evidence of demand.</p>
<p>“Dental marketing agency” and “restaurant marketing agency,” for example, both get searched a couple hundred times a month in the US, which indicates substantial demand. “Dance school marketing agency,” on the other hand, doesn’t get searched much at all.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="👋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />You can use our free <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">keyword tool</a> to learn which industries search the most for digital marketing agencies.</p>
<h3>2. Study your industry</h3>
<p>Got the industry you want to go after? Good. Now it’s time to study.</p>
<p>Winning the trust of advertisers in your target vertical requires you to answer several questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the most common <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points">pain points</a>?</li>
<li>What are the most common obstacles to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/27/growth-academy">growth</a>?</li>
<li>What are these businesses trying to accomplish?</li>
<li>Who are they trying to get in the door? How long is the average <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/01/26/sales-cycle">sales cycle</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>To find your answers, follow Reddit threads, industry Slack groups, and influencers on X (FKA Twitter) and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Empathy plays a huge role in the endeavor. Whenever you spend time learning about your chosen industry, try to imagine yourself in their shoes. That will help you market their business more effectively and make your pitches more effective.</p>
<h3>3. Develop a strategy</h3>
<p>This is where all the knowledge you’ve acquired pays off. Before you start pitching, you need to get the wheels turning on strategy. You’ve got to think in terms of the funnel.</p>
<p>For example, what do conversions look like in this industry?</p>
<p>Let’s say you’ve decided to target the local gym scene. Ask yourself: What do gym owners consider conversions? They probably include things like watching a Facebook video, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/07/call-only-ads">making a phone call</a>, signing up for a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/25/email-newsletter-ideas">newsletter</a>, downloading a guide, scheduling a consultation, doing a trial period, and purchasing a membership.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Agency-growth-verticalization-fitness-ad.webp" alt="screenshot of a fitness ad offering free trial" width="936" height="484" class="aligncenter wp-image-79029 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Agency-growth-verticalization-fitness-ad.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Agency-growth-verticalization-fitness-ad-480x248.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>When you understand an industry’s sales funnel, you can tailor ads to move people through it.</em></p>
<p>Once you’ve determined those conversion actions, it’s time to figure out how you’re going to drive them. Get <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/08/facebook-video-ads">Facebook video</a> views by targeting <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-lookalike-audiences">lookalike audiences</a> based on gyms’ current customers. Drive content downloads by targeting the people who watched at least half of those videos. Use the contact information you get from those content downloads to offer free trial periods. You get the idea.</p>
<p>Notice how the strategy you build for customer #1 works for all of your clients? That’s how you scale quickly.</p>
<h3>4. Find new prospects</h3>
<p>Rubber, meet road. You’ve got a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/21/facebook-funnel">full-funnel marketing</a> strategy built for a specific industry that you know inside and out. Now it’s time to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/01/how-to-get-clients">get new clients</a>.</p>
<p>Google searches are, again, a good place to start. Try entering industry specific keywords that match your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">ideal customer</a> like “dentists near me” or “small retail businesses in Oregon.”</p>
<p>You can also search <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/01/business-directory-listings">business directories</a> like Yelp and others to find businesses that have good reviews and are more active online. Those are often easier to sell to since they value internet traffic.</p>
<h3>5. Review their ads and pitch</h3>
<p>Since you’re just starting out, you’ll probably have to do some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/03/cold-email">cold outreach</a>. Take the potential prospects you’ve found and evaluate their Google search results.</p>
<p>Are they running paid search ads? If so, are they doing a good job?</p>
<p>If the answer to both of those questions is a resounding no, give those places a call or send an email and let them know how you can help. You can include <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/15/google-ads-benchmarks">Google Ads industry benchmark costs</a> for them to compare as another way to show your vertical expertise.</p>
<p>One word of caution. Be careful how you present this information. You don’t want to insult the people who may hire you.</p>
<h3>6. Audit your work</h3>
<p>You’ve signed a handful of clients in your new industry…congrats! But your path to verticalization isn’t complete.</p>
<p>The next step is to audit your work against the overall vertical for things like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/quality-score">Quality Score</a>, impression share, and wasted spend. You can use a tool like our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Paid_GGL_Search_AdWords_AdWordsGrader_AWGrader&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=PPC&amp;utm_campaign=paid_freetool&amp;utm_content=rsa&amp;utm_term=check%20adwords&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAvoqsBhB9EiwA9XTWGUPcJYP0pi3_o9KFavl8jq9hfDd8xlcsulgFR5pb2SmE4v3X0esXtRoCdAEQAvD_BwE">Google Ads Grader</a> to complete your audit.<em></em></p>
<p>Package the results and recommendations in a verticalized report and send it to your clients.</p>
<h3>7. Find your next client</h3>
<p>Your first successful clients are a fantastic source of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/01/10/social-proof-guide">social proof</a>. Use it to gain new clients.</p>
<p>For starters, don’t be afraid to ask your clients for references and reviews. It may feel odd at first, but it’ll be familiar to most people (we all get asked for reviews all the time). Make sure to include the request on invoices, in emails, and have a link on your website so people can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/09/google-ratings">rate you on Google</a>.</p>
<p>Use customer testimonials to write up <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/03/how-to-write-a-case-study">case studies</a> and plaster them all over your website. You can even add it to future client pitches. Any place where a little extra social proof will help win a new client.</p>
<h2>To scale agency growth, go vertical</h2>
<p>It seems counterintuitive to grow faster by narrowing your addressable market. But tripling your new-business close rate in one vertical is much better than failing to win new business in a bunch of them.</p>
<p>To put yourself on the path of growth through verticalization, remember these seven steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick a vertical</li>
<li>Study your industry</li>
<li>Develop a strategy</li>
<li>Find new prospects</li>
<li>Review and pitch</li>
<li>Audit your work</li>
<li>Find your next client</li>
</ol>

<h2>What is a marketing proposal?</h2>
<p>A marketing proposal is a written document that an agency/marketer provides to a client to communicate the details of a given project or service. Those details include everything the client and stakeholder need to decide whether to sign the contract.</p>
<p>Like any <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/11/business-proposals">good business proposal</a>, the marketing proposal comes after a discovery session where the agency/marketer collects all of the information they need to formulate the strategy, timeline, and pricing.</p>

<h2>Why you need a marketing proposal</h2>
<p>So we just covered the basic definition and purpose of a marketing proposal, but there’s more to it than just information. It’s part art, part science. The science part is the logistics, quantifiable goals, metrics, timelines, and deliverables. The art part is how you present it, and how you use it to bring about the intangibles in your clients, like excitement about success, confidence in your services, and relief that their problem will be solved.</p>
<p>A marketing proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides all of the information needed for a prospective client to confidently say yes.</li>
<li>Shows how you can organize and convey information in a compelling way.</li>
<li>Gives you a chance to <a href="https://www.proposify.com/proposal-templates/marketing-proposal-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stand out from competitors</a> and also show that you’ve listened closely and thought through the details.</li>
<li>Highlights your qualifications and past successes.</li>
<li>Helps you to map out the project and stay accountable.</li>
<li>Protects you from scope creep and unpaid invoices.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What to include in a marketing proposal</h2>
<p>What you include in your marketing proposal will depend on your services, your client, and your industry, but here is a list that you can pick and choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cover page:</strong> Your first impression! Make it bold, attractive, and catered to your client’s brand feel.</li>
<li><strong>Executive summary:</strong> Summarizes the overarching problem, goal, and solution; the big picture concept that will get stakeholders to want to listen in on the rest of the presentation.</li>
<li><strong>Table of contents:</strong> A small but necessary detail to help your client navigate through the content on their own.</li>
<li><strong>Goals:</strong> What the client is striving to achieve. These should include both the project goals as well as how those goals fit into greater organizational and <a href="https://www.proposify.com/proposal-templates/marketing-proposal-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing goals</a>. Ideally, these goals are measurable.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges:</strong> What’s getting in the way of achieving those goals. Your client will know most of their challenges but you may also be able to identify additional ones during the discovery session.</li>
<li><strong>Solutions:</strong> The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/03/best-marketing-strategies">marketing strategies</a> you will implement to solve for the challenges and goals.</li>
<li><strong>Scope of work:</strong> The tactics of the strategies, as well as timeframes and other operational details.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> The deliverables of each phase or strategy, how they tie back to the core goals, and any additional benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing: </strong>The cost to the client fully broken out.  May have a few options to choose from. Provides clear return on investment</li>
<li><strong>Working with us:</strong> A look into the team members, your culture, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/09/company-core-values">values</a>. Keep it focused on what value this delivers to the client.</li>
<li><strong>Why us?</strong> Any <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/19/customer-testimonial-examples">testimonials</a>, awards, success metrics, special skills, or social proof that make you especially fit for the job.</li>
<li><strong>Contract:</strong> The terms and conditions and any other legalese you need to include. Try to keep this as easy to read as possible.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips for creating a winning marketing proposal</h2>
<p>It’s not just the information that goes into your proposal—but also how you gather, present, and deliver that information—that matters. Here are some tips on creating marketing proposals that win over clients.</p>
<h3>Do your prep work</h3>
<p>The proposal should come after a thorough discovery session where you get all of the information you need. Take detailed notes so your proposal doesn’t just satisfy their needs, but reflects that you listen carefully and care about and will cater to their individual preferences.</p>
<p>Information to gather in the discovery session:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goals and challenges (short and long-term)</li>
<li>The problem and the source of the problem</li>
<li>Past/existing strategies/successes/failures (including other agencies)</li>
<li>Existing metrics/What will success look like</li>
<li>Priorities</li>
<li>Emotions involved (frustrations, desires, pain points)</li>
<li>The personalities and work styles of the client’s team members</li>
<li>Their timeline, budget, stakeholders</li>
<li>Their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a>, brand messaging, and customer journey</li>
</ul>
<h3>Do additional research</h3>
<p>Your client knows their business best, but you should still do additional research both before and after the discovery session. Gather as much as you can about the client before the session so you can demonstrate your diligence, alleviate them from having to educate you, and free up more time for the more nuanced details.</p>
<p>Do research after the session, on the market, competition, and anything pertinent to the session. This will allow you to add stats and examples to your proposal that can strengthen your case and further <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-demonstrate-value-to-your-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demonstrate your value</a>.</p>
<h3>Make it easy to read and visual</h3>
<p>This is the same tip I give for <a href="https://www.usehatchapp.com/blog/hvac-service-contract-templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">service businesses in their service contracts</a>. Don’t write in complex or formal language to try and impress your client! Keep it <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/05/conversational-tone">conversational </a>and easy to read. Use terms they use, and constantly refer back to the problems and goals they are focused on. Also, visualize wherever you can, such as with timelines:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/marketing-proposal-timeline.webp" alt="how to write a marketing proposal - example of timelines in marketing proposal" width="936" height="545" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-78447" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/marketing-proposal-timeline.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/marketing-proposal-timeline-480x279.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Keep it client-focused</h3>
<p>While a marketing proposal is an opportunity to show your value and set yourself apart from competitors, it needs to stay focused on the client, not you. Any time you highlight something great about your business, be sure to connect it back to what value that provides for the clent.</p>
<h3>Walk through it with them</h3>
<p>Don’t just email the proposal over to your client. Set a time to meet and walk through it together. This will ensure the proposal communicates the information and messaging that you intended and ensures the client sees the details in your work. You can then send the proposal after the meeting and give them time to digest it, think it over, and come up with any other questions before signing.</p>

You can also make changes to the master template and customze the design to your branding. In addition, you can use Jotform itself to share the proposal via email and collect e-signatures from any device. It doesn’t include examples and it’s pretty basic, so this is best for marketers who know what makes an effective proposal and just need a tool to make it look great and/or offer esigning.</p>

Like the above two templates, it’s best for marketers who can write effective proposal copy and just need a way to design it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can’t grow an agency if you don’t get new clients. Heck, you can’t even stay the same size, as some clients will leave eventually. And that’s why new client acquisition is always a top challenge for agencies.</p>

<div id="generate-referrals"></div>
<h2>1. Generate referrals from past and present clients</h2>
<p>Referrals come from happy clients that introduce your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-digital-marketing-agency">agency</a> to new prospects. That means a referred lead already has some trust in your agency, making it one of the most valuable types of leads you can get.</p>
<p>The first step in generating more referrals is simply to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/06/referral-marketing">ask for them</a>. Reach out to current and even past clients and ask if anyone else they know could benefit from the results you’ve provided.</p>
<p>But to really put your new client acquisition on overdrive, take a page from other high-growth companies and create a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/14/referral-program-ideas">customer referral program</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-to-get-clients-wordstream-example-hello-fresh.webp" alt="How to get clients - screenshot of hello fresh's referral program" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-78267 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-to-get-clients-wordstream-example-hello-fresh.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-to-get-clients-wordstream-example-hello-fresh-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>B2C companies like Hello Fresh rock customer referral programs and your agency can, too.</em></p>
<p>To get your referral program going:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choose the offer:</strong> Pick an incentive, like a free service or future discount, to give to clients that successfully refer a new lead.</li>
<li><strong>Make it easy:</strong> Create a simple form clients can use to refer other businesses.</li>
<li><strong>Promote your program:</strong> Remind clients during regular meetings and via email so your referral program is always top of mind.</li>
</ul>

<div id="get-reviews"></div>
<h2>2. Get reviews</h2>
<p>Reviews are like referrals on blast. A single <a href="https://www.link-assistant.com/news/top-search-engines.html">detailed review</a> of your services in a highly visible place like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/16/get-more-google-reviews">Google</a> can influence hundreds of would-be clients. And since <a href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/the-importance-of-online-customer-reviews-infographic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">88%</a> of people say an online review is as influential as a personal recommendation, reviews are an important method to get clients.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-to-get-clients-wordstream-example-review.webp" alt="Get more clients - example of an agency review on Google" width="515" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-78269 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-to-get-clients-wordstream-example-review.webp 515w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-to-get-clients-wordstream-example-review-480x559.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 515px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Reviews on popular online platforms are new-client magnets.</em></p>
<p>Of course, the first step in getting great reviews is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/04/customer-experience-strategy">provide great service</a>. Assuming you have that covered, you’ll want to attract new reviews in as many ways as possible.</p>
<p>Here are a few tactics you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Directly ask (here’s a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">list of templates</a> to ask for reviews by phone, email, and more)</li>
<li>Add a link with a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">call to action</a> on your website</li>
<li>Hand out physical “leave us a review” card</li>
<li>Include review opportunities in customer satisfaction surveys</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t forget to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-respond-to-google-reviews-with-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">respond to reviews</a>, since most people reading a review also see your response. It’s a chance to celebrate great reviews and rectify the less-than-flattering ones.</p>
<div id="network-with-complimentary-businesses"></div>
<h2>3. Network with complementary businesses</h2>
<p>Other businesses in your sphere need clients, too. You can help each other out by trading referrals.</p>
<p>Let’s say you focus on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/13/content-marketing-strategy">content marketing</a>, but one of your clients needs help running <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/ppc">PPC campaigns</a>. Offer the lead to a PPC agency you trust and ask that they return the favor sometime.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/05/linkedin-advertising">LinkedIn</a> is an amazing place to build your professional network. Message complementary businesses and let them know you’ll look out for them if they do the same.</p>
<div id="turn-employees-into-ambassadors"></div>
<h2>4. Turn employees into ambassadors</h2>
<p>Each of your employees has a network and a sphere of influence. As they work in their field longer, their influence grows. Tap into this network by helping your employees become ambassadors for your agency.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-to-get-clients-wordstream-example-ambassador-5.webp" alt="Get more clients - example of an agency employee's post on Linkedin." width="476" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-78272 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-to-get-clients-wordstream-example-ambassador-5.webp 476w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-to-get-clients-wordstream-example-ambassador-5-238x300.webp 238w" sizes="(max-width: 476px) 100vw, 476px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Even if it’s just reposting content your agency creates, employees can introduce your agency to lots of new audiences.</em></p>
<p>An easy way to do this is to ask your team to post about important company milestones on their social media accounts. Maybe it’s your 100th client, 10-year anniversary, or the company retreat. Posts like this help build your brand without pushing a hard sell—something many people would be reluctant to do on their personal feeds.</p>
<p>Another option is to send employees to conferences. Junior team members can benefit from the educational and networking experience. Senior employees could be speakers or panelists. In either case, you’ll have people out in the field drumming up awareness for your business.</p>
<div id="share-your-secrets"></div>
<h2>5. Share your secrets</h2>
<p>Most people will run marketing in house before they turn to an agency. Teach people how to do it themselves, and your agency will be at the top of the list when it’s time to hire.</p>
<p>That may sound counter-intuitive, but some of the biggest modern businesses grew rapidly using that exact technique.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-to-get-clients-wordstream-example-tiktok.webp" alt="Get more clients - Screenshot of TikTok about PPC ads." width="422" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-78273 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-to-get-clients-wordstream-example-tiktok.webp 422w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-to-get-clients-wordstream-example-tiktok-211x300.webp 211w" sizes="(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>TikTok is a sleeper hit for educating prospective clients with quick, fun videos.</em></p>
<p>The good news is, there are plenty of formats and channels to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/13/content-marketing-strategy">educate</a> your future clients. Without getting terribly creative, here are 10 options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Produce a blog (bonus points because it’ll help your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO</a>)</li>
<li>Create a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/25/email-newsletter-ideas">newsletter</a></li>
<li>Speak at conferences and events</li>
<li>Publish <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/06/21/guest-posting-dos-donts">guest posts</a></li>
<li>Be a podcast guest</li>
<li>Create (or co-host) a webinar</li>
<li>Share <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/13/video-ad-tools">educational videos</a> on TikTok or YouTube</li>
<li>Post content on social media (especially <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/19/linkedin-company-page-features-examples">LinkedIn</a>!)</li>
<li>Create mini-courses on your website</li>
<li>Hold in-person lunch-and-learns</li>
</ol>
<p>With a little imagination, you can probably come up with more. The goal is to pick the platforms that you’re comfortable with and that will appeal to your future clients.</p>
<div id="present-fixes-to-prospects"></div>
<h2>6. Present fixes to prospect’s problems</h2>
<p>This is an underrated tactic for getting new clients. Google companies in your target niche and see what their existing ad campaigns look like. Make a list of what you’d do differently, then email the company with ideas for them to improve.</p>
<p>This strategy works great for any type of marketing agency because advertising is, by nature, public. You can also use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/06/digital-marketing-tools">tools</a> like Ahrefs or Moz to learn more about what’s working or not with your prospect’s marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Sure, some will take your thoughts and run with them. But many will want your help to make sure their next campaign is better.</p>
<div id="price-properly"></div>
<h2>7. Price properly</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/15/ppc-agency-pricing">Agency pricing</a> isn’t just about making a profit, it’s part of your brand. Let’s break this down.</p>
<p>Do you offer a truly a premium option with white-glove service? Then your pricing should be a little higher than your average competitor. Not just to cover the costs of the additional service, but also to signal to clients that what you do is different.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if your niche is helping fledgling businesses get a foothold online, and you do it at scale using automation, then your pricing might be lower. Again, it’s not just about the cost-plus-profit calculation. It’s another way to express your brand.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="👋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Want to know how other agencies price their services (plus what they see as their biggest challenges)?

<div id="be-active-on-social-media"></div>
<h2>8. Be active on social media</h2>
<p>It’s impossible to understate the value of time spent on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">social media</a>. Nowhere else can you build a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/03/social-media-networks">network</a>, prove your expertise, and directly connect with future clients on such a large scale.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: you can’t just be a lurker. You have to be consistently active to get the benefits of social media.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-to-get-clients-wordstream-example-impact.webp" alt="Get more clients - screenshot of an interaction on social media." width="775" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-78274 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-to-get-clients-wordstream-example-impact.webp 775w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-to-get-clients-wordstream-example-impact-480x372.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 775px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Don’t just post on social media; reply to comments on your posts and comment on other people’s posts.</em></p>
<p>Here are a few actions that’ll get you more clients quickly from social media:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">hashtags</a> relevant to your business and join those conversations</li>
<li>Reply to other people’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/10/facebook-post-ideas">posts</a></li>
<li>Save your replies and expand on them to create new posts</li>
<li>Reply to everyone who comments on your posts</li>
<li>Fill out your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/instagram-bio-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">profile</a> completely (add links, professional images, and a business description)</li>
</ul>
<div id="create-an-ideal-customer-profile"></div>
<h2>9. Create an ideal customer profile</h2>
<ol start="9"></ol>
<p>An ideal customer profile (ICP) is a little like a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/23/buyer-personas">buyer persona</a>, but it focuses more on your client’s organization than just the point of contact. This works well for agencies selling to other businesses, since people change positions, but the company remains relatively the same.</p>
<p>Creating an ICP takes a few minutes, but the time is worthwhile. An ICP will help you find the clients that help you be more successful while filtering out those that’ll drain your agency&#8217;s resources.</p>
<p>Here are a few steps you can use to create a basic ICP for your agency:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>List client traits you want to have on your ICP:</strong> For agencies, it’ll be things like marketing goals, business model, company size, and industry.</li>
<li><strong>Review past clients:</strong> Where do successful and less successful clients fall in these categories?</li>
<li><strong>Create a point system:</strong> Assign points to each trait (so if your dental clients are always successful and construction clients aren’t, then dental prospects get 3 points and construction prospects get 0).</li>
</ul>
<p>Place all of this on a spreadsheet. Then continue to refine your ICP based on the success of new clients. Over time you’ll have a foolproof way of finding the best clients for your agency.</p>
<div id="go-big-on-social-proof"></div>
<h2><strong></strong>10. Go big on social proof</h2>
<p>We’ve already mentioned how positive reviews and referrals help you build a fast-growing agency. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/01/10/social-proof-guide">Social proof</a> does the same thing, only it’s much broader and more flexible.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-to-get-clients-wordstream-example-social-proof.webp" alt="Get more clients - screenshot of an agency's website with social proof" width="936" height="476" class="aligncenter wp-image-78275 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-to-get-clients-wordstream-example-social-proof.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-to-get-clients-wordstream-example-social-proof-480x244.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Splash your awards, reviews, and results all over your website.</em></p>
<p>Social proof is just about any <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/27/trust-signals">trust signal</a> that shows people how awesome your agency is. That can be quotes from customers, the total revenue you’ve earned clients, logos of companies you’ve helped, or awards you’ve won.</p>
<p>Social proof can also be long form, like customer stories or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/03/how-to-write-a-case-study">case studies</a>.</p>
<p>As you gather proof that your agency is awesome, put that stuff on everything. Landing pages, emails, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/13/marketing-proposal">proposals</a>, anywhere a potential client might learn about your business should be decorated with social proof.</p>
<div id="be-transparent"></div>
<h2><strong></strong>11.Be transparent</h2>
<p>It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of signing a new client. But it&#8217;s really important to communicate the realities of working with you at the very beginning. If the truth of what you do and how you do it scares a client away, that’ll save you a ton of headache later on (and allow that client to find the right agency for them).</p>
<p>Here are a few points to make clear as you’re wooing new clients:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What you can and can’t do:</strong> If you’re a PPC expert but haven’t focused on SEO, let the client know.</li>
<li><strong>Set a communication schedule:</strong> Let your new client know they’ll get a review every month and that Fridays are off-limits.</li>
<li><strong>Set proper expectations:</strong> Tell a customer upfront that results will take a while if they’re in a heavily populated market and have a small budget.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t be afraid to say no:</strong> If a client asks for something that will not work, tell them so.</li>
<li><strong>Put everything in writing:</strong> Document each call in an email that you can refer to if there are questions later on.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may turn a few clients away who have unrealistic expectations. But know that they’ll be back after the agency that lies to them doesn’t deliver.</p>
<h2>Learn how to get clients faster</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a team of dedicated, experienced business development professionals selling your agency, then you might find it difficult to keep new clients flowing through the front door.</p>
<p>No problem! Just remember these tips and you’ll find plenty of ways to get clients, even without a team of salespeople.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a brief hiatus, WordStream’s State of the Digital Marketing Agency report is back—and this time, it’s bigger than ever!</p>
<p>We surveyed over 300 agencies in the US and Canada on everything from the services they offer, how they price those services, their size and structure, their biggest business challenges, and so much more.</p>
<p>To give you a little peek at some of the data, we’re featuring 10 of the biggest takeaways and what they mean for your agency. Let’s dive in!</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f5dd.png" alt="🗝" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong><a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite2023AgencyIndustryReport.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_StateoftheAgency2023_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incontent_links&amp;utm_content=2023SOTA">Download the full State of the Digital Marketing Agency industry report</a></strong> <strong>for 25 charts and data points that will guide your 2024 planning!</strong></p>
<h2>1. More agencies are pricing using a hybrid model</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-pricing.webp" alt="wordstream state of the digital marketing agency 2023 - agency pricing models" width="933" height="815" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76332" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-pricing.webp 933w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-pricing-480x419.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 933px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Our data shows that the hybrid billing model has grown in popularity over the last few years. In our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/20/state-of-the-internet-marketing-agency-report-2020">2020 report</a>, flat fee and hybrid billing models were about equally common, but this year, almost half of all agencies we surveyed are using a hybrid billing model.</p>
<p>“There are lots of options for how agencies can price their services. We’ve seen hybrid billing models grow in popularity because they provide the flexibility for agencies to price their services in a way that benefits both their clients and their own bottom line.” said Erin Rose, Sr. Director of Partner Development for LocaliQ.</p>
<p><a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite2023AgencyIndustryReport.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_StateoftheAgency2023_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incontent_links&amp;utm_content=2023SOTA"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-ad-spend-download-banner.png" alt="state of the agency chart download banner" width="936" height="192" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76291" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-ad-spend-download-banner.png 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-ad-spend-download-banner-480x98.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<h2>2. Agencies are charging extra fees for creative services</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-additional-fees-pricing.webp" alt="wordstream state of the digital marketing agency 2023 - agencies charging additional fees" width="933" height="858" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76333" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-additional-fees-pricing.webp 933w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-additional-fees-pricing-480x441.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 933px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Curious what services and add-ons agencies are charging additional fees for? <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">Landing page creation</a> was the most popular, followed by image ad creation and display creative.</p>
<p>This makes sense because these are time-consuming marketing activities that require expertise and creativity. Plus, effective landing pages and strong creative are crucial to the success of digital marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>Aside from creative services, reporting and tracking were valuable services agencies charged additional fees for.</p>
<p>By offering these services in-house, even for an additional fee, you can add value to your existing services while increasing revenue for your agency.</p>
<h2>3. Social ads is the most widely offered service by these agencies</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-services-offered.webp" alt="wordstream state of the digital marketing agency 2023 - agency services offered" width="933" height="869" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76335" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-services-offered.webp 933w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-services-offered-480x447.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 933px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It’s interesting to see the mix of services the agencies we surveyed offer—with social ads, content, and creative services leading the pack, followed by SEO, <a href="https://localiq.com/products/search-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search advertising</a>, and email marketing.</p>
<p>These strategies continue to be accessible and cost-effective for all types of businesses—making them a reliable option for agencies offering digital marketing services.</p>
<p>This data also shows that most agencies are offering multiple services for their clients. (We dive deeper into that data <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite2023AgencyIndustryReport.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_StateoftheAgency2023_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incontent_links&amp;utm_content=2023SOTA">in the report</a>.)</p>
<h2>4. Most clients run multiple services with one agency</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-products-services-running.webp" alt="wordstream state of the digital marketing agency 2023 - number of services running with agency partners" width="933" height="851" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76336" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-products-services-running.webp 933w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-products-services-running-480x438.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 933px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Of those surveyed, 93% said their clients are running two or more services with them—with 34% saying their clients run an average of 4 or more services with their agency.</p>
<p>This is good news because if your clients are running more services with you, there’s a good chance you’ll be able to retain and potentially upsell them.</p>
<p>This also means your agency should consider ways to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/05/maximize-agency-profitability">offer more services to clients</a>. Running one or just a couple of services decreases your revenue potential—and keeps you from providing a better experience for clients who will have to work across agencies for all their digital marketing needs.</p>
<h2>5. Agencies are spending a lot of time managing paid search for their clients</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-time-spend-ppc-management.webp" alt="wordstream state of the digital marketing agency 2023 - time spent managing ppc per client" width="933" height="849" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76337" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-time-spend-ppc-management.webp 933w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-time-spend-ppc-management-480x437.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 933px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>41% of agencies offering search advertising services are spending 2-4 hours per week managing PPC per client—and 16% are spending 5 or more! This time can add up quickly and hinder your agency from onboarding new clients and adding more services to help retain existing clients.</p>
<p>If you’re spending more than a couple hours per week managing search per client, consider outsourcing or researching automated tools that can cut down on your PPC management without sacrificing results.</p>
<h2>6. Smaller agencies have fewer employees performing multiple job duties</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-fulltime-employees.webp" alt="wordstream state of the digital marketing agency 2023 - agency employee size" width="933" height="845" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76338" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-fulltime-employees.webp 933w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-fulltime-employees-480x435.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 933px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>53% of those surveyed have fewer than 25 employees and 23% are sole practitioners. Meaning most of these agencies’ employees are wearing multiple hats, from account management, sales, reporting, and more.</p>
<p>For example, over half of agencies surveyed don’t have any employees fully dedicated to sales. 18% have employees partially dedicated to sales, and 43% have at least one employee fully dedicated to sales.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a tip, though. Many smaller agencies are using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency">marketing AI tools</a> to swing above their weight.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite2023AgencyIndustryReport.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_StateoftheAgency2023_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incontent_links&amp;utm_content=2023SOTA">Download the report</a> to find out what percentage of agencies have employees dedicated to account management.</p>
<h2>7. Agencies have a varied tech stack (that now includes AI tools)</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-tech-stack-chart.webp" alt="wordstream state of the digital marketing agency 2023 - tools in tech stack for agencies" width="932" height="850" class="aligncenter wp-image-76325 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-tech-stack-chart.webp 932w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-tech-stack-chart-480x438.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 932px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>A good tech stack is essential for agencies—especially smaller agencies doing more with fewer people and resources. Tools for marketing automation and email marketing like HubSpot and MailChimp continue to be important for agencies.</p>
<p>Agencies are also commonly using tools and software for reporting and analytics, project management, content management, and ecommerce/payments.</p>
<p>But one new addition is the prominence of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/21/chatgpt-impact-on-marketing">ChatGPT</a>. This AI tool has become an important resource for agencies and marketers looking to automate tasks that were more time intensive. We’ll be curious how the use of AI tools will evolve and impact agencies in the future.</p>
<h2>8. Managed spend has grown (but at a slower rate than in 2018-2020)</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-managed-spend-growth.webp" alt="wordstream state of the digital marketing agency 2023 - managed spend growth" width="933" height="775" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76339" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-managed-spend-growth.webp 933w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-managed-spend-growth-480x399.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 933px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>34% of those surveyed said their spend under management has stayed the same in the last year. 53% said their spend under management has grown in the last year—26% by more than 25% and 27% by less than 25%.</p>
<p>Between the stressors of the economy and coming out of the pandemic, it’s encouraging to see that agencies have been able to grow their managed spend, although the rate of growth is lower than we saw in our 2018-2020 reports.</p>
<h2>9. Referrals remains the top source for getting new clients</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-client-acquisition.webp" alt="wordstream state of the digital marketing agency 2023 - how agencies get new clients" width="933" height="843" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76340" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-client-acquisition.webp 933w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-client-acquisition-480x434.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 933px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As we found in previous reports, client referrals were by far the top source for acquiring new clients, followed (not closely) by content and digital marketing.</p>
<p>Referrals are amazing, but if your challenge is finding new clients you should switch it up. Use these tips to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/02/strategies-to-grow-your-digital-marketing-agency">get new clients</a> if your referral well is running dry.</p>
<h2>10. Economic conditions and uncertainty is the biggest challenge for agencies for 2024</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-challenges.webp" alt="wordstream state of the digital marketing agency 2023 - biggest challenges" width="932" height="1150" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76341" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-challenges.webp 932w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wordstream-state-of-the-agency-2023-challenges-480x592.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 932px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Getting new clients has been a consistent top challenge for the agencies we’ve surveyed since 2018. The agencies we surveyed this year still anticipate getting new clients will be a big challenge, but <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/recession-proof-small-business-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economic conditions and uncertainty</a> is the top challenge they’re worried about for 2024.</p>
<p>This answer wasn’t even an option in previous reports, and agencies were reporting higher rates of growth. For example, in 2018, nearly half of agencies surveyed saw their managed spend increase by more than 25%, compared to only 26% this year.</p>
<p>We included some tips for how to address this challenge <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite2023AgencyIndustryReport.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_StateoftheAgency2023_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incontent_links&amp;utm_content=2023SOTA">in our report</a>!</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Clients can be hesitant to try new things. But it&#8217;s your agency&#8217;s job to lead them to the right marketing solution for their business growth.</p>
<p>And in many cases, the right marketing solution is PPC.</p>
<p>Whether your agency has only recently started offering PPC services or you&#8217;re looking to expand your client base in this area, this article is for you–I’ll share some of our best strategies for selling Google Ads and winning new PPC business.</p>
<p>Use these tried-and-true methods to sell more of your clients on PPC.</p>
<h2>1. Follow up with EVERY lead</h2>
<p>Unless you have a dedicated sales team or you are a salesperson at heart and just love to prospect for leads, I’d imagine that just making first contact with a prospect is a big hurdle for most. If you do have a sales team or the time, I recommend a strong follow-up process for all <a href="/blog/ws/2015/08/25/inbound-marketing-strategy">inbound leads</a>.</p>
<p>If you don’t–it’s all about taking advantage of opportunities you might not realize are opportunities.</p>
<p>You may also need to nurture leads through the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/07/marketing-funnel">marketing funnel</a> before you can close a sale for your PPC services.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/sales-funnel-1.jpg" alt="sales funnel image" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75752" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/sales-funnel-1.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/sales-funnel-1-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>2. Go after low-hanging fruit</h2>
<p>This includes current clients who are not using Google Ads. If you already know their business model and budget you should have a strong sense of <a href="/blog/ws/2015/05/12/does-google-adwords-work">whether PPC will be a good fit for them</a>, what <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/ppc">PPC strategies</a> will apply, and what will be <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/05/best-ad-platform">the best ad platform for them</a>.</p>
<p>From there, you can put together a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/13/marketing-proposal">marketing proposal</a> that shows them how PPC will complement their existing strategy&#8211;and the types of results they can anticipate.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Get our latest <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteGoogleAdsBenchmarks2023.html?cid=Web_WS_incontent_guide_2023benchmarks_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incontent_links">search ads benchmarks</a> to see average results by industry!</p>
<h2>3. Talk the talk</h2>
<p>Fold PPC into ALL of your new business opportunities and marketing material. Don’t talk about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/26/marketing-channels">marketing channels</a> like organic search or <a href="/blog/ws/2015/12/07/amplify-email-marketing-with-ppc">email marketing</a> without considering how paid search marketing complements these channels.</p>
<h2>4. Create a referral program</h2>
<p>Client referrals are one of the main ways we found agencies <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/02/strategies-to-grow-your-digital-marketing-agency">get new clients</a>. To sell PPC to more clients, you can create a referral program that rewards your existing clients for referring your PPC services to new businesses. This can help you expand while showing your existing clients you value them and their business.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/state-of-the-agency-client-acquisition.png.webp" alt="state-of-the-agency-new-client-source" /></p>
<h2>5. Partner with complementary agencies or businesses</h2>
<p>If your agency specializes in PPC and/or a small range of digital marketing services, you can partner with an agency that provides complementary services. This could be a web design firm, a PR agency, etc. By partnering with a complementary agency, you&#8217;re able to market your PPC services to their clients (and they&#8217;re able to market their services to your clients), which helps you expand your client base and sell Google Ads to more clients overall.</p>

<h2>6. Understand the importance of the first outreach attempt</h2>
<p>The first attempt is your reps’ best shot to reach a prospect because <strong>connect rates drop 33% after the first attempt</strong>. Make sure your reps get the most from these calls by having their pitch prepared and the right time blocked off. Coach them to continue following up on accounts when they have contact information for the decision-maker, and to break off after 6+ touches on weaker accounts. When they have time (or when lead flow is low), they can always return to these weaker accounts where some potential exists.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Source:<a href="http://www.insightsquared.com/2015/07/should-you-keep-calling-that-prospect-a-new-study-gives-the-answer/"> Insightsquared</a></em></p>
<h2>7. Don&#8217;t lose the art of the follow-up</h2>
<p>Many reps assume that if they haven’t connected with a prospect by the fourth or fifth attempt, they never will. But our data told a different story: <strong>Even after 10 attempts, reps were able to connect </strong>with their prospects almost 5% of the time. Connect rate declines quickly at first, but levels off around the sixth dial–this means that there are a lot of conversations buried in seemingly unreachable prospects.</p>
<h2>8. Develop a plan that optimizes your reps’ time</h2>
<p>The number of times you should have your reps <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/18/how-to-follow-up-with-sales-leads">call each prospect</a> depends on your lead flow. If your reps are drowning in leads, it makes more sense for them to focus on making first attempts, where there is a significantly higher connect rate.</p>
<p>Conversely, when lead flow is dry, don’t hesitate to have them dig into some older leads that they haven’t connected with yet. It may take them 20 calls to reach a single prospect, but that’s one more conversation they’d have than if they’d given up.</p>
<p>When you do connect with your prospects, remember that the focus of your conversation isn’t paid search–it’s their business and how they can grow it. PPC is just a means to an end they care about.</p>

<h2>9. Know how to respond to common objections</h2>
<p>When <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/15/ppc-agency-pricing">selling PPC to your clients</a>, you know they&#8217;re going to have some questions&#8211;and probably some objections, as well. You and your reps will need to be prepared to respond to these in a way that makes your clients feel comfortable about their investment in PPC moving forward. Here are some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/30/ppc-client-business-questions">common PPC objections</a> and how to respond to them.</p>
<h4>“My SEO is good enough!”</h4>
<p>It’s crazy to depend entirely on organic search as a lead source. Organic results are unreliable and have shrinking real estate on the SERP, especially on mobile.</p>
<p>Further, we’ve found that the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-intent">most high-intent searchers</a> (people who are really ready to buy) are more likely to click paid results than organic results, even if they’ve found your site organically while they were in the research phase. Plus, tons of studies show that <strong>doing PPC adds incremental traffic on top of your SEO</strong>:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="3606317d-5e3b-411c-b5af-594c00b32aa4" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/agencies-sell-ppc-seo.png" alt="seo and ppc graph" width="608" height="450" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>So “I’m already doing SEO” is not a good argument against PPC.</p>
<h4>“It’s too expensive.”</h4>
<p>Putting aside the fact that SEO isn’t free (it requires both technical and creative resources), PPC is only “expensive” if you ignore what you’re getting back from it. There are tons of levers to pull in PPC to control spend so that you only pay for the clicks most likely to convert, which is the key to getting a strong return on your investment.</p>
<h4>“The clicks don’t convert!”</h4>
<p>If your prospect says PPC hasn’t converted for them in the past, one of a few things could be going on:</p>
<p><strong>1. They’re not tracking conversions properly.</strong> If it’s a business that gets a lot of calls, <a href="https://localiq.com/products/marketing-dashboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make sure they’re using call tracking</a> so that calls are properly attributed back to the ads that drove them.</p>
<p><strong>2. Their offer just isn’t compelling.</strong> If that’s the case no channel is going to deliver conversions.</p>
<p><strong>3. Landing page problems.</strong> Maybe ads link back to the home page, so leads get lost, or the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">landing page</a> isn’t focused. This can be solved with landing page optimization.</p>
<p><strong>4. They’re not remarketing.</strong> The first time isn’t always a charm! More often than not, you have to take your date out to dinner a few times before you sleep with them—and sales courtship isn’t too different! If a visitor doesn’t convert right off the bat, all hope is not lost. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/17/retargeting-campaign-tips">Remarketing</a> is a great CRO tool because it allows you to continue to engage with and nurture people who have already expressed interest in your website.</p>
<p>For example, last summer I tried Jeni’s gourmet ice cream for the first time at a friend’s house. It’s absolutely divine but, at $12 a pint, I had no intentions of stocking my freezer with it. However, I will admit, I checked up on their site pretty regularly to peruse the latest flavors. Next thing I know, I’m getting slammed with remarketing ads! I managed to stay strong after seeing a few, but caved pretty quickly.</p>
