<h2>What is content marketing?</h2>
<p>Content marketing is a strategic approach to creating and sharing valuable, relevant content that attracts and engages a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a>. Instead of pushing products directly, it builds trust and credibility by providing information, education, or entertainment that solves customer problems.</p>
<p>Content marketing is considered an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/05/inbound-marketing-examples">inbound marketing technique</a>. It’s designed to be an organic part of someone’s experience, like providing an answer to a question they’ve asked.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-dentist.webp" alt="Content marketing - post from a dentist" width="789" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94204 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-dentist.webp 789w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-dentist-480x365.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 789px, 100vw" /></p>

<p>Compare that with outbound advertising strategies like a cold call, which are often meant to interrupt an experience.</p>
<p>Using content marketing can drive leads directly and help support other marketing activities. Say you run a car dealership, and someone reads your blog post about the best automotive finance options. Then one of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-ads">Google Ads</a> shows up while they’re searching for cars. They’ll recognize and potentially trust your brand more, increasing the likelihood that they click on your ad.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong>Content marketing is a great tactic to drive visitors to your website.</strong> Get more in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/increase-traffic-to-your-website?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website</a>.</p>
<div id="benefits-of-content-marketing"></div>
<h2>Benefits of content marketing</h2>
<p>Brands that build a successful content marketing strategy regularly outperform their non-content-using competitors. Here’s why that happens.</p>
<h3>Increases brand awareness</h3>
<p>A healthy content marketing program places your brand in front of more people more often. That’s why <a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/content-marketing-strategy/content-marketing-statistics?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">87%</a> of marketers say content has helped them increase their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">brand awareness</a>.</p>
<p>Each <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post">blog article</a>, social media post, and email you share increases your online footprint. This effect is compounded by the network effect, especially in social media.</p>
<p>Here’s how that works. Say you publish a unique guide on solving shin splints for runners.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-cornerstone.webp" alt="Content marketing - shin splints blog post." width="937" height="598" class="aligncenter wp-image-94205 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-cornerstone.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-cornerstone-480x306.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://cornerstonephysio.com/resources/shin-splints-medial-tibial-stress-syndrome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>It’ll solidify you as an expert in your current audience&#8217;s eyes, and it’ll increase your presence as they share it in their networks. And as their connections start following you, the network compounds.</p>
<h3>Improves the quality and quantity of leads</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.demandsage.com/content-marketing-statistics">76%</a> of marketers say content marketing helps them<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-generation-ideas"> generate more leads</a>. It does this by engaging people across the whole buyer’s journey. For example, when someone is just beginning to think about a problem, a helpful blog post will attract them, while it may not be the right time for an overt<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/12/20/creative-advertising-ideas"> promotional ad</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70%</a> of marketers say content marketing delivers “high-quality” leads. That’s because you can design content that helps people self-qualify as a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-scoring">good-fit lead</a>. If your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/unique-selling-proposition">selling proposition</a> is premium service for discerning users, your content can filter out extreme value shoppers who won’t buy what you sell.</p>
<h3>Enhances your credibility</h3>
<p>A disheartening <a href="https://www.inc.com/dakota-shane/96-percent-of-consumers-dont-trust-ads-heres-how-to-sell-your-product-without-coming-off-sleazy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">96%</a> of people say they don’t trust ads. But <a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/content-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">64%</a> of buyers say they do trust brands that create educational content. Oh, and that trust jumps to 73% a week after consuming that content.</p>
<p>Have you ever had a mechanic explain something technical to you in terms you could understand, and then prove what they said with examples? If so, you probably trusted that professional a lot more after the interaction. And that’s what content marketing can do for your business, only on a much larger scale.</p>

<div id="content-marketing-challenges"></div>
<h2>Content marketing challenges in 2025</h2>
<p>Content is one of your best bets for long-term growth and lead generation. But it&#8217;s not all smooth sailing. Quickly evolving tech, shifts in search, and AI-powered competitors have churned up the waters.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for these content marketing challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Constant SERP shuffling:</strong> Google continues to roll out new core updates, and each one seems to change the rules for ranking on search engine results pages. Your best bet here is to watch how other websites in your niche fare and stay up to date on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-ranking-factors-2025">what factors still help you land on page one</a>.</li>
<li><strong>AI Overviews swiping traffic:</strong> Google&#8217;s AI Overviews are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-overviews-impact-on-seo">accelerating the trend of zero-click search</a> (58% of searches result in zero clicks). You can <a href="ttps://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-referral-traffic">claw back some of that lost referral traffic</a> by optimizing for both AI Overviews and AI search engines like Perplexity and Gemini.</li>
<li><strong>Increased AI-powered competition:</strong> Generative AI tools let brands scale content production at an incredible rate, and it&#8217;s getting more popular to do so (around <a href="https://sqmagazine.co.uk/ai-in-social-media-tools-statistics/">60%</a> of US businesses say they use generative AI to keep up their social media content schedule). Your goal here shouldn&#8217;t be an arms race to the quality bottom. Instead, look for ways to make fewer assets stand out more. These <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-differentiate-content">ideas from marketing pros</a> will help.</li>
</ul>
<div id="how-content-marketing-works"></div>
<h2>How content marketing works</h2>
<p>Content marketing works by engaging an audience with helpful and entertaining content to gain their awareness and build their trust.</p>
<p>There are several steps that commonly happen during the content marketing funnel:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attract: </strong>Get the attention of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a> in the places they spend time using content that helps and educates rather than disrupts.</li>
<li><strong>Engage: </strong>Connect with potential buyers on channels like <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/social-media-campaign-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media</a> to continue conversations and further build relationships.</li>
<li><strong>Nurture: </strong>Motivate prospects through a designated buying journey with more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/personalized-marketing">personalized content</a> assets like newsletters and email drip campaigns.</li>
<li><strong>Convert: </strong>Turn followers into customers with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/01/bottom-funnel-conversions">conversion-focused</a> content like product comparisons.</li>
</ul>
<div id="common-types-of-content-marketing"></div>
<h2>Common types of content marketing (with examples)</h2>
<p>Once you start looking for it, you’ll see dozens of types of content marketing. The content types we’ve listed here tend to do most of the heavy lifting for many brands.</p>
<h3>Long-form content</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, long-form content typically includes larger assets, often with higher word counts. Blog posts,<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-write-an-ebook"> ebooks</a>, and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/03/how-to-write-a-case-study"> case studies</a> all belong to this category.</p>
<p>This type of content lets you focus on one or a few related <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide">SEO keywords</a>. Or you can use it to explain a completely new idea in a thought leadership-style post.</p>
<p>Have a look at this blog post about retiring in your 50s. It&#8217;s 2000 words long and ranks for a group of keywords related to retiring early, making it well-targeted to a middle-aged, financially successful audience.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.citizensbank.com/learning/how-to-retire-by-50.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>Social media posts</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">Social media</a> is a versatile content marketing platform. You use it to promote long-form content, share insights directly, gather and use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/user-generated-content">user-generated content</a>, and so much more. And since it’s a two-way communication channel, you can also engage with your audience directly.</p>
<p>You also have a lot of flexibility in the types of content you post on social media. This physical therapist is building an audience with simple tutorials on staying healthy and active.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-pt.webp" alt="Content marketing - social post from a PT. " width="391" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94208 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-pt.webp 391w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-pt-196x300.webp 196w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Freel%2FDGTajXUpKVD%2F%3Figsh%3DMTI4Z2w2cm1yZGlhdQ%3D%3D&amp;data=05%7C02%7CRGlover%40gannett.com%7Caaedb3aee1bc47dfefc608ddf170e936%7Cbc924c8d3e164e88bf26d7fcfb14f2d5%7C0%7C0%7C638932189467072806%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=Dt33QsisRxnT%2BZZ7fhR1UJ1VtePnO1uU7othUiwl6%2Bw%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Notice again how he’s narrowed the target audience down to runners. That’s a great way to make sure you’re content is relevant to your ideal customer.</p>
<h3>Email</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/03/email-marketing-best-practices">Email content marketing</a> can take a few forms. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/25/email-newsletter-ideas">Newsletters</a> are incredibly popular. So are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-nurturing-emails">email nurture campaigns</a> that keep people interested who aren’t ready to buy right away.</p>
<p>Here’s a monthly newsletter from a local <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/handyman-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handyman service</a>. It’s simple, timely, and has links to other resources and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/21/promotional-email-examples">promotions</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-handyman.webp" alt="Content marketing - Handyman newsletter." width="370" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94209 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-handyman.webp 370w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-handyman-185x300.webp 185w" sizes="(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px" /></p>
<p>The winning ingredient here is consistency. A monthly newsletter, sent at the same time each month, becomes very noticeable in an inbox.</p>
<h3>Podcasts</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-marketing-podcasts">Podcasts</a> have been around for a while, but they’ve really made a splash for content marketers in the last couple of years.</p>
<p>The great thing about this type of content marketing is that you can approach it in several ways. You can create your own podcast, be a guest on someone else&#8217;s, or sponsor a show that’s in your niche.</p>
<p>Outdoor retailer REI produces a regular podcast featuring stories from people doing cool stuff in the wild.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-rei.webp" alt="Content marketing - REI podcast" width="937" height="576" class="aligncenter wp-image-94210 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-rei.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-rei-480x295.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.rei.com/blog/podcasts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>If this sounds good to you, try searching for podcasts produced in your town. They could be a good place to get featured.</p>

<h2>How to build a content marketing strategy</h2>
<p>Like every marketing project, you’ll get much farther with content marketing if you have a roadmap. It needs to include a starting point, a destination, and plans on how you’ll achieve your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/15/marketing-objectives">marketing goals</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve created a comprehensive guide to help you<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/13/content-marketing-strategy"> develop a complete content marketing strategy</a>. But for now, here is the scaffolding of a successful<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-plan"> content marketing plan</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set goals:</strong> Start by deciding if it’s traffic, conversions, awareness, or some other marketing metric you’re after. Set a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/smart-goals-examples">SMART goal</a> that’s specific and time-bound (e.g., acquire 100 newsletter subscribers within 90 days).</li>
<li><strong>Define your audience:</strong> Settle on as specific a target audience as possible. Consider demographics, interests, behavior, and favorite platforms for learning.</li>
<li><strong>Conduct keyword and topic research:</strong> Use<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/local-keyword-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> keyword research</a> to identify terms your SEO content will target, and consider common customer questions to round out your topic list.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build a calendar:</strong> Lay out the topics and types of content you’ll produce over the next weeks or months. Focus on quality, then consistency, then quantity.</li>
<li><strong>Create content:</strong> Start producing blog posts, videos, and newsletters specific to the channel you’ve chosen. Make it relevant to your target audience.</li>
<li><strong>Measure and optimize:</strong> Track <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/17/content-marketing-kpis">marketing KPIs</a> like views, engagement, click-through rate, and so on. Identify which content types and platforms have the most impact and focus on them.</li>
</ul>
<div id="content-marketing-tips"></div>
<h2>14 content marketing tips</h2>
<p>Now that we have a solid foundation, let’s work on making sure your content marketing strategy delivers the best return possible.</p>
<h3>1. Think distribution first</h3>
<p>It doesn’t matter how amazing your content is; it won’t help your business grow if no one sees it. That’s why you have to ask “what’s the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-distribution">distribution plan</a>?” for every bit of copy or video you create.</p>
<p>For SEO blog posts, the answer is straightforward. The core distribution plan is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/06/on-page-seo">optimize the post</a> so people find it on search engines.</p>
<p>For a thought leadership post or a new data study that no one is specifically searching for, you’ll need a more active distribution plan. That may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Posting it on social media</li>
<li>Asking <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/26/influencer-marketing">influencers</a> to share it with their audiences</li>
<li>Getting it picked up by a relevant news outlet</li>
<li>Sending it to your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/05/increase-email-signups">email subscribers</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-accountant.webp" alt="Content marketing - social post promoting a blog post." width="791" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94211 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-accountant.webp 791w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-accountant-480x364.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 791px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Social media is a natural fit for distributing blog posts like </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DOVJahpjPnW/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>this one</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<h3>2. Target accessible keywords</h3>
<p>When you’re choosing which keywords to target with content, you’ll need to look at both their search volume and keyword difficulty.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/wordstream-free-keyword-tool-results-cars.webp" alt="wordstream free keyword tool results for cars search" width="900" height="653" class="aligncenter wp-image-92356 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/wordstream-free-keyword-tool-results-cars.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/wordstream-free-keyword-tool-results-cars-480x348.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Search volume refers to the number of times people search for a term within a given month. The higher that number, the more people will see your content if you rank.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/articles/ultimate-guide-to-keyword-competition">Keyword difficulty</a> is an estimate of how hard it’ll be to get your content on the front page of search results. That’s important because even if people search for a term 10,000 times a month, no one will see your content if it isn’t ranking.</p>
<p>If your site is new or has a low domain rating (you can find that on tools like Ahrefs or Moz), then aim for keywords with a lower keyword difficulty and at least some traffic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-ahrefs.webp" alt="Content marketing - Ahrefs." width="937" height="519" class="aligncenter wp-image-94212 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-ahrefs.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-ahrefs-480x266.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Nike has a pretty good domain rating.</em></p>
<h3>3. Produce for the platform</h3>
<p>A long-form article is great for your blog, but it won’t work on most social channels. And of course, text doesn’t play on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/14/tiktok-trend-discovery">TikTok</a>.</p>
<p>Know what works on each channel you plan to publish on and create content specific to each.</p>
<h3>4. Make it mobile-friendly</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mobiloud.com/blog/what-percentage-of-internet-traffic-is-mobile?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Well over half</a> of all internet traffic comes from mobile devices. So the content you publish needs to be easily viewable on small screens.</p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, this means utilizing a responsive web design that optimizes itself according to the device.</p>
<p>But for content creators, it means things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing shorter paragraphs so people don’t see a screen full of text.</li>
<li>Breaking up content with bullet points, images, and subheads so it’s more skimmable.</li>
<li>Including graphics that make information easier to understand without a lot of copy.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-ortho.webp" alt="Content marketing - Orthocarolina blog post." width="325" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94213 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-ortho.webp 325w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-ortho-163x300.webp 163w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Short paragraphs, images, and internal links help break up walls of text on small screens.</em></p>
<h3>5. Research your content competitors</h3>
<p>Content competitors are the websites and organizations that publish content on the same topics as you. They may also be business competitors, but not always.</p>
<p>Researching your content competitors will yield a ton of valuable insights for your own content strategy. To start, read through their blogs and social feeds. Note what types of content they publish, how often, their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">brand voice</a>, and so on.</p>
<p>Then, review these guides to learn many more ways to learn from your competitors online:</p>

<h3>6. Look for topics in forums</h3>
<p>Online forums like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reddit-marketing">Reddit</a> are gold mines of audience research. Find the subreddits your target audience hangs out in. Review them regularly to see what challenges perplex them, what questions they ask, and what insider terms they use.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-AMA.webp" alt="Content marketing - AMA on Reddit." width="937" height="490" class="aligncenter wp-image-94214 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-AMA.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-AMA-480x251.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/1dz4u6w/ama_im_the_ceo_of_peg_city_car_coop_ask_me/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Ask-me-anything</em></a><em> (AMA) events are a great way to drum up questions and content ideas on Reddit.</em></p>
<h3>7. Use lead magnets</h3>
<p>Ideally, you want to turn content viewers into leads. One proven way to do that is by using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/15/lead-magnet-ideas">lead magnets</a>.</p>
<p>A lead magnet is a free piece of valuable content or offer (like an ebook or template) that a business gives away in exchange for a person’s contact information, usually an email address, to generate leads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-quiz.webp" alt="Content marketing - Quiz example." width="937" height="509" class="aligncenter wp-image-94215 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-quiz.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-quiz-480x261.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Try adding lead magnets to a pop-up that triggers when someone scrolls partway down a blog post. Tie the offer into the topic if possible (like offering a yard maintenance calendar on a blog post about growing grass).</p>
<h3>8. Repurpose content for more reach</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/13/content-creation">Creating content</a> takes time. You can multiply the return on a piece of content by<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-repurposing"> repurposing it</a> for use on several channels.</p>
<p>There are few limitations to how you do this. A single interview with an industry expert can become clips you share on social media, a long-form blog post, quotes for your next annual report, and fodder for getting featured in industry publications.</p>
<h3>9. Mention your products thoughtfully</h3>
<p>Nothing will lose trust faster than being overtly salesy when someone expects an unbiased answer to their question. But that doesn’t mean you can’t ever mention what you sell. You just have to be strategic in how you do it.</p>
<p>For example, it’s perfectly acceptable to include your product in a roundup of the best options in your category. It’s also fine to share a screenshot of what you sell if it fits in the narrative of your post. Just don’t promise a list of tips and make them all about your product.</p>
<h3>10. Make the most of your content evergreen</h3>
<p>In content marketing, evergreen content is material that remains valuable and relevant over time. It continues to attract traffic, engagement, and leads long after it’s published.</p>
<p>An example of an evergreen content post would be a guide to fixing a leaky faucet or creating a personal budgeting spreadsheet.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-budget.webp" alt="Content marketing - blog post about budgeting." width="937" height="588" class="aligncenter wp-image-94217 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-budget.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-budget-480x301.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.vermontfederal.org/blog/7-steps-for-creating-a-healthy-personal-budget" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>By contrast, time-sensitive content would be a news article about a one-time event in your industry or a list of timely trends.</p>
<p>Both are useful in a content strategy, but evergreen content delivers the best return over its lifetime.</p>
<h3>11. Use AI wisely</h3>
<p>AI has advanced at a rapid rate, and it’s now capable of spinning up entire blog posts and even videos in a matter of seconds. That challenge with letting it do so is that it can also do it for every one of your competitors just as easily. Which means your AI content will look an awful lot like theirs.</p>
<p>To get the efficiency benefits of AI without churning out copycat content, think of it like an assistant and a creative sparring partner instead of a writer or videographer.</p>
<p>Here are several ways you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-in-marketing">use AI</a> to create better content faster:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Summarize:</strong> Ask AI to provide key insights from a long video transcript or call recording.</li>
<li><strong>Suggest:</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-prompts">Prompt your AI</a> to suggest alternative titles, captions, or a starter outline you can riff off of.</li>
<li><strong>Scrutinize: </strong>Feed a piece of content to your AI tool and have it review for missing subtopics, logic gaps, or spelling errors.</li>
<li><strong>Survey:</strong> Give AI a large dataset and ask it to identify common themes or insights that can be turned into blog post topics.</li>
</ul>
<h3>12. Start optimizing for AI search engines</h3>
<ol start="12"></ol>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/ai-search-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI is taking over search</a> in a big way. People are using platforms like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/21/chatgpt-impact-on-marketing">ChatGPT</a>, Perplexity, and Gemini to find answers. And Google’s own <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-overviews-statistics">AI Overviews</a> are showing up on more results pages.</p>
<p>On one hand, that means less traffic being referred to your website from traditional search engine results. On the other hand, there’s a growing opportunity to generate <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-referral-traffic">referral traffic directly from these AI platforms</a>.</p>
<p>Much of what you do for SEO will help you get cited by AI. So go all in optimizing for Google’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/14/google-e-e-a-t">E-E-A-T signals</a>, target conversational queries, and try to earn more brand mentions on other websites.</p>
<p>On top of that, look at how each platform responds to your target keywords. Check how they autofill suggestions and take note of what related questions they suggest.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-related.webp" alt="Content marketing - Perplexity reply." width="937" height="422" class="aligncenter wp-image-94218 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-related.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/content-marketing-wordstream-related-480x216.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Perplexity’s related questions</em></p>
<h3>13. Update old content</h3>
<p>Over time, some of the assets you create will fall out of date, lose search rankings, and stop pulling in new visitors. They aren’t dead; they’re actually a shortcut to boosting traffic.</p>
<p>Run a search on GA4 or your favorite SEO tool to find content that’s no longer performing. If it’s an evergreen post, look for ways to bring it back to life. Update links, include new data, and ID any informational gaps it’s not currently addressing.</p>
<h3>14. Use lots of original quotes and data</h3>
<p>Original insights and data are a magic pill of success in content marketing. They get cited by AI, help add authority for SEO, and help generate lots of media buzz and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/10/link-building-secrets">backlinks</a>.</p>
<p>You don’t need to commission a huge survey of your industry to generate new data (but do so if you can!). Try these options instead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interview internal and external experts for original insights and quotes.</li>
<li>Post a quick poll on social media.</li>
<li>Anonymize data about your customer base and share it.</li>
<li>Run experiments that test ideas from industry experts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Content marketing FAQs</h2>
<p>Got more questions about content marketing? We&#8217;ve got answers!</p>
<h3>Is it really worth doing content marketing in 2025?</h3>
<p>Yes, content marketing is still one of the most effective ways to grow a business in 2025. Trust is only becoming more important in the buying decision, and content helps you build it. Plus, content marketing is a great way to get found on more AI search results, so it’ll remain relevant in the future.</p>
<h3>What are the key content marketing characteristics?</h3>
<p>The four characteristics of content marketing are audience-focused, value-first, long-term, and relationship-driven. Together, these traits explain why it remains so effective in 2025. Content that solves real problems, builds trust over time, and strengthens customer relationships will consistently deliver valuable returns.</p>
<h3>What are the three C’s of content marketing?</h3>
<p>The three C’s of content marketing are creation, curation, and conversation. You create original content that showcases your expertise, curate relevant resources that add extra value for your audience, and spark conversations that build trust and lasting relationships.</p>
<h3>What is the main goal of content marketing?</h3>
<p>The main goal of content marketing is to attract, engage, and convert an audience by providing valuable, relevant information that builds trust and drives profitable customer action over time.</p>
<h3>How is content marketing different from traditional advertising?</h3>
<p>Content marketing differs from traditional advertising because it focuses on delivering helpful, relevant information that audiences seek out, while traditional advertising usually interrupts people with promotional messages. Instead of pushing products directly, content marketing builds long-term trust and relationships, making it less about quick sales and more about sustained customer loyalty.</p>
<h3>How do I start content marketing?</h3>
<p>You can start content marketing by first defining your target audience and goals, then building a strategy around the types of content that will serve them best (such as blogs, videos, emails, etc.). From there, research keywords, create a content calendar, and publish consistently, while promoting your work through the right channels and measuring results to refine your approach.</p>
<h2>Grow with content marketing</h2>
<p>There are dozens of types of content marketing and many ways to leverage each one. It’s easy to get bogged down with the options.</p>
<p>Our best advice is to start small by simply sharing your knowledge on the platforms with which you&#8217;re most comfortable. If you’re a divorce lawyer who loves TikTok, post a few videos explaining the biggest challenges of navigating a legal separation.</p>
<p>You can turn them into blog posts or Instagram Reels later. But for now, just get your brilliance out into the world and watch more people turn to you for answers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Content marketing encompasses a wide range of tactics. Your website and blog are content marketing. So is your social media presence. Your YouTube videos are content marketing, too.</p>
<p>And while all of that great content helps bolster your digital marketing strategy, there is one tactic that delivers outsized results but is sometimes overlooked: interactive content.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll explain what interactive content is, share a list of common types, and fuel your inspiration with plenty of examples.</p>

<h2>What is interactive content?</h2>
<p>Interactive content is anything that invites direct engagement from readers or viewers. It’s not about passively reading or watching. Instead, interactive content invites your audience to, well, interact!</p>
<p>Some brands shy away from interactive content because it can take more time to create. Unlike a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/27/blog-post-ideas">blog post</a>, which is pretty straightforward and can often be drafted and posted by your internal team, interactive content might require more support. For example, a custom quiz may need the assistance of a writer, designer, and web developer.</p>
<p>However, as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/06/content-marketing-tools">online tools</a> grow more sophisticated, there are drag-and-drop options that empower your team to create simple but effective interactive content.</p>

<div id="why-use-interactive-content"></div>
<h2>Benefits of interactive content</h2>
<p>We’re all looking to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-differentiate-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make our content stand out</a>, especially when AI makes it easy to create a dozen blog posts with a few prompts. Interactive content fits the bill perfectly. In fact, using interactive content can help:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increase engagement:</strong> By nature, content like quizzes and polls encourages active participation, making it more engaging than other types of content.</li>
<li><strong>Generate attention and leads: </strong>Interactive content generates up to <a href="https://outgrow.co/blog/statistics-interactive-content">five times</a> more views than its static counterparts and enjoys double the conversion rate.</li>
<li><strong>Boost virality: </strong>People love to brag about high scores and tell their friends what kind of sandwich bread they are, so interactive content motivates a lot of social sharing.</li>
<li><strong>Lift brand retention:</strong> Immersive experiences stick with us, and when someone benefits from your interactive content, they’re more likely to remember your brand longer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interactive content is also a great source of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/customer-data">customer data</a>. A simple poll asking what color you should include in your next product launch is extremely valuable consumer data.</p>

<h2>12 types of interactive content to try</h2>
<p>You understand the potential of interactive content, but perhaps you’re not sure where to start. You’ve come to the right place. Read on for a list of interactive content types to try, plus see real-world examples of different tactics in action.</p>
<h3>1. Quizzes</h3>
<p>If you were online in the aughts and 2010s, you likely remember the grip that BuzzFeed quizzes had on the culture.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/27/marketing-quiz">Online quizzes</a> are intriguing because they put the quiz taker at the center of the experience. A BuzzFeed-style quiz invites a user to discover something unique about themselves. Who doesn’t want to learn which Golden Girls character they are? This style of quiz encourages sharing—once you discover you’re a Dorothy, you want to tell your friends and see who’s the Blanche in your group!</p>
<p>Alternatively, online quizzes that test your knowledge are engaging because they allow the taker to aim for a high score and feel smart. These trivia-based quizzes often share how you stack up against others.</p>
<p>Finally, quizzes can serve as a sales tool. For example, DTC makeup brand Il Makiage uses its POWERMATCH quiz to help buyers find the right foundation shade—something that might otherwise be a hurdle for an online-only business.</p>
<p>The quiz makes it easy for prospects to identify their ideal shade and make a purchase they’ll be pleased with.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-makup.webp" alt="Interactive content - Quiz from Maikage." width="937" height="341" class="aligncenter wp-image-92130 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-makup.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-makup-480x175.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.ilmakiage.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a5.png" alt="💥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Let’s keep the leads flowing! </strong>Download <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/free-leads?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_howtogetfreeleads_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links">14 Fast &amp; Easy Ways to Get Free Leads (+Examples You Can Copy)</a></p>
<div id="games"></div>
<h3>2. Games</h3>
<p>Like quizzes, games can be similarly attractive and addictive. As an example, The New York Times boasts over <a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/new-york-times-games-advertising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 million</a> daily players of its word and logic games.</p>
<p>If games can create that kind of draw for a newspaper, they can do the same for you. And while games certainly require more development than, say, a simple survey or quiz, the investment can be worthwhile.</p>
<div id="calculators"></div>
<h3>3. Calculators</h3>
<p>Online calculators can be an incredible educational tool for your audience. This particular type of interactive content is great for brands that sell expensive or complex offerings. Customers might need additional education about the financial implications of making a purchase decision.</p>
<p>A classic example is a bank offering a mortgage calculator. Deciding to buy a home is one of the biggest financial decisions a person will make in their lifetime, so a calculator that helps them visualize the full cost implications of that decision can go a long way toward assuaging concerns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-calculator.webp" alt="Interactive content - Home cost calculator." width="630" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92131 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-calculator.webp 630w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-calculator-480x457.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 630px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.suffolkcu.org/learn/financial-literacy/financial-calculators/mortgage-calculators/mortgage-calculator" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Suffolk Credit Union</em></a><em> uses its mortgage calculator to help prospective homebuyers understand monthly costs.</em></p>
<p>Calculators can also work for B2B brands that sell a high-cost business solution. Typically, numerous decision-makers weigh in on a B2B buying decision, and the leaders will often want to know the costs and benefits of making a big purchase.</p>
<p>If you can create a calculator that accurately represents the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/12/20/content-marketing-roi">ROI</a> of purchasing your solution, you give B2B buyers greater assurance that your offering is worth the cost.</p>
<div id="polls"></div>
<h3>4. Polls</h3>
<p>Comments sections, thumbs up, ratings—people love sharing their opinions online. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/04/instagram-story-ads-polls">Creating a poll</a> is a form of interactive content that gives your audience another chance to make their voice heard.</p>
<p>Polls can be used just for fun to drive engagement, or they can help you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/10/best-online-survey-tools">gather customer insights</a> and guide real business decisions.</p>
<p>For example, a DTC mattress brand might post an informal poll in its social media stories asking followers to share whether they’re a side sleeper, back sleeper, or stomach sleeper. The subsequent stories could then show the best mattress for each sleep position.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a business might use a poll to crowdsource information about a new product launch. As an example, a local restaurant looking to add entertainment to its evening schedule might ask its audience whether they’d prefer a trivia night, comedy show, or live music.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Every piece of interactive content needs a great call to action! </strong>Get ideas to create your own in <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download">The 42 Best Call to Action Phrases Ever (&amp; Why They Work)</a>.</p>
<div id="surveys"></div>
<h3>5. Surveys</h3>
<p>Surveys are another way for businesses to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/12/first-party-data">gather vital information</a> from their audience. Surveys tend to be used for an explicit business purpose, like gathering feedback on a recent buying experience.</p>
<p>But a well-designed survey can encourage readers to complete it, even if it’s ultimately for your benefit. Fortunately, there are plenty of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/10/best-online-survey-tools">free online survey tools</a> that can help any business launch an engaging survey.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-media.webp" alt="Interactive content - Media survey." width="305" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92132 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-media.webp 305w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-media-153x300.webp 153w" sizes="(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/thejournal-survey-a5abec57" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Journal</em></a><em> podcast wanted to collect feedback on a potential upcoming live event, and it created a survey to ask its audience what they’d like to see there.</em></p>
<p>Surveys are a great way to open the door to deeper conversations with your audience. At the end of a survey, you can invite the respondents to share contact information and indicate that they’d be open to more discussion. Even if you don’t connect directly, showing that you care about their thoughts makes your audience feel more seen and heard.</p>
<div id="assessments"></div>
<h3>6. Assessments</h3>
<p>Assessments fall somewhere between quizzes and surveys in the world of interactive content. While a quiz tends to be more lighthearted, an assessment is a tool with a bit more weight.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-quiz.webp" alt="Interactive content - online assessment." width="826" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92133 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-quiz.webp 826w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-quiz-480x349.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 826px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://view.flodesk.com/pages/5fc7b185f10e2d0d8e955631" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Therapist and author Nedra Glover Tawwab</em></a><em> has several assessments available on her website. </em></p>
<p>Service businesses might use assessments to help prospective customers determine if they have an issue the business can solve. For example, a physical therapy office might create an assessment for athletes who are trying to decide if their injury requires professional help to heal. Or, a tutoring business might offer an assessment to help parents evaluate whether or not their children could benefit from some academic support outside the classroom.</p>
<div id="image-sliders"></div>
<h3>7. Image sliders</h3>
<p>Before-and-after images have long been a powerful marketing tool for showcasing certain products and services. If you’ve ever watched an infomercial, you’ve probably seen this technique used to demonstrate the power of the product being sold.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-slider.webp" alt="Interactive content - Image slider of a bathroom remod." width="599" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92134 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-slider.webp 599w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-slider-480x481.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 599px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.will-myers.com/products/p/before-/-after-image-slider" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>This example</em></a><em> from a home renovation shows how the contractor transformed a dark and outdated bathroom on the right into a bright, modern, functional space.</em></p>
<p>Online, you can create interactive image sliders that align before-and-after photos, allowing viewers to slide between the two. As they do, they’ll see the impact of the business’s product or service.</p>
<p>This interactive content tactic can be applied in a variety of industries, from dental practices showcasing the results of a teeth whitening session to landscapers demonstrating the transformation of a scruffy backyard into a perfectly pruned oasis.</p>
<div id="maps"></div>
<h3>8. Maps</h3>
<p>When you think of digital maps, you likely envision the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/02/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps">Google Maps</a> interface. But businesses can create interactive maps as part of their content marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Of course, these maps can be used to show your business’s physical footprint if yours is a multi-location operation. But interactive maps can serve other purposes, too.</p>
<p>For example, a travel brand that hosts safaris in Tanzania might create an interactive map that shows where in the national parks you might expect to see different types of wildlife. Or, a retail brand might create a map of its store, allowing customers to virtually browse and navigate the space.</p>
<div id="multimedia-long-form-content"></div>
<h3>9. Multimedia long-form content</h3>
<p>Long gone are the days when a static PDF is your only option for presenting an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-write-an-ebook">ebook</a>, whitepaper, or other type of long-form content to your readers.</p>
<p>Today, it’s possible to create interactive, multi-page documents with embedded videos, moving text, clickable images, and headers that open a pop-up with additional information, among other features.</p>
<p>By making your long-form content more dynamic, you encourage more active reading and less skimming. Slowing your readers down and engaging them throughout the paper helps showcase the full value of your long-form content.</p>
<div id="interactive-video"></div>
<h3>10. Interactive video</h3>
<p>Video is already a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/09/15/video-content-marketing">hugely impactful channel</a>—HubSpot named short-form video the top content format, delivering <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high ROI</a> in 2025.</p>
<p>By adding interactive elements to an already high-engagement channel, you can potentially strengthen its effectiveness. Interactive videos allow viewers to click on elements, see more details, and delve further into the topic.</p>
<p>As an example, a car dealership could create an interactive video showing off the latest model to hit its lot. For each new feature shown in the video, the dealership could add clickable pop-up text that gives even more information on the benefits and specs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-zoo-1024x585.webp" alt="Interactive content - Video from the Edinburgh Zoo." width="1024" height="585" class="aligncenter wp-image-92135 size-large" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-zoo-1024x585.webp 1024w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-zoo-980x559.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-zoo-480x274.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://vimeo.com/blog/post/3-creators-using-vimeo-interactive-to-make-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>This interactive video</em></a><em> from the Edinburgh Zoo invites viewers to choose their own adventure (would you like to see the sun bears or penguins first?) and to click to learn more about each animal along the way. </em></p>
<div id="interactive-social-content"></div>
<h3>11. Interactive social content</h3>
<p>Social media platforms know the power of interactive content, and that’s why many have incorporated interactive features for users to harness.</p>
<p>On Instagram and TikTok, you can add poll or quiz stickers to your Stories or videos. On LinkedIn, you can create and run a poll.</p>
<p>Including interactive content regularly on your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/social-media-calendar-template">social media content calendar</a> keeps your audience engaged. It reinforces that your business’s social media page is a place for dialogue with you, and positions you as an approachable, friendly brand.</p>
<div id="augmented-reality"></div>
<h3>12. Augmented reality</h3>
<p>Augmented reality (AR) won’t be right for every business, but there are certain industries where the technology is a natural fit.</p>
<p>Essentially, AR inserts a computer-generated image into a real physical space. On mobile devices, users can point their camera at the environment they’re in, and AR can add a digital image to the real world shown on the screen.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-AR.png.webp" alt="Interactive content - AR of a room showing a chair." width="937" height="527" class="alignnone wp-image-92136 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-AR.png.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-AR.png-480x270.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.ikea.com/global/en/newsroom/innovation/ikea-launches-ikea-place-a-new-app-that-allows-people-to-virtually-place-furniture-in-their-home-170912/?assetId=0-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Many furniture companies use AR tools to allow consumers to virtually try pieces in their homes before buying. In the example above from the IKEA app, you can see how users hold their camera phones up to the area where they want to see the furniture and then virtually place the couch, chair, or rug in their existing space.</p>
<p>Augmented reality is great for retailers who want to give their customers an opportunity to virtually try their products before they buy.</p>
<h2>Using interactive content to build deeper connections with your audience</h2>
<p>Interactive content, by its very nature, encourages your audience to engage more meaningfully with your brand. It creates space for two-way conversation in a way that static content simply can’t. And opening the door to dialogue helps establish your brand as a place your audience can go for advice and answers.</p>
<p>Even businesses with a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/stretch-your-marketing-budget">limited marketing budget</a> can take advantage of existing tools to start releasing interactive content. From social media polls to free survey tools, there are simple, low-cost ways to begin leveraging the power of interactive content today.</p>

<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-differentiate-content">9 Ways to Truly Differentiate Your Content in an AI World</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Content marketing is nothing like it used to be. Suddenly, everyone has access to tools that can spin up dozens of publishable blog posts with a few well-crafted AI prompts. When anyone can scale, you can’t win the battle for clicks and conversions just by speeding up. <strong>You need to stand out.</strong></p>
<p>With AI content flooding our feeds every day, I wanted to know how marketing pros are out-competing the tsunami of sameness. So, I asked a cohort of experienced marketers, including some of the best content folks I know, for their most effective content-differentiating tactics.</p>
<p>These pros had some super smart ways to do that—from creating unexpected content types to digging deep for human-inspired insights no LLM has access to. And since most of these pros are on small—or even one-person—teams, every idea is doable for just about every CM.</p>

<h2>9 ways to differentiate your content</h2>
<p>It was interesting that no one was explicitly against the use of AI. In fact, some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/ai-for-hyper-personalized-campaigns">use AI to support their tactics</a>. But you’ll see that <strong>every marketer I talked to focused on adding something AI can’t do</strong>—which makes their content more valuable and relevant to the humans they’re hoping to connect with.</p>
<div id="build-a-story-around-original-data"></div>
<h3>1. Build a story around original data</h3>
<p>Most marketers have access to the same <a href="https://localiq.com/google-ads-ai-copy-tool/?cid=Web_LiQ_InContent_AICopyTool_AICT&amp;itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links">AI tools</a> that can sift through the same digital archives to unearth existing information. Throw a prompt into Gemini, Perplexity, or others, and you’ll get a dozen recent stats on your topic.</p>
<p>What AI isn’t so great at is generating new data no one else has yet. That’s the gap <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashleyrcummings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ashley Cummings</a>—a prolific <a href="https://www.contentconnect.site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freelance SaaS writer and editor</a>—said you can exploit to rise above the AI-generated noise.</p>
<p>“One of the best ways to differentiate right now is with original research,” she said. “Take the time to create a solid study, distribute it to the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">right audience</a>, and capture insights.”</p>
<p>Ashley told me she writes reports for her clients based on their research, but she also doubles down on this tactic by incorporating it into the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/13/content-marketing-strategy">content strategy</a> for her own brand.</p>
<p>“For example, I created a 34-page benchmark report for freelance writers and also co-created a report on <a href="https://www.contentconnect.site/blog/state-of-ai-in-content-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how marketers are using AI</a>,” she shared.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-survey.webp" alt="How to differentiate content - survey screenshot." width="936" height="523" class="aligncenter wp-image-91810 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-survey.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-survey-480x268.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.contentconnect.site/blog/state-of-ai-in-content-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>The report is based on a survey of over 220 content marketers. It tackles topics like how this cohort <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-in-marketing">uses AI</a> in their work and how worried they were that AI could become a competitor.</p>
<p>The data in the report is unique, and it tells a story her followers want to hear. “There&#8217;s a lot of generic content out there, and no one needs more of that,” Ashley said. “We need more creative storytelling around hard data that actually brings new insights.”</p>
<p>The best part of Ashley’s strategy is that you can scale it to your resources. A simple poll on LinkedIn generates new, usable data. So does an anonymous questionnaire sent to your customers. If time and budget permit, consider commissioning a large-scale survey about your industry. The data you generate is now yours, and any references to it will lead people back to your platforms.</p>

<h3>2. Create non-traditional content types</h3>
<p>With so many brands scaling standard <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-content-beginners-guide">SEO posts</a> with AI, it’s nigh on impossible to compete in that space. For <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/edoty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eric Doty</a>, content lead at <a href="https://www.dock.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dock</a>, the answer is simple: don’t do it.</p>
<p>“I’m trying to do fewer educational, informational things and do more like building things that are more difficult to replace by AI,” he said.</p>
<p>Eric pointed to a growing collection of templates they’ve built as an example. “Templates don’t feel like content, but we’re building things in our product that people can actually use.”</p>
<p>The templates cover many of the most common jobs Dock’s ICP will face, like creating business cases and onboarding customers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-dock-templates-1.webp" alt="How to differentiate content - Dock template page." width="936" height="520" class="aligncenter wp-image-91820 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-dock-templates-1.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-dock-templates-1-480x267.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.dock.us/templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>These templates are extremely helpful to Dock’s customers. They’re also built using Dock’s product, so they act like mini-use-case studies.</p>
<p>Here’s the best part, though. These assets are a fantastic <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO</a> play. The query “customer onboarding template” gets a few hundred searches each month—presumably from Dock’s ICP.</p>
<p>Eric used the software he sells to create these templates, but you can swipe this strategy for just about any product. Just think about the tasks your customers have to do repeatedly. Or consider the complex jobs they could use some help with. For example, we’ve created <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/05/blog-post-templates">blog post templates</a>, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/30/business-email-templates">email templates</a>, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/08/03/ppc-ad-templates">PPC ad templates</a>, and many others.</p>
<p>The sky’s the limit on the types of content you create. Try bingo cards, calendars, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/interactive-content">interactive quizzes</a>, timelines, and so on.</p>
<p>Once you have your new and original content, Eric suggests using it in more traditional assets. “We’ve differentiated by having mixed media in a blog post, so it’s not just words, it’s templates, there’s videos, there’s product demos.”</p>
<div id="use-your-voice-as-a-differentiator"></div>
<h3>3. Use your voice as a differentiator</h3>
<p>Sometimes, it’s not just what you say but how you say it that gets noticed. That’s especially true when everyone is working from the same knowledge base. The critical factor, says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennastjohn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jenna St John</a>, the head of content at <a href="https://www.grizzle.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grizzle</a>, is to make sure whatever you share has your spin on it.</p>
<p>“Gen AI can get you ‘good enough’ content, but it’s going to get ignored by humans and then by search engines,” she said. “A distinctive voice and a strong point of view have already demonstrated, across many forms of content, how it can cut through the noise. For better or worse, loud gets heard.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/marketing-newsletters">marketing newsletter</a> By Popular Demand is a great example of content that leans hard on its voice to stand out in crowded inboxes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-by-popular-demand-1.webp" alt="How to differentiate content - By Populare Demand email." width="600" height="554" class="aligncenter wp-image-91829 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-by-popular-demand-1.webp 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-by-popular-demand-1-480x443.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://briannefleming.com/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Here are two easy ways to ensure your content is created with your distinctive voice. First, keep a note-taking app handy. Every time you find yourself building an argument in your head about something in your industry, jot it down or record it. Those are the spicy takes that knock people out of their scrolling stupors.</p>
<p>Second, take the topic you’re writing about and explain it to a friend. If you find yourself using different words out loud than you typed, go back and put some more “you” in that post.</p>
<p>“Give your content personality to humanize it and become a reliable, trusted source for readers,” Jenna added. “If your content feels like anyone could write it, then you’re invisible.”</p>
<div id="write-for-your-specific-audience"></div>
<h3>4. Write for your specific audience</h3>
<p>Your audience has cultural norms, shared experiences, and a vocabulary that LLMs, or any generically written content, won’t account for. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrinabalmaceda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katrina Balmaceda</a>, director of business development at <a href="https://withcontent.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">With Content</a>, says there’s opportunity in those unique quirks.</p>
<p>“Most of With Content&#8217;s clients are B2B businesses in Southeast Asia. Over the past eight years, we&#8217;ve noticed how a lot of <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/content-marketing-for-small-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content marketing best practices</a> run up against cultural and traditional norms here,” she explained. “We used to try to convince marketers in our region to adopt these best practices we learn from Western marketers, but we&#8217;ve since realized we should be adapting the advice to reality instead.”</p>
<p>Katrina said they localize their content to be more relevant in several ways, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Offering advice that meets social norms:</strong> They published <a href="https://withcontent.co/opinionated-content-southeast-asian-audience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this piece</a> on how to write opinionated content for a Southeast Asian audience that “gets their audience thinking without making them feel too uncomfortable…due to unspoken cultural constraints.”</li>
<li><strong>Share relatable stories: </strong>Whenever possible, With Content shares <a href="https://withcontent.co/almost-lost-client-won-them-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">success stories like this one</a>, which feature businesses from Southeast Asia so their audience can connect with them.</li>
<li><strong>Use relevant metaphors:</strong> Metaphors are a shortcut to understanding, but use the right ones for your audience. Katrina said they’re particular about choosing locally relevant metaphors to “help with resonance and identification.”</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-with-content-pho-1.webp" alt="How to differentiate content - With Content article." width="936" height="504" class="aligncenter wp-image-91826 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-with-content-pho-1.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-with-content-pho-1-480x258.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://withcontent.co/pho-content-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>“Since we&#8217;ve done this, we&#8217;ve noticed our content resonating more,” Katrina said. “More marketers share our ideas with others, and our clients seem more receptive to advice. TL;DR: culture eats strategy for breakfast.”</p>
<p>Jenna offered a similar take. “Content that stands out is and will continue to be rooted in human insight—original thinking, nuance, and deep audience understanding,” she said. “You absolutely must be writing for the reader: what have they looked at before this, what will they look for after it, and what day-to-day problems are they trying to solve? Get in their brains.”</p>
<p>How do you collect this trove of human insight? By speaking with the people you’re surrounded by every day. “Our best-performing content comes from conversations with customers, niche experts, and internal SMEs,” Jenna told me. “We use their language and talk about problems the way they phrase it right from the title and beginning. It’s already a different feel to just blending the top-performing articles in the SERPs.”</p>

<h3>5. Share first-hand experience and “provide the receipts”</h3>
<p>I’ve always believed that there’s a hierarchy of what makes great content that goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Good:</strong> “Here’s how you can do a thing.”</li>
<li><strong>Better:</strong>  “Here’s how they did a thing.”</li>
<li><strong>Best:</strong> “Here’s how I did a thing.”</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/louise-linehan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Louise Linehan</a>, a content marketer at <a href="http://ahrefs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ahrefs</a>, also believes that lived experiences are a great way to make your content stand out.</p>
<p>“In terms of differentiating our content from AI-generated, or just generic/formulaic content, we make a concerted effort to include first-hand experience and ‘provide the receipts,’” she said.</p>
<p>For example, when Ahrefs publishes a tool review, it’s not just a book report of what others have already written. “We&#8217;ll share screenshots of videos of us actually testing and using the tools, and we make sure to get specific,” Louise said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-ahrefs-browse-1.webp" alt="How to differentiate content - Ahrefs post." width="600" height="546" class="aligncenter wp-image-91828 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-ahrefs-browse-1.webp 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-ahrefs-browse-1-480x437.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/best-ai-marketing-tools/#chatpgt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Louise gave several other examples of how they build different types of content around first-hand experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/boost-traffic-with-ai-content-helper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tutorials</a> based on use cases that were successful at Ahrefs.</li>
<li><a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/ai-overview-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research-based content</a> using their proprietary data.</li>
<li><a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-looking-out-for-number-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Point-of-view articles</a> with their unique take on developing industry news.</li>
</ul>
<p>I really like this “build in public” idea because it’s easily accessible to every content marketer. Simply switch the framing from third to first person, and include some anecdotes about your personal experience with the topic. I did it recently by <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-uses-in-marketing">testing several AI use cases</a>.</p>
<p>With a little tweak, you can turn this tactic into a way to get <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-referral-traffic">AI referral traffic</a>, Louise said. “I think the next step for us, in terms of differentiation, is to get more personalized with the content we create so that we are able to answer more complex AI search queries and turn up in the kinds of specialized conversations that are happening right now.”</p>
<div id="get-original-quotes-from-experts"></div>
<h3>6. Get original quotes from experts</h3>
<p>I really like when tips from experts are practical and easy to implement (read: not a 26-point strategy). And that’s why I love this one from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaleighmoore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaleigh Moore</a>, an <a href="https://www.kaleighmoore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agency owner</a> and experienced content marketer.</p>
<p>“AI can&#8217;t conduct interviews, but humans can,” she said. “So get some original quotes from experts.”</p>
<p>Here’s the really cool part: Kaleigh notes that this differentiation strategy comes with a built-in distribution channel. “The bonus is, the people you quote might be willing to share your content, and that&#8217;s a nice organic distribution boost!”</p>
<p>Eric Doty said they do this at Dock by harvesting quotes from their podcast, <a href="https://www.dock.us/grow-and-tell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grow and Tell</a>, and repurposing them in various formats. “[The podcast] is experts that are in our ICP, so like revenue leaders,” he said. “For each show, we have the video itself, and then we’ve made clips for social media and posted those clips on YouTube and our website.”</p>
<p>Eric shared an example of how quotes leveled up a standard SEO article. “In this post about buyer enablement, instead of just cookie-cutter SEO stuff, we’ve also embedded expert quotes, video clips, even our product templates, product examples.”</p>
<p>Here’s what that looks like in a recent Dock blog post:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-dock-video-1.webp" alt="How to differentiate content - Dock post." width="431" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-91821 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-dock-video-1.webp 431w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-dock-video-1-216x300.webp 216w" sizes="(max-width: 431px) 100vw, 431px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.dock.us/library" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Gathering and organizing expert quotes is a tough job. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/community-campbell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colin Campbell</a>, head of content and community at <a href="https://pixissoftware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pixis</a>, told me how he uses AI to do it.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ve recorded every interview me, my content team, and my PR agency have done,” he said. “I transcribed them, then I used an automated workflow and AI to identify potentially quotable sections.”</p>
<p>Colin said he categorizes the quotes and adds them to a table. With the help of another LLM workflow, he references the table when drafting outlines “so at the outline stage, I&#8217;m making sure to inform our angle with a real POV and to prove that POV with a quote.”</p>
<p>Kaleigh’s tip is instantly actionable for most of us. You probably have experts in-house you can chat with for their insights. Your customers are another great source. Or, simply search for your specialty on Linkedin and connect with people who are posting about it. Reach out and ask for a couple of quotes for your next article.</p>
<div id="bake-in-relatable-examples"></div>
<h3>7. Bake in relatable examples</h3>
<p>For <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reaserios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rease Rios</a>, senior content marketing manager at <a href="https://www.postman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Postman</a>, there’s a simple way to best boring content, especially when it’s created by AI.</p>
<p>“AI can help you with a lot of aspects of writing, but I&#8217;ve always found that the right example can elevate a piece of content, and examples are not something AI excels at,” Rease said.</p>
<p>One of the most important roles of a content marketer is to make complex concepts understandable. Rease says that this is where an ideal example really shines. “I work with very technical topics, so when I write or edit, I look for ways to take a step back and connect with the reader through an example that will resonate,” she explained. “Often, this means finding an example that works with a much broader (and potentially less technical) audience.”</p>
<p>I think this tactic works similarly to Louis’ tip on using first-person experience. You’re packaging a concept in a relatable story to make it more memorable and understandable. And in both cases, it’s something you can do better than AI.</p>
<p>Eric Doty has an interesting application of this strategy. He built <a href="https://www.dock.us/revenue-archives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this gallery</a> of sales assets to help inspire his customers to create their own.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-sales-examples-1.webp" alt="How to differentiate content - Dock examples page." width="600" height="515" class="aligncenter wp-image-91824 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-sales-examples-1.webp 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-sales-examples-1-480x412.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.dock.us/revenue-archives" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>“It’s one thing to write best practices; it’s another to curate examples. It’s effortful work that’s still not extremely easy for LLMs to replicate,” Eric said.</p>
<p>“Solid, relatable examples are a great differentiator,” Rease added. “Examples are your chance to get into the mindset of the readers and consider ‘what would make this click for them?’&#8221;</p>
<p>Real-world examples are best. But when they aren’t readily available, try some hypotheticals that bring your point home. Just remember what Katrina said about relatability. If you’re selling to blue-collar tradespeople, a pithy anecdote about a stock trader may not land.</p>

<h3>8. Create with empathy</h3>
<p>Empathy is often either treated as a hollow buzzword or confused with being nice. In reality, empathy is a learned skill that’s essential for any effective communicator, and as<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-yoder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Stephanie Yoder</a>, director of content at<a href="https://www.rebrandly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Rebrandly</a>, explained, it’s a valuable tool for connecting with your audience in the age of AI.</p>
<p>“You need to be empathetic to your readers, which is something AI cannot do,” Stephanie said. “An increasing number of companies are churning out endless pages of AI-generated content in an arms race to the bottom. That means content made with actual human beings in mind (as opposed to bots) will stand out even more. There is a golden opportunity for brands willing to double down on genuinely helpful content.”</p>
<p>In the context of content creation, empathy means understanding the real problem your customer is trying to solve. The old adage is to “sell the hole, not the drill.” Meaning, promote the solution, not the product. I’d say take that a step further and empathize with the pride of hanging a shelf yourself—then write content that speaks to that.</p>
<p>For a big brand, The Home Depot does a great job of empathizing with its customers. Their taglines “You can do it. We can help” and “How doers get more done” speak directly to our sense of accomplishment instead of “selling the drill.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-home-depot-1.webp" alt="How to differentiate content - Home Depot ad." width="936" height="526" class="aligncenter wp-image-91823 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-home-depot-1.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-home-depot-1-480x270.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.adweek.com/commerce/home-depot-builds-new-slogan-targeted-to-doers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>There are lots of opportunities to show empathy for your readers in long-form content, too. Name your target audience in the introduction, include pain points in your H2s, and add an inside joke or two.</p>
<p>The point, according to Stephanie, is to make sure and include a people-first perspective in all of your content, no matter how it’s created. “This doesn’t mean you can’t use AI to speed up your content creation process,” she said. “But a human must absolutely be in the loop at every stage of the process, preserving the humanity and actual utility of your content.”</p>
<div id="highlight-authors-over-brand"></div>
<h3>9. Highlight authors over brand</h3>
<p>Colin Campbell, the head of content and community at Pixis who gave us the tip earlier on managing expert quotes, has thought a lot about how the challenge of standing out in an increasingly crowded space.</p>
<p>“When everybody&#8217;s using the same LLMs, which all have access to the same information to produce content on the same topics, no amount of editing the outputs will help create a differentiated final product,” he noted. “The only reliable way to create differentiated content now is to curate inimitable inputs.</p>
<p>Collin mentioned four “buckets” of such inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opinions</li>
<li>Experiences</li>
<li>Proprietary data</li>
<li>Identity</li>
</ul>
<p>Other content marketers I spoke to had already explored the first three. So, I was interested in diving into the fourth. “I do believe users will care more and more about who wrote the content they consume,” Collin told me. “Just look at the rise of Substack and individual influencers as ‘thought leaders.’”</p>
<p>We already see this play out all over LinkedIn. Scroll long enough, and you’ll see individuals’ accounts getting much more engagement than the brands they work for. The trick is parlaying that personal following into views and visits on your content.</p>
<p>Rand Fishkin is a great example of how an author can build credibility that outshines brands to out-compete generic content.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-fishkin-1.webp" alt="How to differentiate content - Rand Fishkin LI post." width="600" height="500" class="aligncenter wp-image-91822 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-fishkin-1.webp 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-fishkin-1-480x400.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>

<p>You don’t need to be as prolific on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/01/09/social-media-marketing-strategies">social media</a> as Rand to use Colin’s advice. Try highlighting your author’s credibility in your blog posts. Have them write in the first person where applicable. And start an employee influencer program to help your team members grow their brand—and credibility—with your audience.</p>
<h2>Future-proof your content marketing strategy</h2>
<p>As content marketers, we’ve all seen an incredible amount of change in recent months. It seems like our playbooks get rewritten every few weeks. And even the most experienced among us are constantly “just figuring it out.”</p>
<p>As unsteady as some of this feels, this pro advice shows there <em>are</em> some constants you can rely on to work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Know your customers better than your competitors do</li>
<li>Use that knowledge to create content with empathy for your audience</li>
<li>Do things others don’t to stand out</li>
<li>Place your people out front so followers and buyers know they’re hearing from humans</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep these themes in mind, and you’ll future-proof your content strategy, no matter how smart AI gets.</p>

<h2>The biggest content marketing challenges in 2025</h2>
<p>We’re diving into the biggest <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/content-marketing-strategy-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content marketing</a> challenges businesses are facing and sharing what you can do about them to see the best results all year long.</p>
<div id="publishing-content-that-converts"></div>
<h3>Challenge #1: Creating content that converts users</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/articles/content-marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Content Marketing Institute’s research</a>, the top challenge marketers face with content creation is getting users to take a desired action.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenges-chart.webp" alt="top content marketing challenges chart research" width="1430" height="937" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91206" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenges-chart.webp 1430w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenges-chart-1280x839.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenges-chart-980x642.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenges-chart-480x315.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1430px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/articles/content-marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post">write blog posts</a> and post on social media all day, but if no one becomes a paying customer, there isn’t much point.</p>
<p>Some of your content will simply exist just for entertainment’s sake, and that’s okay. But you’re running a business, so some of it needs to get people to convert.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can overcome this challenge:</p>
<h4>Address the needs and pain points of your audience</h4>
<p>Some people wake up thinking they need cold-pressed juice. Others wake up thinking they want to eat something healthy but don’t have time to cook. Your content should tap into those real-life desires.</p>
<p>Here’s the difference:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenges-addressing-pain-points-png.webp" alt="addressing pain points okay vs better content example" width="936" height="201" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91207" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenges-addressing-pain-points-png.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenges-addressing-pain-points-480x103.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The first statement is informative, but the second one speaks to a specific need. Shift your message to why your product or service helps, and that’s when you’ll see people take action.</p>
<h4>Use headlines that hook people</h4>
<p>Think of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/01/headline-examples">headlines</a> like a storefront. If your signage is bland, people walk by. But if it’s compelling or sparks curiosity, they step inside.</p>
<p>See the difference:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenge-strong-headline-example-png.webp" alt="okay vs better headlines for prompting action in content" width="936" height="180" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91208" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenge-strong-headline-example-png.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenge-strong-headline-example-480x92.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Test different headlines and see what resonates with your audience. Try formulas like these:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question-based:</strong> Tired of Feeling Bloated? This Juice Might Be the Fix</li>
<li><strong>List-based:</strong> 5 Superfoods That Make Your Skin Glow (And How to Get Them in One Drink)</li>
<li><strong>Curiosity-driven:</strong> We Tried Mixing Beets and Pineapple: Here’s What Happened</li>
</ul>
<h4>Use calls-to-action that are easy to say “yes” to</h4>
<p>You’ve likely read an article, got to the end, and then just left. That’s what happens when there’s no clear next step.</p>
<p>Your content needs <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">calls-to-action (CTAs)</a> as a natural next step. But not always in a pushy, “buy now” way.</p>
<p>Let’s say you post a blog on how to naturally boost your immunity with juice. Instead of ending it with a friendly sign-off, give people a reason to act. Say something like “Want to try an immunity-boosting juice? Order online and pick up in 15 minutes!”</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/270d.png" alt="✍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Need help finding the perfect CTA?</strong> Free guide download &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download">The 42 Best Call to Action Phrases Ever (&amp; Why They Work)</a></p>
<div id="knowing-your-audience"></div>
<h3>Challenge #2: Knowing your audience</h3>
<p>Some businesses think they know their customers. The owner of a juice bar might think “We sell smoothies, so our <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/target-audience/">target audience</a> is health-conscious people.”</p>
<p>But that’s too broad, and it’s not that simple. Are they busy professionals grabbing some juice before work? Gym-goers looking for a protein boost? Different people need different messages.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to get inside your audience’s head:</p>
<h4>Do audience research</h4>
<p>Instead of making assumptions, do some actual research. And your content will be better for it.</p>
<p>Look at the customers coming through the door. See who’s placing orders online. Are they mostly young professionals? Students? Parents?</p>
<p>Check out the conversations in places like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reddit-marketing">Reddit threads</a> and Facebook groups. Scope out the reviews of your competitors to see what people are saying about products like yours.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f575-fe0f-200d-2640-fe0f.png" alt="🕵️‍♀️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Want to understand who you should target with your content marketing?</strong> Download the guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteTargetAudience.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_TargetAudineceGuide_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links">How to Find Your Target Audience [Simple Steps!]</a></p>
<h4>Create buyer personas</h4>
<p>Once you’ve gathered some info, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/23/buyer-personas">create buyer personas</a>. Map out who your actual audience is, so you can talk to them like real people.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/buyer-persona-definition-png.webp" alt="definition of and info about buyer personas" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90344" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/buyer-persona-definition-png.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/buyer-persona-definition-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here’s an example for that juice bar: One persona could be “Fran, the Fitness Enthusiast.” She’s 30 years old and lives in the city. She regularly hits the gym at 6 a.m. and needs a smoothie right after. Fran also loves organic ingredients and reading about personal health.</p>
<p>When creating content for this persona, you’d talk about protein blends, superfoods, and the benefits of adding things like turmeric for recovery.</p>
<h4>Use analytics to track audience engagement</h4>
<p>If your content isn’t working, the analytics will tell you. Google Analytics, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/05/social-media-metrics">social media insights</a>, and email open rates also tell a story. Which pages and posts get the most engagement?</p>
<p>Let’s say you post a reel about a new kale smoothie, but it flops. Meanwhile, a post about the best juice combos for glowing skin gets a lot of action. That’s a clue that your audience might care more about one thing over another. Adjust your choices for content accordingly.</p>
<h4>Ask your audience for feedback</h4>
<p>Nothing beats real conversations with your audience. Run a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-do-a-poll-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quick Instagram poll</a>, ask for feedback at checkout, or include a one-question survey in your email newsletter.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ask-for-feedback-email-png.webp" alt="email asking for feedback on upcoming offer" width="1200" height="642" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91211" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ask-for-feedback-email-png.webp 1200w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ask-for-feedback-email-980x524.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ask-for-feedback-email-480x257.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>People may share their opinion if they feel like your brand is listening to them. Plus, their answers will give you content ideas.</p>
<div id="differentiating-content-from-the-competitors"></div>
<h3>Challenge #3: Differentiating content from the competitors</h3>
<p>It’s not easy to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-differentiate-content">stand out</a>. The good news is you don’t need to do any crazy marketing tactics. You just need to be real with your content. Stories create emotional connections, and sharing your expertise builds trust. Do both, and people will remember your content.</p>
<p>Here’s how to start differentiating yourself:</p>
<h4>Tell a story</h4>
<p>Numbers and stats can help build credibility. But if you want your content to leave a mark, give storytelling a go. Research suggests that personal stories and gossip make up <a href="https://www.soocial.com/storytelling-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 65%</a> of our conversations. It’s just how people connect.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re researching information about brakes on your car. As a reader, what do you think would be more memorable&#8211; a dry, factual post about brake repairs? Or an anecdote about a driver who avoided a major accident thanks to a quick visit to a trusted mechanic?</p>
<p>Make your content memorable by weaving in real stories. <a href="https://www.blog.thebrandshopbw.com/brand-storytelling-statistics-and-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55%</a> of consumers are more likely to remember a story than a list of facts.</p>
<p>Now put yourself in the shoes of a mechanic shop owner. Instead of just saying that regular oil changes extend the life of an engine, bring it to life with a real example. Maybe you had a customer who hadn’t changed their oil in 15,000 miles, and their engine was about to fail. Sharing a story makes the point hit home.</p>
<p>And you’re not limited to just <em>your</em> experiences. A glowing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/19/customer-testimonial-examples">customer testimonial</a> about how your shop diagnosed a transmission issue when another shop couldn’t figure it out? That’s more convincing than simply talking about your services.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/customer-testimonial-example-auto-mechanic-png.webp" alt="descriptive customer testimonial for an auto mechanic shop on website" width="1200" height="774" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91236" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/customer-testimonial-example-auto-mechanic-png.webp 1200w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/customer-testimonial-example-auto-mechanic-980x632.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/customer-testimonial-example-auto-mechanic-480x310.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://superiorautoservice.net/testimonial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>People remember stories more than a list of benefits. If someone hears about how your shop helped a stranded driver get back on the road in time for a job interview, that sticks. And when they eventually need car repairs, guess who they’ll think of? Hint: you.</p>
<h4>Give away knowledge and assets</h4>
<p>Some businesses keep their knowledge locked up, so to speak. They’re afraid that customers won’t need them if they reveal too much. But people <em>want</em> to see that you’re an expert.</p>
<p>And the best way to show them? Give them real, valuable insights.</p>
<p>Running that mechanic shop, you already know most car maintenance content out there is predictable. So, offer something people <em>aren’t</em> seeing out there. Maybe a breakdown of how to spot shady repair shops, or an insider’s guide on which warning lights need immediate attention and which ones can wait.</p>
<p>Love free stuff? So does everyone else.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/15/lead-magnet-ideas">downloadable guide</a>, like a DIY road trip safety checklist or a printable maintenance log for tracking oil changes and tire rotations, gives people something practical.</p>
<p>Sharing knowledge doesn’t mean giving away your business. It proves you know your stuff!</p>
<div id="creating-content-consistently"></div>
<h3>Challenge #4: Creating content consistently</h3>
<p>Consistency builds momentum and keeps your audience engaged. But who has time to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-brainstorm-business-ideas">brainstorm content ideas</a> when you’re juggling so many other things?</p>
<p>That’s why you need a plan.</p>
<h4>Develop a schedule and stick to it</h4>
<p>If content is an afterthought for you, it probably won’t happen. So, block out time to plan, create, and post. Or hire someone to do it for you. Whether it’s twice a week or twice a month, consistency matters.</p>
<p>For a juice bar, that could mean every Monday is a post of behind-the-scenes video of your team prepping fresh fruit. Wednesdays are for sharing a customer’s favorite juice order with a fun caption. And on Fridays, you drop a weekend promo.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-plan-template-wordstream-png.webp" alt="content plan template outline from wordstream" width="767" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91237" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-plan-template-wordstream-png.webp 767w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-plan-template-wordstream-480x563.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 767px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Get our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-plan">content plan template</a> to help you get started and stay on track.</em></p>
<h4>Set aside dedicated time for content creation</h4>
<p>There will be times when you’re waiting for a free moment to sit down and work on content, and it never comes.</p>
<p>So, set a time each week to create content in bulk for the future. Make it part of your routine, so it doesn’t feel like another last-minute task.</p>
<h4>Develop a “bank” of ideas and log them as they come to you</h4>
<p>Ever had a great idea for a piece of content, only to forget it in an hour? That’s why you need a bank/library/whatever to save ideas.</p>
<p>Use an app on your phone, a Google spreadsheet, or even a notebook to jot down ideas as they come up. Hearing that more and more customers are raving about your peanut butter acai bowl? Make a note to feature customer favorites.</p>
<p>Before you know it, you’ll have a list saved of content ideas to pick from.</p>
<div id="producing-high-quality-content"></div>
<h3>Challenge #5: Creating high-quality content</h3>
<p>If your content is just a slightly different version of what’s already floating around online, what’s the point? Your goal should be to rise above all the noise, but this is no easy feat&#8211;it’s a top challenge in the content world, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1366088/top-content-marketing-purposes/">per Statista</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s how to create something that’s both useful and high quality:</p>
<h4>Aim to create something better than what’s already out there</h4>
<p>Before you start writing, Google the topic you’re about to cover. What’s ranking? What’s missing from the top-ranking content? Is anything outdated?</p>
<p>If every article about “Why your car won’t start” just lists the usual stuff (dead battery, no gas, etc.), you should go beyond that. Include real customer examples, troubleshooting steps, and when it’s time to call a mechanic.</p>
<p>The more helpful and detailed your content is, the better it will be by comparison.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenge-strong-post-content-example-png.webp" alt="okay vs better content example" width="936" height="247" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91209" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenge-strong-post-content-example-png.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/content-marketing-challenge-strong-post-content-example-480x127.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Support claims with data and research</h4>
<p>Anyone can say they’re the best mechanic in town, but proving it is what convinces people. So, support your content with real data, stats from trusted sources, and even case studies.</p>
<p>For example, instead of saying, “Tire pressure affects fuel efficiency,” you could say:</p>
<p>“Driving on underinflated tires can <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/files/u/publication/gas-saving_tips.pdf?fbb3c63ad5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower gas mileage by 3%</a>, according to the US Department of Energy. That could cost you an extra $100 a year at the pump.”</p>
<p>Numbers can make your content credible.</p>
<h4>Create detailed outlines for each piece</h4>
<p>Ever start writing an article, only to have no idea where it’s going next? That’s what happens when you don’t have an outline prepared.</p>
<p>Give yourself (or whoever’s writing) some direction. Here are some steps to guide you in putting together a good outline:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research your topic. Collect data, stats, and insights that support your arguments.</li>
<li>Determine the main theme. This will be the foundation of your outline.</li>
<li>Break down the main points you want to cover.</li>
<li>Organize ideas into a hierarchical structure.</li>
<li>Arrange your ideas in a logical order that flows and makes sense.</li>
<li>Fill in supporting details like examples and quotes from reputable sources.</li>
</ul>
<div id="aligning-content-with-the-buyers-journey"></div>
<h3>Challenge #6: Aligning content with the buyer&#8217;s journey</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-the-buyers-journey/">buyer’s journey</a> describes the stages that a person might go through before buying, including awareness, consideration, and decision. It represents the relationship that potential customers have with your business, from learning about you all the way to becoming a customer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/buyers-journey-png.webp" alt="buyers journey graphic" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91210" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/buyers-journey-png.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/buyers-journey-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Some people are just discovering your juice bar for the first time. Others are weighing their options. And some are ready to buy but need a nudge. If you want your content to work, it should meet people where they are.</p>
<h4>Awareness stage</h4>
<p>At this stage, people aren’t searching for your business specifically. They’re looking for a solution to their needs. Maybe they’re Googling things like “best ways to boost energy naturally.”</p>
<p>Your job is to create content that answers these broad questions without pushing a sale. At this stage, your CTA should be light and educational, like “Follow us for more nutrition tips.”</p>
<h4>Consideration stage</h4>
<p>Now, they’re interested. They want a smoothie, but they’re weighing their options. Should they make their own at home or head to a local juice bar? This is where you show what makes your product the best choice.</p>
<p>Your CTA should nudge them forward, like “Check out our menu to find your perfect smoothie.”</p>
<h4>Decision stage</h4>
<p>At this stage, they’re ready to buy. But maybe they need one last reason to choose you. A one-time deal, a convenient option (like online ordering), or a little extra reassurance could do the trick.</p>
<p>No more soft-sell CTAs. This is where you give a push, like “Order now and pick up in 10 minutes!”</p>
<div id="promoting-your-content-effectively"></div>
<h3>Challenge #7: Promoting your content effectively</h3>
<p>The <em>concept</em> of promoting your content sounds easy. But the challenge is finding the best places and the time to do it.</p>
<p>Just like you’d do for creating content on a consistent basis, block out some time on a regular basis to promote in other places on the web.</p>
<p>Test out some of these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-distribution">distribution strategies</a> to see what gets the best engagement. Then focus more of your promotion efforts on those.</p>
<ul>
<li>Repurpose in another format</li>
<li>Brand all your visuals</li>
<li>Optimize content for SEO</li>
<li>Include links in relevant blog posts</li>
<li>Post on social platforms</li>
<li>Plug content on a podcast</li>
<li>Syndicate your blog posts</li>
<li>Share with your email mailing list</li>
<li>Pitch your content to related newsletters</li>
<li>Share on forums</li>

<p>Let’s dig deeper into each tip.</p>
<div id="put-together-a-content-strategy"></div>
<h3>1. Put together a content strategy</h3>
<p>Hoping a blog post will have people flocking to your site? That might’ve worked years ago when the web wasn’t saturated with content that’s been done dozens of times over. But in 2025, posting and praying for traction is a waste of time.</p>
<p>You need a plan that keeps your content strategic and different from everything else out there. Here are some ways you can do that.</p>
<h4>Set goals that matter</h4>
<p>Before you write, ask yourself: What’s the point of this content? Are you trying to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/keyword-mapping">rank for a valuable keyword</a> or educate potential customers?</p>
<p>An auto body shop, for instance, might aim to attract local customers by ranking for “best collision repair near me,” while an auto parts retailer might focus on detailed product guides that help people choose the right brake pads. Your goals should define your strategy.</p>
<h4>Know your audience</h4>
<p>Who’s reading your content? And what gets the most engagement? Study <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-pain-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer pain points</a> and look at <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-trends-2025">search trends</a>. See what your competitors’ content might be missing, and address that in your own content.</p>
<p>Use these questions to identify your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/target-audience/">target audience</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who’s buying from you or working with you now?</li>
<li>What are their shopping habits?</li>
<li>What are they buying?</li>
<li>What info are they using to make a buying decision?</li>
<li>Where are they located?</li>
<li>Where are they hanging out online?</li>
<li>Where are they finding you?</li>
<li>When do they interact with your business?</li>
<li>When are they looking for you and your business?</li>
<li>Why are they buying from you?</li>
<li>Why are they buying from your competitors?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Address current industry issues and trends</h4>
<p>There aren’t many industries that are stuck in time. Keeping with the automotive theme, EVs are becoming more popular, and self-driving tech is evolving.</p>
<p>Your content should reflect the trends. If you&#8217;re running a mechanic shop, you could write about how new EVs impact traditional maintenance. Stay ahead of the conversation, and you won’t have to chase engagement.</p>
<h4>Get your timing right</h4>
<p>A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-plan">content calendar</a> lays the foundation for your publishing schedule. No need to scramble for ideas, and you’ve got topics lined up ahead of time. Examples for the mechanic shop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seasonal content: Push winter tire guides in fall, not January.</li>
<li>Local events: If your town has a big car show, create content around prepping a vehicle for display.</li>
<li>Industry happenings: Cover major automotive recalls or tech breakthroughs as they happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s what a content calendar can look like, <a href="https://kantree.io/blog/tips/using-kantree-as-a-content-planning-solution-with-templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">courtesy of Kantree</a>:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/content-calendar-example-png.avif" alt="example of content calendar" width="1040" height="625" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90760" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/content-calendar-example-png.avif 1040w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/content-calendar-example-300x180.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/content-calendar-example-1024x615.avif 1024w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/content-calendar-example-768x462.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/content-calendar-example-980x589.avif 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/content-calendar-example-480x288.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1040px) 100vw, 1040px" /></p>
<div id="focus-on-quality-over-quantity"></div>
<h3>2. Focus on quality over quantity</h3>
<p>People don’t care how much you post–they only care about how good it is. So, if you’re running a travel agency, don’t pump out generic “Top 10 Beaches in the Caribbean” articles that a thousand other sites have already covered. Instead, create something that people can’t find anywhere else.</p>
<h4>Prioritize researched, in-depth content</h4>
<p>Readers want insider knowledge, real experiences, and even some secrets.</p>
<p>Let’s say that travel agency specializes in Jamaica. Instead of writing a listicle about the best things to do in Jamaica, they could cover topics like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hidden Waterfalls in Jamaica That Only Locals Know About</li>
<li>How to Plan a Stress-Free Trip to Jamaica with Kids</li>
<li>The Best Time to Visit Jamaica Based on What You Want to Experience</li>
</ul>
<h4>Aim for evergreen content that will be relevant over time</h4>
<p>A well-written post should be like a great Jamaican rum, getting better over time. Or is that only for wine?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/10/16/guide-to-evergreen-content-marketing">Evergreen content</a> stays relevant long after you hit publish. A guide to all-inclusive resorts in Montego Bay can be timeless, although it may need some updates in the long run. A post about an upcoming festival, on the other hand, is probably only going to be useful leading up to the event.</p>
<p>Focus on creating something that will still provide value next year and beyond.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/first-page-of-google?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_10WaysFirstPageGoogle_Download">10 Tangible &amp; Free Ways to Get on the First Page of Google</a></p>
<div id="meet-the-users-intent"></div>
<h3>3. Meet the user’s intent</h3>
<p>If you’re creating content without thinking about <em>why</em> someone is searching for the topic, you’ll probably miss the mark.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/keyword-search-intent-1-png.avif" alt="different types of keyword intents" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90734" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/keyword-search-intent-1-png.avif 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/keyword-search-intent-1-300x192.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/keyword-search-intent-1-768x492.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/keyword-search-intent-1-480x308.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" /></p>
<p>Take a real estate business in Tampa, FL, for example. If they want to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-differentiate-content">stand out</a>, they can’t just write about homes for sale in Tampa and call it a day. You need to understand exactly what people are looking for and give it to them. And you have to do it better than anyone else if you want to stand out.</p>
<h4>Research some keywords first</h4>
<p>Figure out what your potential readers (and customers) are actually searching for. Tools like Ahrefs, Semrush, and WordStream’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">Free Keyword Tool</a> can help you identify those keywords.</p>
<p>But intent matters too. Maybe even more than search volume.</p>
<p>Take these keywords:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best neighborhoods in Tampa (850 searches/month)</li>
<li>Tampa homes with boat docks (10 searches/month)</li>
</ul>
<p>Which one’s better? Sure, the first one gets more volume. But if you’re targeting people who are ready to buy a waterfront home, that second one is what you want for leads.</p>
<h4>Look at the search engine results</h4>
<p>Once you’ve got a keyword in mind, Google it yourself and look at the results. What’s ranking at the top? Blog posts? Video tours? Market reports?</p>
<p>If listicles rank well, your deep-dive essay might not be the right format. If short, transactional pages are ranking, a 3,000-word guide probably won’t cut it. The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/09/04/content-marketing-goal-alignment">type of content</a> you create should match what users (and Google) expect.</p>
<h4>Address the user’s needs directly</h4>
<p>Imagine a couple relocating from New York, searching for the best areas in Tampa for families. They probably don’t want a basic list. They want information about schools, public transit, etc. Instead of covering the same neighborhoods everyone else has already talked about, go deeper:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which areas have the best schools?</li>
<li>What’s the average home price in each neighborhood?</li>
<li>What’s the vibe: quiet suburban or walkable city streets?</li>
<li>What do actual residents say?</li>
<li>What are the commute times to downtown?</li>
</ul>
<div id="zig-when-everyone-else-zags"></div>
<h3>4. Zig when everyone else zags</h3>
<p>There’s a ton of cookie-cutter content out there. Not to mention a surge of AI-generated fluff.</p>
<p>Search “best things to do in Jamaica,” and you’ll see the same recycled list–Dunn’s River Falls, Seven Mile Beach, etc. These are great spots, no doubt (I’ve visited). But if everyone is writing about the same stuff, why would someone choose to read your content over the others?</p>
<p>If you want to stand out, offer something different. Challenge the status quo and people will pay attention.</p>
<p>Instead of writing another “Top 10 Attractions in Jamaica” article, try “5 Hidden Gems in Jamaica You Won’t Find on Tourist Maps.” Highlight real insider locations, like a peacock farm or a squeezed juice shack with no website.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/unique-content-idea-example-jamaica-png.avif" alt="example of unique content idea for visiting jamaica" width="1200" height="297" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90761" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/unique-content-idea-example-jamaica-png.avif 1200w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/unique-content-idea-example-jamaica-300x74.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/unique-content-idea-example-jamaica-1024x253.avif 1024w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/unique-content-idea-example-jamaica-768x190.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/unique-content-idea-example-jamaica-1080x267.avif 1080w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/unique-content-idea-example-jamaica-980x243.avif 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/unique-content-idea-example-jamaica-480x119.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Bring a fresh angle or a perspective that only <em>you</em> can provide. People associate Jamaica with white sand beaches and reggae. Try something intriguing, like what nobody tells you about visiting Jamaica during hurricane season.</p>
<div id="craft-compelling-headlines-and-introductions"></div>
<h3>5. Craft compelling headlines and introductions</h3>
<p>If your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/headline-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">headline</a> doesn’t stop people in their tracks, it’s not helping your content stand out. Your page could be a goldmine of helpful information, but if nobody clicks, then nobody’s reading it.</p>
<p>See the difference for a mechanic shop:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-bad-headline-png.avif" alt="difference between good vs boring headline" width="936" height="189" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90739" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-bad-headline-png.avif 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-bad-headline-300x61.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-bad-headline-768x155.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-bad-headline-480x97.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" /></p>
<p>A headline that stands out isn’t just descriptive. It taps into curiosity or urgency makes people want to click (without baiting).</p>
<p>Tactics to try:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use numbers</strong>, like “7 Signs Your Brakes Are About to Fail”</li>
<li><strong>Create curiosity gaps</strong>, like “The One Oil Change Mistake That Could Ruin Your Engine”</li>
<li><strong>Promise a transformation</strong>, like “How to Make Your Car Last 200,000 Miles Without Costly Repairs”</li>
<li><strong>Use </strong><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/trigger-words/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>trigger words</strong></a> to spark an emotional reaction, like these.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, someone clicks to your page. Now what?</p>
<p>Hook readers with an introduction that pulls them in. Don’t let them hit the back button before they reach the good stuff!</p>
<p>You could start with a relatable problem, use a vivid scenario, or make a promise. Or some combination of these.</p>
<p>See the difference:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-introduction-png.avif" alt="good vs boring introduction in stand out content" width="936" height="330" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90740" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-introduction-png.avif 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-introduction-300x106.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-introduction-768x271.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-introduction-480x169.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" /></p>
<div id="make-your-content-scannable-and-visually-appealing"></div>
<h3>6. Make your content scannable and visually appealing</h3>
<p>People like to skim and scan. They’re looking for quick answers, takeaways, and visuals to illustrate concepts. If your content is a wall of words, it’s overwhelming and not very inviting.</p>
<p>To keep readers engaged, structure your content so they can find what they need fast. Here are a few tips to do that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use headings and subheadings:</strong> These guide the reader and make the content easy to skim. Not everyone will read your page from beginning to end.</li>
<li><strong>Use bullet points and numbered lists: </strong>These highlight bite-size bits of information and keep attention from drifting. They make step-by-step instructions clear.</li>
<li><strong>Keep paragraphs short: </strong>If your paragraphs are longer than 3-4 lines, consider breaking them up. Nobody wants to sift through walls of text to find something.</li>
</ul>
<p>Us humans, we’re visual creatures. We process images <a href="https://medtechintelligence.com/column/the-power-of-visuals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60,000</a> times faster than text. So, if you’re only using words, you’re missing an opportunity to stand out.</p>
<p>For example, this is an ad but still illustrates the point. The visual is easier to process than a bunch of text explaining how to wear a face mask properly.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/visually-appealing-ad-example-png.avif" alt="example of visually appealing yet informative ad" width="664" height="376" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90762" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/visually-appealing-ad-example-png.avif 664w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/visually-appealing-ad-example-300x170.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/visually-appealing-ad-example-480x272.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px" /></p>
<p>Try these to make your content more appealing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Images: </strong>A well-placed photo or diagram can reinforce your point or provide more context to the topic.</li>
<li><strong>Infographics:</strong> If you’ve got a bunch of data points to share, show them in a graphic.</li>
<li><strong>Videos:</strong> If a video can explain it better than text, use one. Plus, some people prefer video over other formats.</li>
</ul>
<div id="include-data-and-expert-insights"></div>
<h3>7. Include data and expert insights</h3>
<p>Anyone can just make a claim. But backing it up with cited facts and expert opinions will turn your content into a resource that people trust.</p>
<p>Data gives your claims real weight. Instead of vague statements, say something concrete like this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-claim-png.avif" alt="good vs boring claim in stand out content writing" width="936" height="229" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90741" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-claim-png.avif 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-claim-300x73.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-claim-768x188.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-claim-480x117.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" /></p>
<p>The more specific you can get, the better. If you’re writing about the best Tampa neighborhoods for first-time buyers, show stats about affordability.</p>
<p>Know what makes your content even more credible? Expert opinions.</p>
<p>Give readers insights they can’t get from run-of-the-mill articles. If you’re a real estate agent, ask a mortgage broker to help you out with some firsthand knowledge to make your content unique.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-statement-png.avif" alt="good vs boring statement in content writing" width="936" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90742" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-statement-png.avif 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-statement-300x118.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-statement-768x301.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/good-vs-boring-statement-480x188.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" /></p>
<div id="tell-a-story"></div>
<h3>8. Tell a story</h3>
<p>Facts and stats add credibility. If you want to take it a step further so your content <em>really</em> sticks, tell a story. Research shows that personal stories and gossip make up about <a href="https://www.soocial.com/storytelling-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">65%</a> of our conversations. It’s how we connect.</p>
<p>So, make your content memorable by weaving in real anecdotes. <a href="https://www.blog.thebrandshopbw.com/brand-storytelling-statistics-and-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55%</a> of consumers are more likely to remember a story than a list of facts.</p>
<p>Don’t just say that Dunn’s River Falls is a must-visit in Jamaica. Bring things to life with a real experience to make your content feel human. And when people connect with you, they trust you.</p>
<p>You can also weave in stories and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/19/customer-testimonial-examples">testimonials from customers</a>. These build trust with readers and make your content more compelling. Instead of just listing the perks of staying at a luxury resort, you could also tell the story of a past customer.</p>

<div id="try-different-content-formats"></div>
<h3>9. Try different content formats</h3>
<p>If you’re only publishing blog posts, you’re leaving potential traffic and conversions on the table. People consume content in different ways–some love reading an in-depth article, while others prefer a quick video.</p>
<p>If you want to stand out, experiment with different formats and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/03/repurposing-content">repurpose your content across multiple platforms</a>.</p>
<p>Some topics work best in written form, while others need a visual touch. Mix up your content game with blog posts, videos, infographics, downloadable assets, and more.</p>
<p>Don’t just create once and move on, though. Smart marketers repurpose their content across different channels. You could…</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn a blog post into a video script and post it on YouTube.</li>
<li>Break down key points into LinkedIn posts.</li>
<li>Convert original research into an infographic.</li>
<li>Take highlights from an expert interview and create a podcast clip.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all content formats perform equally, though.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/blogging-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bloggers who produce strong results</a>, the most effective formats are roundups, infographics, and original research. Try some of these, see what gets the best engagement, and do more of that.</p>

<div id="be-giving"></div>
<h3>10. Be giving</h3>
<p>Some businesses don’t want to reveal how they do things. They don’t want to reveal their secrets. But customers don’t want to guess whether you know your stuff or not. They want to see proof.</p>
<p>And the best way to prove it?</p>
<p>“Give away” your best tips and tricks. If you run a mechanic shop, don’t post the same generic car maintenance advice everyone else does. Share insider knowledge, especially if your competitors aren’t talking about it. Impress your readers!</p>
<p>Give people something they won’t find in every other auto blog. You might create something like “How to Tell If a Mechanic Is Overcharging You, Straight from an Honest Mechanic.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mechanic-advice-video-png.avif" alt="mechanic advice video" width="2162" height="628" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90764" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mechanic-advice-video-png.avif 2162w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mechanic-advice-video-300x87.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mechanic-advice-video-1024x297.avif 1024w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mechanic-advice-video-768x223.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mechanic-advice-video-1536x446.avif 1536w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mechanic-advice-video-2048x595.avif 2048w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mechanic-advice-video-1080x314.avif 1080w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mechanic-advice-video-1280x372.avif 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mechanic-advice-video-980x285.avif 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mechanic-advice-video-480x139.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 2162px) 100vw, 2162px" /></p>
<p>Also, who doesn’t like free stuff?</p>
<p>Offering a downloadable checklist or ebook can leave a lasting impression. That mechanic shop could create a printable tire pressure and oil change log for customers to track their maintenance.</p>

<div id="promote-and-distribute-your-content"></div>
<h3>11. Promote and distribute your content</h3>
<p>You’re done once you hit publish. No matter how great your content is, you still need to distribute it to the world if you want to stand out.</p>
<p>Meet your audience where they are. Promote your content across multiple channels, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social media:</strong> Don’t just share the link and call it a day. Turn key points into LinkedIn posts or Instagram carousels.</li>
<li><strong>Email newsletters:</strong> Share the new content in your next email with a compelling hook. Give readers a reason to click.</li>
<li><strong>Online communities:</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reddit-marketing">Reddit</a>, Facebook groups, and Quora can be great for sharing helpful content if you’re not spammy about it. Answer questions and link to your content if it adds value.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborations:</strong> Have connections in your industry? See if a complementary business will share your content with its audience.</li>
</ul>
<h2>So, do you want to your content to perform better?</h2>
<p>Content in 2025 needs to break through the noise. If you’re saying the same things as everyone else, you’ll be shouting into the void.</p>
<p>But if you prioritize quality over quantity and offer something that’s truly unique, that’s when people pay attention.</p>
<p>Be bold. Be different. And most importantly, be helpful.</p>

<h2>2025 content marketing trends</h2>
<p>Let’s look at some of the top <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/12/28/content-marketing-advice">content marketing</a> trends for 2025 and some ways you can get ready to take advantage of them.</p>
<div id="marketers-build-uniqueness-moats"></div>
<h3>1. Marketers will build uniqueness moats around content</h3>
<p>There’s a little renaissance happening in the content marketing corners of LinkedIn. Expert SEOs and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/08/content-creator"> content creators</a> are talking a little less about creating lots of content quickly and a little more about making each piece more competitive.</p>
<p>It’s not the old <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-marketing">content marketing</a> trend trope of “content needs to be authentic” driving the conversations. It’s a call to once again prioritize adding something novel—a unique perspective or new data—to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/better-content-performance">make your content rise above</a> the sea of sameness.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-rogers.webp" alt="Content marketing trends - LinkedIn post from Mark Rogers" width="666" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88030 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-rogers.webp 666w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-rogers-480x432.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 666px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/markrogers88_content-marketing-is-in-the-middle-of-a-transformation-activity-7275529147819388928-I3kV?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>The chorus got louder towards the end of 2024, with several notable pros joining in:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/timsoulo_i-hate-the-word-content-it-has-ruined-activity-7275032638048911360-h9xv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Soulo</a>, Ahrefs CMO, shared how great content is built around news, experiments, data, stories, and discoveries.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/randfishkin_my-good-friend-scott-heimendinger-raised-activity-7275426976364933121-bByP?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rand Fishkin</a>, founder of SparkToro, pointed to a site that does incredibly in-depth experiments on cooking knives as the epitome of value-driven content.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jayacunzo_ai-and-humans-both-rely-on-llms-ai-has-large-activity-7275873900876464128-ATcn?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jay Acunzo</a>, speaker and storytelling adviser, suggested that documenting your little life moments is “the biggest, best, and easiest way to create more valuable, original work.”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/wilreynolds_brightonseo-activity-7269728088727457792-JyW4?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Will Reynolds</a>, VP of innovation at Seer Interactive, talked about leveling up “Google-only content” to “Humans loved it” content using things like subject-matter expert interviews.</li>
</ul>
<p>To a large degree, this content marketing trend is a reaction to the high-throughput AI content experiments of early 2024. It quickly became apparent that a content quantity arms race was a losing proposition since everyone could access the same tools to pump out posts.</p>
<p>What’s left is competing on quality and, more specifically, uniqueness. We’ll see more marketers creatively sourcing new data from unexpected places and then using it to build uniqueness moats around their content that AI can’t compete with.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-filipa.webp" alt="Content marketing trends - LinkedIn post from Filipa Caneles" width="534" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88031 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-filipa.webp 534w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-filipa-480x539.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 534px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Content marketers </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/filipa-canelas_this-is-the-linkedin-content-no-competitor-activity-7275132766113931264-OBWW?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>will source unique insights</em></a><em> from creative places in 2025.</em></p>
<p>Almost paradoxically, AI will make competing against AI possible. As we’ll discuss in the next trend, content marketers will have a whole arsenal of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency">AI tools</a> to extract ideas, parse data, and repurpose <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/content-marketing-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original content</a>.</p>
<p>Pushing out more content faster won’t be the play in 2025. The brands that build unfordable uniqueness moats will be the winners of attention and trust in the coming year.</p>
<p><strong>How to prepare for this trend:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Look for unique insights everywhere (your internal user data, surveys, interviews with subject matter experts, product experiments, etc.).</li>
<li>Ask, “What are we adding to the conversation?” for every piece of content in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-plan">calendar</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-in-marketing">Use AI tools</a> to surface new ideas from videos, long text documents, and interview transcripts.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong> Need marketing, social media, and promotion ideas?</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/marketing-calendar?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2025MarketingCalendar_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links">Download The Only Marketing Calendar You Need for 2025</a>.</p>
<div id="ai-technology-stacks-expand"></div>
<h3>2. AI technology stacks will expand exponentially</h3>
<p>Already, <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/ai-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">88%</a> of marketers say they use AI in their work, and 70% say they’ll use it more in the year ahead. But we won’t just be logging onto the same one or two platforms. In 2025, expect to see marketers’ toolboxes fill up with a wide range of AI tools, each tasked with tackling a different <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-marketing-challenges">marketing challenge</a>.</p>
<p>Until recently, most of us plunked our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/08/chatgpt-prompts">prompts into ChatGPT</a> and cajoled it to solve all of our problems. Now, we can ask one tool to robo-voice a podcast from a webinar transcript while a different platform creates an infographic from a blog post.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-influencity.webp" alt="Content marketing trends - screenshot from Influencity." width="830" height="340" class="aligncenter wp-image-88032 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-influencity.webp 830w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-influencity-480x197.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 830px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A new crop of AI tools focuses on one specific marketing challenge, like managing an influencer seeding program.</em></p>
<p>This new breed of point-solution software numbers in the hundreds, with new options popping up constantly. Here are a few interesting options to start with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://influencity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Influencity</a> uses AI to help you find and manage the perfect influencer.</li>
<li><a href="http://design.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Design.ai</a> is an image generator you can use to create logos, videos, and even face swaps.</li>
<li><a href="https://infography.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Infography</a> will read your blog post and spin up an infographic from it.</li>
<li><a href="https://elevenlabs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElevenLabs</a> is a voice generator that adds voiceovers to ads, social media posts, and more.</li>
<li><a href="https://heyeddie.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eddie AI</a> transforms your raw interview videos into sleek and polished visual stories.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many legacy content marketing tools like Canva and Grammarly are also bolting on AI functionality. So, even if you don’t explicitly choose an AI solution, you may end up using AI in your existing workflows.</p>
<p><strong>How to prepare for this trend:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Start by identifying repetitive and time-consuming tasks, plus any new marketing avenue (like podcasts) you’d love to delve into but don’t have the time, and search for AI solutions to help.</li>
<li>Regularly read roundups of new AI tools.</li>
<li>Search the platforms you already use to see what AI functionality they’ve added.</li>
<li>Follow marketing AI and efficiency gurus like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/annabyang/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anna Burgess Yang</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/celiaquillian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celia Quillian</a>.</li>
</ul>

<div id="aeo-becomes-next-cm-focus"></div>
<h3>3. AEO becomes the next content marketing focus</h3>
<p>Answer engines are increasingly replacing traditional search engines as the tool of choice to find information online. As they proliferate in 2025, we’ll see answer engine optimization (AEO) added to many content marketers’ to-do lists.</p>
<p>Answer engines gained much traction as a replacement, or enhancement, of traditional search in 2024. Google expanded its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-overviews">AI Overviews</a>, which now appear in <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/study-google-ai-overviews-appear-in-47-of-search-results/535096/#:~:text=AI%20Overviews%20appear%20in%2047%25%20of%20Google%20searches%20and%20take,more%20likely%20to%20be%20cited." target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly half</a> of all searches. Platforms like Perplexity are becoming more popular (it has over <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/perplexity-ai-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15 million</a> users). And AI behemoth OpenAI launched its new web search platform, <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT search</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-perplexity.webp" alt="Content marketing trends - Perplexity result." width="681" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88033 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-perplexity.webp 681w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-perplexity-480x423.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 681px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Answer engines like Perplexity are becoming popular alternatives for people searching the internet.</em></p>
<p>In their early iterations, AI-powered results offered minimal citations to the content their answers were based on. That posed a huge problem for content marketers who need traffic from those results to justify creating new content. Answer engines responded, and now many highlight sources more prominently, as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-trends-2025">SEO</a> expert Lily Ray <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lily-ray-44755615_seo-activity-7269046589665538048-K70c?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently pointed out</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-lily-ray.webp" alt="Content marketing trends - LinkedIn post from Lily Ray" width="514" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88034 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-lily-ray.webp 514w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-lily-ray-480x560.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 514px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lily-ray-44755615_seo-activity-7269046589665538048-K70c?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>The expanded citations, like those in both Google AI Overviews and Perplexity answers, mean more chances to build brand awareness and traffic from answer engines. Content marketers are beginning to see the potential.</p>

<p>The migration to answer engines will likely accelerate in 2025. We’ll also see more experiments and data from marketers to teach us how to rank our content in AI answers. It’ll be essential to stay tuned to this new channel moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>How to prepare for this trend:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Include a concise answer to the main question in your content, similar to how you’d optimize for featured snippets.</li>
<li>Use natural, conversational language in your content.</li>
<li>Tighten up your structure (FAQs and schema markup especially).</li>
<li>If you have a physical location, get your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/01/business-directory-listings">business listings</a> in order since that’s where AI pulls local search replies.</li>
<li>Add trust signals like citing verified authors in your content.</li>

<h3>4. We’ll see the dawn of AI transparency</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-marketing-trends-2024">Last year</a>, we mentioned that you wouldn’t be required to label content created with AI as such. This year, consumer preference, federal and state laws, and voluntary action by big tech platforms will start to change that.</p>
<p>For the most part, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/most-consumers-dont-care-about-using-ai#:~:text=A%20report%20from%20Storyblok%20claims,during%20the%20busy%20festive%20period." target="_blank" rel="noopener">people don’t care</a> if you use AI to create content. But they really want you to tell them when you do. In two separate surveys, <a href="https://www.telusdigital.com/insights/ai-data/article/generative-ai-transparency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">71%</a> and <a href="https://www.bynder.com/en/blog/bynders-human-touch-survey-uncovers-consumers-opinions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">69%</a> of respondents said the use of AI should be disclosed. And a poll by the AI Policy Institute showed that <a href="https://nz.news.yahoo.com/80-percent-americans-think-presenting-100042782.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMUqxLsFl6ObVWeYbGRQs4HIT1_gn2V3jEvIg8lsBaFosbN-MtrPUZnA7R6JV_9b7tMl1kzU1Dcn4AB36B8jhATmV8gwfmvFUfytLhZDRWboebj_qKhWK66B4AwL7yYTAsqhIGEwJxO0MnJKS5IftAkC02p-9iIKykZSIOgXQZuy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80%</a> of Americans think passing off AI content as human-created should be illegal.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-AI-image.webp" alt="Content marketing trends - AI image generator." width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88036 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-AI-image.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-AI-image-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>AI images are a hot button, with </em><a href="https://newsroom.gettyimages.com/en/getty-images/nearly-90-of-consumers-want-transparency-on-ai-images-finds-getty-images-report#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20central%20findings,has%20been%20created%20using%20AI." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>87%</em></a><em> of consumers saying it’s important to use authentic images.</em></p>
<p>Officials at both the state and federal levels are addressing these concerns. New Hampshire passed <a href="https://www.akingump.com/en/insights/ai-law-and-regulation-tracker/new-hampshire-imposes-new-regulations-on-ai-and-criminalizes-deepfakes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI regulations</a> and criminalized deepfakes. Utah <a href="https://www.skadden.com/insights/publications/2024/04/utah-becomes-first-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added AI-centric consumer protections</a> to its legal code. And the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued an Executive Order</a> which, in part, addressed the labeling of “synthetic content produced by AI systems.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.journalismliberty.org/publications/platforms-labeling-ai-content#:~:text=In%20April%20and%20May%2C%20Meta,generated%20content%20on%20their%20platforms." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta and TikTok</a> joined the AI transparency movement by announcing that they’d voluntarily add AI content labeling systems to their platforms.</p>
<p>Most of these actions don’t implicitly force brands to call out which blogs or ebooks are AI-generated. Nor do they set any type of standard for what “AI-generated” means (what if you use Claude to generate a brief, an outline, or conduct research?).</p>
<p>However, it does show mounting pressure from multiple sources to be more transparent about your AI activities. It’s likely that pressure, and the sources that apply it, will increase in 2025. And brands that plan for it won’t be scrambling as it does.</p>
<p><strong>How to prepare for this trend:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Speak to your customers to get a feel for their AI tolerance.</li>
<li>Create an internal AI rulebook.</li>
<li>Ask freelancers and external contributors how they use AI.</li>
<li>Make a brand standard for what constitutes an “AI-generated” asset.</li>
<li>Consider adding watermarks, disclaimers, and an AI-use statement on your website.</li>
</ul>
<div id="forums-take-center-stage"></div>
<h3>5. Forums take center stage in 2025</h3>
<ol start="5"></ol>
<p>Online forums have long been the semi-secret weapon of the best content marketers. Google, along with an increased search for authenticity online, gave these digital gathering spaces a gigantic boost in 2024. This year, we’ll see more marketers jumping into forums to find a pipeline of new customers they couldn’t access before.</p>
<p>The biggest impetus for this trend was <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/august-2024-google-core-update">Google’s August core update</a>. The search engine’s algorithms placed forum content, especially Reddit, in top SERP spots. Reddit was catapulted to the <a href="https://www.webpronews.com/reddits-seo-surge-the-unintended-consequences-of-googles-august-2024-core-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third most visible website</a> in results pages, quadrupling the traffic it got from Google.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Google users started seeking out forum content to find answers from real people.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-reddit-1.webp" alt="Content marketing trends - Reddit post." width="846" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88037 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-reddit-1.webp 846w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-reddit-1-480x340.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 846px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1c1c9kj/google_on_why_it_shows_reddit_forum_threads_in/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>The forum trust extends to businesses. <a href="https://www.business.reddit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90%</a> of users say they trust Reddit to learn about products and brands. And 27% of Redditors are more likely to buy a product they see advertised on Reddit versus other platforms.</p>
<p>That level of loyalty and attention will attract more activity from marketers. Expect to see experts share how they’re gaining traction on Reddit.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-holben-1.webp" alt="Content marketing trends - LinkedIn post from Jim Holben" width="742" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88038 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-holben-1.webp 742w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-holben-1-480x388.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 742px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jim-holben_ai-marketing-activity-7278739696992616448-uWj7?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reddit-marketing">Marketing on forums</a> isn’t like promotions on other platforms. You will immediately get downvoted to oblivion if you go in all salesy. So, the question is, will marketers find a new funnel of leads from forums in 2025, or is it a siren song that ultimately leads to lost time and assets?</p>
<p><strong>How to prepare for this trend:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Figure out which segments of your audience spend time on forums and which discussion boards they frequent.</li>
<li>Spend time in each forum learning the rules, seeing how users connect, and watching how other brands interact.</li>
<li>Consider paid ads to speed up your results.</li>
<li>Set appropriate goals since getting results from forums may take longer than, say, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-ads">Google Ads</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="distribution-diversity-increases"></div>
<h3>6. The call for distribution diversity increases</h3>
<p>Google’s turbulent year shellshocked many content marketers who relied on SEO for site visits. Alphabet’s search engine behemoth is still one of the best sources of organic traffic, though. In 2025, brands will need to balance finding <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-marketing-pros-drive-traffic">novel distribution methods</a> for their content with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-tactics">feeding the Google algorithm</a>.</p>
<p>Two <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/august-2024-google-core-update">2024 core updates</a> throttled traffic to many websites. Some sites lost over <a href="https://searchengineland.com/review-site-google-traffic-affiliate-seo-content-440143" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90%</a> of their organic search visitors almost overnight. Then <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-overviews-breaking-search">AI Overviews</a> popped up, pushing our links down the SERP and further threatening our traffic. Most recently, a potential <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-chrome-sale">court-ordered Google breakup</a> shook an already wobbly search industry.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-march-headline.webp" alt="Content marketing trends - Reddit headline about March core update." width="729" height="188" class="aligncenter wp-image-88039 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-march-headline.webp 729w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-march-headline-480x124.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 729px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1b8se0w/massive_hit_in_traffic_due_to_march_2024_update/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Headlines like these</em></a><em> were common in the months following Google’s March and August core updates.</em></p>
<p>For many, it felt like the final nail in SEO’s coffin. But as the dust cleared and more data rolled in, it became clear that Google is still the channel for organic traffic.</p>
<p>Consider a couple of data reviews from Rand Fishkin at SparkToro. One noted how efficient Google is at distributing traffic to other websites. The search engine is responsible for sending<a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/where-web-users-spend-time-vs-where-traffic-referrals-originate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 60%</a> of all referral traffic while only receiving 9% of the incoming clicks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-referral.webp" alt="Content marketing trends - referral traffic graph." width="882" height="520" class="aligncenter wp-image-88040 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-referral.webp 882w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-referral-480x283.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 882px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/where-web-users-spend-time-vs-where-traffic-referrals-originate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Another Sparktoro study showed that <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/new-research-we-analyzed-332-million-queries-over-21-months-to-uncover-never-before-published-data-on-how-people-use-google/#demand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">51%</a> of searches have an informational intent while nearly 56% are generic (non-branded). That leaves a lot of traffic out there for brands willing to educate their audience through SEO content.</p>
<p>Herein lies the 2025 reality for content marketers. You need to buffer traffic acquisition against Google’s volatility, but you don’t want to ignore the largest source of organic traffic available.</p>
<p>That’s why, in 2025, we’ll see brands get crazy creative with how they produce and distribute content.<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-repurposing"> Content repurposing</a>, which was a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-marketing-trends-2024"> trend in 2024</a>, will become even more important. This year, internal brand ambassadors, external content distribution networks, and AI-enabled content repurposing will be standard practice for more brands.</p>
<p><strong>How to prepare for this trend: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create content with a “distribution-first” mindset so every piece can have as many lives as possible.</li>
<li>Consider adding AI tools that help you pull insights from interviews, webinars, and long-form blog posts to turn into <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-trends-2025">social media ads,</a> captions, and other short-form content.</li>
<li>Start building a network of both internal and external influencers who can offer quotes for content (which Google loves) and then share it with their followers.</li>
<li>Review your existing library of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-content-beginners-guide">SEO content</a> to see if any of it can be updated quickly and used in other channels.</li>
</ul>
<div id="ai-education-becomes-critical"></div>
<h3>7. In 2025, AI education becomes mission-critical</h3>
<p>There’s a huge chasm between the rate at which brands are adopting AI tools and the comfort level the average marketer has using them. In 2025, we’ll see content team leaders create more organized AI education while freelancers and individual contributors find ways to learn on their own.</p>
<p>Last year, we mentioned that 2024 would be a year of intentional AI adoption for content marketing teams. While that was true (In January of 2024, <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/ai-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">56%</a> of marketers said their companies were implementing AI, primarily for content marketing), education didn’t keep up. 70% of marketers said their employers don’t provide generative AI training—even though over half said it&#8217;s important for their role. 43% said they don’t know how to get the most value out of generative AI.</p>
<p>With so many new tools and use cases developing, the learning curve will only get steeper for content marketers.</p>

<p>That’s why 2025 is a critical year for content marketers to get up to speed. Expect a lot more “learning in public” AI experiments, internal AI training regiments, and freelancers trading tips on using AI in their workflows.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-ai-experiment.webp" alt="Content marketing trends - LinkedIn post from Scott Tousley." width="587" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88042 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-ai-experiment.webp 587w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/content-marketing-trends-wordstream-ai-experiment-480x491.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 587px, 100vw" /></p>

<p><strong>How to prepare for this trend:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a formal AI education program and use guidelines for internal employees.</li>
<li>Encourage experiments and share learning externally (that’s great engagement content).</li>
<li>Consider signing up for free trials of new AI tools and allocating time for your team to use and review them.</li>
<li>Individual contributors and freelancers should set aside recurring time blocks for AI learning.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stay current on content marketing trends</h2>
<p>Content marketing is a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-differentiate-content">different game now</a>, and 2025 is the year we learn what it will look like for the next decade. There’s no resting on what worked in 2015. You’ll need to get intentional about education and tracking trends to stay on top. Marketers who carve out time for learning, experimenting, and following other experts will be in a position to pivot, no matter what 2025 throws our way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Creating content without a plan is like throwing darts blindfolded—occasionally, you might hit the target, but most of the time, you’re just flinging ideas into the void (or throwing darts at people…).</p>
<p>In this article, I’m going to help you build out a content plan so that every piece of content serves a purpose and you hit the bullseye with your marketing goals. And we’ll finish it off with a content plan template to tie it all together.</p>

<h2>What is a content plan?</h2>
<p>A content plan is a tactical outline of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/better-content-performance">specific content</a> you need to create as it pertains to your business goals and resources. It includes the types of content, the creation and distribution process, and any key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure success.</p>
<p>So you may be wondering, what’s the difference between a content plan, content strategy, and content calendar?</p>
<p>While a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/13/content-marketing-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content strategy</a> is a high-level approach that defines the <em>why</em> of your content and the brand voice behind it, a content plan covers the <em>what</em>, <em>when</em>, and <em>how</em>, based on that strategy. It focuses on topics, formats, and deadlines—the tactical stuff. Then, your content calendar visually maps out when and where the content will be published.</p>

<h2>Why do you need a content plan?</h2>
<p>Marketing without a content plan is like going on a road trip without a map (AKA your smartphone). Whether you reach your destination is hit or miss and you’re going to waste a lot of gas. A content plan keeps your efforts organized and intentional. It also ensures:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business goal alignment.</strong> A content plan helps ensure that every piece of content <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/09/04/content-marketing-goal-alignment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contributes to your overall objectives</a>, such as lead generation, brand awareness, or customer retention.</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency and consistency. </strong>It allows you to allocate resources (budget, staff, tools) properly, keep your team organized and on schedule, and maintain consistent messaging.</li>
<li><strong>Maximized impact.</strong> Defining your audience ensures your content resonates best, and strategic planning gets content in front of the right people at the right time.</li>
</ul>
<div id="how-to-create-a-content-plan"></div>
<h2>How to create a content plan</h2>
<p>I’ve broken down content planning into six key steps. Let’s take a look:</p>
<h3>1. Start with the big picture</h3>
<p>To create a content plan, you first need to lay down your foundation. This includes your goals and target audience.</p>
<p><strong>Goals:</strong> Make sure you have clear content marketing goals aligned with business objectives. For example, maybe you want to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase organic traffic</a>, generate leads, or increase customer retention. For help with this, check out our posts on <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-plan-goals-objectives-for-small-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing goals</a> and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/long-term-business-goals-with-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-term business goals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Target audience: </strong>This one is huge. I don&#8217;t necessarily mean the audience itself, either, but the importance of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knowing your target audience</a>. You need to know who you want to reach with your content. Note also that your target audience with your content isn’t just your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/23/buyer-personas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buyer personas</a>. It includes them, but it also includes complementary businesses and influencers who will amplify your content.</p>
<p>For help finding your target audience, here are <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/target-audience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 questions to ask</a> as well as some <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/target-market-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">target market examples</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Conduct a content audit</h3>
<p>Once you’ve gotten yourself oriented with step one, it’s time to take an inventory of your existing content to gather information, find gaps, and identify opportunities. The level of effort required for this step will vary depending on how long you’ve been in your role and how much content your business has produced. Luckily for you, I’ve got a thorough walk-through of how to do a content audit that will cover any scenario. You can find it here, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/10/content-audit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Run a Content Audit: Full Guide + Free Templates</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/content-plan-audit-example.webp" alt="content marketing plan - content audit template screenshot" width="858" height="444" class="aligncenter wp-image-87908 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/content-plan-audit-example.webp 858w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/content-plan-audit-example-480x248.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 858px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you don’t have much content to begin with, it may be worth doing a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/competitive-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">competitive analysis </a>or even looking at some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/18/content-marketing-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content marketing examples</a> just to get acquainted.</p>
<h3>3. Establish your key themes</h3>
<p>These are not your topics. That comes later in the tactical section. What I’m talking about here are the core pillars you want to be covering every month. A good way to do this is to take a look at the categories that exist on your blog. Consolidate them into about 5-7 core pillars. These core pillars need to address all four of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/27/brand-messaging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand voice</a> and core values</li>
<li>Stages of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/01/content-marketing-funnel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content marketing funnel</a></li>
<li>Your specific offerings</li>
<li>Your reader personas</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these pillars will not map 1:1 to your blog categories, nor should they. You should have more categories than pillars.</p>
<h3>4. Outline the process</h3>
<p>Now it’s time to get tactical. As I said above, your content plan covers the what and how of your content strategy. Here are the two key elements:</p>
<p><strong>Topic selection:</strong> Map out how you will come up with topics and titles. This should include a combination of strategies, including<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> keyword research</a>, current events, creative <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/03/brainstorming-techniques" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brainstorming</a>, social listening, competitive analysis, content performance analysis, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/03/repurposing-content">repurposing</a> content.

</ul>
<p><strong>Production:</strong> It’s important to have a standardized process for actually creating the content. This includes writing, editing, and approving, as well as who is in charge of what and how long each piece will take. This may vary depending on the type of content (a blog post vs an ebook or webinar, for example). Check out the resources below for more help with the production aspect of your content plan.</p>

<h3>5. Plan out the distribution</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve outlined your content themes and process, it’s time to figure out how and where your content will be distributed. This means two things:</p>
<p><strong>Channels</strong>: Popular marketing channels include your website, blog, social media, email, partners, and influencers. The best ones for your business depend on where your audience spends most of its time and how much bandwidth you have. It’s important to diversify and tailor your content to each channel while maintaining your brand voice—like using visuals for Instagram, thought leadership posts for LinkedIn, or short, engaging videos for TikTok.</p>
<p>Some more resources to help you out here include:</p>

<li><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/brand-consistency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reasons Why Brand Consistency Matters (+Ways To Build It)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Most Popular Social Media</a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Pl</a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">atforms</a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 2025</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Frequency</strong>: How often you will publish content on each of your chosen channels? How often will you publish certain types of content? For example, you may do monthly webinars and ebooks, weekly blog posts, and daily social media posts. Your content frequency should align with your overall marketing goals and the resources you have available. A content calendar will be critical here to help you stay consistent and organized.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/marketing-channel-mix-wordstream-1024x791.webp" alt="marketing channel mix" width="1024" height="791" class="aligncenter wp-image-85428 size-large" /></p>
<h3>6. Track and measure</h3>
<p>This final step ensures that all your hard work is paying off and that you’re continually optimizing your content strategy for better results. What I mean by track and measure is:</p>
<p><strong>Have a content library</strong>: This should be a spreadsheet that lists all your content assets, with tabs for different content types, such as blogs, ebooks, webinars, case studies, and videos.</p>
<p>Be sure to include relevant details like the last modified date, target audience, and product it supports. You don’t need to include performance metrics here. The idea is to keep everything organized so that others can access the content and you can easily repurpose and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/03/get-more-traffic-from-evergreen-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update content</a> in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Measure performance</strong>: Define the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-measure-brand-awareness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">key metrics</a> that will determine the success of your content. These can include metrics such as website traffic, social media engagement, conversion rates, lead generation, and time spent on the page. Be sure to establish a regular cadence for reporting on these metrics, depending on your goals and the volume of content you produce. Some should be reported on weekly, others monthly, and others quarterly.</p>
<p>Some resources to help you out here include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/social-media-metrics/">Essential Social Media Metrics to Track (+How to Do It)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-metrics/">Key Need-to-Know Marketing Metrics for Every Strategy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/17/content-marketing-kpis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Content Marketing KPIs To Track (+Infographic)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the data you collect, make it a habit to review and adjust your content plan regularly. If a particular type of content is underperforming, brainstorm ways to improve or test new formats. And on the flip side, if something is working well, think about how you can double down on that strategy.</p>

<h3>Wrapping up the year</h3>
<p>For a more reflective vibe, share some sort of “year in review” about your business. Add in a big thank you to your customers while you’re at it.</p>
<p>Here’s how a local non-profit did it in their <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/december-email-subject-lines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December email</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/winter-content-ideas-wordstream-raptor-center.webp" alt="winter content ideas - Year wrap up email." width="415" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87173 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/winter-content-ideas-wordstream-raptor-center.webp 415w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/winter-content-ideas-wordstream-raptor-center-208x300.webp 208w" sizes="(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px" /></p>

<p>You can even do this with things you’ve created. This podcast shared the best episodes of the year in its recap.</p>

<p>Now, go crazy with the themes here. Start with a few of these and let your imagination run wild:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share a ranked list of the best travel destinations for the past year (make it a theme that matches what you sell, like “best destinations for yoga”).</li>
<li>Rank the best new products in your industry.</li>
<li>Create a Spotify playlist of the “best” songs of the year.</li>
<li><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-do-a-poll-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Post a poll</a> where your followers vote on the best (new restaurant, cutest dog picture, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<h2>December content ideas</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/05/december-marketing-ideas">December</a> is absolutely frantic on just about every marketing channel. You’ll need to bring your “A” game to your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/holiday-email-templates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holiday emails</a>, your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/december-social-media-holidays-and-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December social media posts</a>, and all of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/17/holiday-marketing-ideas">marketing this month</a>.</p>
<h3>World Wildlife Conservation Day (December 4)</h3>
<p>Not everything has to be holiday-themed in December. Content not about presents, parties, and the North Pole will stand out in a sea of season&#8217;s greetings.</p>
<p>With that in mind, consider showing a little love for World Wildlife Conservation Day. Of course, it makes sense for a zoo to participate.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/winter-content-ideas-wordstream-wildlife-day.webp" alt="winter content ideas - World Wildlife Day social post." width="345" height="586" class="aligncenter wp-image-87178 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/winter-content-ideas-wordstream-wildlife-day.webp 345w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/winter-content-ideas-wordstream-wildlife-day-177x300.webp 177w" sizes="(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px" /></p>
<p>But any brand can share the message of conservation and protecting animals. Try posting some cute animal pics or just pointing people to where they can help the cause.</p>
<h3>Christmas (December 25)</h3>
<p>Anything to do with Christmas will be especially competitive. The key to success is trying a few different types of Christmas content to see which rises above the holiday din.</p>
<p>See how this headspace addressed the burnout many people feel when things get really busy this time of year?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/winter-content-ideas-wordstream-headspace.webp" alt="winter content ideas - tips for avoiding holiday burnout." width="490" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87179 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/winter-content-ideas-wordstream-headspace.webp 490w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/winter-content-ideas-wordstream-headspace-480x588.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 490px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>That’s a great option because the message is on-brand for the business. Plus, it’s a popular and important topic.</p>
<p>Think about the questions your followers will have leading up to Christmas, and create content that answers them. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a mini manual of Christmas gift-giving games.</li>
<li>Curate the funniest holiday content you can find for your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/christmas-social-media-posts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christmas social media posts</a>.</li>
<li>Share a bunch of ideas for handmade gifts.</li>
<li>Publish a gift guide for your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a> (like a gift guide for yogis if you run a yoga studio).</li>
<li>Write a guide to Christmas on a budget with meal, gift, and decoration ideas.</li>
<li>Post some ideas for decorating an office or professional space with images of great examples.</li>
</ul>
<h3>More December content ideas</h3>
<p>Use these holidays and themes to fill in the gaps in your December content calendar:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rosa Parks Day (December 1)</li>
<li>National Apple Pie Day (December 3)</li>
<li>Free Shipping Day (December 14)</li>
<li>National Cupcake Day (December 15)</li>

<li>Hanukkah (changes annually; December 25, 2024-January 2, 2025)</li>
<li>Boxing Day (December 26)</li>
<li>Bacon Day (December 30)</li>
</ul>
<div id="january-content-ideas"></div>
<h2>January content ideas</h2>
<p>January comes in with a bang but tends to calm down for most people after the first week. Make your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/january-social-media-holidays-and-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January content</a> follow that flow from revelry to relevance. Since we covered New Year’s earlier, we’ll focus on some other key moments in the month.</p>
<h3>Martin Luther King Jr. Day (third Monday in January)</h3>
<p>Few people have had a greater impact on more people than Martin Luther King Jr. Set aside some of your content during that week to celebrate his contributions and spread his message.</p>
<p>Dr. King was an amazing orator and thinker, so a popular way to commemorate the day is by sharing one of his many memorable quotes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/winter-content-ideas-wordstream-mlk.webp" alt="winter content ideas - social post with MLK quote." width="410" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87180 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/winter-content-ideas-wordstream-mlk.webp 410w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/winter-content-ideas-wordstream-mlk-205x300.webp 205w" sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px" /></p>
<p>There are other ways to take part, just do not be salesy. Here are some more options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a blog post listing 10 lesser-known facts about Dr. King and the work he did.</li>
<li>Share biographies and sources people can access to learn more in one of your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/january-email-subject-lines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January emails</a>.</li>
<li>Simply ask people to take a minute and reflect on Dr. King’s message and what it means to them.</li>
<li>Sit it out (let your followers know the day before that you’ll observe a day of silence).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Get to Know Your Customers Day (third Thursday in Q1)</h3>
<p>This is a great time to learn a little about the people who support your business—especially if it’s a slower time of year.</p>
<p>Try sending a short survey to your email subscribers. Ask them about favorite pastimes, travel plans, product feature preferences, or anything that will help you serve them better.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/winter-content-ideas-wordstream-customer-day.webp" alt="winter content ideas - customer survey" width="420" height="598" class="aligncenter wp-image-87181 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/winter-content-ideas-wordstream-customer-day.webp 420w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/winter-content-ideas-wordstream-customer-day-211x300.webp 211w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.hustlermarketing.com/blog/5-examples-of-get-to-know-your-customers-day-emails-to-collect-data-and-increase-brand-loyalty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Notice the brand offers an attractive discount in exchange for taking the survey. That’ll help boost participation and build more affinity for your brand.</p>
<p>How else can you take part? Try these ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run a poll on Facebook or Instagram with a simple “this or that” question.</li>
<li>Pick a theme and ask people to share a story about it (funny food fails, etc.).</li>
<li>Have people share pics of their pets or travels with a little blurb about them, then add what they send into upcoming emails.</li>
</ul>
<h3>More January holidays and content ideas</h3>

<h2>February content ideas</h2>
<p>Sometimes, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/01/11/february-marketing-ideas">February marketing</a> feels a little like a slog. It&#8217;s the tail end of winter and many people are tired of the cold. It&#8217;s far enough away from the holidays that that magic has worn off.</p>
<p>But February does have Valentine&#8217;s Day. And it&#8217;s when people start to think about spring. These February content ideas tap into those themes and several other good reasons to reach out to your customers.</p>
<h3>World Pizza Day (February 9)</h3>
<p>World Pizza Day and National Pizza Day are both celebrated on February 9. Get a slice of the attention with a blog post full of fun facts and recipes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/winter-content-ideas-wordstream-pizza-day.webp" alt="winter content ideas - Pizza day post from 7 / 11" width="411" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87182 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/winter-content-ideas-wordstream-pizza-day.webp 411w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/winter-content-ideas-wordstream-pizza-day-206x300.webp 206w" sizes="(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px" /></p>

<li>Heat up the conversation by asking which style of pizza is the best.</li>
<li>Share “staff picks” for the best pizza places around.</li>
<li>Post instructions for a “build your own pizza party.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Valentine’s Day (February 14)</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/valentines-day-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valentine’s Day</a> is a content creator’s dream.

<p>Take this one from the Steppenwolf Theater, for example. It’s a list of romantic comedies featuring actors in the theater’s ensemble.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/winter-content-ideas-wordstream-rom-com-list.webp" alt="winter content ideas - list of rom-com movies." width="362" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87183 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/winter-content-ideas-wordstream-rom-com-list.webp 362w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/winter-content-ideas-wordstream-rom-com-list-181x300.webp 181w" sizes="(max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px" /></p>
<p>You may not have employees with leading roles in feature films. But you can create a checklist of rom-coms for your followers to view. While you’re at it, use a few of these other Valentine’s Day content ideas to sweeten up your followers&#8217; day:</p>

<h2>November holiday content ideas</h2>
<p>Of course, Thanksgiving is the big holiday this month, and we have plenty of turkey-day-themed content ideas for it. But there are other very important topics to tackle, too.</p>
<h3>Veterans Day (November 11)</h3>
<p>Veterans Day is when a grateful nation shows appreciation for the people who’ve served in the US military. Millions of men and women gave their time, talents, and often much more, so whatever content you post should focus on sincere appreciation for their sacrifice.</p>
<p>A simple, understated appreciation <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/10/facebook-post-ideas">social media post</a> with a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/veterans-day-greetings">Veterans Day greeting is</a> a great option.

<h3>Pre-December holiday content</h3>
<p>It’s pretty common for people to start holiday shopping in early November and decorate by the end of the month. It makes sense to dedicate a little November content to helping them prep for Christmas, Hanukkah, etc.</p>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-create-a-holiday-gift-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gift guides</a> are a valuable commodity this time of year as shoppers scurry to secure the ideal present for everyone on their list. British Airways’ email is just the ticket for its subscribers. It showcased a range of gift ideas for every budget.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/November-content-ideas-wordstream-gift-guide.webp" alt="November content ideas - Gift guide blog post." width="322" height="570" class="aligncenter wp-image-86236 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/November-content-ideas-wordstream-gift-guide.webp 322w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/November-content-ideas-wordstream-gift-guide-169x300.webp 169w" sizes="(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px" /></p>
<p>You can tailor your gift guide to your followers. If you run a chiropractic office that caters to weekend warrior athletes, then curate a list of presents they can give their active friends.</p>
<p>There are several ways you can take your November content to help people prep for the Holidays. Try a few of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you go big on decorating your office or shop? Show it off in an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/22/instagram-reels-ideas-for-businesses">Instagram Reel</a> to inspire others.</li>
<li>Offer some travel planning tips in an email (try these catchy <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/november-email-subject-lines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November subject lines</a> to get more people reading).</li>
<li>Ask your employees to share their favorite holiday party snacks and link out to recipes.</li>
<li>Curate a list of local holiday happenings like parades, Santa visits, and craft fairs, then present them in a simple <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/01/13/infographic-templates">infographic</a>.</li>
<li>Partner with local non-profits to share their volunteer opportunities, repost their content, tag them in new posts, and try a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/11/how-to-stitch-on-tiktok">TikTok stitch</a> or duet to get exposure to their audience).</li>
<li>Remind people that November 10-16 is National Santa Letter Week!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pop culture and food November content ideas</h2>
<p>Gratitude is a big theme in November, and several days are set aside to show appreciation for some of our favorite foods and cultural events. Join in the fun with your November content and endear your brand to people who love these things, too.</p>
<h3>Peanut Butter Lovers Month</h3>
<p>From the classic PB&amp;J to the iconic Reese’s Cup, peanut butter is the mortar of many amazing food combos. You can bet anything you post about it will attract lots of attention.</p>
<p>Recipes are a good go-to here. But don’t forget that doggos love peanut butter, too (and it’s safe for them to eat!). This veterinary clinic offered up a tasty treat recipe for our four-legged friends.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/November-content-ideas-wordstream-peanut-butter.webp" alt="November content ideas - dog treat recipe post." width="366" height="583" class="aligncenter wp-image-86237 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/November-content-ideas-wordstream-peanut-butter.webp 366w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/November-content-ideas-wordstream-peanut-butter-188x300.webp 188w" sizes="(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px" /></p>
<p>What else can you say about this creamy concoction? Try:</p>
<ul>
<li>A blog post about the history of peanut butter.</li>
<li>Amazing peanut butter facts (it takes about 540 peanuts to make one jar of peanut butter) in an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/01/instagram-story-ideas">Instagram Story</a>.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-run-a-facebook-giveaway-or-contest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook contest</a> or <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-do-an-instagram-giveaway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram giveaway</a> to have your followers guess the number of peanuts in a large container.</li>
<li>A request for followers to share their favorite peanut butter recipes and tag your account.</li>
</ul>
<h3>National Donut Day (November 5)</h3>
<p>Donuts are so well-loved that they get two days each year: National Donut Day is celebrated on June 6 and November 5. That’s understandable since donuts bring so much joy to the world.</p>
<p>This parent-focused magazine posted all the donut deals for its readers in one eye-catching image.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/November-content-ideas-wordstream-donut.webp" alt="November content ideas - Graphic of donut deals." width="403" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-86238 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/November-content-ideas-wordstream-donut.webp 403w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/November-content-ideas-wordstream-donut-202x300.webp 202w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" /></p>
<p>Donut leave a hole in your November content calendar. Use these ideas to put some sprinkles on your marketing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a March Madness-style bracket of the best donut shops around town and let people vote on their favorites.</li>
<li>Find the funkiest donut creations (like the bacon-wrapped maple donut) and share them in a social media post.</li>
<li>Write up a blog post or email describing wild and wonderful donut-themed events like the donut mile (contestants eat a dozen donuts while running a mile).</li>
<li>Host a donut-eating contest or free donut giveaway at your location. Film the event, post it to YouTube, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-youtube-channel">promote it</a> with clips on social media.</li>
</ul>
<h3>World Kindness Day (November 13)</h3>
<p>We could all use a little more kindness, and November 13th is the perfect day to show it.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that a brand called Kind Snacks got in on the World Kindness Day action. Their team used the opportunity to volunteer, and the brand shared their good works in a quick video.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/November-content-ideas-wordstream-kindness.webp" alt="November content ideas - World Kindness Day post." width="336" height="579" class="aligncenter wp-image-86239 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/November-content-ideas-wordstream-kindness.webp 336w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/November-content-ideas-wordstream-kindness-174x300.webp 174w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" /></p>
<p>If a full day of volunteering isn’t in the cards, try one of these other fun ways to spread some kindness in November:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish a list of little acts of kindness your followers can do throughout the day (think: call a relative, let someone pass on your commute, pay for someone’s order at the drive-through).</li>
<li>Ask your team or followers to share an act of kindness that meant a lot to them (a double whammy of kindness and gratitude!).</li>
<li>Create a custom hashtag like #RandomActsOfKindness to help kickstart a mini-movement of helpful deeds (learn <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">how to use hashtags</a> and get lots more ideas).</li>
<li>Add encouraging notes to products you ship out in emails to your customers and personalize them, if possible.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Social awareness November content ideas</h2>
<p>November is the start of a tough time for many people. This month, try dedicating some of your content to helping people feel seen, become more aware, and get healthy.</p>
<h3>Native American Heritage Month</h3>
<p>This month, we celebrate the considerable contributions of Native Americans and raise awareness of their unique challenges.</p>
<p>Here’s a very cool way one organization participated. The group&#8217;s Instagram post featured a map showing important Native American locations.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/November-content-ideas-wordstream-native.webp" alt="November content ideas - map of native American settlements." width="372" height="587" class="aligncenter wp-image-86240 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/November-content-ideas-wordstream-native.webp 372w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/November-content-ideas-wordstream-native-190x300.webp 190w" sizes="(max-width: 372px) 100vw, 372px" /></p>
<p>It’s a wonderful way to remember the people who originally inhabited North America. Not a history major with a background in cartography? No problem. Here are several other ways you can give Native American Heritage Month the attention it deserves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage your followers to donate and support causes that improve the lives of Native Americans.</li>
<li>Share images of artwork, book titles, songs, and other Native American cultural creations.</li>
<li>List Native American-owned businesses with links in your monthly email.</li>
<li>Host members of a local tribe on a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/27/youtube-live">YouTube Live</a> event.</li>
<li>Post a weekly series of stories highlighting different facets of Native American History.</li>
</ul>
<h3>No-Shave November</h3>
<p>No-Shave November is a fun way to tackle a very serious topic. The idea is to forgo haircuts and shaving, then donate the dollars you would have spent on grooming to fight cancer.</p>
<p>The movement has gained considerable momentum. The hashtag #noshavenovember has over 1.1 million posts on Instagram alone. Many of them are by businesses challenging their employees to go shaveless for a month to raise awareness and money for the cause.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/November-content-ideas-wordstream-no-shave.webp" alt="November content ideas - Brand post about No-Shave November." width="363" height="580" class="aligncenter wp-image-86242 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/November-content-ideas-wordstream-no-shave.webp 363w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/November-content-ideas-wordstream-no-shave-188x300.webp 188w" sizes="(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px" /></p>
<p>That’s not all brands are doing, though. Here are a few more ways you can get in the cancer fight this month:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a No-Shave November anti-grooming contest and give prizes to the best new beard.</li>
<li>Adopt a non-profit like the American Cancer Fund, share its posts, talk about what it does, and challenge followers to donate.</li>
<li>Have a mustache day at the office where employees sport hilarious fake facial hair, capture video, and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promote it on Instagram</a>.</li>
<li>Combine your No-Shave November content with other causes like Movember and National Cancer Awareness Day (November 7) for a bigger impact.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Take a Hike Day (November 17)</h3>
<p>Hiking delivers a ton of mental and physical benefits. On November 17, you can help your followers find their footing in this healthy activity.</p>
<p>This post reminds us that hiking is better with friends, especially those of the four-footed variety.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/November-content-ideas-wordstream-hike.webp" alt="November content ideas - Post with picture of a dog on a hiking trail." width="420" height="594" class="aligncenter wp-image-86243 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/November-content-ideas-wordstream-hike.webp 420w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/November-content-ideas-wordstream-hike-212x300.webp 212w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" /></p>
<p>Throw in some tips and favorite gear (like a pup pack your dog can carry) to make this content really helpful. Here’s a pack full of other ideas to help people hit the trail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a map of local trails. Include their lengths, difficulties, and the parking and bathroom situations.</li>
<li>Have a “Miles for Smiles” contest where people post a picture and a screenshot from each hike they take in November. Then, give discounts or prizes for things like the most miles hiked, the best photos, etc.</li>
<li>Hiking is hungry work. Share some favorite hiking snacks and encourage followers to comment with their own.</li>
<li>Partner with a local yoga studio, chiropractic office, or sports doctor and have them give healthy hiking tips like how to stretch after a long trek.</li>
</ul>
<h3>More November content ideas for social awareness causes</h3>
<p>Get people talking about these important causes in November:</p>

<div id="even-more-november-content-ideas"></div>
<h2>Even more November content ideas</h2>
<p>There are so many creative ways to connect with your customers and followers in November that we had to create another category to catch them all.</p>
<h3>Create holiday playlists</h3>
<p>The season is full of reasons for great music. From office parties and family dinners to power shopping for the perfect gift, the right tunes make them all better.</p>
<p>Duolingo didn’t miss a beat when it created a playlist of Holiday songs from around the world.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/November-content-ideas-wordstream-playlist.webp" alt="November content ideas - Spotify playlist from Duolingo." width="374" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-86244 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/November-content-ideas-wordstream-playlist.webp 374w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/November-content-ideas-wordstream-playlist-187x300.webp 187w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px" /></p>
<p>It’s easy to do the same for your business. Or you can simply share the list on social media or in your newsletter.</p>
<p>Try matching the melodies to specific events and explain why you chose them. For example, calming mood music would be ideal for the “Navigating the Mall parking lot” playlist.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Content marketing is a machine that needs a constant input of new content to get a linear output of views, visits, and leads. It’s hard to scale results without an equal amount of work.</p>
<p>That is unless you reuse elements from one piece of content to create dozens of new assets you share across many channels.</p>
<p>That’s precisely the type of content repurposing our panel of marketing experts shared with me for this guide. They showed how to turn a single blog post, case study, or brief interview into dozens of assets that generate months’ worth of awareness and conversions.</p>
<p>Even better, they gave real-world examples so we can all step off the content marketing treadmill and get more out of every piece of content.</p>

<h2>What is content repurposing?</h2>
<p>In case you’re new to the concept, content repurposing involves taking elements from an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/better-content-performance">existing piece of content</a> and using them to create new assets for other channels.</p>
<p>For example, I may take a few of the experts’ quotes below, add them to carousel slides, and publish them on LinkedIn. I could also have recorded the interviews and published snippets of the conversations to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-threads">Instagram Threads</a> or Reels.</p>
<p>There are three main benefits to repurposing content:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Save time:</strong> Create several assets quickly from one root piece of content.</li>
<li><strong>Scale ideation:</strong> Fill your marketing calendar without having to come up with a new idea for every post (which is often the hardest part of content marketing).</li>
<li><strong>Increase footprint:</strong> One root piece of content can find an audience on multiple channels when you repurpose it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Content repurposing acts like a lever, allowing one piece of content to do a lot more of the heavy lifting in your marketing strategy.</p>

<h2>8 expert content repurposing examples</h2>
<p>Most of us are familiar with repurposing a blog article into a few social media posts. The ideas our group of marketing pros shared go way beyond that. They explain how to amplify the effect of a single piece of content in a dozen ways, including how to get other people to do it for you (for free!).<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/all-star-playbook?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_AllStarPlaybook_Download"></a></p>

<h3>1. Use unpaid channels for unlimited ROI</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/03/repurposing-content#:~:text=Repurposing%20content%20(aka%20finding%20new,Some%20choose%20podcasts%20over%20ebooks.">content repurposing</a> calculus is pretty simple: get the greatest reach from the fewest resources. That’s how you scale marketing while <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/06/small-marketing-budget">staying on budget</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brittanyjwren/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brittany Wren</a>, Chief Wordsmith at <a href="http://www.stingraywriting.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stingray Writing</a>, nailed that equation by turning a single 30-minute interview into a ton of no-cost engagement, earned PR placements, and countless impressions.</p>
<p>“This example comes from one of my nonprofit clients, Lincoln Literacy, which offers free English language and job-related classes to adults in Lincoln, Nebraska,” Brittany explained. “Nonprofits don’t always have huge budgets, but with a little creativity, you can make a big impact by repurposing a few ideas on unpaid channels.”</p>
<p>To do it, Brittany used excerpts from an interview with the nonprofit’s executive director to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pitch and place a feature article in the Lincoln Journal Star and another in 55+ Magazine.</li>
<li>Write email newsletter content.</li>
<li>Create several social media posts that generated thousands of impressions and an 8.43% engagement rate.</li>
<li>Land two guest spots for the executive on two radio programs (Nebraska Public Media and KLIN&#8217;s The Dan Parsons Show).</li>
<li>Include a quote in the non-profit’s annual report.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Brittney Wren turned a single 45-minute executive interview into countless free impressions.</em></p>
<p>There’s a lot to learn from what Brittany accomplished here. One standout takeaway for me is to open your mind to all the places you can repurpose a great idea. Using quotes in an annual report is such a smart way to get a little extra payback from a root piece of content.</p>

<h3>2. Lead with the concept, not the content</h3>
<p>When a recent court ruling shook up the healthcare marketing industry, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markrogers88/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Rogers</a>, Director of Content Marketing at <a href="https://www.freshpaint.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freshpaint</a>, could have simply <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post">written a blog post</a> describing the fallout. Instead, the Freshpaint team invited a healthcare lawyer to join them on a webinar—then turned that talk into several assets to help their audience understand the repercussions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-repurposing-wordstream-freshpaint-webinar-signup.webp" alt="Content repurposing - Freshpaint webinar signup." width="726" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-85835 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-repurposing-wordstream-freshpaint-webinar-signup.webp 726w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-repurposing-wordstream-freshpaint-webinar-signup-480x397.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 726px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://info.freshpaint.io/what-the-aha-lawsuit-ruling-means" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>A blog post is fairly easy to publish; an expert-led webinar takes more effort. But for Mark, successful repurposing is built on thoughts worth sharing.</p>
<p>“Here&#8217;s a fundamental truth of content repurposing: it <em>has</em> to start with a great idea that is turned into a great piece of content,” he said.</p>
<p>The concepts shared during the webinar became the seeds of several new pieces of content. First up was a series of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/01/09/social-media-marketing-strategies">social media</a> posts that featured spliced portions of the video.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-repurposing-wordstream-freshpaint-linkedin.webp" alt="Content repurposing - Freshpaint LinkedIn post." width="640" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-85871 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-repurposing-wordstream-freshpaint-linkedin.webp 640w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-repurposing-wordstream-freshpaint-linkedin-480x450.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 640px, 100vw" /></p>

<p>Mark also wrote a <a href="https://www.freshpaint.io/blog/what-the-aha-lawsuit-ruling-means-for-the-future-of-privacy-in-healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q&amp;A-style blog post</a> with embedded video clips. This is a brilliant way to present information in multiple formats so people can consume it however they like. It’s also a great way to grab some incidental <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO</a> benefits.</p>
<p>Finally, Mark used the webinar transcript as the basis for several more <a href="https://www.freshpaint.io/blog/how-state-level-privacy-laws-impact-health-data-in-the-u-s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog posts</a>, which relieved him of a lot of content-ideation burden.</p>
<p>Slicing up long-form videos for short-form platforms is an efficient use of time. So is using one big asset to guide several blog posts. But Mark said that what you share is always more important than how you share it. “If you take an average SEO blog post, repurposing it won&#8217;t get you very far.”</p>

<h3>3. Have a repurposing-first mindset</h3>
<p>Content strategist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanbaum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryan Baum</a> takes the top prize for sharing the most ambitious content repurposing example I’ve ever heard of.</p>
<p>“When I think of a ‘case study’ for content repurposing, my first thought is the way Justin Simon and the Metadata marketing team packaged and distributed their DEMAND conference when they were still there,” Ryan said.</p>
<p><a href="https://thedemandevent.com/resources/demand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DEMAND</a> is a full-day digital conference featuring over 20 educational sessions for demand-gen marketers. Ryan explained that the conference was designed to generate content for blogs, social media feeds, email, and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-repurposing-wordstream-demand-landing-page.webp" alt="Content repurposing - DEMAND conference hopepage." width="617" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-85837 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-repurposing-wordstream-demand-landing-page.webp 617w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-repurposing-wordstream-demand-landing-page-480x467.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 617px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The Metadate team designed their 2021 conference as a source for future content repurposing, Ryan Baum said.</em></p>
<p>“The conference was built to end up in these different formats, so they planned it accordingly,” Ryan said. “You can see this in their structure and line of questioning, pre-recorded sessions, picking speakers with audiences, etc.”</p>
<p>It makes sense. You’re recording the best ideas from dozens of the smartest people in your industry. What the Metadata team did really well was systematize the whole process so they could create months’ worth of content from the event with minimal effort.</p>
<p>“Justin and Mark Huber cover it all really nicely in a podcast episode,” Ryan said. <a href="https://metadata.io/resources/podcasts/demand-gen-u/repurpose-event/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">That episode</a> itself was another creative way to repurpose their event experience, which, Ryan joked, “put the meta in Metadata.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-repurposing-wordstream-demand-podcast.webp" alt="Content repurposing - METADATA podcast episode home page." width="782" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-85838 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-repurposing-wordstream-demand-podcast.webp 782w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-repurposing-wordstream-demand-podcast-480x368.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 782px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A </em><a href="https://metadata.io/resources/podcasts/demand-gen-u/repurpose-event/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>podcast episode</em></a><em> about repurposing content as a way to repurpose content is the ultimate content repurposing strategy.</em></p>
<p>Although you may not put together an entire conference anytime soon, you can repurpose this idea for any event you host, like a webinar or a panel discussion.</p>
<p>“It’s not repetitive, it’s a system,” Ryan added. “And systems are the only way I’ve ever seen content repurposing or distribution happen both effectively and consistently.”</p>
<div id="fill-the-funnel-with-customer-stories"></div>
<h3>4. Fill the full funnel with case studies</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/03/how-to-write-a-case-study">Case studies</a> are the gold standard of sales enablement content. But they’re often forgotten after a brief stint as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/25/email-newsletter-ideas">newsletter</a> fodder. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stella-inabo-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stella Inabo</a>, Content Marketer at <a href="http://float.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Float</a>, says that after interviewing 10 customers to create new case studies, she couldn’t “just leave them to gather dust on the marketing site.”</p>
<p>And she certainly didn’t. The Float team mined those conversations for an incredible amount of content that gets shared across five channels and supports every stage of the customer journey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-repurposing-wordstream-Float2.webp" alt="Content repurposing - Atlassian case study page." width="834" height="346" class="aligncenter wp-image-85839 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-repurposing-wordstream-Float2.webp 834w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-repurposing-wordstream-Float2-480x199.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 834px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Float used its </em><a href="https://www.float.com/customers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>case studies</em></a><em> across its entire marketing funnel.</em></p>
<p>For starters, Float created PDFs for the sales team, making it easy for them to use for customer outreach and training.</p>
<p>“We also asked interviewees for permission to use their clips across different channels,” Stella said. “Once we got their okay, we cut snippets of the interviews and sent them over to a creative agency to make videos with Q&amp;A segments featuring them talking about their pain points and how we helped solve them. We uploaded these to our YouTube page.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-repurposing-wordstream-float.webp" alt="Content repurposing - Float case study on YouTube." width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-85840 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-repurposing-wordstream-float.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-repurposing-wordstream-float-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Float’s </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjTMKjgE8pA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>YouTube channel</em></a><em> is a handy place to park case study videos, gather more views, and boost the brand’s overall SEO efforts.</em></p>
<p>Here’s where things get really interesting. The Float team hired an SEO agency to identify keywords from the studies related to the core challenges they solve for customers. Stella said that resulted in over 10 SEO articles “based entirely on our customer stories.”</p>
<p>Then, they updated existing articles with mentions of the case studies and embedded YouTube videos in others. That means they bolstered dozens of existing assets with social proof in just a few minutes!</p>
<p>Next up was social media. “We created a plan that would guide us in repurposing the case studies into carousels, text posts, video posts, and quote posts on LinkedIn,” Stella said. “Since January, we’ve created over 70 LinkedIn assets from the case studies alone.”</p>
<p>And finally, they posted customer stories to their Slack community. “These posts caught the attention of three customers who requested a case study interview.”</p>
<p>I don’t know many businesses that get more mileage from their case studies than Stella and Float. The best part is that none of these tactics are out of reach for most marketers. You can post videos to YouTube and slice them up to LinkedIn for free. If you have access to an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/online-seo-tools">SEO tool</a>, you can pull out a few keywords from the conversations. And even if you don’t have your own <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/19/brand-community">brand community</a>, you may be able to share relevant customer stories on existing forums.</p>
<div id="fuel-employee-advocacy-with-case-studies"></div>
<h3>5. Fuel employee advocacy with case studies</h3>
<p>Have a look at your activity on LinkedIn, Twitter (okay, X), or Threads. If you’re like most, you engage with personal accounts way more than brand posts. That’s why employee advocacy is becoming a bigger part of so many marketing strategies.</p>
<p>The tough part is making it easy for your employees to post quickly, consistently, and on brand.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reaserios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rease Rios</a>, Director of Content at <a href="https://qase.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qase</a>, solves those challenges by repurposing case studies into ready-to-share social media content for her team.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-repurposing-wordstream-qase-linkedin-1.webp" alt="Content repurposing - LinkedIn post promoting Qase content." width="448" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-85872 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-repurposing-wordstream-qase-linkedin-1.webp 448w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-repurposing-wordstream-qase-linkedin-1-224x300.webp 224w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Rease Rios writes </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/parkerkendle_how-qase-helps-elgato-improve-quality-and-activity-7168998388217077760-yjaz?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>LinkedIn post</em></a><em> copy to help her sales team become influencers and brand ambassadors.</em></p>
<p>The prepared social post copy helps Rease ensure that the messages her sales team shares are in line with the greater marketing strategy. It also saves the team a ton of time since many of them may not be LinkedIn experts themselves.</p>
<p>To get the full picture of Rease’s repurposing plan, here’s what she created during the first round of repurposing for a new case study:</p>
<ul>
<li>Five <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/engaging-posts-on-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social posts</a> from the Qase account.</li>
<li>Three variations of text for the sales team to “repost with thoughts” on LinkedIn.</li>
<li>Five unique posts to publish directly from the sales team&#8217;s accounts, each discussing key points from the study.</li>
<li>Multiple quote images.</li>
<li>Quotes for a newsletter opener.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rease said to keep in mind that a lot of good material may not be appropriate for the study itself, but it shouldn’t be wasted.</p>
<p>“A great case study is so much more than the polished finished piece,” she said. “All the insights from the interview, pain points discussed, and quotes that didn’t quite fit into the case study are incredibly valuable. Using all of these pieces allows us to talk about the customer and their work from many different angles on various channels.”</p>
<div id="repurpose-through-influencers"></div>
<h3>6. Repurpose through influencers</h3>
<p>If you heard <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/26/influencer-marketing">influencer marketing</a> a few years ago, you might have pictured makeup tutorials or a food vlogger hyping the next Thai fusion cafe. The practice has grown a lot recently, with experts in nigh on every B2B and B2C vertical helping brands reach broad, engaged audiences.</p>
<p>That’s where <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sneh-ratna-choudhary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sneh Ratna Choudhary</a>, Chief Repurposer at <a href="http://scalingradcontent.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scaling Rad Content</a>, sees many repurposing opportunities. “My theory is expert-led distribution works way better.”</p>
<p>The theory is similar to employee advocacy, only on a larger scale. Sneh shared a recent example to illustrate how well it works, even (or especially) on LinkedIn for B2B businesses.</p>
<p>She contributed her writing chops to this article about <a href="https://www.convert.com/blog/a-b-testing/how-to-successfully-optimize-when-you-cant-ab-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A/B testing methods</a> for Convert. At least two experts in the space turned the key components of the piece into carousels on LinkedIn.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-repurposing-wordstream-convert.webp" alt="Content repurposing - Influencer post sharing content on LinkedIn." width="505" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-85873 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-repurposing-wordstream-convert.webp 505w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-repurposing-wordstream-convert-480x570.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 505px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/daphnetideman_low-traffic-alternative-test-methods-activity-7224050908664377345-2K2U?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Influencer posts</em></a><em> promoting Convert’s guide to A/B testing generated a lot of engagement.</em></p>
<p>Collectively, those carousels generated hundreds of reactions and comments—a much better result than if the brand had just shared the content themselves. “The same blog post, when shared on Convert’s LinkedIn company page, didn&#8217;t get as many likes,” Sneh said. “The content was great. People who were tagged commented on it. But the algorithm still didn&#8217;t pick it up.”</p>
<p>Sneh also said the post format matters. “Repurposing blog posts into carousels for LinkedIn is a great way to get more distribution,” she explained. “Carousels work much better for this purpose, based on my own research.”</p>
<p>The trick is getting expert influencers to do the repurposing for you. Here are a few ways to make it happen:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pay them:</strong> Find someone in your niche with a sizable, engaged following and offer a partnership. Even if they don’t consider themselves an influencer, they may be willing to share your best content for a small fee.</li>
<li><strong>Trade with them:</strong> Look for people who regularly write guest posts for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/10/link-building-secrets">backlinks</a>. If you have a well-visited blog, you could trade links in your content for social shares.</li>
<li><strong>Feature them (my favorite):</strong> Ask experts to share their knowledge for a blog post, give them a citation and backlink in the piece, and ask them to share snippets of it on their social feeds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s one final bit of repurposing wisdom from Sneh: don’t make it all about the original piece of content. “Focus on delivering value natively instead of ‘hey go read this thing I wrote.’ And zero in on the unique angle, main POV, or ideas you want to distribute instead of breaking up the blog post into sections exactly as they’re laid out and posting those on social. Distribute ideas, not blog posts.”</p>
<div id="turn-quest-appearances-into-blog-and-social-content"></div>
<h3>7. Turn guest appearances into blog and social content</h3>
<p>I like this content repurposing idea from freelance fintech writer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/annabyang/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anna Burgess Yang</a> because it draws on a source of ideas most people aren’t leveraging yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of my marketing strategy includes guest appearances on podcasts,” Anna said. “While the hosts will usually send me clips to share on social media, there&#8217;s so much more I can do with that content.”</p>
<p>Along with being a writer, Anna also <a href="https://start.annabyang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advises solopreneurs and small businesses</a> on workflow and automation tactics. She’s created a slick way to make repurposing content even easier. “Once the episode has aired, I feed the transcript to ChatGPT to pull out my main ideas so I can turn them into future social media posts or even an outline for a future blog post.”</p>
<p>Repurposing is a great <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-in-marketing">use of AI</a> because it extracts ideas from something you’ve created instead of trying to generate novel ideas from the tool.</p>
<p>Try using Anna’s technique for any speaking engagement you or your team take part in. That could include webinars, in-person talks, interviews, etc.</p>
<div id="lead-with-seo"></div>
<h3>8. Lead with SEO</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/colby-flood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colby Flood</a>, founder at <a href="https://www.brighterclick.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brighter Click</a>, has an interesting take on repurposing content. Instead of looking for potential SEO blog post ideas from an existing asset, he creates a repurposing system that starts with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo-keyword">SEO keywords</a>.</p>
<p>“At Brighter Click, we’ve crafted a content pipeline allowing thought leaders to invest minimal time in creating video content that gets re-purposed into various mediums,” he said. “We leverage SEO keyword research to craft interview questions for a podcast episode. This interview is then transcribed and turned into multiple blog articles.”</p>
<p>SEO keywords aren’t just useful for helping your content get found on Google. They can also be a consciousness bellwether, telling you which topics your audience wants to understand better. Building your repurposing plan around keywords means you’ll share ideas people are interested in.</p>
<p>Once the blog posts are up, Colby and his team continue to slice and dice the ideas into other formats for more exposure. “The podcast video and blog articles are re-purposed into social media posts across various channels,” he said. “Finally, we create a LinkedIn and email newsletter. This content pipeline allows us to generate 3-4 weeks of content from one 45-minute interview.”</p>
<p>You don’t want to start with very basic 101 keywords here. It’ll be hard to find an interesting angle on “how do I take a screenshot.” But if you look through your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide"> keyword research</a> docs, you’ll find some niche-specific options open to spicy takes.</p>
