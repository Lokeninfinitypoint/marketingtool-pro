										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the world of online marketing, a keyword gap analysis is most associated with SEO, where a company will compare the keywords their website is ranking for against their competitors’ keywords to identify any areas that the competitor ranks for that they don’t. The goal is to find keywords their competitors are outperforming them for and develop a strategy to catch up.</p>
<p>Aside from the word “ranking” and assuming it also translates to “performance,” there’s nothing to say that this process couldn’t be applicable to paid media campaigns as well. Or that only keywords your competitors are bidding on are valuable.</p>
<p>In this article, I want to talk about how we can use (mostly free) tools to do a similar process of keyword discovery for paid search campaigns and discuss why you may want to do so.</p>

<h2>Why do a keyword gap analysis for PPC?</h2>
<p>Whether you’re trying to find new keywords through your own search terms or are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/09/competitor-keywords">looking at where competitors are bidding</a>, keyword discovery is a great way to ensure your paid search accounts are alive and evolving. Odds are that the initial <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/11/21/ppc-keyword-research-guide">keyword research</a> you did when you launched your campaigns is still applicable. But over time, things change.</p>
<p>Google continues to assert that 15% of queries every day are brand new, never before seen by their system.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/new-queries-on-google-png.webp" alt="google says 15% of queries are new each day" width="1436" height="322" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91141" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/new-queries-on-google-png.webp 1436w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/new-queries-on-google-1280x287.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/new-queries-on-google-980x220.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/new-queries-on-google-480x108.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1436px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Whether you leverage your search terms to see how queries evolve or if you piggyback off the work your competitors are doing, this type of gap analysis can ensure that you’re moving with your customer base and not staying stagnant while everyone leaves you behind.</p>

<h2>How to do a keyword gap analysis to improve PPC campaigns: Step by step</h2>
<p>Follow these steps to perform a keyword gap analysis you can use to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/adwords-optimization">optimize your search campaigns</a>.</p>
<div id="take-stock-of-your-existing-keywords"></div>
<h3>1. Take stock of your existing keywords</h3>
<p>We’ll get to your competitors in a minute, but the first place I always encourage advertisers to look for new keywords is in their Search Terms Report.</p>
<p>In Google Ads, this is under the Insights and Reports section of the interface, and all the terms here are queries you’re already showing up for.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-search-terms-report-insights-png.webp" alt="search terms report in google ads" width="361" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91154" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-search-terms-report-insights-png.webp 361w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-search-terms-report-insights-135x300.webp 135w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px" /></p>
<p>Once you’re there, there’s a simple filter that will help you find only net new terms to your account. Either navigate to the Attributes dropdown or search for “Add” in the filters like I did in the image above, and choose the Added/Excluded option from the dropdown.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/add-terms-search-terms-report-png.webp" alt="add/excluded filter in search terms report" width="824" height="282" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91143" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/add-terms-search-terms-report-png.webp 824w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/add-terms-search-terms-report-480x164.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 824px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>From there, check the box next to None. This will show you only search terms that your ads are showing for that you’ve not added as keywords already or that aren’t added as negative keywords.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/search-terms-report-attributes-added-excluded-png.webp" alt="how to filter for excluded search terms" width="508" height="646" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91144" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/search-terms-report-attributes-added-excluded-png.webp 508w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/search-terms-report-attributes-added-excluded-480x610.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 508px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The benefit to this is that you’re likely finding new variants of relevant terms that your customers are actively searching for. They’re likely a good fit for your business (assuming you do regular <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/06/negative-keyword-guide">negative keyword</a> reviews), and they are guaranteed to have search volume since you’re already seeing it in your account.</p>
<p>Additionally, although Google always suggests getting rid of terms that are “duplicates,” even though they’re not identical, they still reward advertisers for having the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/exact-match">Exact match</a> to a query in the account. It’s laid out in their prioritization documents. If a query is the exact same as a keyword in your account and another is close, but not identical, then the exact version will have a higher Ad Rank and have a better chance of matching.</p>

<h3>2. Gather your competitors</h3>
<p>The first stage in this process is to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-find-your-competitors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get a list of competitors</a> you want to use to review for gaps. There are two different types of competitors I want you to think about for this exercise.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Traditional competitors: </strong>These are companies that do the same things you do, and you likely compete directly for the same customers. Think large brands like Dunkin’ and Starbucks, or smaller scale like one roofing company vs another.</li>
<li><strong>Active advertisers: </strong>These are the companies that are bidding on your keywords. For this, conduct a simple search with your existing keywords and see who comes up. These are folks that you are literally competing with in search, even if they don’t do the same things you do.</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/who-to-include-in-ppc-keyword-gap-analysis-png.webp" alt="who to include in ppc keyword gap analysis circle chart" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91146" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/who-to-include-in-ppc-keyword-gap-analysis-png.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/who-to-include-in-ppc-keyword-gap-analysis-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The reason we use both groups is because of the diagram above. There are some companies that are direct competitors and they aren’t bidding against you, others that aren’t really competitors but are bidding against you, and the group we’ll likely learn the most from is the cross-section of the two: those who are your competitors and are bidding on your terms.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f575-fe0f-200d-2640-fe0f.png" alt="🕵️‍♀️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Want an even deeper look at what your competitors are doing?</strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/how-to-spy-on-competitors?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SpyOnCompetitors_Download">How to Spy on Your Competitors: 7 Ways to Become a Competitive Supersleuth</a></p>
<div id="scan-your-competitors-sites"></div>
<h3>3. Scan the websites</h3>
<p>Now that we have our list of competitors, we’re going to use their websites for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/competitors-ads">some light snooping</a>.</p>
<p>We’re going to use the Google Ads Keyword Planner and select the “Start with a Website” option and input each of the sites from the competitor.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/keyword-planner-scan-websites-for-keywords-png.webp" alt="scan websites for keywords in the google ads keyword planner" width="1666" height="649" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91148" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/keyword-planner-scan-websites-for-keywords-png.webp 1666w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/keyword-planner-scan-websites-for-keywords-1280x499.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/keyword-planner-scan-websites-for-keywords-980x382.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/keyword-planner-scan-websites-for-keywords-480x187.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1666px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The results listed will show all the keywords Google thinks the website is about. This can give you all sorts of ideas based just on the content of your competitor’s site.</p>
<p>The best part: there’s a column on the far right that will show you if you already have a keyword in your account or not. This is a very quick way for you to review a keyword for relevancy and then to easily check if you’ve already been using it or if it’s a new term you can test out.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/keywords-in-account-status-png.webp" alt="keywords in account in google ads keyword planner" width="1980" height="624" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91149" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/keywords-in-account-status-png.webp 1980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/keywords-in-account-status-1280x403.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/keywords-in-account-status-980x309.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/keywords-in-account-status-480x151.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1980px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>At times, a company’s entire website can be a bit broad. If you’re finding lots of irrelevant terms but you’re confident the company is relevant to your business, try using individual pages from the site rather than the whole site. If possible, even grab some of their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">landing pages</a> and run those through the tool to see what you can come up with.</p>
<div id="ppc-keyword-gap-analysis-example"></div>
<h2>A PPC keyword gap analysis example</h2>
<p>While the Google Ads Keyword Planner can be a great tool for identifying new terms and easily comparing them to your accounts, I’m a really big fan of the functionality in some of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/09/competitor-keywords">paid research tools</a> out there. One of my favorites is <a href="https://www.spyfu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SpyFu</a>, but others have similar functionality.</p>
<p>With SpyFu, you can take all of your competitors (direct or indirect), put their websites into the tool, and see all sorts of information about their paid search campaigns.</p>
<p>Here are some of the data points you can see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search terms their ads have shown for</li>
<li>Average ad budget</li>
<li>Number of active keywords</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Caveat before we go further: </strong>All of this is inferred data. SpuFu can’t actually know what a competitor&#8217;s keywords are or how much they spend. They can only see the search terms an advertiser showed up for and reverse engineer the number of active keywords and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-shared-budgets">ad budget</a> from there.</p>
<p>While this data isn’t perfect, there’s still plenty we can learn from it. So if you can accept this caveat, which you should, then keep reading.</p>
<p>Still here?</p>
<p>Great!</p>
<p>Let’s start by taking an example website, Lowes.com. (Yes, I’ve been doing home improvement projects, so Lowe&#8217;s is top of mind.</p>
<p>If we input lowes.com into SpuFu, then navigate to the PPC Research section, then choose PPC Keywords, we’ll see a report that looks like this. It has the top performing PPC search queries that Lowes has been showing up for.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/lowes-keywords-spyfu-png.webp" alt="lowes ppc keywords in spyfu" width="1999" height="1262" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91150" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/lowes-keywords-spyfu-png.webp 1999w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/lowes-keywords-spyfu-1280x808.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/lowes-keywords-spyfu-980x619.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/lowes-keywords-spyfu-480x303.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1999px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As you can see, the report is truncated to only the top five terms since we’re in a free account, but if you were to pay for SpyFu, you’d see a lot more variants show up here.</p>
<p>Each of these terms could be a valuable keyword for you to target if you’re a competitor of Lowe&#8217;s and want to show up in the same SERPs that they are. A similar process can be done for all of your competitors to find the top terms they show up for and try to take some new themes for yourself.</p>
<p>That said, my favorite report in SpyFu is the Kombat report. On this tab, you can input multiple competitors, then see how their search term coverage overlaps in a Venn Diagram.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/spyfu-kombat-report-png.webp" alt="spyfu kombat report for lowes" width="1999" height="884" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91151" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/spyfu-kombat-report-png.webp 1999w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/spyfu-kombat-report-1280x566.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/spyfu-kombat-report-980x433.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/spyfu-kombat-report-480x212.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1999px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here, you can see Home Depot and Menards’ search term coverage against Lowe&#8217;s. There’s a group of 118 “Core Keywords,” meaning all three brands bid on these terms.</p>
<p>But the gems come from seeing which terms either Home Depot or Menards bid on that Lowe&#8217;s doesn’t. Specifically, the “Consider Buying” section, in this instance with 70 keywords, shows the search terms Home Depot and Menards are showing for that Lowe&#8217;s isn’t.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/keyword-gap-on-spyfu-png.webp" alt="lowes keyword gap on spyfu" width="1846" height="524" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91152" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/keyword-gap-on-spyfu-png.webp 1846w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/keyword-gap-on-spyfu-1280x363.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/keyword-gap-on-spyfu-980x278.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/keyword-gap-on-spyfu-480x136.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1846px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In this instance, two competitors are showing for the above terms, while Lowe&#8217;s is left out. If you’re the Paid Search Manager for Lowe&#8217;s and you know you offer Owens Corning Duration Shingles, that might be a good term for you to look into.</p>
<p>Additionally, three of the five listed terms are for “appliances” plus a city, state location. That could be an entire keyword theme Lowe&#8217;s should look into researching and building out to ensure they have coverage for folks looking for appliances in areas where they have stores.</p>
<p>Again, these are only the queries Home Depot and Menards are showing for, not the specific keywords, but they’re both onto something with the location terms, and it appears Lowe&#8217;s is being left out of that market conversation. Probably a good place to at least investigate and see if this should be added to their paid search coverage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent years, we certainly haven&#8217;t seen a shortage of major changes to keywords and matching behavior from Google Ads. From the introduction of close variants to the deprecation of modified broad match, updates to query matching logic, and more, the future of keywords in Google Ads will likely continue to ebb and flow. Today, I&#8217;m going to help you navigate these types of updates and share expert advice on how to prepare for the future of Google Ads keywords.</p>

<h2>6 things to know about Google Ads keywords in 2025</h2>
<p>Here are the six most important things to know about Google Ads keywords in 2025 and beyond.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Get ahead of the latest Google Ads changes</strong> and optimize your account accordingly using our free <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads Grader</a>!</p>
<div id="exact-match"></div>
<h3>1. Exact match is the new broad match</h3>
<p><strong>What changed</strong>: The way that keyword match types work in Google Ads has changed.</p>
<p>The definition of exact match used to be &#8220;Ads may show on searches <em>that match the exact term</em> or are close variations of that exact term.&#8221; That’s why it’s called exact match.</p>
<p>Since 2021, <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7478529?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the definition of exact match</a> has been: &#8220;Ads may show on searches<em> that are the same meaning or same intent</em> as the keyword.&#8221; Same name, very different meaning.</p>
<p>Although this definition switch happened a few years ago, we’ve only been seeing changes in our Google Ads accounts for the last year or so. And it’s pretty shocking!</p>
<p><strong>What you need to know</strong>: Here is how all three keyword match types work today. Let’s use the keyword <em>digital marketing services</em> for our example.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exact match:</strong> Ads will show for searches that <strong>share the same</strong> <strong>meaning</strong> as your keyword. For instance, &#8220;digital marketing services&#8221; could match to a query for <em>google ads agency.</em></li>
<li><strong>Phrase match:</strong> Ads will show for searches that <strong>include the meaning</strong> of your keyword, where “digital marketing services” could match to a query for <em>who is the best facebook ads freelancer.</em></li>
<li><strong>Broad match:</strong> Ads will show for searches that <strong>are related to</strong> <strong>the meaning</strong> of your keyword, as in &#8220;digital marketing services&#8221; on broad match could serve to a query for <em>branding agencies in new york.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Watch out!</strong> Even if you’re using exact match keywords, you could end up serving ads on searches you never intended to. For example, one of my clients uses exact match keywords in her<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/11/02/brand-keywords" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> brand search campaign</a>, and a year ago, out of the blue, she started seeing <em>her competitors</em> show up in her search terms report.</p>
<p>Check your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/16/google-ads-search-terms-report-changes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search terms report</a> regularly, and add negatives as needed. There are also <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/n-gram-google-ads-script" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads scripts</a> you can add to automatically negate “close variant” matches if it really bothers you.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/keyword-match-type-chart.webp" alt="keyword match types in google ads" width="722" height="477" class="aligncenter wp-image-87112 size-full" /></p>
<div id="negative-keywords"></div>
<h3>2. Negative keywords don’t work how you think they do</h3>
<p><strong>What changed</strong>: <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/15070437">Google announced</a> in June 2024 that <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/negative-keywords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative keywords</a> will now block misspellings. Note that as of publishing this article, the “<a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2453972/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">About negative keywords</a>” Help Center article has not yet been updated to reflect this change.</p>
<p><strong>What you need to know</strong>: Until now, if you wanted to block a certain query or a competitor name, you would need to also block every conceivable misspelling to ensure you don’t serve an ad where you don’t want to.</p>
<p>For example, if you sell Google Ads services and want to ensure you don’t advertise when people are searching for Google Analytics services, you would have had to block not only “analytics” but also “analytic,” “anlytics,” “analitics,” etc. It was like playing a game of whack-a-mole with your search terms report.</p>
<p>With this new misspellings update, Google is saying that the negative keyword “analytics” will also block all misspelled searches, due to improved semantic understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Watch out!</strong> It is too soon to know if this feature is working as intended for advertisers. While it’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/04/google-ads-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">powered by AI</a>, some concerns include how this will treat brand names that are intentional misspellings (like Krispy Kreme or Scribd) or words that are homographs (minute [time] / minute [small]) or homophones (ad / add, our / hour).</p>
<p>If you haven’t reviewed your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/06/negative-keyword-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative keyword lists</a> in a while, now is the time to do so.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/google-ads-keywords-negative-list.jpg" alt="future of keywords - negative keyword list example" width="893" height="329" class="aligncenter wp-image-87103 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/google-ads-keywords-negative-list.jpg 893w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/google-ads-keywords-negative-list-480x177.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 893px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="pmax"></div>
<h3>3. You can (finally) exclude your brand from Performance Max</h3>
<p><strong>What changed</strong>: The <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/14505308?sjid=7170002814080390323-NC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand exclusions</a> feature has expanded to include all search and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/05/performance-max-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Performance Max campaigns</a>. If you don’t want to advertise on searches for your brand, a competitor brand, a partner’s brand, etc., Google says it’s now possible with brand exclusions.</p>
<p><strong>What you need to know</strong>: In the campaign settings for your search or Performance Max campaign, you can create a “brand list” of brands you’d like to exclude. Using the branded terms you select as a guide, Google will exclude you from advertising on all searches related to that brand.</p>
<p>For example, if you add “YouTube” to your brand list for exclusion, you would not show ads on searches for “youtube,” “yitibe,” or even “google music app.”</p>
<p><strong>Watch out!</strong> Brand exclusions are helpful, but not foolproof. You’ll still want to check your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-performance-max-updates-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> search themes report</a> (PMax) and search terms report (search) regularly to ensure no brand variants are slipping through the cracks.</p>
<p>We expect the feature to continue to improve over time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/google-ads-performance-max-campaigns-brand-exclusion-list.jpg" alt="google ads performance max campaigns - brand exclusions" width="924" height="199" class="aligncenter wp-image-80371 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/google-ads-performance-max-campaigns-brand-exclusion-list.jpg 924w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/google-ads-performance-max-campaigns-brand-exclusion-list-480x103.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 924px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="brand-campaigns"></div>
<h3>4. You can use broad match keywords for your brand campaigns</h3>
<p><strong>What changed</strong>: <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/15070437" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brand restrictions are now called brand inclusions</a>, and it’s the opposite of brand exclusions. (Huh?)</p>
<p><strong>What you need to know</strong>: If you want to <em>only</em> advertise on searches that are related to a specific brand, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/14453047?sjid=7170002814080390323-NC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apply brand inclusions</a> to your search campaign with broad match keywords by using a brand list.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-match-types">keyword match types</a> have loosened up considerably, it’s an interesting new strategy to test to keep your brand search campaigns focused on your brand. Or your competitor search campaigns focused on your competitor if you’d like.</p>
<p><strong>Watch out</strong>! It’s not enough to have a search campaign with broad match keywords; brand inclusions only work with the broad match setting turned on.</p>
<p>If you accept Google’s recommendation to “add brand inclusions and turn on broad match,” it will change the broad match setting for your campaign.</p>
<p>And what does that mean? This brings us to our next point: the push for broad match from Google Ads.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f50e.png" alt="🔎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Need help finding the right keywords?</strong> Try our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">Free Keyword Tool</a>!</p>
<div id="broad-match"></div>
<h3>5. Google wants you to use broad match keywords…for everything</h3>
<p><strong>What changed</strong>: When you set up a new search campaign, there’s a section in the settings called &#8220;broad match keywords.&#8221; This section isn&#8217;t new, but the default setting is. Now, if you’ve chosen a Smart Bidding strategy, it&#8217;s automatically set to &#8220;on: use broad match keywords for your entire campaign.&#8221; Previously, it was &#8220;off: Use keyword match types.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What you need to know: </strong>When you use the campaign-level broad match keywords setting, this seemingly small step makes two major changes to how your Search campaign runs.</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/13389795?hl=en&amp;sjid=3167375269957238143-NA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with this setting on</a>, all your keywords will be treated as broad match, regardless of whether you&#8217;ve added them as phrase or exact match. Even if you include match types when typing in your keywords, Google Ads will simply discard your match types when you hit “Save.”</p>
<p>Second, keywords in campaigns with the broad match setting on will be prioritized as if they were exact match, meaning they&#8217;ll have the <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2756257?sjid=3167375269957238143-NA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest priority in the auction</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Watch out!</strong> The broad match setting is now going to be one of those things you’re going to need to check in every campaign you take on, right up there with search partners and display network.</p>
<p>The setting isn’t bad, but it will cause a lot of confusion for you if you’re not aware it’s on.</p>
<div id="search-themes"></div>
<h3>6. You can use search themes (instead of keywords) to guide your Performance Max campaigns</h3>
<p><strong>What changed</strong>: Last year, Google launched the <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/14767319?hl=en&amp;sjid=15739392587824482937-NC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search themes beta for Performance Max</a>, giving advertisers the option to add up to 25 “words and phrases your customers use to find your offerings to help Performance Max campaigns reach the right audience.”</p>
<p><strong>What you need to know</strong>: Performance Max campaigns have a search themes report that shows you the types of searches you’ve been advertising on. Now, you can use search themes as a campaign input, not just an output.</p>
<p>However, just like an optional audience signal is meant to help guide the automation, ultimately Google will show your ads whenever, and wherever it wants to achieve your goals. Search themes are also optional, and don’t guarantee that you’ll serve ads on those specific searches.</p>
<p><strong>Watch out!</strong> Adding search themes to Performance Max changes your <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2756257" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign prioritization</a>. When more than one campaign could serve an ad on a given query, exact match keywords in search campaigns still have priority #1, but phrase match keywords, broad match keywords, and PMax search themes all share priority #2.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, search themes can make your PMax campaign as likely to serve as your search campaigns. Without search themes, search campaigns will always beat PMax.</p>

<div id="future-of-google-ads-keywords"></div>
<h2>Expert advice on the future of Google Ads keywords</h2>
<p>Given how much has changed in this space over the last two years, I asked five Google Ads experts what this article would look like if I were writing it in another two years. How will keywords work? Will we still have keywords in Google Ads?</p>
<p>The consensus seems to be that search themes and brand inclusions/exclusions are a harbinger of what’s to come, while match types and negative keywords are on the way out.</p>
<p>Here is what industry experts are saying about the future of Google Ads keywords beyond 2025.</p>
<h3>Google Ads keywords may evolve in favor of broad match types and search themes</h3>
<h4>Menachem Ani, Founder at JXT Group</h4>
<p>I think that Google will always stay with the intent of the keyword. However, we&#8217;ve seen Google working to go beyond intent for a while. First, with audiences (RLSA), then with algorithmic and predictive intent alongside the search term intent. I&#8217;d say that keywords will continue to be around in some form, but <strong>match types will evolve and likely be replaced with broad match keywords and some form of search themes</strong> as we&#8217;ve seen in Performance Max.</p>
<h4>Meriem Nacer, Founder at 4M Digital Consulting</h4>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/meriem-4m-digital-consulting-headshot-150x150.webp" alt="google ads keywords - meriem " width="150" height="150" class="wp-image-87115 size-thumbnail alignright" /></p>
<p>Currently, I&#8217;m seeing challenges with phrase match terms like “5-star hotels London” matching specific hotel names, and “Hotel Bedding” matching with mattress brands. <strong>I predict phrase match will be phased out, leaving only exact and broad matches. Ultimately, more dynamic campaigns like Performance Max will likely dominate. </strong>However, websites and systems are not yet strong enough across smaller accounts, leading to inefficiencies and wasted spend. Smaller businesses and B2B could suffer severely from this.</p>
<h4>Anne Bui, Founder at Puffer Digital</h4>
<p>In my opinion, <strong>keywords will become extinct and replaced with clusters of search themes/intent</strong>, rather than the keyword granularity we’re currently used to. That movement can already be seen with the evolution of match types and how keywords are reported in Performance Max campaigns—it’s only a matter of time before Google scales that out across all search targeting. With AI advancements there’s now more search context used via smart bidding in auctions, enabling the shift from looking at keywords at an individualistic level. Gone are the days of selecting every single keyword for our campaigns—and I’ll gladly take that time back!</p>
<h3>Keywords are just a part of a larger targeting strategy</h3>
<h4>Navah Hopkins, Brand Evangelist at Optmyzr</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m a big believer in embracing close variants because they allow you to bid on profitable ideas, versus having to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-cost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget for every single keyword</a>. With that said, I do believe<strong> targeting keywords will remain.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/navah-headshot-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" class="alignright wp-image-87118 size-thumbnail" /></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>However, they&#8217;re going to fully morph into signals versus syntax. This means negative keywords, placement exclusions, and audience exclusions will be even more important. </strong>Keyword signals represent additional privacy protections for Google (and other keyword-based ad buys). While it&#8217;s frustrating to lose that lever, I&#8217;d count on negatives remaining the same so that Google can&#8217;t be held liable by mounting litigations.</p>
<h4>Solange Abraham, Founder at House by Solange</h4>
<p>In two years, <strong>keywords will likely evolve from direct targeting tools to contextual guides. This shift is evident in Google&#8217;s loosening of match types and focus on search themes. </strong>As AI advances, search engines will better understand user intent, reducing the importance of exact-match keywords. We&#8217;ll see a move towards topic-based content and semantic optimization. Google&#8217;s BERT update, improving natural language processing, supports this trend. Voice search growth necessitates a conversational approach. Keywords won&#8217;t vanish, but their role will diminish as algorithms interpret context more sophisticatedly. Marketers must adapt, prioritizing content strategies over individual keyword targeting.</p>
<h4>Adrienne Shaver, Co-Founder at Second Banana Bunch</h4>
<p>In the next two years, keywords will evolve towards a more audience-centric, intent-driven approach. This shift reflects consumers&#8217; desire to be understood, not just targeted. AI advancements will reduce reliance on exact matches, focusing on broader query intent and user context. Traditional keywords won&#8217;t vanish but will integrate with semantic search, creating more intuitive PPC campaigns. <strong>These will utilize broad match strategies and first-party data to align with user intent authentically. </strong>As search automates, PPC professionals must invest in analyzing audience behaviors to grasp the motivations behind searches. This approach will help brands build valued communities rather than mere target audiences, fostering genuine connections through more empathetic, context-aware keyword strategies.</p>

<h2>What to expect for Google Ads keywords in 2025</h2>
<p>Needless to say, your traditional approach to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> keyword research</a> in the coming years will likely need to adapt to AI advancements and changes to the search advertising experience. Experts anticipate that a more holistic approach to keywords that focuses on a few core terms framed up with the right audience targeting is going to be the move in 2025 and beyond.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you’re a marketer or small business owner, you’re likely at least tangentially familiar with the concept of keyword research. Through the lens of search engine optimization (SEO), keyword research is the practice of identifying keywords related to your products or services that people are actively searching for on Google, then optimizing your website for those keywords. This allows your site to show up higher than your competitors in the search engine results page (SERP).</p>
<p>Sounds simple enough, right? And it is. But when we talk about keyword <em>mapping</em>, we’re talking about something slightly different than keyword research, but equally as important.</p>
<p>In this post, we’re going to talk about exactly what keyword mapping is and how you can implement it in a way that drives quality traffic for your business. We’ll also share a simple template you can use to get started on your keyword mapping efforts.</p>

<h2>What is keyword mapping?</h2>
<p>Whether you’re just getting started <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo-keyword">researching keywords for your SEO strategy</a>, or you’ve been doing it for a long time, chances are you’ve come across two problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>You keep finding keywords that are related, or semi-related to one another, and you don’t know whether they should be included on the same piece of content, or which keyword should be your “target” keyword.</li>
<li>You already have pages on your site that align with some of the keywords you’re finding, but they’re not <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-content-beginners-guide">fully optimized for those keywords</a>, or don’t include all of the keywords you’re finding.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keyword mapping is the natural solution to both of these very typical conundrums.</p>
<p>Keyword mapping, in a nutshell, is the process of identifying cluster keywords that you can optimize for specific pages on your site. A cluster of keyword are keywords that are semantically similar to one another in meaning or intent, meaning that the person who is searching for one keyword might realistically be looking for information on another keyword in a given cluster.</p>

<div id="why-is-keyword-mapping-important"></div>
<h2>Why is keyword mapping important?</h2>
<p>Keyword mapping is important because it allows you to do a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prioritize which keywords in a given cluster you should target with a piece of content, and understand how those keywords should be arranged on the page.</li>
<li>Structure, restructure, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/18/content-optimization">optimize existing content</a> according to what people are searching for.</li>
<li>Have your pages placed in the SERPs by the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2024-google-algorithm-updates">Google algorithm</a> and drive significantly more traffic by reaping the rewards of the above two benefits.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we have a baseline understanding of what keyword mapping is and why it’s beneficial, let’s take a look at some examples of how it works in practice.</p>
<div id="how-does-keyword-mapping-work"></div>
<h2>How does keyword mapping work?</h2>
<p>Let’s say you’re a roofing contractor. You see that a lot of your customers have questions about the cost of your metal roofing products, and you decide it would be a good idea to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post">create a piece of content</a> to address those questions (and drive other interested prospects to your website).</p>
<p>Using your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">favorite keyword research tool</a>, you do a little searching and see that the keyword “metal roof cost” has a really strong volume (9.9K), and a moderate level of competition (57).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/how-does-keyword-mapping-work.webp" alt="keyword tool showing competition and volume for keyword mapping" width="936" height="493" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81471" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/how-does-keyword-mapping-work.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/how-does-keyword-mapping-work-480x253.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>That’s great, and you’re all set to write your blog post. But when you dig deeper into the keyword on your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-seo-tools">SEO tool</a>, which, because it has the highest volume in this given cluster, we will call the “parent keyword,” you see that people who search for “metal roof cost” are also searching for all kinds of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/27/lsi-keywords">semantically similar or related keywords</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/keyword-research-for-keyword-mapping.webp" alt="keyword tool showing related keywords for keyword mapping" width="820" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81472" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/keyword-research-for-keyword-mapping.webp 820w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/keyword-research-for-keyword-mapping-480x350.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 820px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Oof. Now this complicates things a bit, doesn’t it? Are you supposed to create separate pieces of content for all of these keywords? For which keyword should you optimize the blog post you were already planning on writing? The answer all comes down to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-intent">intent</a>. We’ll talk through how to do this next.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> But first: Looking for more ways to drive people to your site?

<div id="how-to-do-keyword-mapping"></div>
<h2>How to do keyword mapping based on intent and ranking opportunity</h2>
<p>Through keyword mapping, you can sort through this mess of semantically related keywords and start coming up with a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/01/content-marketing-funnel">content plan</a> that’s going to reap you the maximum amount of traffic.</p>
<p>For our purposes here, because “metal roof cost” has the highest volume, and our domain has some decent authority, we decide that we have a reasonable chance of ranking for the parent keyword. We also do a quick search on Google and see that blog posts optimized for “metal roof cost” are also answering questions like “how much does a metal roof cost,” “average cost of metal roof,” and “1,500 sq ft metal roof cost.” Furthermore, when we enter these queries into Google, we see that the search results contain the same posts as the search results for “metal roof cost.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/keyword-mapping-google-search.webp" alt="google search for average cost of metal roof" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81473" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/keyword-mapping-google-search.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/keyword-mapping-google-search-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>That’s great! Because there are no posts in this SERP targeting “average cost of metal roof” as the primary keyword, we can safely assume that we should include it as a “secondary” or “ancillary” keyword in our post targeting “metal roof cost.” Ideally, because this keyword has strong search volume, we should include it as an H2, along with the other secondary keywords discussed above.</p>
<p>Taking another look at our cluster, we see that “metal roof vs shingles cost” also has great search volume (3.6K). Should we include this as a secondary keyword as well? Let’s see what the search results tell us.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/keyword-mapping-search.webp" alt="google search results for metal roof vs shingle roof search" width="780" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81474" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/keyword-mapping-search.webp 780w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/keyword-mapping-search-480x369.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 780px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Clearly, Google has determined that people who are searching for this keyword get the most use out of an entire blog post on that specific topic, not a post of metal roofing costs that covers “metal roof vs shingles cost” as a sub-topic. Therefore, this keyword deserves its own post.</p>
<p>The same goes for a keyword, from our initial cluster list, like “standing seam metal roof cost.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/how-to-do-keyword-mapping-example.webp" alt="google search for standing seam roof cost" width="936" height="465" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81476" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/how-to-do-keyword-mapping-example.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/how-to-do-keyword-mapping-example-480x238.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Enter this query into Google and you’ll see that nearly all the top content is optimized for standing seam roofs specifically. That means that this keyword deserves its own post as well.</p>
<p>Does that mean that you can’t address standing seam roofs or shingles in your post targeting “metal roof cost?” Absolutely not. Doing so provides more useful information for your reader and gives your post an opportunity to rank for a more diverse set of keywords. But it shouldn’t be the focus of your post. And, if you want to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drive as much traffic as possible</a>, you should spend more time crafting <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/14/google-e-e-a-t">quality, unique content</a> around those other keywords.</p>
<div id="how-to-use-keyword-mapping-for-seo"></div>
<h2>How to use keyword mapping for on-page SEO</h2>
<p>We’ve talked at length in this post about “optimizing” content for a given keyword in your keyword map, but what exactly does that mean? After you’ve done the hard work of breaking out your clusters (using the handy template we’ll provide in a second), how do you actually rank for the keywords you’re targeting with net new content?</p>
<p>The key here is <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/06/on-page-seo">on-page SEO</a>. In order to show up on page one of the search results for a given keyword, your post needs to follow a certain structure and adhere to certain rules that Google has defined as necessary to understand and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/09/google-ranking-factors">rank content</a>. The most critical components of on-page SEO when it comes to ranking for the keywords you’ve mapped are the following:</p>
<h3>Keyword optimization</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, identifying a keyword is only half the battle. You need to make sure your keyword appears throughout your page: in your title tag, meta description, H1, H2s, and throughout the body content.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Including keywords throughout these different page elements tells Google that your page is relevant for a given search query.</p>
<h3>Optimize meta tags</h3>
<p>Your meta <a href="https://gannett-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/ahoward_gannett_com/Documents/Aug%206th.docx?d=w74a63ac6878b4a64842c5ced46f1c3dd&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=0E8t0z">title</a> should be under 60 characters to ensure it displays fully in the search engine. Your meta descriptions should be around 150-160 characters, and include an enticing call-to-action. Both <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/meta-tags">meta tags</a> should contain your target keyword, and should be relevant and compelling.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/heading-tags-for-seo.webp" alt="example of heading tags for seo" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81477" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/heading-tags-for-seo.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/heading-tags-for-seo-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Optimize URL structure</h3>
<p>Create clean and descriptive URLs that provide a clear indication of the page’s content. Avoid using long and complex URLs with unnecessary characters or numbers. Instead, use hyphens to separate words and keep the URL concise. We provided a couple examples of how to do this effectively in the image of our keyword mapping template below.</p>
<p>There are other aspects of on-page SEO, but in terms of leveraging your keyword map to make sure the right pieces of content are showing up for the right keywords, these are the elements to which you need to pay the most attention.</p>
<div id="keyword-mapping-template"></div>
<h2>Keyword mapping template</h2>
<p>Now let’s talk about the keyword mapping template we promised at the onset of this post. As you start grouping these keywords from your initial cluster by intent, you can and should add them to a template like this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/keyword-mapping-template.webp" alt="keyword mapping template from wordstream" width="936" height="275" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81478" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/keyword-mapping-template.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/keyword-mapping-template-480x141.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Want to use this same template? Simply </strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ttXtUpIbPKCch4MC_pNn2OHzFBUS7BUP91C0jdndhvE/copy"><strong>open this link</strong></a><strong> and click “Make a copy.”</strong></em></p>
<p>As you can see, the keywords we identified as needing their own pieces of content become their own cluster topics, complete with secondary keywords of their own that should be included in that content. Leveraging a template like this is obviously great for ideating new content, but it can also be a great way to understand how to make your existing content better match the queries for which your customers are searching.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f495.png" alt="💕" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Want more tips and ideas? We&#8217;ve got 130+ for you!

<h2>Do keyword mapping for SEO to rank higher</h2>
<p>It’s really that simple. Keyword mapping isn’t just a way to get organized. It’s a way to give yourself a chance to rank for the most diverse set of keywords that you can. It’s also, as we’ve seen, an amazing way to approach content creation meticulously and systematically, which, if you want to cast a wide net and drive as much traffic as possible, is really the only way to approach <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2024-seo-strategies">SEO</a> and content marketing.</p>

<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/11/02/brand-keywords">Are You Paying Too Much for Your Brand Keywords? 5 Ways to Find Out (&#038; Fix It!)</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>As a Googler for six years and then a Google Ads coach for two years, I have seen thousands of Google Ads accounts. Virtually all of them run branded search campaigns (search campaigns that use variations of your business name as keywords), and about one in 10 complain that their brand keyword costs per click (CPCs) are too high.</span></p>
<p>Now, that may sound on trend considering <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/15/google-ads-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordStream&#8217;s recent search benchmark data</a> shows that average cost per click has increased for 61% of industries and saw a general year-over-year increase of 5%.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/brand-keywords-cost-per-click-chart.jpg" alt="brand keywords - google ads costs year over year" width="842" height="598" class="aligncenter wp-image-77057 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/brand-keywords-cost-per-click-chart.jpg 842w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/brand-keywords-cost-per-click-chart-480x341.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 842px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Download the full<a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteGoogleAdsBenchmarks2023.html?cid=Web_WS_incontent_guide_2023benchmarks_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 2023 Google Ads benchmark report</a> here.</em></p>
<p>However, keep in mind that brand keywords historically have had a significantly cheaper cost per click than your typical non-branded keywords. That, coupled with the fact that branded keywords convert at a <a href="https://hawksem.com/blog/branded-vs-non-branded-keywords/">100%</a> higher rate than non-branded keywords, it&#8217;s no wonder that businesses want to make the most of these terms with the best bang for their buck.</p>
<p>If you feel like you&#8217;re in the same boat where your branded keyword costs are high, but you don&#8217;t want to give up on them just yet, you&#8217;re in luck. <span>Here are five of the most common reasons why your branded keywords costs per click are high this year, and how to fix it.</span></p>
<h2>5 issues causing high brand keyword costs (and how to fix them)</h2>
<p>Use this guide to diagnose and treat your Google Ads branded keywords with unusually high costs:</p>
<h3>1. You messed up your <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 22px;">match types</span></h3>
<p><span>The most common culprit of high CPCs in a branded search campaign is…you’re not actually advertising for queries that align with your brand name.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s say you’ve entered your branded keywords into your search campaign like this:</span></p>
<p><em><span>joe’s awesome business</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>joe’s business</span></em></p>
<p><span>That’s called <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/29/succeed-with-google-ads-broad-match" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broad match</a>, and it tells Google that you want to advertise on user searches that <em>are related to the concept of </em>Joe’s Awesome Business. It does NOT tell Google that you want to advertise when people are specifically searching for your business; you would need to use phrase match or exact match for that.</span></p>
<h4>How to know if you’ve messed up your match types</h4>
<p><span>In <strong>Google Ads</strong>, go to<strong> Keywords</strong>, then click <strong>Search keywords</strong>. Then, look at the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/13/future-of-keyword-match-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Match Type</strong></a> column and ensure it says <strong>Phrase Match</strong> or<strong> Exact Match</strong> next to every keyword in your branded search campaign. Even if you think you used the right match type, it’s easy to accidentally leave off a quotation mark or bracket, leaving you with unintentional broad match keywords.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/branded-keywords-keyword-match-type.jpg" alt="branded keywords - keyword match type column screenshot in Google Ads" width="641" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-77062 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/branded-keywords-keyword-match-type.jpg 641w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/branded-keywords-keyword-match-type-480x449.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 641px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Use this free guide to find more ways to <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteHackingGoogleAds.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_HackingGoogleAds_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hack Google Ads for better performance</a>.</p>
<h3>2. You’re not adding negatives</h3>
<p><span>Unfortunately, just because you have the right match types, it doesn’t mean you’re only advertising on your branded queries.</span></p>
<p><span>Over the last year, Google has gotten much more liberal with its definition of a “close variant” match—so liberal, in fact, that I’ve heard reports of Google Ads matching <em>competitor names</em> to brand names, even when using phrase or exact match.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s say that you’re using the keyword <em>“joe’s awesome business” </em>and Sara’s Fabulous Shop is down the street, selling similar products. Google might match a search for &#8220;<em>sara’s fabulous shop&#8221;</em> to your <em>“joe’s awesome business”</em> keyword, even though we can all agree that this would not fit our definition of a matching phrase. </span></p>
<p><span>If Google’s algorithm understands the similarity between these two competitors, it will treat them as synonyms, turning your branded search campaign into a competitor search campaign! And, of course, CPCs on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/01/competitor-keyword-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">competitor keywords</a> are always quite high due to low <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/19/does-quality-score-still-matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quality Score</a>, and potentially high competition.</span></p>
<h4>How to know if you’re not adding negatives</h4>
<p><span>In Google Ads, go to <strong>Keywords</strong>, then click on <strong>Negative keywords</strong> to see if any negatives have been added to your branded search campaign.</span></p>
<p><span>Whether they have or not, you’ll want to go to <strong>Keywords</strong>, then <strong>Search terms</strong>, and sort descending by the Impressions column for the last 30 days (or 90 days, if your search volume is quite low). Spot anything surprising in there? Add it as a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/negative-keywords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative keyword</a>.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/branded-keywords-negative-keywords-1.jpg" alt="branded keywords - negative keyword in search terms example" width="768" height="327" class="aligncenter wp-image-77064 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/branded-keywords-negative-keywords-1.jpg 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/branded-keywords-negative-keywords-1-480x204.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 768px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f50d.png" alt="🔍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordStream Free Keyword Tool</a> can help you find keywords and negative keywords for your brand search campaigns!</p>
<h3>3. Your competitors are bidding on your brand</h3>
<p><span>Let’s say you’ve got the right match types, you’re adding negatives as needed, your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/16/google-ads-search-terms-report-changes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Search Terms Report</a> looks good and your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/07/18/adwords-cost-per-click-too-high" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPCs are <em>still</em> high</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>The next most common culprit is that your competitors are bidding on your brand, so there’s competition for your brand keywords. (Less common, but also possible, is that you have such a generic brand name that you’re bidding against other businesses for customers that may or may not even be looking for you.)</span></p>
<p><span>While this is annoying, it’s perfectly legal as long as they aren’t using your trademarks in the text of the ad itself. The best way to get rid of them is to keep defending your brand—ensure you have over a 90% <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/07/impression-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impression share</a> in your branded search campaign. By doing so, you’ll drive up <em>their</em> CPCs to the point that it won’t be profitable for them to bid on your brand anymore, and <em>your</em> CPCs will subside once they exit the auction.</span></p>
<h4>How to know if your competitors are bidding on your brand</h4>
<p><span>Don’t Google yourself! In Google Ads, go to <strong>Keywords</strong>, then <strong>Auction insights</strong>. If your competitors are bidding on your brand, you’ll see their domains show up here.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/google-ads-impression-share-auction-insights.png" alt="brand keywords - auction insights example" width="936" height="323" class="aligncenter wp-image-72497 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/google-ads-impression-share-auction-insights.png 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/google-ads-impression-share-auction-insights-480x166.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>4. You picked the wrong bid strategy</h3>
<p><span>Keywords aren’t the only possible reason for high CPCs. Perhaps the reason you’re paying too much for your brand keywords is that you’ve picked the wrong<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/19/google-ads-automated-bidding" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> bid strategy</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>Google Ads Recommendations will often suggest Target Impression Share, but in my experience, this is a surefire way to blow through lots of budget. I prefer to use Maximize Clicks or Maximize Conversions for branded search campaigns, but these solutions won’t work for every account and can sometimes lead to higher CPCs.</span></p>
<p><span>If your CPCs are really out of control, switch to Manual CPC with enhanced CPC turned on, and start by setting a Max CPC that’s 25% lower than your actual CPCs. Monitor your Search <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/07/impression-share">Impression Share</a> carefully (especially if there are competitors in your auctions), and gradually reduce your bids in 25% increments to bring your CPCs back down.</span></p>
<h4>How to know if you picked the wrong bid strategy</h4>
<p><span>In Google Ads, when you’re in a campaign (not an ad group), go to Settings on the left-hand side to see which bid strategy you’re using.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/brand-keywords-bid-strategy-screenshot.jpg" alt="brand keywords - bid strategy selection example" width="927" height="315" class="aligncenter wp-image-77065 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/brand-keywords-bid-strategy-screenshot.jpg 927w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/brand-keywords-bid-strategy-screenshot-480x163.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 927px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>5. You have a Quality Score issue</h3>
<p><span>The amount you pay per click is a function of both your bids and your <em>quality</em>. Though not as common in a branded search campaign, it’s worth checking to see if you have a Quality Score issue.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span>Perhaps you didn’t include your brand name in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/03/how-to-write-exceptional-ppc-ad-copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ad copy</a>, so your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/14/improve-google-ads-click-through-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click-through rate</a> is lower than it should be. Or perhaps your ads are fine, but your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/08/landing-page-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">landing page</a> is so poor that it’s hurting your Quality Score, and in turn, driving up the CPC Google will require from you for the privilege of showing an ad.</span></p>
<p><span>In a branded search campaign, your Quality Score for every keyword (if reported) should be a 9 or 10.</span></p>
<h4>How to know if you have a Quality Score issue</h4>
<p><span>In Google Ads, go to<strong> Keywords</strong>, then <strong>Search keywords</strong>. Add the following 4 columns to your report: Quality Score, Expected CTR, Ad relevance, and Landing page experience. Quality Score (if reported) should be a 9 or 10 for each keyword; Expected CTR and Ad relevance should both show &#8220;above average,&#8221; and Landing page experience should be &#8220;average&#8221; or &#8220;above average.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/branded-keywords-quality-score.jpg" alt="branded keywords - quality score columns" width="900" height="227" class="aligncenter wp-image-77066 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/branded-keywords-quality-score.jpg 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/branded-keywords-quality-score-480x121.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>Consider all options for brand keyword optimization</h2>
<p>Clearly, the factors at play when it comes to your brand keyword costs go beyond the typical keyword settings. Many factors within your account will impact your brand keyword CPC, so keep an open mind when you&#8217;re optimizing your branded keywords (and check these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-google-ads-keywords">keyword tips</a>). And, if you&#8217;ve tried looking into all five of these possible culprits, see how <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/marketing-services">WordStream&#8217;s solutions</a> can help you maximize your brand keyword ROI.</p>
<p>To recap, look at these five things when you find yourself dealing with high brand keyword CPCs:</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a previous post, I covered some of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/07/ppc-keyword-challenges">regular mistakes I see with keyword selection and usage in search campaigns</a>. I teased that after the campaigns are set up, the job is not done; that there are regular maintenance tasks you should be working on to keep your keyword list healthy and thriving, and that a new post was coming with more details.</p>
<p>Well, good news fam, this is that post!</p>
<h2>6 keyword maintenance tips every advertiser should follow</h2>
<p>Here are the six ways you can work to maintain your search keywords and make sure you’re constantly evolving to find the best performance for your campaigns.</p>
<h3>1. Regular performance reviews for pauses</h3>
<p>This one is a bit of a no-brainer, but you’d be surprised at how often we log in to a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/08/07/how-to-set-up-google-adwords-account">Google Ads account</a> only to find that there are tons of keywords that have been active in the account since day one and are performing much worse than other keywords in the account.</p>
<p>Take a look at the example below. This account has <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/07/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead-google-ads">high CPAs</a> on average, but some really do stand out from the crowd. The top two keywords have CPAs well over $1,000 while other terms have CPAs in the low $200s. Additionally, the keyword on the bottom has spent $700+ and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/21/google-ads-not-converting">not converted at all</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ongoing-keyword-maintenance-tasks-performance.png" alt="keyword performance review example in google ads" width="1428" height="912" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70493" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ongoing-keyword-maintenance-tasks-performance.png 1428w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ongoing-keyword-maintenance-tasks-performance-1280x817.png 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ongoing-keyword-maintenance-tasks-performance-980x626.png 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ongoing-keyword-maintenance-tasks-performance-480x307.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1428px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Now while these things aren’t inherently end-of-the-world scenarios, one missing point here is that this campaign was capped by budget. That means that we’re spending through our daily budget and often being held back from showing on additional queries.</p>
<p>In this scenario, these lower-performing terms are stealing budget that could be applied to more efficient keywords.</p>
<p>Assuming all other performance markers stayed the same, here’s how this set of keywords would have performed if these keywords would have been caught for the low performers that they are and paused earlier on.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-performance-changes-tracking.png" alt="keyword maintenance performance tracking" width="1900" height="356" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70494" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-performance-changes-tracking.png 1900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-performance-changes-tracking-1280x240.png 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-performance-changes-tracking-980x184.png 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-performance-changes-tracking-480x90.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Quite a difference huh?</p>
<p>In my example scenario, which is true for the real account, there is plenty of volume to scale even if we pause the low-performing keywords. So if we do that, we save 12% of spend <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/21/how-to-save-money-google-ads">(more ways to save money in Google Ads here)</a> and only lose 2% of conversions.</p>
<p>But further yet, since we have room to scale, what’s more likely is that spend will be the same (second to last row) but conversion totals will increase, giving us 11% lift on conversions simply by pausing underperforming keywords and using the same budget as before.</p>
<h3>Suggestion:</h3>
<p>No matter how much volume your account has, set up a regular task cadence to review performance for both short and long time frames and make pauses based on performance.</p>
<p>Try looking at the last month, three months, and last year to see if a keyword is regularly performing outside of your target goals and make determinations to pause and reallocate funds where you can.</p>
<p>But don’t just look at “underperformers” in comparison to each other. The stats I gave above are compelling, but you need to draw some boundaries in your reviews.</p>
<p>For this type of analysis, I look at a few filters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Converting keywords with a CPA that is 4x that of our account goal.</li>
<li>Non-converting keywords where total spend is 3x that of our account’s CPA goal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these filters give the keywords a chance to perform as well as give me a chance to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/24/google-ads-optimization"> optimize the performance we’re seeing</a> to make them work. But if they find their way into these groups and hit these thresholds, I have to pause and come back to them later. We’ll get to this at the end of the post.</p>
<h3>2. Filter keywords for low search volume terms</h3>
<p>If you’re anything like me, you’re probably pretty optimistic when <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/11/21/ppc-keyword-research-guide">conducting keyword research</a>. You’re looking forward to getting campaigns up and running and seeing how they perform. But sometimes that optimism can cause us to overbuild campaigns and include too many keywords.</p>
<p>In another scenario, your campaigns could start off targeting keywords with strong volume but over time work their way out of favor. Search behavior is constantly changing and just because people were searching for something when you built your campaigns, that doesn’t mean they’re going to keep searching for them.</p>
<p>Keywords that hit a certain threshold will be categorized as Low Search Volume by Google and will look like this.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-metrics.png" alt="keyword maintenance metrics in google ads" width="1292" height="652" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70495" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-metrics.png 1292w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-metrics-1280x646.png 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-metrics-980x495.png 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-metrics-480x242.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1292px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2616014?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what Google says about Low Search Volume terms</a>:</p>
<p><em>A status that&#8217;s given to a keyword with very little to no search history on Google.</em></p>
<p><em>Important: The keyword will be inactive until its search traffic increases, when the keyword can start triggering your ads to appear.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Keywords marked as &#8220;Low search volume&#8221; are associated with very little search traffic on Google, an indication that they&#8217;re not very relevant to most customers&#8217; searches.</em></li>
<li><em>If the number of search queries for these keywords increases even a small amount, they&#8217;ll be reactivated and will start triggering your ads to show again. Our system check and updates this status regularly.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-low-search-volume.png" alt="what google ads says about low search volume keywords" width="720" height="342" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70496" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-low-search-volume.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-low-search-volume-480x228.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Suggestion:</h3>
<p>Pay close attention to your keyword status. In the image above, you’ll see that one keyword is Low Search Volume AND has a Below First Page Bid. For this keyword, I will increase the bids to the higher level (as long as it’s within reason of what I’m willing to pay; in this case it is) and review again after a week or two to see if it’s gained any traction.</p>
<p>For all other keywords, while there might still be hope for these keywords down the line, in my experience, it’s easiest to pause these keywords after three months of no volume to help clean up your account. Otherwise, they simply bulk everything up while providing no value at all since they aren’t <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/26/search-impression-share">generating any impressions</a>.</p>
<h3>3. Monitor ongoing performance trends for opportunities</h3>
<p>Keyword pauses aren’t the only things you should be on the lookout for. Regular reviews should also include reviews of how competitive your landscape is and how that impacts your strategy.</p>
<p>I want to take a real-world example I just ran into for this section. I recently conducted an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/16/ppc-audit">audit of an account</a> that’s been struggling over the past few years. They are promoting a fitness tracker app for phones and have determined that a CPA of $30 is profitable for them.</p>
<p>When they initially set up their campaigns a few years ago, they were easily hitting this number and seeing good success. But over the last year or so, they noticed their CPA continually increasing and moving into a range where it’s no longer profitable.</p>
<p>After a number of changes to the account, they asked me to take a look and see what I could find. As I told them, the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/10/google-ads-account-structure">account is set up</a> exactly the way I would do it, so I didn’t believe structure or strategy on the whole was an issue.</p>
<p>But after digging in a little to see where efficiencies were being lost, I noticed a couple areas of concern.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-tasks-campaigns.png" alt="keyword maintenance tasks - campaign performance graph" width="720" height="302" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70497" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-tasks-campaigns.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-tasks-campaigns-480x201.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The first is the blue line in the image above: Avg CPC (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/cost-per-click">cost per click</a>). You can see that in early 2021, the CPCs were fairly low, averaging $0.89. But starting later that year and continuing well into 2022, the CPCs rose and ended 2022 with an average of $2.02.</p>
<p>While that might not seem like a big CPC, that’s a 127% increase in CPC, meaning that other stats are going to have to improve to make up for this loss in efficiency.</p>
<p>Before we get to the second area of concern in the chart, I wanted to find out why the CPCs were increasing so much.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-tips-competitor-impression-share.png" alt="competitor impression share graph" width="720" height="435" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70498" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-tips-competitor-impression-share.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-tips-competitor-impression-share-480x290.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It didn’t take long to see that there was an influx of competitors over the course of this time frame that caused these keywords to get a lot more competitive. While the trend ebbs &amp; flows each quarter (most likely just due to issues with Auction Insights data rather than actual changes in the environment), you can see that the overall trend shows the space getting more competitive over time.</p>
<p>At this stage, it’s clear we’re seeing more competition for our keywords. So we’re faced with deciding whether to try and improve performance or to cut bait and go elsewhere.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the second problem I alluded to earlier: The red line in the first chart: Conversion Rate.</p>
<p>After an artificially high second quarter, you can see the CVR sort of climbs with the CPC increases throughout the end of 2021, but then dies off in 2022.</p>
<p>After looking into a number of factors like onsite behavior, traffic sources, website changes, etc., we revisited the competitors and found that during this time, most of them launched a free version of their app. So now we’re not competing with more companies, but many of them now have a free option where this account did not.</p>
<p>Now they’re really faced with some choices about what to do with keywords.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the same keywords and launch a free option of the app <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/24/how-to-compete-in-google-ads">to compete</a>.</li>
<li>Keep the same keywords but focus <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/03/how-to-write-exceptional-ppc-ad-copy">ad copy</a> on features and benefits that justify paying for all options.</li>
<li>Find new keywords that focus on people only trying to look for paid options.</li>
<li>Find new keywords that emphasize the features and benefits that make this app stand out and justify the cost.</li>
<li>Look into the feasibility/economics of creating a free option to win back customer share and upsell to paid features.</li>
</ul>
<p>But likely, there needs to be some combination of work on all five of these points for them to see ongoing success.</p>
<p>In this instance, maybe they can tout that their fitness tracker also has meal planning and workout routines included. Maybe it integrates with your wearable tech better than other apps. No matter the path forward, it’s important to keep an eye on your trending stats to make sure you’re not falling behind.</p>
<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>

<p><span> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2734.png" alt="✴" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Do you have any inefficiencies in your Google Ads account?</span></p>

<p><span></div></div></span></p>
<h3>Suggestion:</h3>
<p>Keep a long-term view on trending data in your accounts. Are your keywords getting more or less expensive? Is traffic shifting toward them or away? How are competitors impacting your keyword strategy, if at all?</p>
<p>Keywords can perform well at the beginning then start to wane over time. Even if they don’t reach a level of needing to be paused, they could easily be telling you something about your industry or competitive landscape that could and should have an impact on your keyword strategy.</p>
<h3>4. Conduct keyword research on a regular basis</h3>
<p>It’s a pretty common practice for advertisers to conduct keyword research when first building out their campaigns. At that point, you’re looking for all the terms you can target to reach your audience.</p>
<p>But just like all other aspects of a search account, this also isn’t a “one and done” type of task. Queries are changing all the time and new themes may arise over time that you want to take advantage of.</p>
<p>And no, this isn’t just a “Michelle says so” type of task.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-google-search-terms.png" alt="15% of google searches have never been searched before" width="720" height="324" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70499" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-google-search-terms.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-google-search-terms-480x216.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Even Google says (and has confirmed many times over the years) that queries are changing all the time and 15% of searches have never been seen before.</p>
<h3>Suggestion:</h3>
<p>Set a regular calendar reminder to hit up your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/09/18/best-keyword-research-tools">favorite keyword research tools</a> once a quarter or a couple times a year, just to see if anything has changed around your core terms and if you should be expanding your coverage.</p>
<p>You can take ideas from your current keyword list, common sense, or you could leverage the next regular optimization on the list to get new seed ideas.</p>

<p><span></div></div></span></p>
<h3>5. Review search term reports for new keywords or negatives</h3>
<p>It’s always in your best interest to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/16/google-ads-search-terms-report-changes"> review your search term reports</a> to see what queries your keywords are matching to. With all of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Spp9rE-KbLM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changes in match types</a> over the last couple of years, you may be surprised as to what finds its way into this report.</p>
<p>To find it, simply head to the keywords section in the left hand navigation, then click Search terms.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-search-terms-report.png" alt="search terms tab in google ads" width="241" height="393" class="aligncenter wp-image-70500" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-search-terms-report.png 400w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-search-terms-report-184x300.png 184w" sizes="(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px" /></p>
<p>From there, you’ll be able to see the performance of your search terms and how they matched up to your keywords.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-add-negative-keywords.png" alt="add negative keywords in google ads" width="720" height="348" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70501" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-add-negative-keywords.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-add-negative-keywords-480x232.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>For good performers:</strong></p>
<p>You can add these directly to your existing ad groups in your campaigns by simply checking the box next to the search term and clicking Add as a keyword in the blue bar that shows up. Depending on where you are in the account, you’ll need to set the destination campaign and ad group for that keyword, as well as the match type, but once you click save, it will be added to your account. You can also use these as the seeds for new keyword research as I mentioned above.</p>
<p><strong>For poor performers:</strong></p>
<p>You can see in the image above that it’s just as easy to add a negative keyword as it is a positive one. If you see terms that aren’t meeting your performance standards, be sure to exclude them from your Ad Group, Campaign, or use Negative Keyword Lists to keep your ads from showing on those queries.</p>
<p>That said, it’s important that you understand how negative keywords work in comparison to regular keywords, because it is a bit different. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsVfzVTMNTw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here’s a video</a> that walks you through some of the nuances so you can make sure you’re using them correctly.</p>
<h3>Suggestion:</h3>
<p>Search term review should be done on a regular basis, but likely needs to be done more often when first starting a campaign. At that stage, too many things are unknown and you want to keep a close eye on performance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-search-term-review-maintenance.png" alt="suggested cadence of search term report review" width="720" height="160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70502" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-search-term-review-maintenance.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-search-term-review-maintenance-480x107.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is a typical cadence for how I would schedule search term reviews for a new account, moving into a more mature phase over time.</p>
<p>One BIG caveat: it all depends on volume. This cadence is for a small to mid-sized account. If your account is extremely small or on the larger side, this might not be the right fit, but hopefully it lets you see what a typical cadence <em>could</em> look like and help you develop your own.</p>
<p>While you’re doing this task, keep notes of the new keywords you add to use for keyword research seeds for those quarterly or bi-annual reviews.</p>
<h3>6. Revisit previously paused keywords for reactivation</h3>
<p>Just like everything else with digital advertising, the landscape for keywords is always changing. Performance will always ebb and flow depending on countless factors and it’s your job to stay on top of those the best you can to take advantage, or at least not make big mistakes.</p>
<p>While we talked a number of times about pausing keywords depending on many factors, one thing people don’t do often enough is revisit paused keywords for reactivation.</p>
<p>Now I’m sure this seems silly to many of you.</p>
<p>Why on Earth would I reactivate a keyword that didn’t perform well in the past or didn’t have any search volume associated with it?</p>
<p>My answer is…because you never know what trends have changed until you give that keyword another shot to perform.</p>
<h3>Suggestion</h3>
<p>Review all paused keywords in your account every six months or so.</p>
<ul>
<li>How long have they been inactive?</li>
<li>Why were they paused in the first place?</li>
<li>Did they ever have good performance or was it all a waste of spend?</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-reactivated-keywords.png" alt="reactivated keywords in google ads" width="720" height="366" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70503" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-reactivated-keywords.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-maintenance-reactivated-keywords-480x244.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you have room in your budget and performance allows, give a few of these terms another shot by activating them again and adding a label for easy filtering and monitoring.</p>
<p>Sometimes these work out, sometimes they don’t. But I’ve had enough surprises of keywords coming back to life and performing really well that this has become a regular practice for me in my accounts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last few years, Google and Microsoft have continued to come out with new fancy tools to help get your business in front of potential customers, but in my experience, nothing quite compares to Search. These users tend to have the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/30/commercial-intent-keywords">highest intent to buy</a> as they’re actively looking for a solution to a problem, not just browsing content like many other campaign types.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/serp-seeking-solution-to-problem.png" alt="google ads for online mental health counseling" width="600" height="516" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70728" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/serp-seeking-solution-to-problem.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/serp-seeking-solution-to-problem-480x413.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But there is a bit of a problem with them: paid search campaigns can be difficult to do <strong>right</strong>.</p>
<p>I would argue Search campaigns are the most complex of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/05/types-of-google-ads">PPC campaign types</a> and give you the most control over where you show up and how you present your brand. But just like Spiderman, with great power comes great responsibility and more often than not, I see accounts where Search campaigns simply aren’t treated well.</p>
<p><strong>One of the main problem areas is also the driving force of Search campaigns: keywords.</strong></p>
<p>In this post, I’m going to cover some of the foundational best practices around keywords and discuss some common mistakes we see in accounts. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach, and in some of these sections I’ll be trying to help you thread the needle between too much and too little, but hopefully, by the end of this post, you’ll have an idea of how to approach your keywords and set your Search campaigns up for success.</p>
<h2>Challenge #1: How many keywords should you have in your account?</h2>
<p>Determining the number of keywords to have in your account can be quite daunting, but also a complete no-brainer. The answer: as many as are necessary.</p>
<p>But how do you figure out which ones are necessary?</p>
<p>Your first job is to start with thorough <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/keyword-prioritization">keyword</a> research. This includes building a keyword list from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/09/18/best-keyword-research-tools">keyword research tools</a> like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common sense</li>

<p><span></div></div></span></p>
<p>Let’s assume I’m trying to advertise womens running shoes and through my keyword research, I find the terms below:</p>
<ul>
<li>running shoes</li>
<li>womens running shoes</li>
<li>running shoes women</li>
<li>nike running shoes for women</li>
<li>womens nike running shoes</li>
<li>best running shoes for women</li>
<li>ladies running shoes nike</li>
<li>does nike make womens running shoes</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-selection-best-practices-new-campaign-running-shoes.png" alt="list of keywords related to womens runing shoes" width="500" height="397" class="size-full wp-image-70504 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-selection-best-practices-new-campaign-running-shoes.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-selection-best-practices-new-campaign-running-shoes-480x381.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Now that you have a list, it’s time to start culling through it and finding which ones make the cut and find their way into your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/10/google-ads-account-structure">account structure</a>.</p>
<h2>Challenge #2: Variants, variability &amp; redundant keywords</h2>
<p>One thing you may notice about this list of keywords: many of them are very similar to each other with only a slight variance in word choice or order.</p>
<p>“Womens running shoes” and “running shoes womens” are just a difference in word order. The same is true for “womens nike running shoes” and “nike running shoes for women”. Although one has “for” included, it could be argued that it’s effectively the same keyword.</p>
<p>In years prior, I honestly wouldn’t have gotten much pushback on including both of these in a keyword list and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/21/how-to-run-google-ads">campaign build-out</a> for a client. But with all of Google’s recommendations expanding to all sorts of account management tasks, one common pushback we see is for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/09/remove-redundant-keywords-recommendation-change">redundant keywords</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-selection-best-practices-new-campaign-remove-redundant-keywords.png" alt="remove redundant keywords recommendation in google ads" width="720" height="335" class="size-full wp-image-70505 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-selection-best-practices-new-campaign-remove-redundant-keywords.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-selection-best-practices-new-campaign-remove-redundant-keywords-480x223.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You may get a suggestion that looks like this in your account and suggests that you ditch one keyword for another.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it’s not taking the actual performance into account. And, for better or worse, some of these keywords that are flagged as redundant by Google actually perform quite differently from each other.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/best-practices-keyword-selection-new-campaign.png" alt="keyword metric columns in google ads" width="720" height="222" class="size-full wp-image-70506 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/best-practices-keyword-selection-new-campaign.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/best-practices-keyword-selection-new-campaign-480x148.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In this example, the keyword Google wants me to remove actually has the majority of the volume and conversions. Yes, the other variant has a lower Cost/Conv but Keyword 2 is still hitting my account-level goals. Additionally, if they’re essentially the same keyword, then why is something causing Keyword one to miss out on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/26/search-impression-share">impression share</a> in the auction? Why isn’t it being shown at the same rate as Keyword two?</p>
<p>Additionally, in my experience, if I were to turn off Keyword two in favor of Keyword one, my overall volume would actually drop slightly as Keyword one doesn’t usually pick up all of the impression share Keyword two forfeits by being paused. This isn’t a great scenario for my account.</p>
<h3>Suggestion</h3>
<p>Although it goes against pretty much all suggestions you’ll hear for campaign structure nowadays, I nearly always recommend including each one of the “redundant” variants in a new campaign build under one condition: they both have estimated search volume in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LECshZT8NsE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Keyword Planner</a>.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LECshZT8NsE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>If both of the keywords from my example have volume then I would add both, let the performance play out, and then only pause one if it didn’t hit my goals.</p>
<p>If both don’t have any estimated volume or one has very very low traffic compared to the other, then I would consider leaving it out of a new build.</p>
<h2>Challenge #3: Head terms vs long tail variants</h2>
<p>In the world of paid search advertising, the more narrow your keywords are focused, the lower your costs, but also, the lower your volume. Keywords that have four or more words in them are usually considered <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/long-tail-keywords">“long tail” terms</a> while keywords with three or less are usually “head terms.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/digital-marketing-trends-2023-long-tail-keywords-graph.png" alt="2023 digital marketing trends - long tail keywords" width="720" height="544" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-69687" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/digital-marketing-trends-2023-long-tail-keywords-graph.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/digital-marketing-trends-2023-long-tail-keywords-graph-480x363.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Taking the list of keywords above, we can see there is quite a range of keywords we may run with and some make more sense than others.</p>
<p>“Running shoes,” though it may be technically accurate to our imagined business, it’s not quite as specific as we would like. We’re trying to sell womens running shoes, so this head term may be too short and likely not where we want to focus.</p>
<p>If you’re ever on the fence about whether a head term is too broad, a quick search can usually answer your question.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/running-shoes-serp.png" alt="serp for running shoes" width="720" height="703" class="size-full wp-image-70507 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/running-shoes-serp.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/running-shoes-serp-480x469.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As you can see above, “running shoes” is a super broad mix of results and if we’re trying to target just women’s shoes, this likely isn’t a good fit and should be on the list.</p>
<p>But on the flip side, you might wonder about the usage of “best running shoes for women” vs “running shoes womens.” While they might seem similar, you can get a wide range of performance within those terms.</p>
<p>Take a look at the Google Ads Keyword Planner for these two variants:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-top-of-page-bid.png" alt="google keyword planner keyword research " width="720" height="197" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70508" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-top-of-page-bid.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-top-of-page-bid-480x131.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>While both might feel like they’re basically the same, by adding “best” and “for” you’ve extended the keyword from 3-5 words and effectively created a long tail term.</p>
<p>You can see that both have a healthy amount of estimated volume, but more so, the costs are quite a bit different for the long tail.</p>
<p>Whether you’re looking at the top or the bottom of the estimated click cost range, the five-word long tail version is anywhere from 15% to 56% cheaper than the three-word head term.</p>
<p>By having both of these keywords in your account, you’re taking advantage of the higher volume head term, but also saving a bit on more specific queries that your longer tail keyword will likely match for.</p>
<p>Just because it feels like keywords are the same or one will cover the other, that doesn’t always mean it’s true or is the right thing to do in terms of performance.</p>
<h3>Suggestion</h3>
<p>Always start by adding in the long tail variants that have estimated volume in your account. You may end up with some of those pesky “redundant keyword” alerts from Google, but it’s best to let the performance speak for itself. We’ll talk later about how to monitor these keywords and decide whether to keep them around or make some changes.</p>
<h2>Challenge #4: Match type myopia</h2>
<p>Over the years, there have been tons of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/27/google-ads-match-type-update-2021-explained">changes to how match types work within Search campaigns</a>. In the past, Exact was exact, Phrase matched only to phrases, and Broad was, well, way less broad than it is now.</p>
<p>But in many accounts, whether from lack of knowledge or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/06/broad-match-smart-bidding">pressure from Google</a>, many accounts have only Broad match keywords set up without having any others in place.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-match-types-lawn-mowing.png" alt="google ads match types diagram" width="720" height="542" class="size-full wp-image-70509 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-match-types-lawn-mowing.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/keyword-match-types-lawn-mowing-480x361.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The problem is, these match types work very differently and depending on which ones you use, you may or may not see success with Search campaigns.</p>
<p>Broad match can be very, very broad and end up targeting a number of search terms that are not relevant to your business.</p>
<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>

<p><span></div></div></span></p>
<h3>Suggestion</h3>
<p>Rather than starting with Broad match keywords, I suggest you always start with Phrase and Exact match terms first. These are more restrictive, but can still give you scale with Phrase.</p>
<p>If you’re seeing good, sustained success with them after a few months, you can start to expand into Broad match, but again, there are a handful of other things I would suggest doing first and then best practices for implementation that you can find in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/06/broad-match-smart-bidding">this post</a>.</p>
<h2>Challenge #5: Keyword list maintenance</h2>
<p>I’ve saved my favorite problem for last. The set it and forget it folks are the ones who may or may not have done their due diligence in the original campaign build out and paid attention to all of the other notes above…but then never made any ongoing changes to their keywords. They never evolved. The campaigns are the same as they were however many years ago when they were set up.</p>
<p>Now, if your performance is strong, this might not be a bad thing. But in most scenarios we see, if an account was set up over a year ago and hasn’t had any changes made in the meantime, it’s likely not keeping pace with where it did on day one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever gone to clear out all of the open browser tabs on your smartphone and gotten a kick out of all the different things you searched over the past few weeks? We turn to Google for so many things, from health concerns to hose patches to houses for sale.  This, of course, gives businesses an abundance of opportunities to get in front of their target audience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/keyword-intent-funnel-example.png" alt="keyword intent funnel" width="575" height="473" class="aligncenter wp-image-63347" />But just as diverse as your search history is the intent behind the keywords your potential customers are searching online. Commercial intent keywords are the most valuable to your business, but they are not one-size-fits all. In this article, we’re going to look at what commercial intent keywords are and how to use them to make the most of your marketing budget.</p>

<h2>What are commercial intent keywords?</h2>
<p>Commerical intent keywords are those typed into search engines by consumers looking to buy or educate themselves in order to buy. Put another way, they are basically invitations from prospective customers to tempt them with your wares. They tell you, loud and clear, that they have money in their hands (or burning holes in their pockets), and they want what you’re selling.</p>
<p>For context, there are four <a href="/blog/ws/2012/12/10/three-types-of-search-queries">types of search queries</a>:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/keyword-intent-four-types.png" alt="the four types of keyword intent" width="720" height="441" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61610" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/keyword-intent-four-types.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/keyword-intent-four-types-480x294.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Informational:</strong> answer questions or learn something</li>
<li><strong>Navigational: </strong>locate a specific website</li>
<li><strong>Transactional:</strong> buy something</li>
<li><strong>Commercial:</strong> explore/investigate in order to buy</li>
</ul>
<p>Commercial and transactional keywords often overlap, and if you think of keywords as signals from prospective customers, these are the most promising.<br />
<a></a></p>
<h2>The importance of keyword intent</h2>
<p>Keywords come in all shapes in sizes. While they all have one thing in common—that they&#8217;re entered into search engines by consumers—they differ widely in what the user is trying to achieve when they search it. This is what we mean by keyword intent. For example, someone searching &#8220;do i need a lawyer?&#8221; has different intent than someone searching &#8220;workers compensation lawyer san diego.&#8221;</p>
<p>As such, how you choose to get in front of your target audience for any given keyword needs to align with the intent of that keyword. For the former, you might target that keyword with an organic blog post or checklist. Your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/01/content-marketing-funnel">content marketing funnel</a> enables you to get in front of the customer early, make a good impression, and build trust. Maybe later on, they&#8217;ll come back when they need you.</p>
<p>For the latter, this person is more likely to be a hot lead, and this is a perfect use-case for PPC, because you can be sure your targeted ad is right at the top of the search results, and you’re willing to pay to make sure you get the lead.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re looking to succeed with your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/26/intent-marketing"> intent marketing</a>, what kinds of keywords can be considered to have high commercial intent?</p>

<h2>Examples of commercial intent keywords</h2>
<p>Although there are many commercial intent keywords, some are “stronger” than others.</p>
<p>Firstly, there are two main categories of keywords with high commercial intent: “buy now” keywords and “product” keywords. Let’s take a look at what this means and how they differ.</p>
<h3>Investigative commercial intent keywords</h3>
<p>These are the words and phrases a person will use when they&#8217;re solution- or brand-aware and are looking to learn more about their options. Keyword modifiers for these types of searches include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Affordable</li>
<li>Best</li>
<li>Cheapest</li>
<li>Comparison</li>
<li>Review</li>
<li>Top</li>
<li>Vs</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/commercial-intent-search-example-crm.png" alt="SERP for a commercial intent keyword search - &quot;best CRM for small business&quot;" width="720" height="425" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63268" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/commercial-intent-search-example-crm.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/commercial-intent-search-example-crm-480x283.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Buy now commercial intent keywords</h3>
<p>These are technically transactional intent keywords, but like I said earlier, transactional and commercial can overlap. This category of keywords signals that the prospect, as the name implies, is ready to buy something or engage right now. They’ve made up their mind to buy, and they’re looking for an attractive offer that meets their expectations.</p>
<p>“Buy now” keywords include terms like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy</li>
<li>Order</li>
<li>Discount(s)</li>
<li>Deal(s)</li>
<li>Coupon(s)</li>
<li>Free shipping</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Buy&#8221; and &#8220;order&#8221; are the strongest, as this is a prospect’s pure declaration of intent to part ways with their cash in exchange for whatever you’re selling. The others are also strong buying signals, but also indicate that the prospect wants or expects you to differentiate yourself from your competition in the form of incentives.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/commercial-intent-keyword-example-buy.png" alt="commercial intent search example for &quot;buy potting soil&quot;" width="720" height="383" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63266" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/commercial-intent-keyword-example-buy.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/commercial-intent-keyword-example-buy-480x255.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Local commercial intent keywords</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that some keywords have both commercial and local intent, like</p>
<ul>
<li>Open now</li>
<li>Near me</li>
<li>[Product/service name] + location</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/local-commercial-intent-keyword-example.png" alt="local commercial intent keyword example" width="720" height="522" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63334" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/local-commercial-intent-keyword-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/local-commercial-intent-keyword-example-480x348.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>These keywords can apply to keyword bidding in Google ads, but other ways to capitalize on these queries are through <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local SEO</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/11/google-local-services-ads-tips">Google Local Services Ads</a>. For example, the query &#8220;landscaping boston&#8221; pulls up search ads:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/local-commercial-intent-search-example.png" alt="local commercial intent SERP for &quot;landscaping boston&quot;" width="720" height="541" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63335" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/local-commercial-intent-search-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/local-commercial-intent-search-example-480x361.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But for a smaller city, you may only see Google Business profiles and local listings, indicating that your priority here is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/03/google-my-business-optimization">optimize your Google Business Profile </a>and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/best-free-business-listing-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local listings</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/local-commercial-intent-serp-gbp.png" alt="SERP for a local commercial intent search" width="720" height="452" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63336" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/local-commercial-intent-serp-gbp.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/local-commercial-intent-serp-gbp-480x301.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Product/service commercial intent keywords</h3>
<p>The next most valuable commercial intent keywords are “product” keywords. Although these keywords typically convert highly, prospects may be slightly more hesitant to purchase immediately than those using “buy now” keywords.</p>
<p>“Product” keywords include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Branded searches (Dell laptop)</li>
<li>Specific products (iPhone 5c)</li>
<li>Product categories (insect repellant, beach accessories)</li>
</ul>
<p>Commercial intent keywords for services include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rent</li>
<li>Hourly rate</li>
<li>Consultation</li>
<li>Free trial</li>
<li>Service, agency, company, firm (tax prep services, advertising company)</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/commercial-intent-keyword-example-service.png" alt="SERP for a commercial intent search for &quot;advertising services&quot;" width="720" height="410" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63269" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/commercial-intent-keyword-example-service.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/commercial-intent-keyword-example-service-480x273.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Some of these keywords will be more valuable than others, depending on the nature of your business. For example, product-specific keywords and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/03/19/why-bid-on-branded-terms-ppc">branded keywords</a> are savagely competitive, but convert very well. Although “comparison” and “review” keywords may not seem as strong as some of the others, these keywords can still convert highly as the intent to purchase is still there – the prospect might just make you work harder for the conversion.</p>
<h4>Lead vs product searches</h4>
<p>When creating a list of product keywords, it’s important to note the distinction between lead and product searches. For example, in the lawyer example below, the prospect isn’t looking to hire a lawyer right away. This means that although the prospect is considered a hot lead, the potential customer probably still needs to <a href="/blog/ws/2014/06/24/call-tracking-software">call the business</a> to discuss their situation further.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/commercial-intent-keyword-search-lawyer.png" alt="commercial intent keyword example - search for &quot;criminal justice lawyer&quot;" width="720" height="544" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63267" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/commercial-intent-keyword-search-lawyer.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/commercial-intent-keyword-search-lawyer-480x363.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For these reasons, “best” might be considered the strongest product keyword for a service-based business like a workman’s comp attorney (as well as “free consultation”). Product searches, on the other hand, can be completed entirely online and focus solely on a specific product, so product keywords such as “affordable” and “cheapest” are likely to be the most effective (and highly competitive).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/consultation-SERP.png" alt="SERP for a consultation keyword search" width="720" height="518" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63337" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/consultation-SERP.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/consultation-SERP-480x345.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /><br />
<a></a></p>
<h2>Why are commercial intent keywords more valuable than high-volume keywords?</h2>
<p>Some businesses spend thousands of dollars to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/17/website-visibility"> maximize their visibility</a>. This is all well and good, and high traffic is always a good thing, but if the vast majority of your visitors aren’t buying what you’re selling, it might be time to reconsider your approach.</p>
<p>Unless you’re one of those ad-supported <a href="/blog/ws/2014/07/15/clickbait">clickbait</a> sites like BuzzFeed, high-traffic keywords aren&#8217;t worth much unless they’re driving conversions. This isn&#8217;t to say you shouldn&#8217;t go after big keywords with less commercial intent, but it makes more sense to target these keywords with organic content that is higher up in the purchasing funnel.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/keyword-volume-vs-intent.png" alt="keyword volume vs intent" width="720" height="455" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63345" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/keyword-volume-vs-intent.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/keyword-volume-vs-intent-480x303.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>On the other hand, high commercial intent keywords are best suited to paid search campaigns for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paid search ads get you placement at the very top of the page</li>
<li>You can make tweaks and adjustments to optimize for cost per click, cost per lead, cost per conversion and other metrics</li>
<li>Ad types like <a href="/blog/ws/2014/04/14/google-shopping-ads">Shopping Ads</a> are highly attractive to searchers with commercial intent and tend to <a href="/blog/ws/2013/06/05/product-listing-ads-stealing-conversions">get the clicks from people who are ready to buy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that while you can&#8217;t target keywords with shopping ads, you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/25/google-shopping-ads-priority-bidding-structure">structure your campaigns out using the priority feature</a> so that Google will adjust your bids based on intent.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-shopping-priority-bidding-structure.png" alt="" width="715" height="497" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50683" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-shopping-priority-bidding-structure.png 715w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-shopping-priority-bidding-structure-480x334.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 715px, 100vw" /></p>

<h2>How to find high commercial intent keywords</h2>
<p>When it comes to keywords with strong commercial intent, one size definitely doesn’t fit all, so how do you go about identifying these keywords in the first place? There are several ways you can begin to identify high commercial intent keywords, regardless of what kind of business you run or your desired conversion outcomes. Let’s take a look at a couple of them.</p>
<h3>1. WordStream&#8217;s Free Keyword Tool</h3>
<p>To kick off your keyword research, you can use <strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">WordStream&#8217;s Free Keyword Tool</a></strong>. Simply enter a seed keyword into the search box and include your industry and location (optional).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/free-keyword-tool-search-example.png" alt="wordstream free keyword tool search example" width="720" height="398" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63271" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/free-keyword-tool-search-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/free-keyword-tool-search-example-480x265.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Then you&#8217;ll get results with monthly search volume, top-of-page bid, and competition.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/free-keyword-tool-results-example.png" alt="wordstream free keyword tool results example" width="720" height="514" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63270" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/free-keyword-tool-results-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/free-keyword-tool-results-example-480x343.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>2. Google Ads Keyword Planner</h3>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the Google Ads Keyword Planner is one of the best ways to identify commercial intent keywords. Access it from the “Tools and Settings” tab then select “Discover new keywords.&#8221;<br />
Now, enter your product or service in the search field. For this example, I used “buy iPhone,” a fiercely competitive product-specific keyword. After a moment, you’ll be presented with a graph of search volume trends (notice the spike in September when Apple holds its annual event).</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/google-ads-keyword-planner-results-iphone.png" alt="google keyword planner results for iphone" width="720" height="433" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63339" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/google-ads-keyword-planner-results-iphone.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/google-ads-keyword-planner-results-iphone-480x289.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></div>
<p>But if you scroll down, you&#8217;ll see keyword ideas where you can identify the high commercial intent keywords you’re interested in.</p>
<p>In the following figure, notice how “buy iphone”  and &#8220;cheap iphones&#8221; have the highest suggested bids, by far? This is because they&#8217;re <strong>very</strong> high commercial intent keyword, and competition for them is intense.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/google-ads-keyword-planner-results-buy-iphone.png" alt="commercial intent keywords - google ads keyword planner results" width="720" height="257" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63340" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/google-ads-keyword-planner-results-buy-iphone.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/google-ads-keyword-planner-results-buy-iphone-480x171.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></div>
<h3>3. Google Analytics</h3>
<p>Another way you can determine which keywords are driving conversions is by using Google Analytics. Go to Acquisition &gt; Google Ads &gt; Keywords and you&#8217;ll see your top-performing keywords and how they relate to your conversion goals.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/commercial-intent-keywords-google-analytics.png" alt="commercial intent keywords in google analytics" width="720" height="236" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63342" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/commercial-intent-keywords-google-analytics.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/commercial-intent-keywords-google-analytics-480x157.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></div>
<ul>
<li>Your top 10 (by default) keywords are displayed in the far-left column.</li>
<li>The goal you wish to measure against can be changed via the drop-down menu circled in the figure above.</li>
<li>The three columns beneath the goal you’re currently viewing correspond to the percentage of visits that converted (column one), the total number of conversions (column two) and the monetary value of those conversions (column three)</li>
<li>Note that if you do not have monetary values assigned to your goals, all values in column three will be zero.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, what does all this mean? Well, first of all, your top-performing keyword might not necessarily be the one that resulted in the most conversions. In the figure above, the first keyword in the list drove the most traffic (by a considerable margin), but the third keyword actually had the highest percentage of sessions that resulted in a conversion.<br />
Now that you’ve figured out how your keywords impact actual conversions, ask yourself: How many high commercial intent keywords are in your top 10? If you don’t see any, it might be time to start adding some of these keywords in your Google Ads account.</p>
<p>Even if your top-performers are doing well, how much better could your conversion rate be if you targeted high commercial intent keywords as well? Of course, this will likely have an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/15/google-ads-budget-report">impact on your budget</a> as we saw in the “iphone” example above, high commercial intent keywords often have a significantly higher suggested bid and CPC, so be sure to bear this in mind if you choose to throw your hat in the ring.</p>
<h2>Commercial intent: Show me the money</h2>
<p>Targeting high commercial <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-google-ads-keywords">intent keywords</a> can result in dramatic improvements to your click-through rates and offer you an excellent opportunity to focus on what really matters – conversions. Add some high commercial intent keywords to your Google Ads account and get ready to shut up and take their money.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve heard of its magical powers. Digital marketers swear by it, saying it can uncover some of the highest intent, most searched keywords in your industry.</p>
<p>Competitor keyword analysis.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/competitor-keyword-analysis-venn.png" alt="competitor keyword venn diagram" width="526" height="328" class="aligncenter wp-image-61752" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/competitor-keyword-analysis-venn.png 526w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/competitor-keyword-analysis-venn-480x299.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 526px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But there are tons of competitors to sift through, hundreds of different tools you could use, and even more keywords to consider. How in the world can you harness that magic without spending hundreds of hours?</p>
<p>By following a proven process that sifts through all the noise. In this post I’m going to walk you through the process I’ve used at my agency, Rank Tree, to usurp competitors, <em>Game of Thrones</em>-style<em>,</em> on my clients’ behalf.</p>
<h3>Table of contents</h3>
<ul>

<li><a href="#how">How to do competitor keyword analysis</a></li>

</ul>
<p><a id="what"></a></p>
<h2>What is a competitor keyword analysis?</h2>
<p>A competitor keyword analysis is the process of figuring out the queries your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/competitive-analysis">competitors</a> are ranking for in search results, and reverse engineering what they did to outrank them.</p>
<p>It can be used for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide">doing keyword research for both SEO and PPC</a>, and is one of the quickest and easiest ways to find the highest intent <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/keyword-prioritization">keywords</a> for your business (meaning those that lead to conversions on your website and sales).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/semrush-competitor-keyword-analysis.png" alt="competitor keyword analysis example using semrush" width="460" height="383" class="aligncenter wp-image-61484" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.semrush.com/features/organic-research/?second_level_id=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>And I can verify this. Competitor keywords, in just about every campaign we do, are one of the biggest factors in the SEO decisions we make.</p>
<p>But despite its wonderful powers, a lot of people do it wrong. And making the same common mistakes other people do can completely sabotage you. That’s what we’ll avoid in the process below.<br />
<a id="how"></a></p>
<h2>How to do quick &amp; effective competitor keyword analysis</h2>
<p>Use this process to find what I call <strong>golden keywords</strong>: high-intent, high-volume keywords that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/11/14/how-to-rank-for-a-keyword">your site can rank for</a> quickly.</p>
<h3>Step #1: Understand what your customers search</h3>
<p>One of the most common mistakes people make with SEO and PPC in general is chasing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/01/23/keyword-search-volume">keywords with high volume</a>. This is deadly because ranking for a high volume keyword doesn’t always (and often doesn’t) translate into leads and conversions.</p>
<p>For example, the keyword &#8220;content marketing&#8221; has a monthly search volume of 14,000. I could rank my site for this keyword and get thousands of visitors, but none of them are going to turn into customers. The people searching that phrase in Google are simply trying to figure out what content marketing is. Most of them likely aren’t looking to purchase content marketing services.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/keyword-intent-volume.png" alt="keyword volume vs likelihood of conversion " width="534" height="330" class="aligncenter wp-image-61477" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/keyword-intent-volume.png 534w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/keyword-intent-volume-480x297.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 534px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>That’s why figuring out what your customers actually search in Google before you begin this process is so important. To do this, you need to know far more than just your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience&#8217;s</a> demographics. You need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Questions they ask</li>
<li>Problems they struggle with</li>
<li>Goals they have</li>
<li>Things they talk about</li>
</ul>
<p>This helps you map out keywords based on things your customers think and struggle with while they’re at the top, middle, and bottom of your funnel. And this context is what separates sites with tons of traffic but no conversions from sites with tons of traffic <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/website-conversion">tons of conversions</a>. If you need help with this, I created this <a href="https://blog.writesonic.com/how-to-create-a-content-plan-that-drives-traffic-and-leads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">step-by-step process for mapping keywords to your funnel</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/keyword-funnel.png" alt="keyword intent funnel" width="538" height="465" class="aligncenter wp-image-61478" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/keyword-funnel.png 538w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/keyword-funnel-480x414.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 538px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Blog_InContentTextLink_FKT"><strong><em>Not sure what your audience is searching? Use our Free Keyword Tool to find out!</em></strong></a></p>
<h3>Step #2: Determine your top 3 competitors</h3>
<p>With a mile-deep knowledge of what your potential customers search in Google, it’s time to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/18/ppc-competitor-analysis">identify your top competitors</a>.</p>
<p>There are likely hundreds of different companies providing products or services that are somewhat similar to yours, but for this exercise, we need to identify your main <strong>three</strong> competitors.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons I recommend only looking for your top three competitors:</p>
<ol>
<li>No one has time to perform competitor keyword research on 100 competitors.</li>
<li>Your closest competitors are your best bet for finding the highest intent keywords in your market.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the 80/20 of competitor keyword research and I’ve found tons of amazing keywords countless times from only researching three competitors.</p>
<p><strong>We’re looking for those competitors who are the bane of your existence. The ones who:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Target the same customer base.</li>
<li>Are most similar to you (in terms of products or services).</li>
<li>Stay on your mind the most.</li>
</ul>
<p><a id="tools"></a></p>
<h3>Step 3. Select your competitor keyword analysis tools</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/09/competitor-keywords">tool you use to find competitor keywords</a> can make or break you. Why? Because the metrics these tools provide dictate which keywords you decide to go after, and some tools have more accurate metrics than others.</p>
<p>I recommend going with more well-known tools with access to tons of data because they will have more accurate metrics on just how much a term gets searched and how competitive it is. I usually use a combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>SEO tools like Ahrefs and Semrush to identify the keywords.</li>
<li>Reporting tools like Google Search Console and <a href="https://measuremindsgroup.com/set-up-and-understand-google-analytics-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics 4</a> to make comparisons between your competitive analysis and the existing traffic coming to your site. You may find you’re already hitting some of the keywords bubbling up in your research and that your content just needs refinement (can we interest you in some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/05/blog-post-templates">SEO-optimized blog post templates</a>?).</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/competitor-keyword-analysis-search-console.png" alt="google search console search appearance report" width="720" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61486" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/competitor-keyword-analysis-search-console.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/competitor-keyword-analysis-search-console-480x280.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>I’m not suggesting these are the <em>only </em>tools you should use–just make sure you understand (at a high level) how a tool is calculating its metrics. Pass on any tool that doesn’t have a track record of accurate data and calculations. Too many people completely ignore this to their own peril.</p>
<h3>Step #4: Analyze your competitors&#8217; URLs</h3>
<p>Now we’re down to the good stuff. Grab the URLs of your top three competitors selected in Step #2 and use your tool of choice to analyze the keywords they rank for.</p>
<p>Most tools will have some version of a “Site Explorer” like Ahrefs has where you can see paid keywords, organic keywords, backlinks, rankings, and more for whatever URL you enter.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/competitor-keyword-analysis-example.png" alt="competitor keyword analysis example in ahrefs" width="720" height="372" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61480" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/competitor-keyword-analysis-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/competitor-keyword-analysis-example-480x248.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>In this example, I filtered the keywords to contain &#8220;how to&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Some tools also have keyword or content gap reports where you can enter multiple competitors and compare their rankings to yours with the click of a button. This is ahrefs&#8217; Content Gap tool:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/content-gap-example.png" alt="competitor keyword analysis - example of ahrefs content gap" width="720" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61481" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/content-gap-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/content-gap-example-480x300.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And this is Semrush&#8217;s Gap Analysis tool:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/semrush-content-gap-example.png" alt="semrush content gap example" width="720" height="304" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61487" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/semrush-content-gap-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/semrush-content-gap-example-480x203.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>5. Identify your golden keywords</h3>
<p>Regardless of which tool you use, the key here is identifying keywords your competitors rank for that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Drive the right kind of visitors (i.e. they drive customers, not just visitors).</li>
<li>You can <a href="https://themistakenman.com/best-ai-content-writing-softwares/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create content</a> (or optimize existing content) for that’s better than your competitors.</li>
<li>Have enough search volume to be worth investing towards.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the “golden keywords” we talked about in Step #1—the ones you should try to steal from your competitors. This will be largely subjective based on a number of factors, like whether you&#8217;re performing this analysis for SEO or PPC and what your goals are.<br />
<a id="template"></a></p>
<p>This Google Sheet template will enable you to organize your keywords by whatever criteria makes the most sense, whether that&#8217;s search volume, competition, stage of funnel, or intent.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/competitor-keyword-analysis-template.png" alt="competitor keyword analysis template" width="720" height="167" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61501" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/competitor-keyword-analysis-template.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/competitor-keyword-analysis-template-480x111.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SmAGaAezzJ9DAoIdf6iu_wqACeCHcj9MFT4_irOvaHc/copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Click here to make a copy of this template.</em></a></p>
<h4>Always, always actually Google the keyword</h4>
<p>This is the easiest way to figure out what kind of visitors you can expect. Google wants to give people the best answer to their query, so we can reasonably assume that the top-ranking results provide the best answers (in Google’s opinion) in most cases.</p>
<p>Sometimes you’ll find a keyword you think is a home run and then the SERP will show completely irrelevant results or a branded term for a product, service, or company that you’d never want to waste your time on.</p>
<h4>Don’t just look at keyword difficulty metrics</h4>
<p>Generally speaking, keyword difficulty metrics measure the number of links the top-ranking URLs have for a particular keyword. They aren’t 100% accurate measurements of how hard it will be to rank.</p>
<p>That’s why I recommend also looking at the Domain Rating (DR) or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/12/domain-authority">Domain Authority (DA)</a> of each of the top results for any keywords you’re considering. Sometimes you’ll see a keyword that a tool says is “very hard” with super-low DR sites (like 20) in the top 10, and vice versa. This is usually an indicator that it’s actually easier or harder to rank for than the difficulty metrics claim.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/domain-authority-example-moz-serp-analysis.png" alt="domain authority - moz serp analysis example" width="600" height="441" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55534" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/domain-authority-example-moz-serp-analysis.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/domain-authority-example-moz-serp-analysis-480x353.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>Make competitive keyword analysis a staple in your PPC &amp; SEO strategies</h2>
<p>Competitive keyword research helps you quickly and easily uncover the best keywords in your niche. It’s by far the most fruitful strategy I’ve used, and I know many people who almost solely find their keywords this way.</p>
<p>Remember, this is a quality over quantity game. The right traffic is better than a lot of traffic. And this process will help you define the “right” traffic for your site. Approach this with a “reverse engineering” mindset.</p>
<p>You have the best chance to take your competitors’ keywords when you beat them at their own game and provide Google with the answers it’s looking for.</p>
<p>To recap, here&#8217;s how to do a competitor keyword analysis:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understand the terms your audience searches</li>
<li>Choose your tools</li>
<li>Identify your top three competitors</li>
<li>Plug them into the tool</li>
<li>Find your golden keywords</li>
</ol>

<h3>1. Keyword suggestions</h3>
<p>Of course, a blog post about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/12/21/seo-keyword-research-ideas">keyword ideas</a> should start with the Keyword Suggestions tool, but this is the best place to start for my other recommendations in this post. Take the list of keywords you are trying to expand and paste them in Excel. Highlight those keywords and click on the Keyword Suggestions. You will then get a list of new potential keywords and stats based on the past month.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="c155d0e6-9e39-4a71-8ebd-2671f6ab048b" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Microsoft20Advertising20Intelligence20Tools20keyword20suggestions-1.png" alt="Microsoft Advertising Intelligence Tools keyword suggestions" width="800" height="484" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>The first column will show you the keywords you had in your list. The second column will give you a variety of keyword recommendations based upon your original list. You can then assess a variety of metrics such as potential volume, bid estimates, and more.</p>
<p>Looking for some ideas of what to try? The most common list would be a list of your converting keywords. We always want to find more of what is working right? The next list I would take would be a list of converting search queries. <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/10/modified-broad-match-going-away">Match types</a> are becoming more and more irrelevant. So the list of queries people type in is not the same as a list of keywords you are targeting.</p>
<p>Try both in this tool. This is the easiest way to find new suggestions in Microsoft Advertising Intelligence, but we’re far from done. There are a variety of other tools I am going to talk about that can help verify if these initial keyword suggestions are either worth pursuing more options or even adding to your account.</p>

<h3>2. Traffic</h3>
<p>After you have your list of suggested keywords from Microsoft Advertising Intelligence, highlight the list of new keywords. Then go back up to the top navigation bar, and click on the Traffic button. You can then create a new report from your selected keyword grouping to see a shorter list of keywords by device and number of searches from the previous month.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="c5aacac9-831f-4660-b4f6-cc141574b730" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Microsoft20Advertising20Intelligence20Tools20traffic-1.png" alt="Microsoft Advertising Intelligence Tools traffic" width="800" height="650" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>While it is similar to the original Keyword Suggestion export, the Traffic view is an “easier to digest” report. Since the Traffic view doesn’t break up the keywords by match type, we can see a consolidated view of the suggested keywords. Many times you will only need a quick scan of the list to easily find which options will actually have volume that will make an impact on any additional you add to your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/14/microsoft-ads-if-functions">campaigns</a>.</p>
<h3>3. Age group &amp; gender</h3>
<p>If you are trying to reach a very specific audience with your Search campaigns, you may want to check out the Age Group &amp; Gender tool which also lives under the “More Research” option in the top navigation. Highlight your desired list of new keywords to see traffic percentages broken by, you guessed it, age and gender on the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/03/differences-between-google-ads-and-microsoft-ads">Microsoft Network</a>.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="d579559a-de1a-481a-bbb7-8bc81335f473" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Microsoft20Advertising20Intelligence20Tools20age20group20and20gender-1.png" alt="Microsoft Advertising Intelligence Tools age group and gender" width="800" height="655" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>While the age and gender columns are right next to each other, the percentage totals are separated between the two. The five age columns will total to 100%, and the gender columns will total to another 100%. This tool has helped me for certain clients who are trying to reach a specific age range, gender, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>Sometimes a list of relevant keywords a client wants to target are searched a lot, but not by the main audience they are trying to reach. I can go back to them with this information to show them we may need to bid lower on these keywords or <a href="/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide">research new ones altogether</a> if it makes sense. I understand this tool may not be as important to some accounts, but I still wanted to touch upon it.</p>
<h3>4. Associated keywords</h3>
<p>Besides just getting a list of keyword ideas, you can use the Associated Keywords option (found in the More Research button) to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/09/competitor-keywords">find keywords that other advertisers are bidding on</a>. We do not get information on who is bidding on these keywords, but it can give you some idea on which keyword opportunities might be more valuable.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="64548629-9cb9-41b0-9948-b9f9f508c3c2" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Microsoft20Advertising20Intelligence20Tools20associated20keywords-1.png" alt="Microsoft Advertising Intelligence Tools associated keywords" width="800" height="566" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>While these keywords may have value, you might keep in mind that these keywords may also be more competitive. Possibly put this new list of keywords in the standard Keyword Planner and get information on the possible spend it will take to be successful.</p>
<h3>5. Webpage keywords</h3>
<p>Under the More Research button in the top navigation, you can choose to research keywords by specific URLs. Maybe you want to take a list of URLs that consist of popular products or products you need help <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">driving more traffic.</a> Take a list of those URLs and paste them into an Excel sheet. Then you can have Microsoft scan that list of keyword suggestions based upon the content of those pages.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="b8c9b34f-2e9a-4bfd-8be6-405d66660717" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Microsoft20Advertising20Intelligence20Tools20webpage20keywords-1.png" alt="Microsoft Advertising Intelligence Tools webpage keywords" width="800" height="631" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>In the image above you only see the results from one URL, but there were others included in the results. Initially the export will be sorted by the Input URL so you can run this on many URLs at once. Most likely not every keyword recommendation you will see in the export is worth targeting in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/25/bings-ads-vs-google-adwords">Search campaigns</a>. Handpick the keywords that are relevant. Then take that new list and run more Keyword Suggestion and Traffic reports to see if you can find even more relevant keywords related to your product URLs.</p>
<h3>6. Keyword performance</h3>
<p>I am going to pretend the list of keyword suggestions from the Webpage Keywords results was to my liking. I can then highlight those keywords and click on the Keyword Performance options to get recent, historical performance of these keywords solely on the Bing Network. Before I generate the performance list, I can choose which device and <a href="/blog/ws/2011/04/05/google-vs-bing-match-types">keyword match type</a> I want to review in the export.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="5addbcaf-e88a-4caf-9424-68963a3fe7a2" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Microsoft20Advertising20Intelligence20Tools20keyword20performance-1.png" alt="Microsoft Advertising Intelligence Tools keyword performance" width="800" height="651" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>In the view above, I sorted the list by the most impressions. I also added a keyword filter to make sure every keyword recommendation included “lightsaber.” Now we can see how these suggested keywords have recently performed on the Microsoft Advertising Search Network. Right away I can see which keywords could drive the most traffic as well as what I could expect to pay for each click using Microsoft Ads.</p>
<p>While I only used one scenario for the Keyword Performance tool, you can use this tool for any keyword list you have pulled up. I definitely recommend <a href="/blog/ws/2020/02/20/cross-platform-keyword-research-tools">trying this tool</a> for any opportunity list you think is ready to use in your campaigns as one last confirmation check.</p>
<p>I also like to use this tool for potential cost estimates a client could request. But since this will only show keyword estimates on the Bing Network, I would want to see what all of my new keyword suggestions could potentially bring in Google which brings me to my last suggestion.</p>
<h2>Test your keywords in Google</h2>
<p>After I feel I have exhausted all ideas in my current research phase in Microsoft, I will then take my various keyword suggestion lists and test them out in Google. Many times I will see keywords with little to no search volume in Microsoft show up in Google’s Keyword Planner tool.</p>
<p>I have grown to like Microsoft Advertising Intelligence as my starting ground because it is a lot easier for me to come up with initial lists and research even more options without having to start over. It is extremely convenient to research a variety of opportunities all within one Excel Worksheet.</p>
<p>You can then also flip the scenario. If you have found keywords working in Google, you can use those suggestions to see if they are worth targeting in Microsoft Ads as well.</p>
<h2>Microsoft Advertising Intelligence can work for any paid search account</h2>
<p>For a free tool, Advertising Intelligence is pretty robust. There are many other features this tool offers, and I only went through the few I would use when getting started. Take some time to download the tool and find out which features work best for you. You can also use the tools in a variety of combinations to keep expanding your lists. You do not have to go in just the same order as I ran through in this post. Do whatever makes sense to find the right keywords for your campaign goals.</p>

Today, the key to crafting amazing content is <em>context</em>. And for good reason: o<span lang="EN">ver <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-reaffirms-15-searches-new-never-searched-273786" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15% of Google’s daily searches</a> are new terms that users have never searched before.

<p><span lang="EN">With Googlers finding so many different and unique ways of searching for common issues, this is precisely the reason why LSI keywords have become such a large part of Google&#8217;s ranking factors. <span lang="EN">From an SEO perspective, using LSI keywords has very positive results. By using them in your content, you will be able to boost its contextuality and improve your search visibility. </span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">In this article, I’m going to provide everything you need to know about LSI keywords so that you improve your SEO, drive more relevant traffic to your site, and attract more customers. I will cover:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">What LSI keywords are;</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">The key benefits of LSI keywords;</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">What LSI means for SEO; </span></li>

<p><span lang="EN">So if you&#8217;re ready, let&#8217;s get started.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span lang="EN">What are LSI keywords?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Google has been talking about the importance of LSI keywords since 2015. However, they haven&#8217;t spent a lot of time explaining to Internet marketers exactly what LSI keywords are. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">LSI stands for Latent Semantic Index(ing). This is a computer program that is designed to learn a wide variety of synonyms based on context. It’s a method that uses mathematical techniques to find relationships between words and concepts within a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/12/28/content-marketing-advice">piece of content</a>.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/lsi20keywords20diagram.png" alt="LSI keywords diagram" width="800" height="402" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://organiksoft.com/what-are-lsi-keywords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">Here’s a more practical definition of LSI keywords: </span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN">In terms of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/01/17/seo-content-beginners-guide">SEO</a> (search engine optimization), LSI keywords are search terms related to the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2010/07/21/blog-keyword-targeting">main keyword you are targeting</a>. They help to support your content and add more context to make it easier for both users and search engines to know what your content is about.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Both the above and below are examples of suitable LSI keywords for this post’s primary keyword, which is “<em>LSI keywords</em>”:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">What are LSI keywords</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">LSI keywords examples</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">How to use related keywords </span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Tools to find LSI keywords</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Do related keywords affect SEO</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Semantic keywords</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">As you can see, each of the phrases above is suitable for accompanying the main keyword (“LSI keywords”). </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Don’t worry if this sounds a little complicated (especially since our keyword includes the word &#8220;keyword&#8221;). Later on, we’ll look at the different ways to easily find LSI/related keywords, as well as how you can use them in your content to <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/02/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps">appear higher</a> and more frequently in relevant search results. </span></p>
<h3>Are LSI keywords the same as synonyms?</h3>
<p>While some LSI keywords can be synonyms, not all synonyms are LSI keywords. The majority of LSI keywords are <a href="/blog/ws/2021/01/13/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing">words and phrases</a> that are <em>closely related</em> to your main keyword. So, using synonyms in your posts can help your article’s on-page SEO, but synonyms aren’t LSI keywords.</p>
<p>For example, a synonym for the word “jacket” would be “coat”. However, LSI keywords for “jacket” would include words like: reversible, winter, feather down, warm, padded, puffer, and so on.</p>
<p>A good way to understand the difference between synonyms and related keywords is to perform a Google search. The suggested searches that appear in the drop-down menu are LSI keywords:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/lsi20keywords20examples_0.png" alt="lsi keywords examples" width="721" height="379" /></div>
<h3>What are the benefits of using LSI keywords?</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">As I mentioned in the introduction, there are hundreds of thousands of Google queries performed each year that have never been searched. Google has made improvements to its algorithm to factor in context so that it can better understand related keywords. Google said:</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LSI20keywords20new20searches20on20Google_1.png" alt="LSI keywords new searches on Google" width="600" height="274" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-reaffirms-15-searches-new-never-searched-273786">Source</a></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Incorporating LSI keywords into your content boosts the contextuality of your content and yields <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/08/09/long-term-value-of-seo-myth">SEO benefits</a>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>They boost your website’s ranking in search engines: </strong>Sprinkling LSI keywords throughout your text helps search engines to understand your page and boost its ranking power.</li>
<li><strong>Semantic keywords improve your content’s relevance:</strong> Adding related words also helps to ensure you don’t overload your content with keywords, aka keyword stuffing.</li>
<li><strong>Related words increase the number of people who find your content: </strong>LSI keywords also help you provide a better search experience for users, which, in turn, translates into improvements in various ranking factors, such as time spent on a page, bounce rate, and more.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Do LSI keywords have any disadvantages?</h3>
<p>LSI keywords don’t necessarily have any disadvantages, but the indexing method does have some limitations. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn’t consider the order of words and disposes of all conjunctions and prepositions.</li>
<li>It considers words to have just <em>one </em>meaning.</li>
<li>It does not recognize underlying ideas and irony. In some cases, the meaning of the words may not match the meaning of the text.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span lang="EN">When did LSI keywords become relevant?</span></h2>
<p>If you’re wondering when LSI keywords became relevant, it all began in 2004 when latent semantic indexing was implemented in Google’s search algorithm. Its purpose was to assist the search engine in providing users with more relevant results.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/lsi20keywords20relevant20results.png" alt="lsi keywords relevant results" width="800" height="679" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">Google can produce relevant results for even figurative language.</span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">But, Google wasn’t just focused on keywords. The search giant also wanted to understand anchor text in hyperlinks, as well as groups of sites that link to each other (also known as <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/seo-street-smarts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO neighborhoods</a>). </span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">With all this in one algorithm update, Google dramatically changed the way it delivers search results. </span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN">No longer was the search engine targeting <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/exact-match">exact-match keywords</a> in web content. Now the algorithm could understand <em>context </em>and <em>synonyms</em>. <span lang="EN">Instead of looking at a single keyword and its frequency of use to find out what the page was about, Google could now analyze <em>everything </em>offered on the page.</span></span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/lsi20keywords20related20keywords.png" alt="lsi keywords related keywords" width="800" height="539" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://www.seocompetitors.com/latent-semantic-indexing/">Source</a></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">To better understand the impact of this change, let’s take a deeper dive into LSI keywords and their relationship to SEO. </span></p>
<h3>The Impact of LSI keywords on SEO</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">In the early days, Google’s crawlers, also known as “spiders”, would automatically find and scan websites by crawling from one link to another on connected web pages. As they crawled, they would look at the keywords on a page to help them identify its topic.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">For example, if you were to publish a post titled “21 Tips For Effective Email List Segmentation,” Google would scan your page to determine if you used the term “<em>email list segmentation</em>” in key areas on your website, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The title tag,</li>
<li>Content body,</li>
<li>Image alt text,</li>
<li>H1 heading, H2 and H3 subheaders, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">But, after the LSI update, Google’s crawling method changed, resulting in these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/12/local-seo">SEO improvements</a>:</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">Google understands pages better</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN">In addition to scanning your page for the main keyword, now it would also scan your page for various <em>related</em> keywords, such as: “email campaign,” “MailChimp,” “audience,” “subscribers,” “email tools,” and so on. <span lang="EN">What this means is, Google works to find out what the <em>overall </em>topic of a page is, and relies on latent semantic indexing to understand the content at a much deeper level than simply looking for multiple occurrences of a specific keyword.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">Google reads pages contextually</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Basically, Google’s algorithm now has the ability to “read” a page <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/advertising-channels/search/search-getting-smarter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the same way a human would</a>, and categorize keywords depending on the determined context. <span lang="EN">This means that the search engine can now differentiate between words based on even the <em>smallest </em>details (which is why <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/18/content-optimization">keyword mapping</a> is important). For instance, it can now tell the difference between literal and figurative expressions, like:</span></span></p>
<p class="text-align-center"><span lang="EN"> <em>“Don’t shoehorn LSI keywords into your content if they are not relevant.” </em></span></p>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">vs</span></em></p>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">“Use a shoehorn to protect shoes when you put them on.”</span></em></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">Google can generate even more relevant results</span></strong></p>
<p>According to this recent <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub45569/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research paper from Google</a>, they identify words that frequently occur together to help the bots more easily understand the main topic of the pages it scans. With more accurate categorization, results are even more relevant.</p>

<p><strong>Google incorporates the overall picture of your business</strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN">In addition to that, their algorithm is designed to weigh your business name, website, and industry to help Google get a well-rounded understanding of each page on your site as it relates to your business as a whole. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Now can you see why LSI keywords have become such an important part of the search engine’s algorithm?</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Google’s main goal is to provide searchers with the most relevant results it can—even for the 15% of search terms that have never been searched before. That is an amazing standard of quality which would be impossible for the search engine to achieve without latent semantic indexing.</span></p>
<h2>Does YouTube use LSI keywords?</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Interestingly, it should be noted that even though Google owns <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/20/youtube-marketing">YouTube</a>, they primarily run on two different search engines and algorithms. What I’ve found surprising is that it doesn’t seem that, at the time of this writing, YouTube utilizes LSI keywords for rankings.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">As a YouTube creator myself, I try to include primary keywords in the titles of my videos and rarely pay attention to LSI keywords, and the videos still rank well. The only place I’d be able to put them is in the description of the video, but it doesn’t seem like it’s required.  </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">So while YouTube searches do pull up related suggestions, there aren’t many places to insert LSI keywords.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/youtube20LSI20keywords.png" alt="youtube LSI keywords" width="625" height="547" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">Related/LSI keywords on YouTube, from our </span></em><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/05/14/how-to-get-more-views-on-youtube"><em>How to Get More Views on YouTube </em></a><em>blog post.</em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">YouTube SEO relies mainly on <a href="https://www.onehourprofessor.com/best-youtube-editing-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-quality editing</a> to increase engagement and the click-through rate of the thumbnails. Of course, I’m over-simplifying a complex algorithm, but it’s a universally accepted truth that high-quality editing, rather than LSI keywords, is the biggest factor in YouTube’s algorithm.  </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">So although LSI keywords seem to be an important factor on the Google search engine, they are not as important in the YouTube search engine.  </span></p>
<p>With that, let’s move on to the next section where you’ll discover 5 effective tools to help you find LSI keywords to use in your posts.</p>
<h2><strong><span lang="EN">How to find related keywords with LSI keyword tools</span></strong></h2>
<p>The first step in finding LSI keywords is to create a base of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide">important keywords for your business</a>. Once that’s done, coming up with related keywords will be easy. All you need is to do a little bit of research to uncover endless possibilities—and for that, you need tools. Here are five LSI keyword tools you can use to find suitable selections of related words.</p>
<h3>1. Google Autocomplete</h3>
<p>Google’s instant search feature is the simplest way to find keywords related to your main one. All you need to do is type your target keyword into Google’s search box and you will get a range of predictions as to what you might type next.</p>
<p>Look for the words that appear in bold as suggestions. Make a list of the ones that are relevant to your topic and incorporate them into your content.</p>

<h3>2. Google Related Searches</h3>
<p>You can also type your main keyword into Google and then scroll down to the bottom of the page to find the “Related Searches” section. Check out the listed terms to get more ideas for LSI keywords for your content.</p>

Look for the ones that are bolded, as in the example below.</p>

<h3>5. Serpstat</h3>
<p><a href="https://serpstat.com/">Serpstat</a> is yet another effective tool that helps you find semantically related phrases for your posts.

<p>Of course, there are many other related keyword finders out there, including <a href="https://ahrefs.com/keyword-generator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ahrefs </a>and <a href="https://moz.com/free-seo-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moz </a>SEO tools. These are great because they not only provide you with a comprehensive list of related keywords that people typically search for on the topic, but they also allow you to filter the words and phrases by connection strength, search volume, and cost per click.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to find LSI keywords using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords">free keyword research tools</a>, let’s look at the best ways to use them in your content and SEO strategy.</p>
<h2><span lang="EN">How to use LSI keywords for SEO </span></h2>
<p>The keyword generation tools mentioned above will provide you with a long list of suitable LSI keyword options for your content. Now it’s time to add them to your content and experience <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/05/08/seo-during-covid-19">SEO</a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/05/08/seo-during-covid-19">&#8216;s important benefits</a>.</p>
<h3>Choose LSI keywords best suited for your topic</h3>
<p>Before you determine how to incorporate LSI keywords into your text, you need to identify the ones best suited for your topic. For instance, if you were <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post">writing a blog post</a> targeting the main keyword “blog SEO”, the tool you’re using might spit out an endless list of options, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog seo checklist</li>
<li>Seo blog topics</li>
<li>blog post seo tips</li>
<li>Seo blogs for beginners</li>
<li>what are the advantages of seo</li>
<li>Seo blog meaning</li>
<li>Seo plugins for bloggers</li>
<li>How to write seo friendly post</li>
<li>blog seo for beginners</li>
<li>Seo latest trends</li>
<li>how to optimize your post for seo</li>
<li>&#8230;and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, most of these are good (depending on the context).</p>
<p>If you were creating a blog post for WordStream on the benefits of blogging SEO, you would pair the main keyword, “blog SEO” with relevant phrases like “<em>what are the advantages of SEO</em>” and “<em>blog SEO for beginners</em>”.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the post was about the different ways to optimize your blogging SEO, you would choose LSI phrases like “<em>how to optimize your post for SEO</em>” and “<em>X blog post SEO tips</em>”.</p>
<h3>Look at the total monthly search estimate</h3>
<p>Sometimes, determining the best LSI keywords for your phrases can be really difficult, as some suggestions may make sense as a completely different post altogether.</p>
<p>For example, if you were writing a post about “<a href="https://www.onehourprofessor.com/best-online-course-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>online course platforms</em></a>” you’d see LSI keyword suggestions like “<em>online course learning platforms.”</em></p>
<p>When this happens, you need to determine if the suggestion would make better sense as an individual article, or as an addition to the original post. For me, I usually look at the total monthly search estimate to decide whether it’s worth it to write something new, or include the suggestion as a part of the original article I’m researching.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LSI20keywords20search20volume.png" alt="LSI keywords monthly search volume" width="800" height="765" /></div>
<p>The keywords that your tool offers will work for different contexts, and you need to determine which ones will work best for the specific page you’re creating.</p>
<p>During your research, if you come across keywords that don’t fit your page, you can still make a note of them to use on different pages so you can improve the overall SEO of your website.</p>
<h3>Add LSI keywords to your page</h3>
<p>You should add your LSI keywords to the same places you would add your main keyword, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meta title and meta description</li>
<li>Headings (H1, H2, H3)</li>
<li>Image alt tags</li>
<li>Throughout the body text</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you sprinkle related words and phrases throughout your post in a natural-sounding way. This will help broaden your opportunities since you can’t use the main keyword over and over again in all the important areas of your page.</p>
<h3>Focus on user experience</h3>
<p>Don’t overuse LSI keywords in your content. While these aren’t your keywords, exactly, it’s still quite easy to overuse them—and if you do, you will get penalized for it. You want to include enough related words to make the context of your page immediately clear to Google and other search engines, but without ruining the reader’s experience.</p>
<p>To do this effectively, you must add related keywords while keeping the content cohesive, natural-sounding, and easy to follow. This will help you not only avoid penalties but also to improve your visitors&#8217; experience and ultimately, <a href="https://www.onehourprofessor.com/how-to-make-money-blogging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make money while blogging</a>.</p>
<h2>Final tips for using LSI keywords for SEO</h2>
<p>Here are some general rules for implementing related words in your content to enhance your SEO strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t go overboard with the use of synonyms</li>
<li>Write how you <em>speak</em>. If you wouldn’t say it in real life, it doesn’t belong in the text</li>
<li>Use a fixed ratio of related words and phrases to the rest of your content (eg. one LSI keyword for every 200-300 words)</li>
</ul>
<p>Although having a ratio such as the one above isn’t perfect—and it certainly doesn’t guarantee that you will rank for any of your chosen LSI keywords–it is a helpful guideline to get you going in the right direction.</p>
<p>Regardless of how often you use LSI keywords, your main priority should always be to offer <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/15/website-copy">clear, concise, and useful information</a> that helps readers find the answers and solutions they seek (while also helping you achieve your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/15/marketing-objectives">business objective</a> of transforming readers into paying customers, of course).</p>
<p>If you write with the aim of providing value first, you’ll find that you wind up using related keywords in a natural way throughout your text without making any conscious effort.</p>
