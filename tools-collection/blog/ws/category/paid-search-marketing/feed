										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Performance Max campaigns are the farthest-reaching ads you can have on Google. In a single campaign, you can reach users on Google Search, Display, YouTube, Gmail, Discover, and Maps.</p>
<p>Advertisers using PMax can leverage many different types of assets that will be adjusted, combined, and reorganized to fit into each of the unique placements across those six channels. With that level of variability, it can be difficult to create compelling ads that fit into each place. Knowing what portion of an ad is going to show where, if you’re not already familiar with these ad placements, can be a challenge.</p>
<p>In this article, I&#8217;ll outline which assets from your ad unit can be used in which placements across the Google ecosystem so you’ll be able to create compelling ads that capture attention and convert.</p>

<h2>What does every PMax ad example include?</h2>
<p>Remember, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/performance-max" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PMax ads</a> shift and adapt to multiple placements that work best for your business. Check out the examples of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-audit-pmax-display-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all the possible PMax ad placements</a> below.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-placements.webp" alt="performance max placements" width="900" height="424" class="aligncenter wp-image-92109 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-placements.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-placements-480x226.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But what’s even more interesting is that not only can you reach all of these users in a single campaign, you can reach them in a single ad unit/asset group. Honestly, the ad builder is so large it’s impossible to get all of it in one screenshot, but the image below gives you a little taste of what’s in there.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-ad-builder.png" alt="pmax ad examples - performance max ad builder screenshot" width="750" height="631" class="aligncenter wp-image-95169 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-ad-builder.png 750w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-ad-builder-480x404.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>To give us a working vocabulary, let&#8217;s run through the asset types you can leverage in PMax asset group ad units and talk about what they are.</p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW112171623 BCX0"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW112171623 BCX0"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span></span>Are common Google Ads mistakes preventing your PMax campaigns from bringing in results?</strong> Find out, and learn how to fix them, with our free guide to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/google-ads-mistakes?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_googleadsmistakes_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six common (but costly) Google Ads mistakes</a>!</p>
<div id="pmax-ad-examples-brand-guidelines"></div>
<h3>Brand guidelines</h3>
<p>The first portion of the ad unit will be your <strong>brand guidelines</strong>. This helps you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/23/how-brand-your-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">control how your brand will look</a> across many different placements in the Google ecosystem. These controls are pretty self-explanatory.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-brand-guidelines.png" alt="pmax ad examples - brand guidelines" width="840" height="363" class="aligncenter wp-image-95170 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-brand-guidelines.png 840w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-brand-guidelines-480x207.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 840px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/08/business-name-ideas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business name</a> is required to run a PMax campaign. The only issue is that it can only be 25 characters long. This can be either the name of the business or your outward-facing brand name, but it needs to stick within that character limit.</p>
<p>Next are your logos. You can add up to five, but again, you need to stick within Google’s guidelines. They require only the square logo, but I encourage you to also upload the landscape version. It just looks so much better in some placements.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-logos.png" alt="pmax ad examples - brand logos" width="356" height="359" class="aligncenter wp-image-95166 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-logos.png 356w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-logos-297x300.png 297w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-logos-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px" /></p>
<p>Last will be some optional features you can use under the “more options” dropdown. Here, you can input custom color hex codes to ensure Google uses the exact right colors from your brand guidelines. This will come in really helpful for some placements where they regularly add in accent colors to make your ads stand out. There’s also a dropdown to customize the font used in your ads in case you want some control there as well. The list isn’t huge, but it’s nice to have some options to choose from.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-custom-brand-colors.png" alt="pmax ad examples - brand colors" width="801" height="387" class="aligncenter wp-image-95171 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-custom-brand-colors.png 801w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-custom-brand-colors-480x232.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 801px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="pmax-ad-examples-ad-assets"></div>
<h3>Ad level assets</h3>
<p>Next come the core ad unit assets. These will be the main foundation of the ad units, and all are featured in most ad units across the other campaign types.</p>
<h4>Text components</h4>
<p>These are all short snippets of text that will be combined to create the ad units.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Headlines: </strong>Up to 15 headlines, three are required, each with up to 30 characters.</li>
<li><strong>Long Headlines: </strong>Up to five long headlines, one required, with up to 90 characters.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Up to five descriptions, two required, with up to 90 characters.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/performance-max-ad-examples-copy.png" alt="pmax ad examples - ad text assets" width="594" height="857" class="aligncenter wp-image-95168 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/performance-max-ad-examples-copy.png 594w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/performance-max-ad-examples-copy-480x693.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 594px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Visual components</h4>
<p>These visual components will be used only in placements that require them and help you to<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-make-your-business-stand-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> stand out from the competition</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Images</strong>: Up to 20 images, but the minimum requirement is two (one square image and one landscape image).</li>
<li><strong>Videos</strong>: Up to five videos; zero are required, though. But as you can see, if you don’t provide a video, then Google will automatically create one for you using other assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these assets will be used and combined in all sorts of different combinations, which we’ll cover later on.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/performance-max-ad-example-images-videos.png" alt="pmax ad examples - image and video assets" width="731" height="415" class="aligncenter wp-image-95167 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/performance-max-ad-example-images-videos.png 731w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/performance-max-ad-example-images-videos-480x273.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 731px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="pmax-ad-examples-expanded-assets"></div>
<h3>Expanded assets</h3>
<p>As a side note, the naming convention in this section is confusing simply because Google insists on using “assets” all over the place. For those of you who have been around a while, you’ll recognize these<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-assets"> assets formerly known as ad extensions</a>. For those of you who are new, these are effectively other portions of your ad that are fundamentally different from the regular headlines, descriptions, videos, and images from above.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sitelinks</strong>: Additional links that operate as landing pages, combined with a short headline of 25 characters and up to two 30-character descriptions.</li>
<li><strong>Call to action:</strong> A short call to action message like “Learn More” or “Contact Us” that will accompany your ad. You can select your preference from a dropdown of provided options or select Automated to let Google choose the one it believes makes the most sense.</li>
<li><strong>Callouts</strong>: Short snippets of text, 25 characters or less, that provide additional context to your ads.</li>
<li><strong>Structured snippets</strong>: A short list of items accompanied by a header category selected from a dropdown.</li>
<li><strong>Promotions</strong>: Show off sales or discounts alongside your ad to create more interest.</li>
<li><strong>Prices</strong>: Highlight prices of specific products or services on your site.</li>
<li><strong>Locations</strong>: Show relevant, physical locations to your target audience based on your Google Business information.</li>
<li><strong>Calls</strong>: Advertisers have the option to add a phone number to help generate calls from ads.</li>
<li><strong>Lead forms</strong>: A customizable form hosted by Google that can collect user data just like a form on your landing page.</li>
<li><strong>Messages</strong>: A feature allowing users to send your company a message through WhatsApp rather than going through a more traditional landing page conversion route.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Performance Max ad examples by placement</h2>
<p>Now that we have all of the building blocks out of the way, let’s start to look at some PMax ad examples across each of the networks Google hosts, so you’ll have an idea of what your ads could look like.</p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW112171623 BCX0"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW112171623 BCX0"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span></span>PMax is an AI-powered campaign type, but did you know there are more ways to incorporate AI into your strategy?</strong> Download our free guide to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/ai-advertising?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_AIAdvertising_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 9 powerful ideas to use AI in Google and Facebook Ads</a>!</p>
<div id="pmax-ad-examples-search"></div>
<h3>Search</h3>
<p>More than likely, you’re already familiar with search ads on Google. Performance Max variants of those ads are pretty straightforward and mostly leverage the text components you provide in your asset group.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-pmax-ad-examples.webp" alt="google ads pmax ad examples - google search" width="717" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-95162 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-pmax-ad-examples.webp 717w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-pmax-ad-examples-480x402.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 717px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In the examples below, you can see the headlines and descriptions I’ve provided in all different combinations. Some have shorter versions of the ads, and some are longer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-pmax-ad-examples-serp.png" alt="pmax ad examples - search placement" width="756" height="629" class="aligncenter wp-image-95165 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-pmax-ad-examples-serp.png 756w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-pmax-ad-examples-serp-480x399.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 756px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Others have some of the assets we talked about earlier, and others don’t. They stick only to the text components.</p>
<p>While these ads do function very similarly to Responsive Search Ads, there is one big difference. Performance Max ads do not allow advertisers to pin assets into certain placements. Since these assets are used for all networks on Google, it doesn’t apply to all placements.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-headlines.png" alt="google ads pmax ad examples - ad headlines" width="721" height="499" class="aligncenter wp-image-95174 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-headlines.png 721w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-headlines-480x332.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 721px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>So when you’re writing your ads for Performance Max, keep the dynamism of RSAs in mind, but remember you don&#8217;t have the option to pin. All of these components can show in just about any combination, so it’s in your best interest to make sure all variants can combine with all other variants and still make a compelling ad.</p>
<div id="pmax-ad-examples-display"></div>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The display network variants for Performance Max ads have quite a wide range of spaces they can fit in. Because of that, there are lots of different examples we can look at to see how our same components will show up.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-dynamic.png" alt="pmax ad examples - display" width="821" height="337" class="aligncenter wp-image-95172 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-dynamic.png 821w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-dynamic-480x197.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 821px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>On mobile, ads can show with all different combinations of headlines, descriptions, images, and even videos.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-mobile.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - mobile" width="817" height="335" class="aligncenter wp-image-95175 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-mobile.webp 817w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-mobile-480x197.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 817px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Even in this next set, you can see that the colors of the ads are quite a bit different, and they include just one of the headlines in big text with small supporting text or the entirety of the video running with some surrounding text.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-dynamic-headlines.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - dynamic mobile search ads" width="964" height="394" class="aligncenter wp-image-95173 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-dynamic-headlines.webp 964w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-dynamic-headlines-480x196.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 964px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>When we get to the desktop examples, the ads look pretty similar, but they could show in either the top of the page&#8230;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-display.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - display desktop ads" width="604" height="398" class="aligncenter wp-image-95177 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-display.webp 604w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-display-480x316.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 604px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>&#8230; in between text, or&#8230;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-display-network.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - desktop display network" width="612" height="306" class="aligncenter wp-image-95157 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-display-network.webp 612w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-display-network-480x240.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 612px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>&#8230; on the right-hand rail.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-on-site.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - right hand rail" width="600" height="328" class="aligncenter wp-image-95156" /></p>
<p>As you can tell from the previews, these ads are going to show in placements where the user is engaging with a website external to Google. While search ads need to answer a user’s query, display ads need to capture their attention enough to make an impact. Providing assets to PMAX ads that are eye-catching and attention-grabbing will be very useful for the display placements.</p>
<div id="pmax-ad-examples-youtube"></div>
<h3>YouTube</h3>
<p>For each asset group, you can add up to five selected videos. But it’s important to know that all Performance Max ads will have video assets, even if you don’t include your own.</p>
<p>The message below that you&#8217;d see in the builder states that if you don’t provide your own videos, Google will make one for you with the image assets you provide. And let me tell you, those videos are…not super pretty. I highly encourage you to use your own compelling videos that follow the regular <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/15/youtube-algorithm">YouTube video best practices</a>.</p>

<p>Here are a few previews of what the YouTube placements will look like. Some use the image assets (which, yes, are cropped horribly in my examples), but others will use the videos. There are some with headlines and descriptions, others with long headlines.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-youtube.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - youtube placements" width="714" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-95160 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-youtube.webp 714w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-youtube-480x403.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 714px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-youtube-placements.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - youtube" width="737" height="616" class="aligncenter wp-image-95153 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-youtube-placements.webp 737w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-youtube-placements-480x401.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 737px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It’s important to note that some of these variants have the title of the video included as well, so be sure the videos you utilize will combine well with the text and image assets you leverage, or else you may end up with some inconsistent ads.</p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW168540966 BCX0"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW168540966 BCX0"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/26a1.png" alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span></span>PMax campaigns are just one strategy out of tons that SMBs are taking advantage of this year!</strong> Get the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/smb-marketing-trends-report/?cid=Web_LiQ_InContent_Guide_2026SmallBusinessMarketingTrendsReport_Download&amp;itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Small Business Marketing Trends Report for 2026</a> to find out what else beyond PMax you should be trying!</p>
<div id="pmax-ad-examples-discover"></div>
<h3>Discover</h3>
<p>Google Discover is likely one of the more unique placements for Performance Max ads, and if you don’t use the platform, this placement might seem a little mysterious to you.</p>
<p>Google Discover is a personalized content feed that proactively serves content on mobile devices in the Google app. This happens even before the user conducts a search and is based on their previous behaviors.</p>
<p>Using our same set of assets, here are a few looks at how a Performance Max can appear on Discover.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-discovery-ad-examples.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - discover" width="965" height="396" class="aligncenter wp-image-95154 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-discovery-ad-examples.webp 965w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-discovery-ad-examples-480x197.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 965px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>These ads look a bit like a cross between some of the display and YouTube placements. They leverage only the image assets and include headlines and descriptions, but just one of each.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that out of the images I have, they only used the landscape and square versions. There’s no preview option that leverages the more mobile-friendly 9&#215;16 format.</p>
<p>This content type promotion on a personal newsfeed should feel a bit like a social ad, and you’ll benefit from keeping social best practices in mind when writing variants that could show in the Discover feed.</p>
<div id="pmax-ad-examples-gmail"></div>
<h3>Gmail</h3>
<p>The last placement for Performance Max is<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/gmail-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Gmail ads</a>, and these are the only format that has two different views for each placement: one for the closed version and one for when the user opens the email line item.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-in-gmail.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - gmail" width="900" height="263" class="aligncenter wp-image-95161 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-in-gmail.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-in-gmail-480x140.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>On mobile, most of the closed versions are just text, but there is an option to have the image included. These also leverage headlines and descriptions, but no long headlines are to be found.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-gmail-1.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - gmail screenshot" width="900" height="348" class="aligncenter wp-image-95176 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-gmail-1.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-gmail-1-480x186.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Once those ads are opened, they all have images, but usually just repeat the same ad copy only in a bigger font.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-promotions.webp" alt="pmax gmail ad examples" width="966" height="343" class="aligncenter wp-image-95164 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-promotions.webp 966w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-promotions-480x170.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 966px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They look pretty similar on desktop devices. Relatively minimal copy in both the open and closed versions, but repeated in each. If anything, the headline disappears in the open version and is replaced by the image and a call-to-action button.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-gmail-inbox.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - gmail inbox ad" width="877" height="360" class="aligncenter wp-image-95163 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-gmail-inbox.webp 877w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-gmail-inbox-480x197.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 877px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The biggest priority for these ads is still to make sure that all components can work together, but also expect that they might need to stand alone. In the open version on desktop, there’s only the description text left behind to convey your messaging, and although my image has text in it, yours might not.</p>
<h2>How to recreate these PMax ad examples</h2>
<p>Performance Max ads have many, many iterations of how they can manifest depending on what platform your ads are triggered for. Overall, it’s important to keep the dynamism in mind. Some ad units leverage lots of components and need to make sense in any combination. Others use very few assets and also need to be compelling in just a short portion of text, and maybe an image. Your goal should be to make as many compelling components as possible and assume that they all can show alongside any other asset or by themselves and still be compelling as a whole.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google’s reach may extend across the world, but for some local searches, we need a trusted solution in our own neighborhood (and quickly)!</p>
<p>Searchers watching their sinks overflow can’t wait for a plumber from across state lines, and they’re hesitant to call a stranger to help them get into their car when they’re locked outside in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Local service advertisers often struggle to convert these searchers with just SEO or standard search ads alone.</p>
<p>Luckily, Google’s Local Services Ads (LSAs) can come to the rescue. In this article, we&#8217;re covering everything you need to know about LSAs to make the most of them for your business.</p>

<h2>What are Google Local Services Ads?</h2>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/local-services-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Local Services Ads</a> allow service-based businesses to run ads meant to generate leads directly on the search results page. Rather than linking to a landing page like traditional Google Ads, LSAs are meant to drive calls, form fills, messages, or appointment bookings directly from the ad. Specific industries such as locksmiths, plumbers, garage door professionals, electricians, lawyers, real estate agents, and many more can take advantage of this Google Ads type.</p>
<p>When a searcher enters a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/01/google-local-search-trends">local search</a> query, they may see several trusted professionals in their area positioned right above the traditional paid search ads; these ads show a business number, hours, ratings, and reviews.</p>
<p>For example, an LSA might look like this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-248583 size-full" src="https://localiq.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-local-services-ad-verified-badge-ad-example-png-e1760120783229.webp" alt="google local services ad - screenshot of lsa with verified badge example" width="512" height="684" /></p>
<p>Upon clicking on a local advertiser’s listing, Google prompts them to confirm the job they’re looking for as well as their service area. If you fit the job and serve that area, you’ll be matched to the searcher, and they’ll be able to review your qualifications, ratings, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/16/get-more-google-reviews">Google reviews</a> before contacting you.</p>
<p>If you’re <em>not</em> a good fit for their job or you don’t serve their region, then Google will save you the costs and burdens and will connect them to a more appropriate Local Services Ad.</p>
<p>Google’s Local Services Ads display on desktop, tablet, and mobile searches; they also have reach beyond traditional search ads.</p>
<p>Local Services Ads are featured in the Google Assistant’s response to relevant <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/14/google-voice-search">voice search</a> queries! The Google Assistant inquires about the searcher’s job type and location to ensure a quality match for the advertiser.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Google Local Services Ads</h2>
<p>Still wondering if Google Local Services Ads are right for your business? Let&#8217;s review some of the benefits of this specific ad type.</p>
<h3>Advertisers pay per lead–not click!</h3>
<p>PPC advertisers know the pain of paying for a click that isn’t a good fit or doesn’t convert—especially for businesses with high average costs per click, like attorneys and dentists. Google’s Local Services Ads help connect the right job to the right advertiser and prevent the job mismatch that often happens when a user searches for broad terms for a very specific job or for an area outside your service zone.</p>
<p>Businesses running Local Services Ads are <a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/7195435?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6224863&amp;visit_id=1-636637313008159834-1013385142&amp;rd=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only charged for valid leads</a>, and depending on the job and the market, these can end up being even lower than the average cost per lead for search ads in your industry. If you receive a lead that is either fraudulent, spam, or a poor match, you can even dispute the charge for credit.</p>
<p>Plus, the Google Local Services Ads average cost per lead is about $60—which is significantly lower than the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/search-advertising-benchmarks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search ad benchmark average cost per lead</a> of $70.11.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-GA-Benchmarks-CPL-871x1024.webp" alt="2025 google ads benchmarks - cost per lead" width="871" height="1024" class="aligncenter wp-image-91516 size-large" /></p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW153089153 BCX0"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW153089153 BCX0"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></span>Find out how your search costs can compare to your current LSA costs</strong> using our latest <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/google-ads-industry-benchmarks?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2025GoogleAdsBenchmarks_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search ads industry benchmarks</a>!</p>
<h3>Gain trust with the Google Verified badge</h3>
<p>When eligible, the Google Verified badge will automatically appear on your LSAs, adding an extra dose of credibility. Before October 20, 2025, LSAs used to have multiple different badges (like the Google Guarantee) depending on their industry and <a href="https://support.google.com/localservices/answer/6226575?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">level of verification</a>. However, that has since changed, and all LSAs will now have <a href="https://support.google.com/business/community-guide/366556199/upcoming-changes-to-local-services-ads-google-guarantee-badges?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the new Google Verified badge</a> instead.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-248569 size-full" src="https://localiq.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-local-service-ads-google-verified-badge.webp" alt="google local service ads - google verified badge" width="523" height="600" /></p>
<p>This Google Verified badge is meant to provide a more consolidated, cohesive, and transparent LSA experience for both users and advertisers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-248584 size-full" src="https://localiq.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-verified-badge-example-png.webp" alt="google local services ads - verified badge" width="390" height="86" /></p>
<h3>Expand the reach of your paid search ads</h3>
<p>You’ll notice that Google Local Services Ads sit above the paid search ads and the organic listings.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-local-services-ads-on-serp.jpg" alt="google local services ads - example of serp with LSAs" width="900" height="800" class="aligncenter wp-image-94917 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-local-services-ads-on-serp.jpg 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-local-services-ads-on-serp-480x427.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>That’s because <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/ppc/#section5">Google Local Services Ads</a> aren’t meant to replace your traditional search ads or even your <a href="https://localiq.com/products/listings/">organic local listings</a>.</p>
<p>Some searchers still turn to Google and expect to visit your website before deciding if you’re the best provider for their business. Even if they don’t convert via LSAs, their prime position on the SERP and user reviews <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/08/attribution-models">may change how people convert later on</a>.</p>
<h3>Be included in voice search responses</h3>
<p>Your customers are less likely to open a new tab and type a search query when they’re wrist-deep in their clogged drains! With over 20% of all searches coming from voice search, Local Services Ads are one of the few ways you can make sure that you’re found on the <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/assistant/how-google-home-and-google-assistant-helped-you-get-more-done-in-2017/">400 million devices</a> powered by Google Assistant.</p>
<h3>No ads or keywords to manage</h3>
<p>Paid search advertisers know that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords">keyword research</a> and ad testing can be never-ending tasks. Luckily, Google’s Local Services Ads require neither! Local Services Ads will automatically trigger when a customer searches for one of the thousands of relevant search terms, be it as broad as “Plumber” or as specific as “leaky faucet under sink.” The ad format will automatically be created using information from your business profile.</p>
<div id="howto"></div>
<h2>How to get started with Google Local Services Ads</h2>
<p>Ready to try out Google LSAs? Here&#8217;s how to get started.</p>
<h3>1. Confirm your eligibility</h3>
<p>Google’s Local Services Ads are only available for certain industries (which we outlined earlier). To find out if you can connect with your customers through Local Services Ads, first confirm your business type and location <a href="https://ads.google.com/localservices/signup/eligibility?pli=1">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re eligible, you’ll be guided through creating an account to manage your Local Services Ads. Local Services Ads are managed separately from the ads you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/21/google-skillshop">create in Google Ads</a>, so you’ll need to create a new account.</p>
<h3>2. Create your business profile</h3>
<p>Your Google Local Services Ads profile is different from your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/06/08/what-is-google-my-business">Google Business Profile account,</a> which is connected to your local listing on Google (and if you haven&#8217;t already, make a note to create and <a href="/blog/ws/2020/06/03/google-my-business-optimization">optimize</a> this account as well). Your Local Services Ads business profile will determine which jobs are matched to your business. Be honest about what kind of services you can perform as well as which areas you want leads in, as you’re agreeing to potentially pay for any match leads from your Local Services Ads.</p>
<p>From your business profile, you can edit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your weekly budget</li>
<li>Your business hours</li>
<li>Your service areas</li>
<li>Your job types</li>
</ul>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/business-profile-example.png" alt="business-profile-example" width="814" height="640" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>You also have the option to add highlights to your business profile, which will potentially serve alongside your Local Services Ads on the SERP and on your business details page. Use these to highlight attributes (“Locally owned &amp; operated”) and special offers (“Military discount available”) to distinguish yourself from others in your industry. Although these highlights are optional, Google recommends including 2-5 highlights in your business profile.</p>
<h3>3. Add your license and insurance details</h3>
<p>If you’re a licensed and insured professional, you’ll need to submit proof. Be sure your paperwork is up to date, and then provide your general liability insurance details as well as your related professional licenses.</p>
<p>If your city or state requires additional licenses, you can add them here as well to ensure you’re compliant in those regions.</p>
<h3>4. Complete a background check</h3>
<p>Before Google starts sending people into its users’ homes, offices, and cars, it wants to be sure its users are safe and can always trust the Local Services Advertisers covered under the Google Verified badge. For this reason, Google requires businesses and their fieldworkers to pass a <a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/6226575?ref_topic=6224863&amp;hl=en&amp;visit_id=1-636571767460960195-2392301597&amp;rd=1">background check</a>.</p>
<p>There is no cost for these background checks, and you can manage them <a href="https://pinkerton.screenmenow.com/Default.aspx?c=ALLI_04073">here</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Manage your leads</h3>
<p>Once your business profile is complete, you can launch your Local Services Ads and start collecting new leads. You can view and manage your incoming leads in your <a href="https://ads.google.com/localservices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LSAs dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>From this dashboard, you can navigate to the “Leads” tab via the drop-down in the top right corner of the platform</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/managing-your-leads.png" alt="managing-your-leads" width="800" height="700" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>Remember that leads aren’t necessarily booked jobs! Be sure to follow up with your inbound leads. After selecting an individual lead, you can review the details of the lead, including the job type and location, as well as listen to the recording of the call.</p>
<p>After reviewing these leads, you have these three options to follow up with an interested lead:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reply </strong>to the customer by sending your message as an email or text message to the customer.</li>
<li><strong>Call </strong>the customer based on the phone number they listed.</li>
<li><strong>Decline </strong>the job request. If you decline the request, it will be removed and the customer will be notified. You can send a response with more information about why the request was declined. Once declined, requests can be recovered if something changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>After reviewing your leads, you can also mark a lead as booked to track your upcoming jobs. Use this feature to schedule your upcoming jobs, send confirmation emails, and gather customer reviews. Reporting on these booked deals will also help you determine your Local Services Ads’ <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-roi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overall ROI</a> and profitability.</p>
<h3>6. Manage your LSA budget</h3>
<p>From your business profile, you can adjust your Local Services Ads budget. You can manage how much you’d like to spend on your Local Services Ads by raising or lowering your average weekly budget. Like in Google Ads, Google may <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-budget">spend slightly less or more than your assigned weekly budget</a> in any given week, but it will never exceed your monthly maximum budget.</p>
<p>Given that you’re charged per lead—rather than click—with Google Local Services Ads, increasing or decreasing your budget will directly impact the number of <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/april-promotion-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leads</a> you generate. If you’re just starting off with Local Services Ads, it’s recommended that you budget for at least 20 leads per week to get the most out of your new ads.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/managing-your-budget.png" alt="managing-your-budget" width="817" height="609" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>Keep in mind that your Local Services Ads budget is separate from your Google Ads budget, so if you’re running both, you’ll want to ensure you’re prepared for the combined costs of your campaigns.</p>
<h3>7. Consider your LSA rankings</h3>
<p>Even with Local Services Ads, there’s still a limited amount of space on the SERP!</p>
<p>Up to three Local Services Ads will appear on Desktop, two on Mobile, and only one via Google Assistant. Just like with your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/ppc">PPC campaigns</a>, to ensure your listing shows, you’ll need to have a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/ad-ranking">high Ad Rank</a>.</p>
<p>However, unlike your search ads, you don&#8217;t have to worry about your ad’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/quality-score">Quality Score </a>(formulated by a combination of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/average-ctr">ad’s CTR</a>, ad relevance, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">landing page</a>). Instead, Google calculates your Local Services Ads’ Ad Rank by considering factors including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your review score and the number of reviews you receive</li>
<li>Your responsiveness to customer inquiries and requests</li>
<li>Your business hours</li>
<li>Whether or not Google&#8217;s received serious or repeated complaints about your business</li>
</ul>
<div id="tips" div="">
<h2>Tips for effective Local Services Ads</h2>
<p>These four Google Local Services Ads tips can make a big difference in ROI.</p>
<h3>1. Be mindful of the locations you target</h3>
<p>Each Local Services Ads profile should be viewed as a campaign. Just like you wouldn’t ask a campaign to service more than one major market, it’s unrealistic to ask a Local Services Ads to target more than three major markets.</p>
<p>In an ideal structure, you’d have each LSA profile focusing on one major market (corresponding to one Google Business Profile).</p>
<p>However, if you only have one GBP and serve multiple locations, <strong>be sure the locations you choose to target are in close proximity to your main prospect hubs</strong> (i.e, where you’ll have a higher likelihood of benefiting from the proximity ranking factor).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-service-areas.png" alt="google local services ads - service area selection" width="720" height="604" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60042" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-service-areas.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-service-areas-480x403.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>2. Avoid unnecessary disapprovals</h3>
<p>The most common reasons for LSAs to stop serving are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/23/google-ads-disapprovals">disapprovals</a>, and two common disapprovals are for the image to get flagged or certifications to go out of date. For example, when you’re setting up your profile, you’ll be asked to input the expiration date of your certifications. However, some certifications don’t need to be renewed—or if they do, they’re not an annual renewal. Be sure to set the expiration date far enough in advance that you won’t need to think about it for 5-10 years.</p>
<h3>3. Keep your Google reviews up</h3>
<p><span>Keep in mind that reviews on your regular Google Business Profile appear on your LSA profile and impact your ad ranking, but not the other way around. And any reviews you get from your LSAs will go away if you stop advertising, and you won’t be able to respond to reviews that come through your review link. </span></p>
<p>You can learn <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/16/get-more-google-reviews">how to get more Google reviews here</a>.</p>
<h3>4. Set realistic hours</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/19/conversion-rate-benchmarks">Conversion rates</a> for LSAs and response times have a strong correlation: the faster you are to respond to leads, the greater the chance you will win the business.</p>
<p>Local Services Ads do not factor response times into ranking, but they do learn what kind of users result in successful calls/form-fills.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-hours.png" alt="google local services ads - business hours view" width="557" height="623" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60043" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-hours.png 557w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-hours-480x537.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 557px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>Make sure your LSA is set to only run when you have the team to respond. </strong>If you can’t support leads 24/7, do not let the campaign run 24/7. This will help Google allocate budget as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-job-types.png" alt="google local services ads - job types" width="720" height="551" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60035" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-job-types.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-job-types-480x367.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul></ul>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Google is testing ads in AI Mode, so we're breaking down what this means for advertisers, how to show up here, and whether or not it's actually worth it for your business.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-ai-mode">Google Ads in AI Mode: Here&#8217;s What We Know</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AI is becoming an increasingly integral part of online marketing as more advertisers adopt “smart” options in platforms and use AI tools to help generate, manage, optimize, and report on campaigns.</p>
<p>But from another angle, AI has also been impacting how and where our ads can show in a Google search results page. Earlier this year, Google released AI Mode, a new user experience that will continue to change the SERP game. That announcement immediately prompted many people to ask, “What will ads in AI Mode look like, and how can I get my ads to show there?”</p>
<p>Google is now testing ads in AI Mode, so ahead of a larger rollout later this year, we want to give an overview of what AI Mode is, discuss the settings you need to employ to be included, and what that could mean for your advertising strategy moving forward.</p>

</ul>
<div id="what-is-google-ai-mode"></div>
<h2>What is AI Mode in Google?</h2>
<p>AI Mode is a self-contained search experience designed to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-experiments">use AI</a> in a conversation-type experience to answer complex queries. It’s powered by <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-use-google-bard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gemini</a>, Google’s largest and most capable AI model, and compared to normal search, which is more of a one-and-done type of experience, AI Mode is intended to drive further research and learning with multiple rounds of questions or query refinement. It will then deliver a range of information based on how that exchange goes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ai-mode-example.webp" alt="example of google ai mode with query for how to fix sink" width="900" height="519" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94858" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ai-mode-example.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ai-mode-example-480x277.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As a quick aside, here’s the next question we almost always get after defining AI Mode: “Is AI Mode different from AI Overviews?”</p>
<p>In short, yes and no.</p>
<p>Yes, from the user experience, AI Mode is different from AI Overviews.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-overviews-statistics">AI Overviews</a> show up within the regular search results and are just a single component of that page of answers compared to AI Mode’s contained experience. They also don’t allow for direct reengagement based on the answers provided. You can click on the supporting documentation links or the ads in AI Overviews, but if you want to go further than that, you have to conduct another search, effectively losing the thread of the previous one, and you may or may not be served another AI Overview.</p>
<p>But also, no, AI Mode and AI Overviews are extremely closely related to each other. The information served in them is usually pretty close (you can compare by clicking between the AI Mode and All tabs in Google), and the way advertisers can engage with them is pretty similar.</p>

<div id="the-types-of-queries-best-suited-for-ai-mode-and-ai-overviews-ads"></div>
<h2>The types of queries best suited for AI Mode (and AI Overviews) ads</h2>
<p>To try and discern the impact AI Mode may have for advertisers, we need to understand the types of queries that it’s best suited for.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-mode">AI Mode</a> is relatively new, we need to take some direction from the documentation around AI Overviews to understand how AI Mode might be impacted. Let’s dig into what we do know about AI Overviews and see how that can inform our expectations about AI Mode.</p>
<p>AI Overviews are not shown for all query types. They’re usually shown for queries that require a longer, in-depth answer rather than a series of links. That means AI Overviews are likely only going to show when the search is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broad and information-based</li>
<li>Comparison based</li>
<li>Multi-step</li>
<li>Explanatory</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these is heavily focused on transactions or sales. They’re all more research or learning based and, more often than not, an ad likely won’t show for this type of query anyway.</p>
<p>If you are getting search volume through your campaigns for these higher funnel, more generalized queries, you could likely already be seeing a decrease in impressions as AI Overviews are being shown more often and are likely pushing ads down the page.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong> Looking for more ways to drive people to your site?</strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website</a></p>
<div id="requirements-to-show-ads-in-ai-mode-and-ai-overviews"></div>
<h2>Requirements to show ads in AI Mode</h2>
<p>To know the impact AI Mode may have on advertising, we also need to know the criteria required to show your ads in AI Overviews. As ads on Google AI Mode are in the experimental stage, there&#8217;s very little documentation around it (just <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-ai-mode-ads-internal-document-459931" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this brief from Google</a> to brands in August).</p>
<p>Unlike regular <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/ppc-keyword">keyword targeting</a>, where the search term simply needs to closely match what your keywords are for an ad to show, ads on AI Mode require much more cohesion for the searcher. Not only does your keyword need to be relevant to the query, but your ad content and landing pages also need to be relevant to the answers provided by AI Mode as well (this is also how ads work in AI Overviews).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-ai-mode-benefits.webp" alt="google ads ai mode details from google" width="900" height="715" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94871" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-ai-mode-benefits.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-ai-mode-benefits-480x381.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-ai-mode-ads-internal-document-459931" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Additionally, just like AI Overviews ads, Google is requiring advertisers to opt into AI-powered targeting solutions like broad match, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-max-for-search">AI Max for Search</a>, or keywordless targeting that accompanies Dynamic Search Ads or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/performance-max">Performance Max</a>.</p>

<div id="what-could-ai-mode-mean-for-advertisers"></div>
<h2>What could ads in AI Mode mean for businesses?</h2>
<p>Between the types of queries best suited for AI Mode and the settings required for advertisers to show up there, the implications for advertisers could be pretty large.</p>
<h3>A varied marketing approach</h3>
<p>For your ad to show in AI Mode (or in AI Overviews), you’re likely going to have to shift away from hard selling, as the queries these features are showing for aren’t the right fit. Additionally, you’re likely not going to get away with short landing pages with the minimum viable content to make the sale. Odds are, those pages aren’t going to be supportive enough of the AI answer experience to qualify your ads.</p>
<h3>Targeting expansion</h3>
<p>You’re also going to have to lean into Google’s intent-based query matching to leverage these placements. Without broad match or keywordless matching, you won’t be eligible for these new placements. Additionally, the expanded reach of campaigns like Performance Max goes beyond Search and into many other Google properties like YouTube and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/gmail-ads">Gmail</a>, which is obviously quite a big change.</p>
<h3>A bigger role for creative assets</h3>
<p>If you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-performance-max-pre-launch-optimizations">opt into Performance Max campaigns</a> or leverage the Text Customization and Final URL expansion features within AI Max for Search, you’re giving at least some control to Google when it comes to your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/21/emotional-ad-copy-examples">ad copy</a>. They’ll be able to create new text and visual components to leverage in your ads as you compete for these queries or expand into new placements that are much more creative forward.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/asset-optimization-ai-mode.webp" alt="ai mode asset optimization" width="900" height="369" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94862" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/asset-optimization-ai-mode.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/asset-optimization-ai-mode-480x197.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="should-you-be-focused-on-showing-ads-in-ai-mode"></div>
<h2>Should you be focused on showing ads in AI Mode?</h2>
<p>It’s no secret that things are changing quickly with AI and that Google is vying to be at the forefront of that industry. But it’s also no secret that Google still heavily relies on ads to account for much of its revenue each year. With those two truths in mind, it&#8217;s hardly a surprise that ads are being integrated into Google’s AI offerings from its search platform.</p>
<p>In my estimation, <strong>getting your ads to show with AI Mode (or AI Overviews) likely shouldn’t be your main goal with advertising.</strong> Your goal is still to hit your profitability or volume goals, but that doesn’t mean this shouldn’t be on your mind.</p>
<p>At this point in time, the advertisers who test and iterate on their strategy to both continue to see success with existing campaigns as well as find out what works for them in an AI-centered search experience will end up reaping the rewards in the future. Maybe it makes sense to opt into <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-max-for-search">AI Max</a> for a little while and see how it does. Have you run Performance Max campaigns recently? There have been a ton of updates to give advertisers better controls, and if you leverage them, maybe this campaign type can be profitable and get you eligible to show in AI experiences.</p>
<h2>What to do next</h2>
<p>In the immediate future, I don’t foresee AI Mode having a large impact on advertisers who have a dialed-in campaign strategy. At least not while user behavior is still relatively the same. That will almost certainly change over time as users get more used to AI and figure out ways to be more efficient with it. The advertiser who tests and learns in these early stages will be ahead of the game when these AI features are more widely adopted.</p>
<p>For now, it’s important to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/category/google-ads">keep up with the latest changes</a>, keep an eye on your existing Google Ads campaigns, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-experiments">use AI in smart ways</a> to further your marketing strategy.</p>

<h2>What are Microsoft Ads?</h2>
<p>Microsoft Ads are pay-per-click ads shown on the Microsoft Search and Audience networks, which include ad placements on channels like the Bing Search Results Page, Edge and Outlook apps, Xbox systems, and more.</p>
<p>Microsoft Ads function similarly to the Google Ads or Meta Ads platforms in that advertisers bid in an ad auction to land their business on eligible targeted placements.</p>

<h2>Need-to-know Microsoft Ads statistics and facts</h2>
<p>Wondering why Microsoft Ads are so important to your business’s ad strategy? Here’s the data you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Bing is the <a href="https://www.reliablesoft.net/top-10-search-engines-in-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second-</a>largest search engine in the world.</li>
<li>Microsoft Ads have a <a href="https://www.warroominc.com/institute-library/blog/bing-ads-vs-google-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">45%</a> higher click-through rate than Google Ads.</li>
<li>Microsoft Ads costs per click and lead can be <a href="https://www.conversios.io/blog/microsoft-ads-vs-google-ads-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30-70%</a> lower than the averages in Google Ads.</li>
<li>Microsoft Ads typically returns <a href="https://www.conversios.io/blog/microsoft-ads-vs-google-ads-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4 to $10</a> for every $1 spent.</li>
</ul>

<div id="microsoft-ads-benefits"></div>
<h2>Benefits of Microsoft Ads</h2>
<p>Here are a few more Microsoft Ads benefits to consider.</p>
<h3>Microsoft Ads can be more clickable</h3>
<p>On top of the benefits highlighted in the stats above, Microsoft Ads look a bit more like organic results on <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/advertise-on-bing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bing SERPs</a>. Aside from the small “Sponsored” text in the ad shown below, you can’t really tell it’s a paid result, which makes users more inclined to click.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-on-serp.webp" alt="microsoft ads - example ad" width="791" height="512" class="aligncenter wp-image-94778 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-on-serp.webp 791w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-on-serp-480x311.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 791px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>The Microsoft Ads import tool makes account buildout a breeze</h3>
<p>You can also easily <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/replicate-google-ads-on-bing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">copy campaigns you’re already running</a> on Google Ads or Meta Ads into Microsoft Ads. This simplifies cross-platform advertising management, making Microsoft Ads a no-brainer if you’re already running ads elsewhere.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-auto-import.webp" alt="microsoft ads - autoimport" width="422" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94776 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-auto-import.webp 422w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-auto-import-211x300.webp 211w" sizes="(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px" /></p>

<h3>You’re tapping into additional audiences</h3>
<p>One last benefit of Microsoft Ads businesses often forget is that they allow you to tap into audiences you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to reach. Not all consumers are loyal to just one search engine or app, so it’s best to advertise on as many platforms as possible to ensure you’re hitting your target audience at every possible touchpoint.</p>
<div id="microsoft-ads-get-started"></div>
<h2>How to get started with Microsoft Ads</h2>
<p>Follow these five steps to get your business up and running on Microsoft Ads.</p>
<h3>1. Create a Microsoft Ads account</h3>
<p><strong>Navigate </strong>to <a href="https://ads.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ads.microsoft.com</a> and click either of the “<strong>Sign up now</strong>” prompts.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-homepage.webp" alt="microsoft ads - homepage screenshot" width="900" height="446" class="aligncenter wp-image-94782 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-homepage.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-homepage-480x238.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>From there, you’ll follow the steps to <strong>input your business information</strong>, and you’ll be prompted to import any Meta or Google Ads campaigns you’re running that you want to carry over into Microsoft Ads.</p>
<h3>2. Set your payment method (and know your budget)</h3>
<p>Microsoft Ads will then prompt you <strong>to choose how you want to be billed </strong>for any clicks (or other interactions, depending on your ad type) on your ads. You’ll want a reliable payment method here, as an invalid payment will stop your ads from running.</p>
<p>At this point, you’ll likely want to start considering <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-budget" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how much you’ll spend on Microsoft Ads</a>. This<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o56o0sTJrM5VYBLYclldYqpO1xlBeigHGaup-OAd10A/copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> free Microsoft Ads budget template</a> can help you navigate this important part of your strategy planning.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-budget-template.webp" alt="microsoft ads - budget template screenshot" width="900" height="559" class="aligncenter wp-image-94786 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-budget-template.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-budget-template-480x298.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o56o0sTJrM5VYBLYclldYqpO1xlBeigHGaup-OAd10A/copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Get the template here</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<h3>3. Create your first campaign</h3>
<p>Once your account is set up, it’s time to start building your Microsoft Ads! Note that if you select to<strong> create an account and campaign</strong> (rather than just an account), you’ll be prompted to automatically <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/05/performance-max-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create a Performance Max (PMax) campaign</a> in Microsoft Ads during the set-up process. You can read up on the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/20/performance-max-pros-cons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pros and cons of PMax</a> here.</p>
<h3>4. Review and launch your campaign</h3>
<p>By the step, you’ll want a good understanding of what campaign goals you’re looking to achieve, what audience you’ll want to target, and which ad types you’ll want to create and publish. The tips in this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-account-structure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads account structure guide</a> can be applicable here, since the two platforms function so similarly.</p>
<p>Basically, once your account is created, you’re able to really dig into your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/paid-search-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Ads strategy</a>. You might want to<strong> hold off on publishing a campaign right away </strong>once you get your account sorted, so that you can <strong>ensure your </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/customize-google-ads-conversion-tracking" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>conversion tracking</strong></a><strong> is set</strong> and that you’re confident in the ad setup you’re selecting.</p>
<h3>5. Measure and optimize your Microsoft Ads</h3>
<p>Congratulations! Your business is now up and running on Microsoft Ads. Now, all that’s left to do is <strong>track your campaign performance</strong> and <strong>make optimization tweaks </strong>as you go.</p>
<p>Read on to the following Microsoft Ads tips for what to do to optimize your ads, and you can jump into the<strong> reporting </strong>section of the platform to start measuring your campaign results. If you don’t have a ton of historical data coming in right away to gauge your baseline performance, you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-google-ads-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use industry benchmarks</a> to see how you’re doing compared to averages in your industry.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that it might be helpful to lean into third-party tools or marketing partners to analyze your campaign performance, too.</p>

<div id="microsoft-ads-tips"></div>
<h2>Microsoft Ad tips</h2>
<p>Here are some quick tips for running Microsoft Ads.</p>
<h3>1. Use pre-qualifying terms in your ad copy</h3>
<p>It’s important to keep in mind that the goal of your Microsoft Ads won’t always be to get more clicks. In most cases, the goal is to convert people into paying customers.</p>
<p>For example, if you use controversial or provocative words in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/03/ad-copy-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ad copy</a> (that aren’t related to your business), you’ll certainly get more clicks on your ads. But how many of those people will turn into your customers? Most likely not too many.</p>
<p>Since you don’t want to waste your advertising budget on useless clicks, it’s a good idea to pre-qualify prospects in your ads to ensure you get targeted traffic.</p>
<p>If you look at the image below, there’s no confusion about who the ad is for. The ad doesn’t try to target all dog food buyers. It explicitly states “best dog food for picky dogs” in the headline to specifically target people looking for the best dog food for their dog with selective taste buds. So, you can be quite confident that most people who click the ad likely fit that description.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-example-ad.webp" alt="microsoft ads - example microsoft ads copy" width="900" height="536" class="aligncenter wp-image-94784 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-example-ad.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-example-ad-480x286.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>2. Leverage ad extensions</h3>
<p>Ad extensions in Microsoft Ads function similarly to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-assets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ad assets in Google Ads</a>. These are additional links, buttons, and bits of information you can tack onto your ads to make them larger, more eye-catching, and actionable.</p>
<p>For instance, it’s no secret that a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/13/call-to-action-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong call to action (CTA)</a> prompts people to take action.</p>
<p>You can include a CTA button in your Microsoft ads using an action extension. The action extension displays a CTA button next to your ad’s description, making it easy for people to spot and click.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-extensions.webp" alt="microsoft ads - extensions" width="900" height="605" class="aligncenter wp-image-94787 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-extensions.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-extensions-480x323.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4da.png" alt="📚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide download</strong> &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download">The 42 Best Call to Action Phrases Ever (&amp; Why They Work)</a></p>
<h3>3. Leverage social proof</h3>
<p>Many of us naturally turn to others to help us decide when we have limited information about certain products or services.</p>
<p>If there’s strong evidence that other people find what you sell valuable, that will often serve as enough catalyst to convert people.</p>
<p>While it’s difficult to provide convincing enough <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/social-proof/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social proof</a> in your search ad where there’s limited space, you can still include some social proof in your ad using a review extension. The extension allows you to display a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-online-reviews-impact-your-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">positive review</a> from your existing customer.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can simply add a social proof element to your ad text or images. For instance, the example Microsoft Audience Network image ad below shows how the company tries to communicate credibility in its creative and copy.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-display-ad.webp" alt="microsoft ads - audience network ad example" width="599" height="606" class="aligncenter wp-image-94777 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-display-ad.webp 599w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-display-ad-480x486.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 599px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>4. Be specific with your offers</h3>
<p>Your Microsoft Ads should clearly showcase what they offer. For instance, if your business offers a discount, you want to communicate exactly how much discount the customer is getting rather than writing vague statements, such as “huge discounts.”</p>
<p>You only get limited space on Bing results pages, and it takes less than a few seconds for customers to decide if they will bother with your ads. So, make sure you display the most enticing offer that’ll grab their attention.</p>
<h3>5. Try a variety of campaigns and ad types</h3>
<p>Microsoft Ads has expanded just as much as other major advertising platforms over the last few years. Now, advertisers have more options than ever to expand their reach and constantly serve up fresh ads to their audiences. Take advantage of as many different campaigns and ad types in Microsoft Ads to ensure you’re tapping into every possible ad placement for your business.</p>
<p>Your Microsoft Ads campaign options are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search</li>
<li>Shopping</li>
<li>Streaming</li>
<li>Lodging (for hotels and hospitality businesses)</li>
<li>Performance Max</li>
<li>Audience</li>
</ul>
<p>All six of these campaign types allow for different ad formats, like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/05/responsive-search-ad-copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Responsive Search Ads</a>, image and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/video-marketing-for-small-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video ads</a>, and so on.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-campaign-menu.webp" alt="microsoft ads - campaign options" width="900" height="546" class="aligncenter wp-image-94783 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-campaign-menu.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-campaign-menu-480x291.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>6. Leverage automation when you can</h3>
<p>Similar to Google or Meta Ads, Microsoft Ads offers <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-experiments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI capabilities</a> directly within the platform to streamline your ad workflows. For example, you can use Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/05/generative-ai-in-digital-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generative AI options</a> to create, edit, or expand images for your ads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-ai.webp" alt="microsoft ads - ai image example" width="900" height="338" class="aligncenter wp-image-94780 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-ai.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-ai-480x180.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In your campaign settings, you can have <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-ads-ai-copy-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">auto-generated assets</a> created for your ad headlines and descriptions, too.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-campaign-settings.webp" alt="microsoft ads - campaign settings screenshot" width="900" height="203" class="aligncenter wp-image-94781 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-campaign-settings.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/microsoft-ads-campaign-settings-480x108.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Additionally, Microsoft Ads has fully <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/23/optimize-performance-max-campaigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automated campaign types, like Performance Max</a>, if you’re unsure of where to start or don’t have a ton of time to oversee a campaign.</p>
<p>At minimum, you’ll likely find yourself using an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-automated-bidding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automated bidding strategy</a>, as that’s the standard for most accounts at this point. This is because it’s best for your bids (the most you’re offering to pay for an ad placement or click) to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-smart-bidding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adjust automatically according to each ad auction</a> in real time.</p>
<h2>Turn your Microsoft Ad ideas into reality</h2>

<h2>Why is your Google Ads account structure so important?</h2>
<p>Let’s take a step back–what is even meant by account structure, and why is it so important?</p>
<p>I’m glad you asked. Put simply, the way you structure your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-not-working">Google Ads</a> account allows you to control how you want your ads to be triggered and when and where you want them to appear. Not having a well-structured account is like attempting to drive a car that’s not properly built&#8211;accidents are bound to happen.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that having a well-structured account will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the searches triggering your ads are relevant to your audience.</li>
<li>Result in better Quality Scores, which, in turn, brings better results and lower prices. Quality score is essentially the scale of how much Google likes you (and trust me, you want Google to love you!).</li>
<li>Keep you organized and able to optimize. If your account is a mess, then you’re likely to get lost in the mess, your results will plummet (or never arrive), and optimizing to get better results will be out of the question. So keep in mind organization (and your own sanity) when structuring your account.</li>
</ul>

<div id="overview"></div>
<h2>Google Ads account overview</h2>
<p>A Google Ads account is more than just one account with a bunch of ads. So let&#8217;s start with a big-picture overview of its key components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account:</strong> This is the outer shell, with your business and payment information that houses everything.</li>
<li><strong>Campaigns:</strong> Campaigns house your ad groups. You can only have one <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/05/types-of-google-ads">ad type</a> (Search vs. Display, for example) per campaign, but you can (and should) have multiple ad groups within a campaign, and you can (and should) have multiple campaigns per account.</li>
<li><strong>Ad groups:</strong> These contain your ads and keywords and are grouped by theme.</li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>These are the terms that you want to trigger your ads to show in the search engine results page (SERP).</li>
<li><strong>Ads: </strong>This is the actual copy and creative that appears on the SERP.</li>
<li><strong>Landing page:</strong> The page viewers land on once they click your ad. You will have only one landing page per ad group. Given<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/15/landing-page-best-practices"> landing page best practices</a>—namely, how specific it should be to the offering and the ad promoting it—you can get a feel for how ad groups are organized.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-account-structure.webp" alt="google ads account structure chart" width="818" height="613" class="aligncenter wp-image-91558 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-account-structure.webp 818w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-account-structure-480x360.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 818px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There are different groupings and levels, and certain features and settings are only available at certain levels within your account.</p>
<p>At first, this may feel confusing, but in the end, it&#8217;s designed this way to help you streamline things as much as possible and customize where necessary.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s dive into each layer within your account so you can see what I mean.</p>
<div id="account"></div>
<h2>The account level</h2>
<p>The shell of your Google Ads account is the first layer of PPC management that is often referred to as the “account level.” This is where big-picture portions of your Google Ads get taken care of, like your billing, user permissions, and more.</p>
<h3>How do I create a Google Ads account?</h3>
<p>To <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-run-google-ads">create a Google Ads account</a>, go to <a href="https://ads.google.com/home/#!/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ads.google.com</a> and have an email address handy. It doesn’t necessarily have to be a Gmail account.<a href="https://ads.google.com/home/#!/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em></em></a><em> </em></p>
<h3>What is a Google Ads Manager account? Do I need one?</h3>
<p>Google Ads Manager accounts were designed with agencies in mind, as they have <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/19/agencies-sell-more-ppc">multiple clients using PPC</a>. This acts as an umbrella account where you can manage multiple accounts in one place.</p>
<p>However, you don’t have to be an agency to have a Manager account. You may be an independent consultant, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/06/small-business-ideas">own multiple businesses</a> or brands, or just have different needs in your PPC plan that require totally separate setups.</p>
<p>In short, if you manage more than one account, you’ll want to follow the prompts to create a Manager account. If you’re just working in one individual account, though, a Manager account is not needed.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f926-200d-2640-fe0f.png" alt="🤦‍♀️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Are you making mistakes in Google Ads?</strong> Find out with the <strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Free Google Ads Performance Grader</a></strong>!</p>
<h3>Account-level settings</h3>
<p>Here are a few of the highlights within the settings found at the account level. Changes to any of these settings will apply to every campaign, ad group, and ad in your account.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account name: </strong>Usually your business name. Just keep it simple and easy to reference in case technical support ever needs to hop in.</li>
<li><strong>Account status: </strong>Enabled, disabled, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Data protection contacts:</strong> Who you’d want to be notified by Google regarding data and privacy terms.</li>
<li><strong>Time zone: </strong>Your ad scheduling will automatically set to this.</li>
<li><strong>Auto-tagging: </strong>A required setup that will add a GCLID (Google click identifier) to your URLs.</li>
<li><strong>Tracking template:</strong> Any parameters you want included in your URLs for all of the ads in your account.</li>
<li><strong>Third-party measurement:</strong> Where you can link your CRM for data integration.</li>
<li><strong>Call reporting: </strong>How you’ll track calls (if you’re running call extensions, location extensions, or call ads).</li>
<li><strong>Negative keywords: </strong>Terms you negate at the account level (we’ll cover more on negative keywords later).</li>
<li><strong>Auto-apply:</strong> Where you select which optimizations you want Google to apply across your account’s campaigns automatically.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Account-level tips</h3>
<p>As you poke around the account level, here are three general <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/losing-money-in-google-ads">Google Ads tips</a> to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decide how you want your account to be structured: </strong>This question arises constantly: <em>What is the perfect account structure</em><em>? </em>I hate to break it to ya, but there is, truthfully, no magic recipe for structuring your account, and more than one strategy can prove successful. Luckily, there are a few different methods that work well:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Based on the structure of your website:</strong> How is your website structured? Do you have different tabs or pages for different products or offerings? Do you value different product pages over others? If your website is well-structured (which it should be), then it makes sense to structure your Google Ads account in a similar fashion.</li>
<li><strong>By products/services offered: </strong>This is likely the same as the structure of your website, but think about your different services or products offered and structure your account in a similar fashion. For example, let’s say you sell tennis gear; you would want to create a campaign for tennis rackets, tennis balls, tennis clothing, etc. Then, under the tennis rackets campaign, you might create separate ad groups for the brands you sell or perhaps for the size or gender the racket is for. Take a look at your various offerings and decide which ones are most valuable. Is there a very large demand for tennis bags online? Then you might want to run a campaign for tennis bags with a higher budget. Spend some time mapping out your products and deciding how you want to divvy up your budget between campaigns.</li>
<li><strong>Based on locations: </strong>Is location important to your business? Maybe you’re a law office that has <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing/opening-new-location-7-ways-promote-it/">multiple locations</a> across New England, or perhaps you sell development courses in major cities ranging from London to Tokyo. If location targeting is important, then structure it based on this. For example, create a London campaign to sell your development course to only those in a particular radius of the city.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there are many other tactics to structuring your account, but it’s all about taking the time to come up with a rational structure that will be easy to manage, track, and <a href="/blog/ws/2014/04/24/ppc-performance">optimize</a> to get the best results over time. So take the time to ponder various structuring techniques, and decide on the one that works best for your business. Once you’ve decided, I’d recommend actually mapping out the structure on a piece of paper or in an Excel doc to get a full visual of the campaigns and ad groups you’ll be creating. Now, onto a couple more Google Ads account structure tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perform regular audits: </strong>Like with anything in small business marketing, you need to check in on your Google Ads performance regularly. When you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/15/google-ads-account-audit-post-covid">audit your Google Ads account</a> on a scheduled basis, you’re able to find areas for optimization before they turn into headaches.</li>
<li><strong>Be wary of auto-apply recommendations: </strong>Advice from Google Ads is like advice from a stranger—take it with a grain of salt. Google’s auto-applied ads and other optimization recommendations can be helpful at times where you’re short of ideas, but at the end of the day, you will know what’s best for your account.</li>
</ul>
<div id="campaigns">
<h2>The campaign level</h2>
<p>In general, a marketing campaign can mean anything, but in Google Ads, the term “campaign” is the bucket that houses your ad groups. You&#8217;ll set your budget, targeting, the type of ad you want to run, and more at the campaign level. As mentioned above, you can only have one ad <em>type</em> per campaign, but you&#8217;ll have multiple ad <em>groups</em> per campaign and multiple campaigns per account.</p>
<h3>What are the different campaign types in Google Ads?</h3>
<p>Here are the seven different campaign types in Google Ads to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Search: </strong>Text ads that appear on Google Search<span>.</span></li>
<li><strong> Display:</strong> Image ads that appear on websites in the Google Display Network<span>.</span></li>
<li><strong> Shopping: </strong>Product ads on Google Search and the Shopping tab<span>.</span></li>
<li><strong> Video: </strong>Animated ads on YouTube and the Display Network<span>.</span></li>
<li><strong> Demand Gen:</strong> Immersive ads that appear on multiple Google networks<span>.</span></li>
<li><strong> App: </strong>Ads for your app across multiple Google networks<span>.</span></li>
<li><strong>Performance Max: </strong>Ads created from various assets shown across all of Google’s eligible networks.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Another note: </strong>For this post, our anatomy will follow that of an advertiser using Search, Display, and/or Video campaigns. Some components may vary by campaign type, which will be noted throughout.

<h3>Which campaign type should I use?<strong> </strong></h3>
<p>It’s a best practice to run a few different campaign types within your Google Ads account to maximize your performance across Google’s advertising networks. Different campaign types can help you hit different<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/19/ppc-metrics"> PPC metrics</a>, so it’s in your best interest to try at least one or two when starting out.</p>
<p>For example, you may want to run a search campaign to catch folks while they&#8217;re searching on Google, as well as a display campaign for when they&#8217;re browsing other sites across the web. Some campaigns are industry-specific and may not be needed, like Shopping (for ecommerce businesses) or App campaigns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-account-structure-example.jpg" alt="google ads account structure - example account layout" width="935" height="558" class="aligncenter wp-image-94410 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-account-structure-example.jpg 935w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-account-structure-example-480x286.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 935px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>How many campaigns should I have?</h3>
<p>This will all depend on your business size, business model, budget, and more. There’s no right or wrong answer when it comes to what campaign types you should have or how many of them, but it’s a best practice to keep it as manageable as possible.</p>
<p>So, for example, if you’re a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/19/google-ads-for-small-businesses">small business running Google Ads</a> and don’t have the overall budget or bandwidth to realistically stretch across 10 or 20 campaigns, it’s better to start small with one or two for effective advertising rather than be overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you might not always have all your campaigns running at once. You might have seasonal offers, for example, or campaigns that you only run when you have the inventory or budget.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s the best Google Ads campaign structure?</h3>
<p>This is all going to depend on your business size, type, model, and more. There isn&#8217;t a one-size-fits-all formula, but there are some options to consider. Similar to how you&#8217;d approach your overall account structure, take a look at how you group your offerings on your website to inspire your campaign makeup. What do you have unique pages for? Which pages are most popular or of the highest value? If your website is well-structured, you might want to adopt the same system for your campaigns. For <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/franchise-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-location businesses</a>, it might make sense to run campaigns by location since location targeting is set at the campaign level.</p>
<h3>Campaign-level settings</h3>
<p>There’s a lot to play around with at the campaign level, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Campaign name:</strong> Similar to account name, this is how you’ll refer to your campaign and has no impact on performance.</li>
<li><strong>Status:</strong> Paused, enabled, or removed.</li>
<li><strong>Conversion goal:</strong> What you want your campaign to achieve in relation to your conversion actions.</li>
<li><strong>Budget:</strong> Roughly how much your campaign will spend per day.</li>
<li><strong>Bid strategy:</strong> How aggressively you want to bid, based on your goals. See our complete guide to bidding strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Locations:</strong> Where in the world you choose for your campaign’s ads to show, also known as geotargeting.</li>
<li><strong>Languages:</strong> This is not the language of your ad, but what languages you want your ad to show for.</li>
<li><strong>Networks:</strong> In some campaign types, like Google Search, you can opt to show your campaign solely on the Google SERP or also on Google’s subsidiary search engines within its Search Partner Network.</li>
<li><strong>Start and end dates:</strong> If you don’t want to worry about enabling or pausing your campaign, start and end dates can sometimes come in handy.</li>
<li><strong>IP exclusions:</strong> Any specific IP addresses you’d rather not show to.</li>
<li><strong>AI Max for Search campaigns:</strong> For Search campaigns, advertisers have the option to opt into AI automation for asset optimization and more.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Campaign-level tips</h3>
<p>When it comes to running Google Ads, there are a few campaign tips to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Run a variety of campaign types. </strong>This will help you hit different business goals. Plus, they often work synergistically. For example, display campaigns can build brand awareness and improve your search ad performance. Of course, some campaign types are industry-specific and may not apply to your business.</li>
<li><strong>Keep them organized. </strong>Break out your campaigns so they map to your business <span>goals</span>, such as by product or service type, conversion action type, sales funnel stages, or locations. And establish a naming convention that makes sense to anyone managing the account.</li>
<li><strong>Separate out branded campaigns. </strong>These campaigns behave and perform differently from <span>non-branded</span> campaigns, so it’ll be best to budget for, strategize, and report on these separately.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </strong><strong>Is your Google Ads account structure in need of a refresh?</strong> Find out, and get an instant account report, using our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Free Google Ads Grader</a>!</p>
<div id="ad-groups"></div>
<h2>The ad group level</h2>
<p>Going down one tier under campaigns, we have ad groups. Each ad group contains a group of related keywords, their associated ads, and a landing page. One sidenote, though, for PMax campaigns, these are known as asset groups.</p>
<h3>I only want to create one ad&#8211;why do I need an ad group?</h3>
<p>You’ll notice when creating an ad that you’re prompted to create an ad group. This is a required part of the process, even if you just want one ad. But as we’ll talk about later, it’s best to<strong> have at least two different versions of your ad</strong> so you can test and see what performs best.</p>
<p>In most cases, you won’t have just one ad in your Google Ads account.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s an example to explain why: </strong>Let’s say you’re a home service business and you want to advertise two main offers: installations and repairs. Installations are of higher value to you than repairs, so you separate these into two different campaigns.</p>
<p>That way, you can allocate more budget toward installations (because, as we just learned, budget is set at the campaign level, not the ad level). But you have different types of installations, like windows, gutters, and more.</p>
<p>You want to keep the same location, network, and device targeting for each of these offers—so it works to keep them in the same campaign—but the targeted keywords and ad copy for your window installation ad will, of course, be totally different from your gutter installation ad.</p>
<p>The same goes for your different types of repairs. So, you’ll want to have a separate ad group for each type of installation. Not only will this keep your account organized, but it will also keep your costs low.</p>
<h3>How do thematic ad groups lower my ad costs?</h3>
<p>The higher your Quality Score, the lower your cost per click, and you achieve high Quality Scores by keeping your ads and landing pages super relevant to their keywords. So, if you put all of your installation ads in one ad group, you’ll have window installation ads connected to gutter installation keywords—not very relevant.</p>
<p>Plus, you can only have one landing page per ad group, so you’d need to make it general enough to cover everything—once again, not very relevant.</p>
<p><strong>If you separate your ad groups out, you can ensure tight alignment between your keywords, ad, and landing page for a better play in the Google Ads auction.</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-cost-google-ads-auction-formula.jpg" alt="google ads cost - google ads auction formula" width="935" height="326" class="aligncenter wp-image-91781 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-cost-google-ads-auction-formula.jpg 935w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-cost-google-ads-auction-formula-480x167.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 935px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>How many ad groups should I have per campaign?</h3>
<p><strong>You should have no more than roughly 7-10 ad groups per campaign. </strong>You’ll most likely need even less than that. The more centralized to your main goals or offerings, the better. If you have a ton of ad groups, that’s a sign you need another campaign!</p>
<h3>How many keywords should I have per ad group?</h3>
<p>You should have only one keyword theme per ad group (as we established), so you may only need to start with 10-20 keywords max. With all the keyword matching updates, we don’t need as many as we once did, so stick to your core terms and avoid muddying up the waters with a ton of variations.</p>
<h3>How many ads should I have per ad group?</h3>
<p>You should aim to have two or three ads per ad group. This is a little confusing since responsive search ads themselves rotate through different copy combinations within the same ad, but you should still always be testing more than one overall approach or tone at a time, such as an RSA with a set of positively-framed headlines and descriptions vs one with those that are negatively framed.</p>
<p>Note that<strong> you can only have three enabled RSAs per ad group</strong>, or otherwise you’ll get a flag that looks like this when you try to create another ad:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-account-structure-rsa-flag.jpg" alt="google ads account structure flag" width="505" height="210" class="aligncenter wp-image-94405 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-account-structure-rsa-flag.jpg 505w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-account-structure-rsa-flag-480x200.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 505px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Ad group-level settings</h3>
<p>Here is a quick preview of what you can adjust at the ad group level:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ad group name:</strong> Same as campaign and account levels, name your ad groups what would make the most sense to you. Again, the names of your assets are not a performance factor.</li>
<li><strong>Ad group status:</strong> Whether your ad group is paused, enabled, or removed.</li>

<h3>Ad group-level tips</h3>
<p>Recommended best practices for ad groups are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Do organize your ad groups systematically.</strong> Stick to core <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/29/single-theme-ad-groups">ad group themes</a> and break them out in a way that makes the most sense for you. Themed ad groups will help to keep your ad relevance high, which is essential if you want to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/24/how-to-compete-in-google-ads">compete in Google Ads without having to hike up your bids</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t use too many or too few ad groups. </strong>While you don’t want to stuff everything into one ad group, you also don’t want to break them out too much into a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/03/the-case-against-skags">SKAG (single keyword ad group) </a>structure as either option can equally be a pain to manage.</li>
<li><strong>Do get ready to change these regularly</strong>. As a PPC expert, pausing, adjusting, and moving around ad groups and their components is the bulk of my optimization work.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t add in ad group components just to hit our recommended numbers above.</strong> Those are guidelines, so don’t break your back squeezing in an unnecessary keyword or ad group to hit an ideal number.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>The keyword level</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/ppc-keyword">Keywords</a> act as your “north star” within your Google Ads account. For Search, they indicate to Google which types of queries you want your ads to show for.</p>
<p>Note: PMax campaigns use <span>s</span>earch <span>t</span>hemes instead of keywords.</p>
<h3>What are Google Ads keyword match types?</h3>
<p>When you select or edit your keywords, you’ll also have to assign them a <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7478529?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">match type</a>. There are three match types to choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul></ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong> Broad match:</strong> Least restrictive; matches your ad to any queries related to that keyword.</li>
<li><strong> Phrase match: </strong>Matches your ad to any queries that include your keyword or include anything that means the same thing as the keyword.</li>
<li><strong>Exact match: </strong>Most restrictive; matches your ad to queries that are your keyword or are of the same meaning as the keyword.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/keyword-match-type-chart-e1758567069313.webp" alt="keyword match types in google ads" width="680" height="432" class="aligncenter wp-image-87112 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/keyword-match-type-chart-e1758567069313.webp 680w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/keyword-match-type-chart-e1758567069313-480x270.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 680px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Keyword-level settings</h3>
<p>As you add keywords, these are the settings you will apply:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Keyword bid:</strong> Only necessary if you’re using manual bidding.</li>
<li><strong> Match type: </strong>This will depend on your strategy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Keyword-level tips</h3>
<p>Check out these quick Google Ads keyword tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do your PPC keyword research.</strong> This is non-negotiable! Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">keyword research tools</a> to identify the most relevant keywords for your offerings and make sure you’re capturing transactional or commercial intent.</li>
<li><strong>Mix up your match types.</strong> This will give you flexibility to see which match type works best for your core terms.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain your keyword lists. </strong>Adding your keywords to your ad group is just the first step in the process. You need to be regularly mining your search terms report to find new keywords to add, negative keywords to negate, and low-performing keywords to remove, pause, or separate out.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t just go for the lowest CPC keywords. </strong>Some keywords are going to have a higher average cost per click than others, but these will typically bring in higher value clicks and conversions.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t ignore other targeting options in favor of keywords. </strong>These may be the building blocks of Google Ads, but you still need to pay attention to your location, device, and audience targeting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The ad level</h2>
<p>We’re now down to the most granular part of your Google Ads account anatomy: the ad level. This is where we get to the good stuff: your ads! These, of course, are what your targeted users see. Who knew that for the one ad you see on a website or SERP, there are so many doors to open to get there?! When building out a campaign, the ad level is where you input text and upload or generate creative assets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-benchmarks-example-ads-on-serp.webp" alt="google ads benchmarks - example ad serp" width="800" height="379" class="aligncenter wp-image-91526 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-benchmarks-example-ads-on-serp.webp 800w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-benchmarks-example-ads-on-serp-480x227.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An example of what ads look like on the SERP. </em></p>
<p>If you’re creating a search ad, it’s important to stick to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/10/responsive-search-ads">responsive search ad copy best practices</a>, like pinning headlines and descriptions sparingly, and using keywords carefully, rather than excessively.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/responsive-search-ads-wordstream.webp" alt="how responsive search ads work" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92499 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/responsive-search-ads-wordstream.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/responsive-search-ads-wordstream-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Ad-level settings</h3>
<p>There are a couple of components you can change within the ad creation portal:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ad components:</strong> Assets like your headlines, descriptions, videos, or images.</li>
<li><strong>Landing page URL: </strong>Where you’ll be pointing your ad to. All ads within the same ad group have to point to the same landing page URL. All ads within a campaign have to point to the same domain.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ad-level tips</h3>
<p>Remember the following when creating your Google Ads:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be strategic with your ad copy. </strong>A great ad includes the right mix of features, benefits, differentiators, and CTAs. Use these tips for writing exceptional ads.</li>
<li><strong>Always be testing. </strong>Until mind-reading becomes widely available, this is the only way you’ll know what type of ad best appeals to your customers. Try swapping different keywords to go along with your ads, different images on Display ads, video lengths on Video ads, or include different language that speaks to a specific product price or service offering.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is a Google Ads budget?</h2>
<p>Your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-cost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads budget</a> is how much money you’re ready to spend for user interactions with your ads, like clicks, views, or other engagements (depending on your campaign type and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-smart-bidding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bidding strategy</a>). You set your Google Ads budget at the campaign level.</p>
<p>Google Ads budgets help inform the platform’s algorithms to know how much you’re looking to spend on a campaign. This budget will be broken out into bids for each ad auction, so your Google Ads bidding strategy can impact <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-automated-bidding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how quickly or slowly your budget gets spent</a> throughout the day.</p>

<div id="google-ads-budget-types"></div>
<h2>Types of Google Ads budgets</h2>
<p>There are four different types of Google Ads budgets advertisers may refer to, so let’s clarify them a bit.</p>
<h3>Daily budgets</h3>
<p>A daily budget is a budget <strong>every advertiser must assign to individual campaigns</strong>. Daily budgets guide Google Ads to know how much you want to spend on that campaign each day.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-budget-daily-budget.webp" alt="google ads budget - campaign daily budget screenshot" width="763" height="361" class="aligncenter wp-image-94150 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-budget-daily-budget.webp 763w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-budget-daily-budget-480x227.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 763px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>Note that Google Ads can (and usually will) spend more or less than your daily budget </strong>on any given day. This is called overdelivery. Typically, though, these fluctuations in spend average out to your daily budget over a 30-day period. So, it can be helpful to<strong> start with your ideal monthly spend and work backwards to determine your daily budget from there</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-budget-overdelivery.webp" alt="google ads budget - overdelivery explanation screenshot" width="867" height="228" class="aligncenter wp-image-94145 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-budget-overdelivery.webp 867w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-budget-overdelivery-480x126.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 867px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A breakdown of </em><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1704443" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Google Ads budget overdelivery</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<h3>Shared budgets</h3>
<p>Found in the <strong>budgets and bidding section </strong>within the Google Ads<strong> tools menu</strong>, and <strong>less common than daily budgets</strong>, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-shared-budgets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared budgets</a> are lump sum budgets you can spread or “share” across multiple campaigns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-budget-shared-budget.webp" alt="google ads budget - shared budgets screenshot" width="900" height="294" class="aligncenter wp-image-94138 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-budget-shared-budget.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-budget-shared-budget-480x157.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Monthly account spend limit</h3>
<p>This is a cap you can put on your total spend at the account level, regardless of your assigned daily budgets. You can find your account spend limit options under the<strong> settings</strong> menu within the<strong> billing</strong> section of the platform.</p>
<p>Account spend limits can sound appealing at first, and they are definitely helpful for businesses with hard budget stops. But know that <strong>setting your spend limit too low will restrict your campaign performance</strong>. Regardless of whether you assign a monthly spend limit to your account,<strong> you still have to assign a shared or daily budget to your campaigns.</strong></p>

<h3>Campaign total budget</h3>
<p><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10486938?hl=en#:~:text=When%20you%20already%20know%20how,after%20a%20campaign%20is%20created." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Campaign total budgets</a> are only available for Demand Gen, <a href="https://business.google.com/us/accelerate/announcements/retail-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Search, Shopping, and Performance Max campaigns</a> with specific start and end dates, so this isn&#8217;t the most popular strategy for Google Ads budgeting just yet. It will pop up as an option when you&#8217;re creating these types of campaigns, and Google uses your campaign&#8217;s total budget to spend evenly throughout the campaign&#8217;s duration while still accounting for higher or lower traffic days.</p>

<h2>How is your Google Ads budget spent?</h2>
<p>To fully understand how Google Ads spends your budget, let’s first refresh on how the Google Ads auction functions.</p>
<p>If you’re running a search campaign, when a user you’re targeting searches on Google for a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/keyword-prioritization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keyword you’re bidding on</a>, your ad is entered into the ad auction, where Google evaluates how much you’re willing to pay for a click (or view, etc.) from the user, and the Google Ads algorithm <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/14/how-does-google-ads-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranks your ad</a> accordingly.</p>
<p>If you’re using a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/05/types-of-google-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads campaign type</a> outside of search, like Display, Demand Gen, PMax, Video, or Shopping campaigns, the same concept applies when a targeted user browses content you&#8217;re targeting.</p>
<p>When considering your Google Ads budget and your campaign spending behavior in the auction environment, it can be helpful to remember that Google has a job to do. It’s constantly trying to balance the best quality ad for the user while also showing ads that will provide the platform with the most ad revenue.</p>
<p>That’s why your keyword <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/19/does-quality-score-still-matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quality Score</a> plays a role in Google Ads budget and bid planning. The better your ad relevance, expected click-through rate, and landing page experience (the three factors that go into Quality Score), the less you’ll have to pay per click. This is because Google’s algorithm views your ad as one that provides a higher-quality experience for its users—making them want to come back to Google for more.</p>
<p>All that to say, <strong>your Google Ads budget should reflect how you expect to perform in the ad auction</strong>. If you want your ad to rank at the top of the search engine results page (SERP), it may require a bit more budget.</p>

<h2>What is a good Google Ads budget?</h2>
<p>A good Google Ads budget is going to look different for every account out there. Factors that impact your Google Ads budget include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overall marketing budget</a></li>
<li>Your industry competition</li>
<li>Your chosen campaign types</li>
<li>Your advertising goals and objectives</li>
<li>And more</li>
</ul>
<p>We typically see small businesses starting their Google Ads budget at around <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-ads-spend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1,000-$2,500</a> per month. However, that number tends to climb as an account settles and scales, and<strong> most businesses have a Google Ads budget of </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-for-startups" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>$1,000 and $10,000</strong></a><strong> per month</strong>.</p>
<p>For reference, <strong>a new Google Ads campaign usually costs around </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-for-startups" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>$20-50</strong></a><strong> per day</strong>.</p>
<p>Additionally, nearly 20% of small businesses have an overall annual marketing budget of $20,000-49,000, with advertising being the top channel using that budget, according to our <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-marketing-trends-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small business trends report</a>.</p>

<p>So, we know the average Google Ads budget is anywhere between $1,000 and $10,000 for SMBs, but that’s still a pretty big window. Follow these steps to identify the exact right budget for your business.</p>
<h3>1. Review baseline Google Ads metrics</h3>
<p>To narrow in on a budget number that fits your business size, industry, and objectives, first take into account the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average cost per click in Google Ads in 2025 is $5.26.</li>
<li>The average cost per lead in Google Ads in 2025 is $70.11.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Review Google Ads benchmarks specific to your industry</h3>
<p>Next, zone in on your industry-specific metrics using our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-google-ads-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads benchmarks report</a>. You can use industry-specific data on average costs like this to predict how much you can expect to pay to achieve your click or conversion goals.</p>

<p>If you already have your Google Ads budget but you’re thinking of adjusting it due to industry competition or other factors, you’re not alone. Our trends report found that 36% of businesses were increasing their budgets this year due to increasing ad costs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/marketing-trends-report-2025-budget-investments-e1757606415462-664x1024.webp" alt="google ads budget - trends report" width="664" height="1024" class="aligncenter wp-image-94148 size-large" /></p>
<h3>3. Calculate your Google Ads budget</h3>
<p>Ready to calculate your own Google Ads budget? There are a couple of ways you can do just that:</p>
<p><strong>Calculate your Google Ads daily budget(s) by&#8230; </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your monthly spend. </strong>To get your total daily budget, you can take your ideal monthly spend and divide it by 30.4 (to account for the average number of days in a given month).</li>
<li><strong>Your goal number of clicks or leads per day.</strong> Take your industry’s average CPC (or CPL) and multiply it by your ideal number of clicks (or leads) per day. At a minimum, your daily budget will likely need to be slightly above that (accounting for cost fluctuations) to cover the costs of your desired results.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to set up your Google Ads budget</h2>
<p>You can set your Google Ads budget within<strong> campaign settings</strong>, or by <strong>clicking the pencil </strong>directly within the <strong>budget column</strong> of the platform’s <strong>campaign-level reporting</strong>.</p>

<h2>Google Ads budget tips</h2>
<p>Here are some tips to help you navigate your Google Ads budget planning.</p>
<h3>Be flexible</h3>
<p>The most important Google Ads budget tip to keep in mind is to stay flexible with your PPC spending. Be ready to shift and reallocate budgets across campaigns according to performance fluctuations. You’ll also have to revisit your Google Ads budgets regularly and increase or decrease them based on factors like <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/always-on-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seasonality</a>, competition, CPA targets, and more.</p>
<p>However, just be aware that it takes Google’s algorithmic learning period some time to adjust to any campaign changes—including budget shifts. That’s why it’s so important to never fully pause your staple campaigns, because Google uses any historical data you continuously collect to optimize your performance.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Regardless of seasonality, you should never fully stop your campaign spending! </strong>Download our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/always-on-marketing?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_alwaysonmarketing_Download&amp;itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free guide to always-on marketing</a> and see why it’s the key to unstoppable growth year-round!</p>
<h3>Know your goals</h3>
<p>Your goals directly align with what you’re setting for your Google Ads budget. If you set smart goals for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/19/ppc-metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">key PPC metrics</a>, you can predict from there how much money your budget will need to cover the costs of achieving those goals.</p>
<h3>Consider costs outside of just campaign spend</h3>
<p>Speaking of covering costs, be aware that additional purchases outside of campaign spend may be necessary to make your Google Ads successful. For example, you may also need to invest in a marketing partner, freelance designer, and more. This might not directly impact what you set as your campaign&#8217;s daily budgets, but it’s good to keep in mind when you’re considering your total Google Ads costs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-budget-considerations.webp" alt="google ads budget - considerations chart" width="762" height="367" class="aligncenter wp-image-94155 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-budget-considerations.webp 762w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-ads-budget-considerations-480x231.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 762px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Use AI sparingly</h3>
<p>It can be tempting to use AI in your Google Ads budget calculations. It’s so easy to simply <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-prompts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ask an AI tool</a>, “How much should my Google Ads budget be?” But it’s been proven that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-accurate-is-ai-for-ppc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one in five AI answers to PPC questions are incorrect</a>.</p>
<p>We recently asked five different <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-ai-tools">AI tools</a> the same PPC cost questions, and many answers were totally off base. That said, if you want AI to provide an added reference point for your budget estimations, it was found that Gemini and Perplexity had the most accurate Google Ads cost and performance data.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you, like me, have been running Google Ads for quite some time, you may remember something called Gmail Sponsored Promotions (GSP). This was a short-lived option as part of a Display campaign where you could show ads to people within Gmail. And get this: you could target those ads based on the content of people’s emails! As you can imagine, this was highly effective for advertisers but also a serious privacy concern for users. Google nixed that many years ago, and the Gmail placement was eventually folded into Demand Gen and PMax campaigns. Standalone Gmail Ads died&#8230;or so we thought.</p>
<p>Recently, Google introduced a new option in Demand Gen campaigns that allows you to pick your channels. Demand Gen campaigns can place ads on YouTube, Discover, Gmail, and the Display Network. Now, if you only select the “Gmail” option, you can run ads exclusively on Gmail. This presents a unique opportunity for email marketers, Google Ads practitioners, small business owners, and more.</p>
<p>In this guide, I&#8217;m going to share everything you need to know about Gmail Ads in 2025 so you can decide if this is the right next step for your marketing strategy.</p>

<h2>What are Gmail Ads?</h2>
<p>Gmail Ads are ads that show directly in users&#8217; inboxes. When users are on their Promotions or Social tabs in Gmail, the ad will look like they have an email from your business. It will say &#8220;Sponsored&#8221; next to your business name and then display one of your headline options and one of your description options. This is called the “teaser ad.”</p>
<p>Sometimes, your image, video, or products may be shown, too, before the user even clicks on the ad.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gmail-ads-example.jpg" alt="example Gmail ad" width="309" height="594" class="aligncenter wp-image-93817 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gmail-ads-example.jpg 309w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gmail-ads-example-156x300.jpg 156w" sizes="(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px" /></p>

<div id="types-of-gmail-ads"></div>
<h2>Types of Gmail Ads</h2>
<p>Since a Gmail Ad is part of a Demand Gen campaign, you can create a <strong>single image ad</strong>, a <strong>carousel image ad</strong>, or a <strong>video ad</strong>. Here is a breakdown of all these different types of Gmail Ads:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single image and video ads</strong>: You can have up to five headlines and five descriptions per ad. With an image ad, you can add up to 20 images per ad, and with a video ad, you can add up to five videos per ad. Note that, currently, the Google Ads Help Center says that video ads are not compatible with Gmail, but this is outdated information! Video ads can run in Gmail, though for now, they only serve on mobile devices.</li>
<li><strong>Carousel image ads</strong>: These ads only get one overall headline and one overall description. This is because when a user clicks on your ad, it will open an email that has multiple “cards” forming your carousel. Each card then has its own image, headline, description, and final URL. Think of this as similar to a Carousel ad you might run on Meta. (This is actually the only place in Google Ads where carousel ads are supported.)</li>
<li><strong>Product Ads</strong>: If you have a product feed from Google Merchant Center connected to your Google Ads account, you can also choose to include this as part of your ad. You can select this in your Campaign settings.</li>
</ul>

<div id="targeting-gmail-ads"></div>
<h2>How to target users with Gmail Ads</h2>
<p>Because Gmail ads are part of a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/22/demand-gen-campaigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demand Gen campaign</a>, you have a variety of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-audience-targeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">audience targeting options</a> available to you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google&#8217;s audiences</strong>: You can target using detailed demographics, in-market segments, life event segments, and affinity segments.</li>
<li><strong>Custom segments</strong>: You can target based on the things people search for, the types of websites they visit, and/or the types of apps they use.</li>
<li><strong>Your data segments</strong>: You can<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/retargeting-ad-ideas" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> reach people who have visited your website</a>, used your app, interacted with your YouTube content, or are on a customer list you’ve uploaded. You can also target a Google Engaged audience, which is made up of users who have visited your website from Google or YouTube search results.</li>
<li><strong>Lookalike segments</strong>: You can build a lookalike segment of people who are similar to any of your data segments.</li>
<li><strong>Basic demographics</strong>: You can narrow your audience further using basic demographics such as age, gender, and parental status.</li>
<li><strong>Location targeting</strong>: As with any other type of Google Ads campaign, you can use location targeting.</li>
<li><strong>Optimized targeting:</strong> This option turns your audience <em>targeting</em> into audience <em>signals</em>, giving Google permission to show your Gmail Ads to people who might not match the audiences you&#8217;ve chosen, but who it thinks are likely to convert. Proceed with caution because optimized targeting can quickly consume your budget, leaving little room for the specific audiences you&#8217;ve selected.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheatsheet.webp" alt="google ads audience targeting chart" width="929" height="358" class="aligncenter wp-image-91285 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheatsheet.webp 929w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheatsheet-480x185.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 929px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You should note that <strong>content targeting</strong> options are not available to you with Gmail Ads or any Demand Gen campaign. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>No keyword targeting</li>
<li>No placement targeting (because the placement is Gmail)</li>
<li>No topics targeting (because, again, you are only targeting the Gmail placement)</li>
</ul>
<p>One more tip: If you regularly send out promotional emails, and you have a list of people who have unsubscribed from your emails, I recommend uploading that list to Google Ads and excluding it from your Gmail campaigns. Otherwise, you may end up showing ads in Gmail to people who have unsubscribed from your emails, which creates a poor user experience.</p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW91369322 BCX0"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW91369322 BCX0"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4e7.png" alt="📧" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span></span>Be sure your Gmail Ads are hitting the right inboxes</strong> with our free guide to <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteTargetAudience.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_TargetAudineceGuide_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redefining your target audience</a>!</p>
<div id="gmail-bidding"></div>
<h2>How bidding works with Gmail Ads</h2>
<p>When you set up your Demand Gen campaign, you can choose to optimize for clicks or conversions. If you have enough data in your account, you may also have the option to optimize for conversion value.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are running your Gmail Ads to a <strong>warm audience</strong> that is already familiar with your business, then you should optimize for conversions, either through the Maximize Conversions or Target CPA <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-smart-bidding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bid strategy</a>.</li>
<li>If you are targeting your ads to a <strong>cold audience</strong> that is not yet familiar with your business, I recommend using the Maximize Clicks or Target CPC bid strategy. Yes, Target CPC! That&#8217;s the newest bid strategy in Google Ads, and it is only available in Demand Gen campaigns.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to create a Gmail-only campaign in Google Ads</h2>
<p>Now that you understand all the basics of Gmail Ads, it&#8217;s time to get started. The process for creating a Gmail-only campaign is simple. Here are the steps you need to follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Google Ads, <strong>create a new campaign</strong></li>
<li>Choose the objective &#8220;<strong>create a campaign without guidance</strong>.&#8221;</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Demand Gen</strong> campaign type. Confirm your conversion goals and proceed to the next step.</li>
<li>After you enter the various campaign settings like budget, bid strategy, etc., you will be taken to your <strong>ad group settings</strong>.</li>
<li>One of the options under ad group settings is<strong> channels</strong>. By default, your Demand Gen campaign will be opted into all channels. You’ll want to uncheck the boxes for the Google Display Network, YouTube, and Discover, so that your ads will now only be shown in users&#8217; Gmail inboxes.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples of Gmail Ads in the wild</h2>
<p>Want to see some examples of effective Gmail Ads? Here are a few we ran across!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gmail-ads-teaser.webp" alt="gmail ads - example gmail ad with image" width="294" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93818 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gmail-ads-teaser.webp 294w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gmail-ads-teaser-147x300.webp 147w" sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An example of Gmail ads within the standard inbox. Our Generation is showing a plain text teaser ad, and you can see that organic emails, like the one from PC Express Rapid Delivery, are also eligible to show images as part of their teaser.</em></p>
<p>If the user clicks to open your ad, to “view the email,” this is called the “expanded ad.” This is where they’ll see your full image(s) and/or video(s) and call-to-action button.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gmail-ads-expanded.webp" alt="google gmail ads - example" width="276" height="564" class="aligncenter wp-image-93820 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gmail-ads-expanded.webp 276w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gmail-ads-expanded-147x300.webp 147w" sizes="(max-width: 276px) 100vw, 276px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>When expanded, the ad from Google Ads is a single-image ad with a “Visit Site” call to action.</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gmail-ads-shopping.webp" alt="gmail ads - gmail shopping ads example" width="296" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93819 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gmail-ads-shopping.webp 296w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gmail-ads-shopping-148x300.webp 148w" sizes="(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>When expanded, the ad from Our Generation is a product feed ad, showing 23 different products with a “browse more” option at the bottom of the email. The ads show images, titles, and pricing from the Google Merchant Center feed, as well as certain annotations like “Free Shipping.”</em></p>
<div id="measuring-gmail-ads"></div>
<h2>How to know if your Gmail Ads are working</h2>
<p>To determine whether your Gmail Ads campaign is working, you&#8217;ll want to add a few columns to your report that you may not typically use: <strong>engagements</strong>, <strong>engagement rate</strong>, and <strong>average cost per engagement</strong>.</p>
<p>Why? When your Gmail ad appears in someone&#8217;s inbox, that counts as an <strong>impression</strong>. If they click to open the ad, that does not actually count as a click; that counts as an <strong>engagement</strong>. Once someone opens the ad and sees the full details, they then have the option to <strong>click</strong> and be taken to your website.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your goal is <strong>engagement</strong>, then you should measure the success of your campaign based on its <strong>engagement rate</strong> and <strong>cost per engagement</strong>. A low engagement rate suggests that your headlines and descriptions may need improvement. And because we know that sometimes images can show in the teaser ad, you might also want to try using more engaging imagery. The more engaging your ad is, the more Google will want to show it to people, so focus on <em>increasing</em> engagement rate in order to <em>decrease</em> cost per engagement.</li>
<li>If your goal is <strong>website visits (clicks)</strong>, then you should measure the success of your campaign based on its <strong>click-through rate</strong> and <strong>cost per click</strong>. A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/14/improve-google-ads-click-through-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low click-through rate</a> suggests that people who were interested enough to expand your ad didn’t find it compelling enough to follow through to your website. Experiment with different calls-to-action and different image and/or video assets to improve this metric. The more people who click on your ad, the more Google will want to show it to people, so focus on <em>increasing</em> click-through rate in order to <em>decrease</em> cost per click.</li>
<li>If your goal is <strong>conversions</strong>, then you&#8217;ll want to measure success based on <strong>conversion rate</strong> and <strong>cost per conversion</strong>. Remember that Gmail Ads are meant to complement Search or Shopping campaigns. Your conversion metrics will also look very different if you’re targeting a warm audience, like previous website visitors, vs. a cold audience, like an affinity segment. With those caveats in mind, if your campaign has been running for at least four weeks and you have no conversions, you can try changing your bid strategy, optimizing for a micro-conversion that occurs earlier in the customer journey, or testing different audiences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, if people don&#8217;t engage, they can&#8217;t click. And if they don&#8217;t click, they definitely can&#8217;t convert. The key takeaway here is to focus on <strong>engagement first</strong>, then focus on <strong>clicks</strong>, and then, if you&#8217;re trying to get conversions, focus on your <strong>conversion metrics</strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seasonality might be best associated with the major holiday events at the end of the year: Black Friday, Cyber Monday, etc., and while that time of the year can have a major impact on many businesses, focusing only on events that are large can leave you under-strategizing around other “seasonal” trends throughout the year.</p>
<p>Whether it’s an obvious change in behavior based on the time of year, like those end of year holidays, the changing of the seasons themselves, or a trend that repeats itself in your industry each year, there are quite a few strategies you can employ to make the most of those seasonal changes. Here are 10 strategies to lean into (or out of) seasonal trends within your accounts.</p>

<h2>10 seasonal PPC strategies for any business</h2>
<p>Whatever the occasion for your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/performance-max-holiday-strategies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seasonal PPC ads</a>, these 10 tips can help set you up for success.</p>
<div id="use-historical-data"></div>
<h3>1. Use historical data to forecast future fluctuations</h3>
<p>History might repeat itself, or it might rhyme, but either way, regular trends are something you should be aware of and ready for.</p>
<p>The first step in optimizing your accounts for these trends is to know when they’re coming and to know with enough heads up that you can actually do something about it.</p>
<p>Here are some places you can go to get insights on how these seasonal trends are impacting your campaigns and start to understand what each portion of the year holds for your accounts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ad platforms:</strong> Every self-serve ad platform includes some form of visualization. Leverage a long lookback window and review performance trends for high/low conversion rates, increased/decreased costs, and any other anomalous performance. Note the time of year they occur and for how long, then see if there’s a repeating pattern.</li>
<li><strong>GA4:</strong> Review overall site trends for your company, not just your campaigns. Are there performance spikes or dips that happen regularly? Do you see common trends in year over year data?</li>
<li><strong>Internal teams:</strong> Depending on your business model, the best insights around seasonality might come from your sales teams or another team within your company. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/20/google-ads-for-lead-generation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">B2B lead gen</a>, for example, usually has some component of personal selling that happens, and I’ll pretty much guarantee that if there’s a salesperson at your company who’s been there for more than a year, they’ll know the different trends that occur within the year and why.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’re able to pinpoint when these fluctuations are happening (and ideally why they’re happening), review the performance of your individual keywords, ad sets, and campaigns during that time to see if there are standouts or duds. Just because the account saw a big slowdown or spike doesn’t mean it was uniform across the account. Use those insights to inform your campaign strategy for the next time that the seasonality effect comes around.</p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW232331268 BCX0"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW232331268 BCX0"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4c6.png" alt="📆" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Need ideas for seasonal PPC campaigns?</span></span></strong> Download our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/marketing-calendar?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2025MarketingCalendar_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free marketing calendar template</a> filled with ideas, tips, and more for every month of the year!</p>
<div id="expand-targeting"></div>
<h3>2. Revisit and expand targeting to accommodate trends</h3>
<p>We’re mostly talking about how buyer behavior changes during these seasonal periods, but don’t forget to think about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-audience-targeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who your audience is</a> or how their shopping behavior might be changing.</p>
<p>For search campaigns, revisit your keywords. <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-revisits-15-unseen-queries-statistic-in-context-of-ai-search/543160/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15%</a> of queries are new every day and have never been seen before. That trend doesn’t go away during seasonal shifts. If anything, there may be outside factors influencing your audience to search differently than they have before.</p>
<p>Use tools like the Google Keyword Planner, Google Trends, and regularly review your search terms report to find new keywords to add to your account to capture any shifting behaviors.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-google-trends.webp" alt="seasonal ppc - google trends" width="713" height="397" class="aligncenter wp-image-93602 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-google-trends.webp 713w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-google-trends-480x267.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 713px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In some cases, you might even need to reach an entirely different audience than your regular clientele. If you’ve ever lived in a college town, you know the summers and winter break are drastically different from the school year. With many students going home over those time periods, it makes sense for bars and restaurants to take a more family-friendly stance than they might when students are in session and they’re only interested in what the drink specials are.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to think outside the box with your targeting and challenge your usual assumptions.</p>
<div id="customize-ad-copy"></div>
<h3>3. Customize ad copy</h3>
<p>This is probably the most obvious adjustment for seasonal campaigns and the one you normally think of when it comes to promotional times.</p>
<p>The most common way I see advertisers incorporate these messages is to adjust their existing ads’ headlines and descriptions to include the new messaging. While that strategy is totally acceptable and fine, I’d caution against that. Each time you adjust your ad, the data will get muddied and make it hard to tell how things are doing over time.</p>
<p>Instead, I’d suggest you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-run-google-ads">create an entirely new ad unit</a> that contains the seasonal messaging. This could run alongside your existing creative, or you could pause them. That’s up to you, just know Google might not serve your new creative if it doesn&#8217;t feel confident in how it will perform.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to make entirely new ads, there’s a good middle ground that I’m a pretty big fan of as well.</p>
<p>Use headline and description ad assets when you can’t or don’t want to update your existing RSAs. These will rotate individual headlines and descriptions into your existing RSAs. These can be scheduled to run during only your promotional period and then turn off when it’s over. Just remember that these will honor any pinning strategies you have in place.</p>

<div id="seasonal-assets"></div>
<h3>4. Don’t sleep on seasonal assets</h3>
<p>Speaking of assets, there are a few <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-assets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ad assets</a> you can utilize to highlight your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/seasonal-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seasonal messaging</a>.</p>
<p>Promotion assets are extremely customizable for just about any seasonal messaging you want to use.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-assets.png" alt="seasonal google ads promotion assets" width="294" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93605 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-assets.png 294w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-assets-147x300.png 147w" sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px" /></p>
<p>To start, you can select what your occasion is from quite a large list of options. From there, you can customize language, currency, the type of promotion you’re running, and then there’s space for info about the item, a final URL, and then you can customize the details of your promotion. It’s pretty obvious how these can be useful for promotional periods.</p>
<p>But while promotion assets were designed for this purpose, they’re not the only ones you can use to infuse seasonality into your accounts.</p>
<p>Callouts are standalone snippets of text, so you can easily add a handful with seasonal tilts in them to get into rotation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-callouts.webp" alt="seasonal google ads callouts" width="376" height="528" class="aligncenter wp-image-93601 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-callouts.webp 376w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-callouts-214x300.webp 214w" sizes="(max-width: 376px) 100vw, 376px" /></p>
<p>Structured snippets are similar. You can easily add a new variant or two with a new set of seasonal messaging that can rotate with your evergreen variants.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-structured-snippets.webp" alt="seasonal ppc - structured snippets" width="341" height="470" class="aligncenter wp-image-93600 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-structured-snippets.webp 341w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-structured-snippets-218x300.webp 218w" sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px" /></p>
<p>Sitelinks can also be customized to reflect your seasonal messaging, but they’ll take a little more effort than callouts and structured snippets. For sitelinks, you’ll need seasonal messaging, but you also need a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/08/landing-page-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unique landing page</a> that isn’t used in other sitelinks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-sitelink.webp" alt="seasonal ppc - sitelinks" width="353" height="419" class="aligncenter wp-image-93599 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-sitelink.webp 353w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-sitelink-253x300.webp 253w" sizes="(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px" /></p>
<p>Lastly, price assets can operate pretty similarly to promotion assets, and you can easily use the header and description fields to help incorporate your seasonal messaging.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-price-assets.webp" alt="seasonal ppc - price asset screenshot" width="354" height="544" class="aligncenter wp-image-93598 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-price-assets.webp 354w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-price-assets-195x300.webp 195w" sizes="(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px" /></p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW232331268 BCX0"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW232331268 BCX0"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Could your Google Ads account benefit from optimized seasonal ads?</span></span></strong> Find out with our free<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Google Ads Grader</a>!</p>
<div id="landing-pages"></div>
<h3>5. Make sure your landing pages are ready</h3>
<p>With all this ad customization you’re doing, it’s important to make sure those messages are reflected on the landing page. It’s easy to get excited about all the bells and whistles of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/03/ad-copy-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ad copy</a>, but if your landing pages aren&#8217;t delivering on those awesome messages, you’re likely to lose your customers when they feel like you’re not delivering on the promise of your ads.</p>
<p>If your seasonal shift sees an increase in traffic, it’s a good time to make sure your landing pages load quickly and that your site is able to handle the influx of traffic.</p>
<p>A great tool to help troubleshoot any speed deficiencies on your site is Google’s <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Page Speed Insights</a>. With this tool, you can find out which pages on your site are slow for mobile or desktop, then address specific problem areas to speed them up.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-page-speed-insights.webp" alt="seasonal ppc - google ads page speed insights" width="699" height="501" class="aligncenter wp-image-93593 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-page-speed-insights.webp 699w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-page-speed-insights-480x344.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 699px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="budget-alignment"></div>
<h3>6. Align your budget with your goals</h3>
<p>If the seasonal trend you’re about to experience is one where business slows, you might not need to adjust your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/14/google-ads-budgeting-strategies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads budget</a>. For example, over the holidays, my B2B accounts usually slow down quite a bit, but <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/06/small-marketing-budget" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we don’t lower the budget</a> for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>First, we’re likely not going to spend the entire budget anyway, so there’s no real risk of leaving it. Second, the people who DO convert during that time are usually pretty motivated. If you’re researching new software for your company in the week between Christmas and New Year&#8217;s, you’re likely up against some sort of annual renewal and need to make a move quickly.</p>
<p>But for other accounts where volume scales up, sometimes by multiple folds, not increasing your budget could mean that you miss out on incremental traffic and maybe not take full advantage of your promotional period.</p>
<p>Google Ads daily budgets do take into account the performance trends and will spend over your daily budget on strong days. But if your promotional period is multiple days, you’re likely going to be spending too hot and since the algorithm is going to try and balance out to a monthly average, you’ll almost certainly miss out.</p>

<div id="seasonal-adjustments"></div>
<h3>7. Use seasonality adjustments</h3>
<p>If you’re using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-smart-bidding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smart Bidding</a> and your seasonality is a short burst of large performance swings, like a 25% or more increase or decrease in conversion rate, you can use a feature from Google called a Seasonal Adjustment.</p>
<p>You can learn more about <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9352512?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seasonality adjustments</a> here, but effectively, they let you tell Google to expect performance that will be very different from your “normal” performance. That way, it doesn’t over- or underreact to performance changes during your short seasonality impact. Overall, these are intended to be used sparingly, but can have a very large impact on your performance.</p>
<div id="remarket-strategically"></div>
<h3>8. Remarket strategically</h3>
<p>Remarketing lists are a solid staple in regular campaigns, but when your seasonal promotions come around, they can be a great way to reach back into a valuable group of users.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of remarketing lists that could be great to leverage during promotional periods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cart abandoners during recent sales</li>
<li>Users who purchased during last year’s sales</li>
<li>Users who signed up to be notified when a sale occurred</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/11/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsletter signups</a></li>
</ul>
<div id="schedule-ads"></div>
<h3>9. Schedule your ads ahead of time</h3>
<p>One of the biggest stress factors during promotional periods is making sure the right ads are active in the right places at the right time.</p>
<p>Many platforms will let you schedule your ads ahead of time to turn on when your sale starts and turn off when your sale ends.</p>
<p>My advice to you: trust but verify.</p>
<p>Leverage these tools to turn things on and off for you, but still spot check. You’ll alleviate the stress of needing to be present when ads need to change over, but you will still have peace of mind once you check in.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-schedule.webp" alt="seasonal ppc - ad and campaign scheduling action in google ads" width="672" height="458" class="aligncenter wp-image-93594 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-schedule.webp 672w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-schedule-480x327.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 672px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="real-time-optimization"></div>
<h3>10. Maintain and optimize your seasonal PPC ads in real time</h3>
<p>One last point for seasonal campaigns is to always maintain and optimize your ads during these times. Don’t put these as a “set it and forget it” strategy. During peak hours, things move fast. Just like other times of the year, it’s important to keep a close eye on how your campaigns are performing, especially if the window is short, i.e., a weekend-long sale. We might not like working on the weekend, but if you turn your promos on Friday evening, then don’t check again until Monday, you could miss out on important intraday trends that you could have capitalized on.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean you have to be tied to your computer the whole time during these periods either. Platforms like Google Ads have tools that can alert you when performance changes by large swings. In the image above, Google will review the ROAS performance of the ads every hour and send an email if the ROAS is below 100%.</p>
<p>Tools like this can give you peace of mind to go about your day but let you know when you need to log in and handle business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google Ads has been rolling out changes that nudge advertisers toward using more and more automation. If the idea of letting Google handle every aspect of your campaigns once made you nervous, you’re not alone—but with AI getting smarter and Google fine-tuning its tools, most businesses now use at least some automation in their accounts.</p>
<p>One big piece of that puzzle is automated bidding. Automated bidding simplifies your bidding strategy for you based on your budget and goals.</p>
<p>But just because it’s “automated” doesn’t mean it’s simple. There are different automated bidding strategies, each with its own pros and cons. So, should you use automated bidding? And if you do, which strategy makes the most sense for your business?</p>
<p>That’s exactly what we’re going to cover here. We’ll break down manual, automated, and Smart Bidding in Google Ads—plus when to use each—so you can make the most of your ad budget.</p>

<h2>What is automated bidding?</h2>
<p>When you set up a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-run-google-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads campaign</a>, you have to tell Google how much you’re willing to pay for your ad to be shown. This is called your bid, and there are two different ways to set your bids: manual or automated.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistakes" data-cke-saved-href="/blog/ws/2014/10/30/switch-automatic-bidding-to-manual">manual bidding</a>, you tell Google the maximum amount you’re willing to pay per click on your ad (CPC), and you can make adjustments to that bid based on your ad’s performance as determined by the metrics available in your reports.</p>
<p>With automated bidding, Google uses <a href="/blog/ws/2018/10/01/google-ads-automated-rules" data-cke-saved-href="/blog/ws/2018/10/01/google-ads-automated-rules">automated rules</a> to adjust your bids for you, based on the ad’s likelihood of getting a click or conversion. Automated bidding may use additional data points that aren’t available in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/07/ppc-reporting" data-cke-saved-href="/blog/ws/2021/09/07/ppc-reporting">reporting metrics.</a></p>
<p>There are eight types of automated bidding options in Google Ads:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enhanced cost per click (ECPC)</li>
<li>Maximize Clicks</li>
<li>Maximize Conversions</li>
<li>Maximize Conversion Value</li>
<li>Target Cost Per Action ( tCPA)</li>
<li>Target Return on Ad Spend (tROAS)</li>
<li>Viewable CPM (vCPM)</li>
<li>Cost Per View (CPV)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Automated bidding vs. Smart Bidding: What&#8217;s the difference?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-smart-bidding" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7065882#zippy=%2Cautomated-bidding-signals">Smart Bidding</a> and automated bidding often get used interchangeably, but they’re not the same thing. Smart Bidding refers only to Google’s automated bidding strategies that use “auction-time bidding,” meaning it will optimize for conversion or conversion value in each and every auction. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximize Conversions</li>
<li>Maximize Conversion value</li>
<li>Target CPA</li>
<li>Target ROAS</li>
</ul>
<p>So while all Smart Bidding strategies are automated, not all automated bidding strategies are Smart Bidding strategies.</p>

<div id="types-of-automated-bidding"></div>
<h2>Every automated bidding strategy in Google Ads</h2>
<p>Here are all your automated bidding strategy options and their pros and cons.</p>
<div id="maximize-conversions"></div>
<h3>1. Maximize Conversions</h3>
<p>Maximize Conversions is a fully automated bidding strategy, meaning there are no individual keyword bids set by advertisers that Google factors in. It simply chooses a CPC bid based on the goal of the bidding strategy.</p>
<p>The Maximum Conversions bid strategy is designed to get as many conversions as possible while spending your daily budget. Max Conversions also gives you the option to add a target CPA to help guide its bidding.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-ads-automated-bidding-maximize-conversions.jpg" alt="Maximize Conversions" width="1246" height="240" /></div>
<p>Although this bid strategy is relatively straightforward, it warrants an abundance of caution. Here are some tips to keep in mind and precautions to take.</p>
<h4>Each campaign needs its own daily budget</h4>
<p>It’s important that each campaign using Maximize Conversions has its own daily budget assigned, as opposed to being part of a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-shared-budgets">shared budget</a>, as this strategy will always try to spend the full daily allotted budget per campaign. If included in a shared budget, Maximize Conversions will spend the daily budget of the entire shared group, not just its own allotment.</p>
<h4>You need conversion tracking in place</h4>
<p>Do not run this strategy without having conversion tracking in place. Google’s goal is to maximize the number of conversions being tracked, so if no tracking is enabled, the algorithm is more likely to make bad decisions to find a person willing to convert.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36587 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-conversion-tracking.png" alt="google ads conversion tracking setup" width="720" height="233" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-conversion-tracking.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-conversion-tracking-480x155.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Keep an eye on CPC</h4>
<p>Remember, Google’s algorithm is going to bid whatever it needs to bid to get you the most conversions possible. You may see your spend or average CPC creep up as Google is bidding more aggressively to meet your conversion goals.</p>
<p>However, while Max Conversions has a history of potentially spending more aggressively, the increased <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization-marketing">conversion rate</a> balances you back out. Your spend or average CPC may be higher, but you’ll have more conversions coming in—resulting in an overall lower CPA and higher ROI. Plus, with the new option to add a target cost per action (CPA), these risks can be kept in control.</p>
<p>In short, if your goal is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/performance-max-lead-generation">get more leads for cheaper</a>, Max Conversions might just work for you. However, if you’re tight on budget, try a target CPA with Max Conversions or go for another strategy instead!</p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW31673628 BCX0"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW31673628 BCX0"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4b8.png" alt="💸" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span></span>Are you wasting any spend in Google Ads? </strong>Find out instantly with the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Free Google Ads</a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader"> </a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Grader</a>.</p>
<div id="maximize-clicks"></div>
<h3>2. Maximize Clicks</h3>
<p>This strategy is very similar to Maximize Conversions but instead focuses on clicks. With Maximize Clicks, Google will work to get as many clicks as possible while spending your daily budget.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-ads-automated-bidding-maximize-clicks.jpg" alt="Maximize Clicks" width="1248" height="372" /></p>
<p>This strategy can be great if you’re trying to drive more volume to your site for <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/14/use-branding-to-improve-advertising" data-cke-saved-href="/blog/ws/2020/09/14/use-branding-to-improve-advertising">branding</a> and list building, or if you have very strong <a href="/blog/ws/2019/08/19/conversion-rate-benchmarks" data-cke-saved-href="/blog/ws/2019/08/19/conversion-rate-benchmarks">conversion performance</a> and want to find more volume.</p>
<p>Here are some other tips to keep in mind.</p>
<h4>Set a max CPC</h4>
<p>Always set a max CPC and keep an eye on your average max CPC as well. Google will work to get as many clicks as possible for your campaign, but as with Maximize Conversions, it will also work hard to spend your entire daily budget each day, even if clicks are far more expensive than normal.</p>
<h4>Regularly check on CPC performance</h4>
<p>Regularly check in on the CPC performance this bid strategy is generating (and any other goal metrics you have in place) to ensure it’s still meeting your goals. If not, then adjust your settings or potentially look to a new bid strategy.</p>
<div id="maximize-conversion-value"></div>
<h3>3. Maximize Conversion Value</h3>
<p>Max Conversion Value is the older sibling of the Max Conversions strategy because it’s slightly more advanced.</p>
<p>While the two strategies are fundamentally the same, Max Conversion Value looks to bring in conversions that will give you the highest return.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36586 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies-pros-cons-maximize-conversion-value.png" alt="google ads automated bidding strategies pros and cons: maximize conversion value setup" width="720" height="154" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies-pros-cons-maximize-conversion-value.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies-pros-cons-maximize-conversion-value-480x103.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In other words, it doesn’t necessarily look at how<em> many </em>conversions it’s bringing in, but the<em> value</em> within each conversion. It’s a strategy that looks at quality over quantity.</p>
<p>Similar to how Max Conversions allows you to set a Target CPA, Max Conversion Value gives you the option to set a Target ROAS to help guide its bidding.</p>
<p>There are two points of caution for this bidding strategy.</p>
<h4>Track conversions</h4>
<p>Just like with Max Conversions, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/24/google-ads-conversion-tracking" data-cke-saved-href="/blog/ws/2021/05/24/google-ads-conversion-tracking">properly setting up conversion tracking</a> is vital to the success of this strategy.</p>
<h4>Assign values</h4>
<p>Be sure <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/10/how-to-determine-conversion-value">each action is assigned a value</a>, or else the algorithm will be confused.</p>
<p>After all, a conversion worth $1000 to your business deserves a higher bid than one worth only $5. If your tracking is not properly set for value-based bidding, this won’t work.</p>
<div id="target-cpa"></div>
<h3>4. Target CPA (tCPA)</h3>
<p>Target CPA stands for target cost per action (or conversion). It used to be a separate bidding strategy but is now only available as an option within the Max Conversions strategy (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/google-retiring-tcpa-troas" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/google-retiring-tcpa-troas">learn more here</a>).</p>
<p>With tCPA, you set a target cost per action (conversion) and then Google adjusts bids to generate as many conversions as possible at that CPA.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36585 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-target-cpa.png" alt="google ads automated bidding strategies: target CPA setup" width="600" height="227" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-target-cpa.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-target-cpa-480x182.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Advertisers are able to set bid minimums and maximums to ensure Google doesn’t adjust bids through the floor or ceiling, but only for <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6263072" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portfolio-</a>level</span> use. If you’re targeting for individual campaigns, these bid caps aren’t available.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36584 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/gogle-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-target-cpa-options.png" alt="google ads automated bidding strategies: target CPA min and max setup" width="500" height="600" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/gogle-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-target-cpa-options.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/gogle-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-target-cpa-options-480x576.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There are three things to note about tCPA bidding.</p>
<h4>Set up conversion tracking</h4>
<p>Like Max Conversions and Max Conversion Value, Target CPA bidding requires conversion tracking enabled in your account. Without it, this bidding strategy is useless—it will never know if it’s driving conversions or not.</p>
<p>But that’s not all. Just because you have conversion tracking turned on doesn’t mean you’re off to the races just yet.</p>
<h4>Provide minimum conversion data</h4>
<p>To drive conversion performance, Google needs to have a certain amount of conversion data to be able to make smart decisions. If you don’t have enough conversion volume, then the algorithm can’t make smart decisions, and tCPA isn’t the right bidding option for you.</p>
<p>At the campaign level, Google says the minimum is 15 conversions in the last 30 days, but we’ve found this to be on the low side. Ideally, you should have at least 30 conversions, if not 50, in the past 30 days before testing tCPA bidding.</p>
<p>If your campaigns don’t reach this level individually, they might at a portfolio level. If they still don’t, tCPA likely shouldn’t be on your list of eligible bid strategies.</p>
<h4>Set a realistic target</h4>
<p>Lastly, when getting started with tCPA, it’s important to set realistic initial goals. If your campaign has had an average CPA of $40 over the past six months, it’s not in your best interest to set a target CPA of $20, as it will limit Google right away in the auctions it can enter in and learn.</p>
<p>If you’re planning to use tCPA bidding, plan on the first two weeks to a month being a learning phase. Set your target CPA slightly higher than what your average CPA has been recently, or use the Google-suggested CPA target to let Google find a groove, then slowly bring it down over time to your target CPA.</p>
<div id="target-roas"></div>
<h3>5. Target ROAS (tROAS)</h3>
<p>Target ROAS is nearly the same as Target CPA, but with return on ad spend (ROAS) instead. And just as tCPA has been reorganized under Max Conversions, tROAS has been reorganized under Max Conversion Value (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/google-retiring-tcpa-troas" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/google-retiring-tcpa-troas">learn more here</a>).</p>
<p>With this strategy, Google Ads will predict future conversion and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/25/conversion-value" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/25/conversion-value">conversion value</a> performance based on your historical data to enter auctions, and then adjust bids in real time to maximize conversion value while trying to achieve the target ROAS goal you’ve set at the ad group, campaign, or portfolio level.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36583 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-target-ROAS.png" alt="google ads automated bidding: target roas setup" width="720" height="261" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-target-ROAS.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-target-ROAS-480x174.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As with tCPA, individual conversions may have higher or lower ROAS than your goal, and Google will work to balance those out over time to achieve your ROAS target.</p>
<p>With tROAS, advertisers can set bid limits (minimums and maximums) at the campaign or portfolio level to help keep the Google algorithm from straying too far, but Google cautions against this as it can limit the machine&#8217;s decision-making.</p>
<p>All the same cautions for tCPA apply to tROAS.</p>
<h4>Set up accurate conversion tracking</h4>
<p>Ensure you have accurate conversion tracking in place including conversion values and that you have enough conversion performance in the recent past to leverage this strategy.</p>
<h4>Don&#8217;t set your target ROAS too high</h4>
<p>Also, be careful not set your target ROAS at a restrictively high level right off the bat. Start off with a goal slightly lower than what your performance has been recently, then slowly raise the target over time to achieve a more profitable ROAS.</p>
<div id="target-impression-share"></div>
<h3>6. Target Impression Share</h3>
<p>With Target Impression Share, advertisers set a goal impression share percentage in the same way you would set a target CPA for that bidding strategy.<br />
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-ads-automated-bidding-target-impression-share.jpg" alt="Target Impression Share" width="1072" height="558" /><br />
There are three placement options you have to bid for with Target Impression Share:</p>
<ul>
<li>Absolute Top of Page</li>
<li>Top of Page</li>
<li>Anywhere on the Page</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these will tell the Google algorithm different things about your preferences, and it will adjust bids accordingly.</p>
<p>Advertisers are also able to set a max CPC bid with Target Impression Share bidding to help guard against overspend, but Google cautions against setting it too low and throttling performance.</p>
<p>Like any other bidding strategy, this one has the potential to increase your bids beyond the profitability level if you’re not careful. This strategy is focused on awareness and reach (though it can be used for performance), but there are still limits to what makes sense monetarily for your campaigns.</p>
<h4>Keep an eye on CPC</h4>
<p>Always set a max CPC bid to ensure you don’t pay too much for any individual click. Although Google cautions against it, don’t worry about setting this bid too low to start. Try setting it at a percentage increase over your current bid of 20%-50%. If that works well, then leave that cap. If you’re not seeing the volume you’d like, increase the max CPC.</p>
<h4>Have realistic expectations</h4>
<p>Very few auctions will actually see 100% coverage anymore. So although you set a target to 100%, don’t be surprised or frustrated if you show up closer to 95% as a top achievable number.</p>
<p>Always keep an eye on CPCs and performance outcomes to ensure this bidding strategy is achieving your goals before continuing with this strategy.</p>
<div id="viewable-cpm"></div>
<h3>7. Viewable CPM</h3>
<p>Viewable CPM (vCPM) refers to cost per thousand viewable impressions. According to <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6026409?hl=en" data-cke-saved-href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6026409?hl=en">Google</a><em>, </em>an ad is counted as viewable when 50% of your ad shows on screen for one second or longer for Display ads, and two seconds or longer for video ads.</p>
<p>This is a Display-only bid strategy designed to let advertisers bid for impressions when your ad is shown in a viewable space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36582 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies-viewable-cpm.png" alt="google ads automated bidding strategies pros and cons: viewable CPM setup" width="600" height="153" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies-viewable-cpm.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies-viewable-cpm-480x122.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>vCPM bidding is great if you’re working on expanding your brand coverage and simply want to get your message in front of a large group of people.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things to watch out for with vCPM bidding: frequency and placements.</p>
<h4>Be mindful of frequency</h4>
<p>With this strategy, Google will look to maximize the number of viewable impressions your ad receives. When using this strategy with a finite audience, your chances of hitting a high frequency count for each user go up.</p>
<p>We’ve all had the ads that seem to stalk us as we peruse the internet, so be sure that although you’re trying to maximize ad views, you’re not doing it at the expense of a small audience who now feel overwhelmed by your brand.</p>
<h4>Keep an eye on placements</h4>
<p>Additionally, not all viewable impressions are created equal. Just like any other display campaign, it’s important to keep an eye on your placements report to ensure you’re not showing up on unwanted sites.</p>
<div id="cost-per-view"></div>
<h3>8. Cost Per View (CPV)</h3>
<p>Bidding on individual views is only available for video ads. With Cost Per View, you set a campaign-level bid limit that implies the maximum you’re willing to pay for each view or interaction with your video (whichever comes first).</p>
<p>In this case, you’d only be charged for a view if someone watched your video for more than 30 seconds (or the entire video if it’s shorter than 30 seconds). Otherwise, if the viewer instead clicks on a link the video shares or takes part in other calls to action (app download, etc.), you will be charged for that interaction.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36581 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-cpv-automated-bidding-strategy.png" alt="google ads automated bidding strategies: cost per view setup" width="600" height="349" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-cpv-automated-bidding-strategy.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-cpv-automated-bidding-strategy-480x279.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The nice thing about CPV bidding is it also allows you to “bid up” when you show alongside popular YouTube videos that may be more likely to bring you in a return.</p>
<h4>Set up the right targeting</h4>
<p>Beware if you have loose targeting on your video campaigns! If you’re bringing in TONS of views at a cheaper cost, it most likely won’t make sense for you to use CPV.</p>
<h4>Only spend when it counts</h4>
<p>Since you’re bidding on individual views, you only want to spend when it really counts. So if you have looser targeting this will be tougher to gauge. Additionally, video views and average costs per view tend to be relatively cheap.</p>
<p>This makes CPV a great strategy for a hyper-focused video campaign in a highly competitive space, but not the best for those just starting out in video ads.</p>
<div id="manual"></div>
<h3>A note on Manual Cost Per Click (CPC)</h3>
<p>Although Manual CPC is not an automated bidding strategy, it&#8217;s still worth mentioning in our bid strategy roundup as it&#8217;s the easiest bid strategy to grasp on the Google Ads platform. Advertisers set their bids manually at the keyword level, and the bids stay where they are until the advertiser changes them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36589 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-manual-cpc.png" alt="pros and cons of every automated bidding strategy in google ads: manual cpc setup" width="720" height="207" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-manual-cpc.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-manual-cpc-480x138.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Despite the friendly warning from Google, this is the best place to start for folks starting out in PPC or using their spare time to manage their account but has its drawbacks.</p>
<p>Despite the friendly warning from Google, this is a recommended place to start for folks starting out in PPC or using their spare time to manage their account.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistakes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manual bidding</a> has two drawbacks:</p>
<h4>It takes a lot of time</h4>
<p>When it comes down to it, manual bidding requires a time investment to look at performance, judge if the keyword bid needs to change, decide what that change needs to be, and then actually make that change.</p>
<h4>You could be underinformed</h4>
<p>When we review our <a href="/blog/ws/2011/05/10/common-ppc-metrics" data-cke-saved-href="/blog/ws/2011/05/10/common-ppc-metrics">performance metrics</a>, we’re at the whim of the metrics Google allows us to see for our campaigns. With automated bidding strategies, Google is able to take data points into account that we don’t even know exist.</p>
<p>These two downsides don’t mean all automation is good and that manual bidding isn’t the right solution for you. But they are something to consider when determining bid strategies.</p>
<div id="set-up-automated-bidding"></div>
<h2>How to set your automated bidding strategy</h2>
<p>Once you determine which automated bidding strategy is right for you, how do you select it?</p>
<p>It’s important to note that when you’re setting up your campaign, <strong>Google will automatically choose an automated bidding strategy for you based on your goals. </strong></p>
<p><strong>You do not have to use this strategy!</strong></p>
<p>You can choose any other automated bidding strategy, or instead choose to bid manually.</p>
<p>Simply select the blue text at the bottom where it says “Select a bid strategy directly (not recommended)”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36590 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-default.png" alt="bid strategy setup in google ads" width="600" height="270" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-default.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-default-480x216.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Alright, so now that you know the basics of Google Ads bidding, let’s go through every option you have for bidding.</p>
<div id="choosing-a-strategy"></div>
<h2>Which automated bidding strategy should you choose?</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve covered all the automated bidding strategies, it’s time to choose the one that’s right for your whole account, right?</p>
<p>Wrong!</p>
<p>The best thing about automated bidding and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/17/google-ads-bid-management">bid management</a>: we can pick and choose what we use where.</p>
<p>Google Ads allows for automated bidding strategies to be set at either the ad group, campaign, or portfolio level, depending on the strategy you choose. This means you can direct different aspects of your account to rely on different bid strategies depending on their goals.</p>
<p>When choosing a bid strategy, evaluate at the campaign level to determine if the strategy will help accomplish your goal and if you have enough data to make it work (e.g., enough conversion volume to make Target CPA effective). If not, you might benefit from another bid strategy, a portfolio-level strategy, or even an adjustment in account structure to better leverage it later on.</p>
<h2>Set it and <em>don’t</em> forget it</h2>
<p>Automated bid strategies in Google Ads are a fantastic way to save time while leveraging algorithms to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/offset-lower-website-traffic">optimize your account</a>, but only when evaluated and chosen wisely.</p>
<p>And even though automated bidding strategies require less maintenance than manual bidding, there’s no such thing as “set it and forget it.” Once these strategies are leveraged in your account, set reminders to check in on them to ensure they’re still accomplishing the goals they set out to hit. Happy automating!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve been paying attention to the Google Ads landscape over the past couple of months, you’ve likely heard of the release of AI Max for Search. I’ve heard from many advertisers that they’re worried that Google is messing with Search campaigns, but I think those worries are a bit premature.</p>
<p>In this article, I want to talk about what AI Max for Search is (and some of what it isn’t) and talk about when it might make sense to test in your account.</p>

<h2>What is AI Max for Search?</h2>
<p>First, let’s get something out of the way: AI Max is NOT a replacement for Search campaigns.</p>
<p>So, let’s talk about what AI Max <em>is</em> and how it will work.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-marketing-live-2025#:~:text=3.-,AI%20Max%20for%20Search%20campaigns,-AI%20Max%20for">AI Max</a> is a new set of optional features you can enable with your Search campaigns in Google Ads to help with targeting and creative assets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-for-search-campaigns.webp" alt="ai max for search campaigns" width="755" height="565" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93380" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-for-search-campaigns.webp 755w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-for-search-campaigns-480x359.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 755px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="ai-max-for-search-new-features"></div>
<h3>New features for AI Max</h3>
<p>Here’s a quick rundown of the new features available within AI Max:</p>
<h4>Search term matching</h4>
<p>This is a new form of keywordless targeting that combines a few different features. It uses Broad match (i.e., the Broad match campaign setting) plus keywordless matching that uses signals from keywords, assets, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">landing pages</a>.</p>
<p>From what I can tell, when it comes to keyword prioritization, AI Max will fall in line with the existing hierarchy in one of two ways.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-search-term-matching.webp" alt="ai max search term matching" width="684" height="687" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93381" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-search-term-matching.webp 684w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-search-term-matching-480x482.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 684px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If your ad is triggered for a search term based on the Broad match setting, that will fall into the level of the list alongside Phrase match and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/11/search-themes-for-performance-max-campaigns">Search themes</a> for PMax. If your ad is triggered with the keywordless matching option, i.e., the search term was determined by your keywords, assets, or landing pages, then it will fall into the last row where only Ad Rank serves to determine prioritization.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-for-search-campaigns-example-e1753987829552.webp" alt="ai max for search keywordless targeting" width="884" height="507" class="aligncenter wp-image-93386 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-for-search-campaigns-example-e1753987829552.webp 884w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-for-search-campaigns-example-e1753987829552-480x270.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 884px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Worried you&#8217;re wasting spend in Google Ads?</strong> Find out with a free, instant audit &gt;&gt; <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Google Ads Performance Grader</a></p>
<h4>Updates to reporting</h4>
<p>Since AI Max gets to choose search queries, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-google-ads-keywords">keywords</a>, landing pages, and assets for you, each of those reports will now have a portion that shows when AI Max selected them. Within search terms, you will also be able to see if the query was selected based on Broad match expansion or keywordless matching.</p>
<div id="ai-max-for-search-existing-features"></div>
<h3>Not-so-new features in AI Max</h3>
<p>There are some features in the AI Max for Search announcements that are effectively just carryovers from what’s usable in regular Search or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/10/dynamic-search-ads">Dynamic Search Ads</a> (DSA) campaigns currently.</p>
<h4>Brand settings</h4>
<p>With AI Max for Search, you’ll still be able to utilize Brand Inclusion and Exclusion lists just as you do with regular Search campaigns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-brand-settings.webp" alt="ai max for search brand settings" width="782" height="422" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93382" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-brand-settings.webp 782w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-brand-settings-480x259.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 782px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>URL rules</h4>
<p>Just like with Dynamic Search Ads campaigns, you’ll be able to control which URLs your ads are eligible to use with inclusions and exclusions. Advertisers will also be able to utilize Page Feeds, as well, if that’s a simpler option than having two separate inclusion-exclusion lists.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-url-rules.webp" alt="ai max for search brand rules" width="720" height="140" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93383" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-url-rules.webp 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-url-rules-480x93.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Text customization</h4>
<p>This feature is new to Search, but exists in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/23/optimize-performance-max-campaigns">Performance Max campaigns</a>. With Text Customization, Google will use text from your existing ads, landing pages, and assets along with generative AI to create a customized ad copy that’s relevant to your user&#8217;s query.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6e0.png" alt="🛠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Get the tools and tips you need to build the perfect landing page in our free guide &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLiQContentDLHowToMakeGreatLandingPages.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_LandingPages_HowToMakeGreatLandingPagesGuide_Download">How to Make Great Landing Pages (with Crazy-High Conversion)</a></p>
<h4>Final URL expansion</h4>
<p>Also, available in PMax campaigns, Final URL Expansion lets Google choose a more specific page from your site as the landing page for your ad if it believes it’s more relevant than the landing page you selected. This requires Text Customization to be turned on.</p>
<h4>Locations of interest</h4>
<p>These controls will be able to be adjusted at the ad group level to include people based on either their location, Presence or their Presence or Interest in a given location. The key difference here is the control at the ad group level rather than the campaign level as with existing Search campaigns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-locations-or-interest.png" alt="ai max for search locations or interest" width="602" height="93" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93390" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-locations-or-interest.png 602w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-locations-or-interest-480x74.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 602px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Many other features, like negative keywords and location exclusions, will still apply to your AI Max campaigns just like they do for regular Search.</p>
<div id="ai-max-for-search-note"></div>
<h3>A note about AI Max options</h3>
<p>One thing I want to stress about AI Max in its current form is its optionality. There are LOTS of features within this new set that you can pick and choose à la carte to apply or not apply as you wish. Each of the options listed below are features that can be opted into or out of based on your preferences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keywordless Targeting</li>
<li>Text Customization</li>
<li>Final URL Expansion (must have Text Customization enabled to use this)</li>
<li>Location of Interest</li>
<li>AI Max: You can toggle this on or off at your discretion</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> You still have lots of control, even when ceding some control to Google.</p>

<h2>Requirements for AI Max</h2>
<p>There are just a couple of requirements for you to use AI Max.</p>
<p>First, your campaign type must (obviously) be a Search campaign. If you want to use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/04/google-ads-ai">Google’s AI features</a> with other campaign types, there are plenty of others to choose from.</p>

<p>Second, you must be using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-smart-bidding">Smart Bidding strategies</a> focused on conversions. This means Max Conversions or Max Conversion Value are eligible, as well as their augmented styles of tCPA and tROAS, respectively. No other bid strategies are supported at this time.</p>

<h2>When not to use AI Max</h2>
<p>While some of these features are really just a different packaging for options that are already available in Google Ads, there are some scenarios where I wouldn’t recommend using AI Max for Search.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Poor website:</strong> Just like with DSA campaigns, if your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/no-website-traffic">website isn’t a strong representation of your company</a>, AI Max for Search might not be a great idea if you leave the Text Customization and Final URL expansion on.</li>
<li><strong>Regulation-heavy industry:</strong> Just like with other automated features in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-run-google-ads">Google Ads</a>, if you need to have strict messaging in ads based on regulatory compliance, AI Max might not be a great option.</li>
<li><strong>Low conversion volume:</strong> Although Google touts its Smart Bidding as being able to generate results without much history, I’ve personally never found success with that. I’d always suggest following the 30/30 rule, meaning at least 30 conversions in the last 30 days, with 50 conversions in the last 30 days being an even better threshold to meet.</li>
<li><strong>Lead quality considerations:</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-generation-ideas">Lead generation</a> is always a tough route with Google Ads automation. The platform is really good at getting leads, but <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-quality">generating quality leads</a> can be a challenge. If you have high thresholds to hit for quality, AI Max could still be an okay option, but will likely need to take a backseat to classic Search. Speaking of…</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to try AI Max for Search</h2>
<p>For now, I’m thinking of AI Max for Search as a combination of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/performance-max">Performance Max</a> and Dynamic Search Ads. The biggest common factor in those campaigns: they’re here to drive incremental volume outside of my reach with my existing Search campaigns.</p>
<p>What does all this mean for me? I’m still going to build out a robust, old-school Search strategy that leverages Exact match terms just like I have for the last 15 years and manage it as usual. Given the prioritization schedule above, Exact match still outranks everything else, and since that’s where I’ll have the most control, that’s where I’m going to start.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I’ll leverage AI Max as an expansion tool, just like I would for DSA. If anything, AI Max, in my mind, just translates to a slightly more AI-centered Dynamic Search Ads strategy. It functions relatively the same, but just has a few more bells and whistles.</p>
<p>TL;DR: If you’re a fan of classic Search paired with Dynamic Search Ads for extra reach, then AI Max for Search might be your new favorite tool.</p>
<div id="how-to-get-started-with-ai-max"></div>
<h2>How to get started with AI Max for Search</h2>
<p>AI Max for Search started its rollout as of early 2025 but is going to take until Q3 of 2025 to be fully available to all accounts. If you want to test this campaign type, you’ll have to wait for it to hit your account.</p>
<p>Once the feature is available for you, there will be an option to use Google Ads Campaign Experiments to test AI Max for Search before jumping in full force. It’s not clear at this time exactly what the logistics of that setup will be, but there will be some functionality around it.</p>
<h2>Is AI Max for Search right for you right now?</h2>
<p>Google is continuing to roll out new features powered by AI to help advertisers find their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/target-audience-examples">target audience</a>. If you’re a classic marketer like me, this might be a nice addition to what you already have running. If you’re new to marketing and Search in general, this might be an easy option for you to get things started and see results.</p>
<p>Just like all other new features, I don’t think AI Max is for everyone, and it certainly can be a slippery slope for advertisers who aren’t sure what they’re doing, but it also could be a great option for folks who have maxed out traditional search and need to see incremental results.</p>
