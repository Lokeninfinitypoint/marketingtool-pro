<h2>Real estate marketing ideas for your website</h2>
<p>A website is not a real estate marketing <em>idea</em>, but a <em>must</em>. Consumers expect businesses to have websites today, and a bad website can be worse than no website at all. Here are some ideas to get your website marketing your real estate business around the clock.</p>
<h3>1. Have an impressive homepage</h3>
<p>Did you know that <a href="https://www.kinesisinc.com/the-truth-about-web-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">75%</a> of people admit to judging the credibility of a business based on its website design? First impressions matter, which is why your homepage should be in top shape. This means vibrant images, a prominent call to action, and an intuitive menu.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/real-estate-marketing-ideas-homepage-1.png" alt="real estate marketing ideas - impressive homepage example" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58781" width="720" height="431" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/real-estate-marketing-ideas-homepage-1.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/real-estate-marketing-ideas-homepage-1-480x287.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>2. Create awesome listings</h3>
<p>Today’s consumers like to do a lot of legwork themselves online when making major purchases, and that includes home buying as well. I myself have only rented, but even then, when scouting around, I’ll Google Map the address, use Street View to get a feel for the area, see which businesses are within walking distance, look at home photos, and, ideally take a virtual tour of the property.</p>
<p>Your property pages and <a href="https://localiq.com/products/listings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listings</a> should make it easy for users to access all this information—with detailed descriptions, great photos, virtual tours, and easy access to Google Maps and Google Earth. List the hot spots nearby and their respective walking distances (mention the bus stop that’s just a five-minute walk, or the Starbucks at the end of the block).<a href="https://localiq.com/localiq-grader?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b><i></i></b></a></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4e3.png" alt="📣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong>Want to keep the free leads flowing?</strong> Download <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/free-leads?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_howtogetfreeleads_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links">14 Fast &amp; Easy Ways to Get Free Leads (+Examples You Can Copy)</a></p>
<h3>3. Hire a photographer</h3>
<p>It’s absolutely vital that you have gorgeous photos of your properties. The right time of day or angle can make all the difference. Hire a professional photographer (preferably with experience photographing homes and architecture), or, if you have sophisticated equipment and are confident in your abilities, have your own hand at it. Just remember this is one of those scenarios when it pays to bring in the professionals.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/real-estate-marketing-ideas-homepage-photo.png" alt="real estate marketing ideas - vibrant homepage image" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58729" width="550" height="421" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/real-estate-marketing-ideas-homepage-photo.png 550w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/real-estate-marketing-ideas-homepage-photo-480x367.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 550px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>4. Create lead magnets</h3>
<p>The key to generating leads is to offer something to your audience that is worth giving up their contact information for. Consider producing a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/15/lead-magnet-ideas">lead magnet</a> guide like “X Common Mistakes New Homeowners Make&#8221; or &#8220;X Features to Look For In a New Home.&#8221; things new homeowners should consider before buying” or “X most valuable features of a new home.” Offering free ebooks in exchange for an email address (and zip code, in the case of real estate) is a great way to capture high-quality leads.</p>
<h3>5. Focus on user experience</h3>
<p>All the great property pages in the world won’t mean much if your site is a nightmare to navigate. Your visitors need to have a good experience on your website, so take the time to brush up on user experience design skills and information architecture.</p>
<h3>6. Do your SEO</h3>
<p>A great-looking website does nothing for you if no one can find it! SEO is a set of practices that work together to get your site to rank high in search engines. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On-page SEO:</strong> Including the keywords you&#8217;re targeting for each page in that page&#8217;s title, meta data, image file names and alt text, and naturally in the body text.</li>
<li><strong>Off-page SEO:</strong> Getting other sites with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/12/domain-authority">high domain authority</a> to link to yours. Our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/28/technical-seo">SEO audit checklist</a> will help with this and your on-page SEO.</li>

<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/real-estate-marketing-ideas-shareable-listings.png" alt="real estate marketing ideas - shareable listing example" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58711" width="603" height="414" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/real-estate-marketing-ideas-shareable-listings.png 603w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/real-estate-marketing-ideas-shareable-listings-480x330.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 603px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>11. Run social ads</h3>
<p>Regular Facebook marketing is great for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/21/build-client-relationships">building client relationships</a>, but if you&#8217;re looking to land new clients, you won&#8217;t get far. But while it has the weakest organic reach of all platforms, its targeting capabilities for paid ads is unmatched. If you want to target single thirty-somethings who work from home and own a pet, you can do that. If you want to target LGBTQ couples looking to buy a condo, you can do that too. Use our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/06/05/instagram-ads-for-real-estate">real estate Instagram ad examples</a> and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/real-estate-facebook-ads-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real estate Facebook ad examples </a>like the one below to inspire you.</p>

<h3>12. Pinterest boards</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/09/pinterest-video-ads">Pinterest advertising</a> and marketing still have their place for some industries—real estate being one of them. Boards are a great way to provide images and information for specific listings. You can create a Pinterest board for a single property that, in addition, to property photos, highlights features and benefits of the area.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pinterest-marketing-realestate.png" alt="pinterest real estate marketing" width="703" height="316" /></div>
<p><a id="local"></a></p>
<h2>Local real estate marketing ideas</h2>
<p>Your website and social media profiles are two of the three basic pillars of your real estate marketing strategy. The third one is with listings and local marketing.

<h3>13. Local sponsorships</h3>
<p>Consider helping sponsor local festivals, sports teams, or school events as an <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/offline-marketing-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offline marketing</a> tactic. Signing up as a local sponsor often means getting your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/08/business-name-ideas">business name</a> a spot on t-shirts, program pamphlets, or flyers.</p>
<h3>14. Local content on your website</h3>
<p>In many ways, you’re not just selling a house, you’re selling a whole town or area. Showcase the best that your area has to offer, with high-quality, beautiful photos of local town landmarks and familiar sites.</p>
<p>Also, make sure you are including some local-oriented keywords in your copy to ensure that your content is found by buyers Googling online for homes in your area.</p>

<h3>15. Build your Google Business Profile</h3>

<h3>16. Become a columnist in local magazines</h3>
<p>See if you can write a column or feature for local publications. You don’t want to be blatantly salesy. Today’s consumers don’t like to be pitched to. Instead, share advice and perspectives that add value. Write about how rising prices of houses on the market show that the town is doing well, or list the reasons why your regional area is becoming more popular (maybe it’s the revitalized downtown area or improved school system).</p>
<h3>17. Host free seminars for home buyers</h3>
<p>Make yourself and your knowledge available to the community by hosting mini-seminars. Consider providing a basic 101 seminar about the basics of home buying and mortgages.</p>
<p>Remember, marketing today is all about inbound, and that doesn’t just apply online. Users want you to share some of your knowledge for free before investing time and money in you. A home buying seminar is the local equivalent of a webinar. Yes, it will take time and energy, but attendees will walk away impressed and will have established a relationship with you. That relationship will be worth its weight in gold when they’re ready to shop for a home.</p>
<h3>18. Partner with local businesses</h3>
<p>Developing relationships with other local businesses will be key for your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/06/05/instagram-ads-for-real-estate">real estate marketing</a> efforts. See if you can get local breakfast joints to let you buy them a set of new coffee mugs with your logo on them, or buy a place on their paper placemat setting. Or partner up with local moving companies to swap referrals.<br />

<h2>Real estate email marketing ideas</h2>
<p>Email marketing has long been one of the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/18/best-marketing-strategies"> best marketing strategies</a> for any industry and for any stage of the funnel. Here are some real estate marketing ideas using email.</p>
<h3>19. Create a newsletter</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/05/increase-email-signups">Collect email signups</a> via your website and events and send out a helpful newsletter with new listings, upcoming seminars you&#8217;re offering, local events, tips, and more. Be sure to segment your lists out by different communities so you can provide super-relevant content.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/real-estate-marketing-ideas-newsletter-popup.png" alt="real estate marketing ideas - email newsletter signup" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58714" width="500" height="444" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/real-estate-marketing-ideas-newsletter-popup.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/real-estate-marketing-ideas-newsletter-popup-480x426.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>It also helps to have a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/11/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups">creative newsletter signup CTA</a>.</em></p>
<h3>20. Start an email nurture campaign</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/26/lead-nurturing-campaign-emails/">Nurture campaigns</a> are like the breadcrumb paths of Hansel and Gretel, except instead of a gingerbread house at the end, clients find their dream home (hopefully without a resident evil witch).</p>
<p>Leave your clients a trail of high-end panko breadcrumbs by tailoring your interactions with them based on previous actions they’ve taken. If they first attended an open house with you, send them an email detailing other nearby houses on the market. If they attended your first-time homebuyer’s seminar, send them your “10 Things Every New Homebuyer Should Know “ ebook. Deliver content that will help your clients take the appropriate next step, depending on where they are in their journey.</p>
<h3>21. Send out greeting emails</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s a simple but smart <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/01/email-marketing-tips">email marketing tip</a>: send out personalized emails during the holidays or even on your clients&#8217; birthdays or anniversaries. A simple gesture can go a long way, and happy clients will be eager to refer you to others in need of your services. Just don&#8217;t go with a generic email! Use these posts for inspiration:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/04/valentines-day-messages-clients">Valentine&#8217;s Day Messages for Your Clients (With Email Templates!)</a></li>

<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/23/how-brand-your-business">Business branding</a> is your buddy – that means pens, drink koozies, and all those other freebies people love. Give out some branded goodies at local festivals and events to spread your brand.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/real-estate-marketing-ideas-branded-swag.jpeg" alt="real estate marketing ideas branded swag" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58787" width="600" height="336" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/real-estate-marketing-ideas-branded-swag.jpeg 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/real-estate-marketing-ideas-branded-swag-480x269.jpeg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>23. Use call tracking</h3>
<p>Real estate is one of those industries that absolutely must use call tracking in their paid search campaigns. Most people use the phone when trying to find a realtor or make an appointment to view an apartment, condo, or house. If those calls come about because someone saw your PPC ad, you want to be able to track which ads and keywords are driving calls.</p>
<h3>24. Create a killer business card</h3>
<p>Get an awesome-looking business card and hand them out like pizza flyers on a Friday night. And don&#8217;t forget your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/01/21/email-signature-examples-and-trends/"> email signature</a>!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/real-estate-marketing-ideas-business-card-templates.png" alt="real estate marketing ideas - business card templates" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58784" width="720" height="454" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/real-estate-marketing-ideas-business-card-templates.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/real-estate-marketing-ideas-business-card-templates-480x303.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Canva has tons of <a href="https://www.canva.com/search/templates?q=real%20estate%20business%20cards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free real estate business card templates</a> to choose from.</em></p>
<h3>25. Old-school mailers</h3>
<p>The web is where it’s at, but that’s not to say traditional advertising doesn’t have its place, especially when you have targeted audiences. Consider sending out postcards to qualified leads or potential buyers in the specific zip codes you are active in.</p>
<h3>26. Give a local care package after closing</h3>
<p>Your relationship with a client doesn’t end right after they close. You want them to remember your name so that hopefully they’ll share your info with friends, family, and acquaintances who might consider moving in the future. Send a local care package to clients after they close, with local movie or theater tickets, restaurant gift cards, etc.<br />

<h2>Unique real estate marketing ideas</h2>
<p>Last but not least, some ideas that will get you thinking outside the box.</p>
<h3>27. Be playful</h3>
<p>Some industries (like pets and babies) get to have all the fun, right? Not necessarily! In fact, being playful with your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/07/facebook-ad-copy-examples">Facebook ad copy</a> and other materials can help you to stand out.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/real-estate-marketing-ideas-facebook-ad-example-brady.png" alt="real estate marketing ideas - facebook ad example" class="aligncenter wp-image-58705" width="389" height="481" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/real-estate-marketing-ideas-facebook-ad-example-brady.png 450w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/real-estate-marketing-ideas-facebook-ad-example-brady-242x300.png 242w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></p>
<h3>28. Animated video</h3>
<p>Consider outsourcing a quality animated video for your real estate businesses. Short, cute, high-quality cartoon videos can help establish your brand as well as give a touch of personality. You may even want to consider featuring local landmarks or sites in your animated video to make it ultra-unique and targeted.</p>

<h3>29. Market with emotion</h3>
<p>Emotions drive behaviors. And no, you don&#8217;t need to create a tear-jerker video (Subaru? MSPCA + Arms of the Angels?) to elicit them in marketing. Something simple like &#8220;Imagine living your dream every day&#8221; can do the trick.</p>

<h3>30. Get seasonal</h3>
<p>Aside from federal and religious holidays, every month of the year has its own set of social awareness themes and national days that inspire tons of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/12/marketing-ideas">creative marketing ideas</a>.</p>

<h2>More real estate marketing ideas</h2>
<p>Here are more creative and practical ideas to help your real estate business grow.</p>
<h3>31. Get on Zillow</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.zillow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zillow</a> is basically the Yelp of real estate marketing, and you really need to be on there if you want any chance of being discovered &#8211; you can ignore the sun, but it will still burn you! Zillow offers the ability to advertise as an agent on their website. This can get a bit pricey, but considering the huge role Zillow plays in home buying, it’s probably your best bet. After all, sites like Zillow account for 48% of all site traffic for real estate searches on the web.</p>
<p>Zillow also allows users to review real estate agents, so put on a smile and rack up that rating, as a solid star rating will greatly increase your leads.<br />

<h3>32. Ask for testimonials from former clients</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/05/customer-testimonials/">Testimonials</a> are tremendous trust signals. Showing that real, live people endorse your services means the world to potential clients. When a homebuyer has had a great experience with you, reach out to them and ask for a testimonial. If possible, try to get a photo of them as well. Make the most of these testimonials by placing them strategically on your website and sharing them now and then on social networks.</p>
<h3>33. Host a webinar</h3>
<p>If you feel comfortable enough, hosting a webinar can be a great way to garner attention for your business. Host a “12 Little-Known Things to Look For In A New Home” webinar, providing a Q&amp;A at the end for questions. Webinars can also be repurposed as YouTube videos (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/16/real-estate-video-marketing">more real estate video marketing ideas here</a>), with can serve as valuable video content that can live permanently on your website!

<h3>34. Keep an eye out on the competition</h3>
<p>What are other realtors in your area doing? What do their websites look like? How active are they on social media? Take note of what competitors are doing – then avoid their mistakes and replicate their success!</p>

<h3>35. Offer virtual tours</h3>
<p>Your client&#8217;s time is precious, and they want to understand as much as possible about a property prior to visiting in person. Virtual tours are a great way to give a comprehensive, accurate preview of the property for potential buyers.</p>
<p>Most platforms, like Zillow, offer easy ways to create virtual tours.</p>

<h3>36. Shared scheduling apps</h3>
<p>Use a scheduling sharing app to coordinate times to show a house to buyers. Scheduling apps like Doodle can cut down on the endless back and forth timeslot swapping.</p>
<h3>37. Look at benchmarks</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re advertising on search or social and your conversion rates are better than last week. That&#8217;s great, but is it a good conversion rate overall? Or let&#8217;s say that you want to start advertising on search but aren&#8217;t sure <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/21/how-much-does-adwords-cost">how much Google Ads will cost</a>. The best way to make sure you&#8217;re not over or underperforming with your ads is to look at benchmarks.</p>

<h3>38. Keep in touch</h3>
<p>Stay in touch (even months and years later) with past buyers in order to build in that good relationship. Send anniversary cards, holiday cards, etc to stay fresh in their minds. When they have a friend who is ready to buy, they’ll pass along your info.</p>
<h3>39. Create a referral system</h3>
<p>Provide incentives for past clients to refer you to future homebuyers.</p>
<h3>40. Consider going niche</h3>
<p>If you’ve got some real estate marketing competition in your area, you may want to consider making yourself stand out with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/28/niche-marketing">niche marketing</a>. Become the go-to real estate agent for dog owners, families with kids, divorced individuals, whatever. Making a name for yourself in regards to a specific niche need can make you memorable, especially in saturated zip codes.</p>

<h2>How to market a restaurant</h2>
<p>There is no one &#8220;best way&#8221; to market a restaurant, as it all depends on your category, audience, location, and more, but these are the foundational steps any food-friendly establishment should take:</p>
<h3>1. Develop your restaurant’s brand identity</h3>
<p>Your brand identity is more than just your brand colors. It represents your business&#8217;s personality, the tone of your content, the emotions you want to inspire in your customers. &#8220;Happy&#8221; is not enough. Think about the most popular restaurants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taco Bell: humor and wit</li>
<li>Cheesecake Factory: indulgence and extravagance</li>
<li>Panera: health and freshness</li>
<li>Olive Garden: family and comfort</li>
</ul>
<p>So first and foremost, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/09/18/beginners-guide-to-target-markets">understand your target audience</a>, then further segment that audience into <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/23/buyer-personas">individual buyer personas</a> with interests and lifestyles you cater to. Establish a theme and feel that works well with all your personas, and then consistently express that in every piece of content you create and every action you take.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-market-a-restaurant-brand-identity-examples.jpg" alt="how to market a restaurant - brand identity examples" width="720" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58238" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-market-a-restaurant-brand-identity-examples.jpg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/how-to-market-a-restaurant-brand-identity-examples-480x313.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>2. Get a website</h3>
<p>This is non-negotiable. At the bare minimum, you need a homepage, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/27/guide-to-about-us-pages">about us</a>, menu, and contact page. But ideally, you&#8217;ll want a reviews page, photo gallery, blog, and even a FAQ page. We&#8217;ll talk more about optimizing your site later, but the important thing to note here is that your website is the go-to for current and potential diners, and it needs to be professional—first impressions matter!

<h3>3. Establish your mission statement</h3>
<p>This goes along with your brand identity, and should be a documented statement expressing the purpose of your business. Is it to make healthy food more affordable? Is it to encourage family bonding? Promote sustainability? Your mission statement should state what you provide, where/to whom, why you do it, and how. You can gain inspiration from these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/02/how-to-write-a-business-mission-statement">mission statement examples</a>.</p>

<h3>4. Set up your socials</h3>
<p>Next on the list for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/17/increase-online-presence">building your online presence</a> is your social profiles. The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">most popular social media platforms</a> for restaurants are Facebook and Instagram, but TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, and even LinkedIn have their place for many brands. You can use our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">complete guide to social media marketing </a>to get your profiles and strategy going.</p>
<h3>5. Get listed on restaurant apps</h3>
<p>Dining and restaurant apps are among the best free restaurant marketing tools, as getting found on one of these means getting found by people with high intent. Dining apps allow users to filter very specifically, so the key to these is adding as many details as possible, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Category (There are far more than the eight in the <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/most-popular-type-of-restaurant-in-every-state-map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thrillist chart above</a>.)</li>
<li>Website</li>
<li>Address and phone</li>
<li>Store hours</li>
<li>Menu</li>
<li>Price Range</li>
<li>Photos, and lots of ‘em</li>

<p>As for which apps to get listed on, these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yelp (check our <a href="/blog/ws/2013/07/22/yelp-reviews">Complete Guide to Yelp</a>)</li>
<li>Zomato (formerly Urbanspoon)</li>

<li>Zagat</li>
<li>TripAdvisor</li>

<h3>6. Set up your Google Business Profile</h3>
<p>Setting up your restaurant’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/08/what-is-google-my-business">Google Business Profile</a> is as important as (heck, maybe even more important than) your Yelp account. This listing allows you to appear in Google Maps, local search results, and the right-side Knowledge Panel in regular search results.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/restaurant-marketing-ideas-google-business-profile-example.png" alt="restaurantm arketing ideas googlel business profile example" width="720" height="575" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58203" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/restaurant-marketing-ideas-google-business-profile-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/restaurant-marketing-ideas-google-business-profile-example-480x383.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /><br />
But setting up your profile isn&#8217;t enough. You need to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/03/google-my-business-optimization">optimize your Google Business Profile</a> if you want it to appear in the Local 3-pack, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/02/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps">rank higher on Google Maps</a>, and actually attract customers from your <a href="https://localiq.com/products/listings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listing</a>. You can see that a Google listing contains a wealth of information including</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact information</li>
<li>Questions and answers (you can populate these yourself!)</li>
<li>Popular times</li>
<li>Google reviews (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/16/get-more-google-reviews">How to get more Google reviews here</a>)</li>
<li>Reviews from elsewhere on the web</li>
<li>Photos</li>
<li>Category</li>
<li>From the business (not shown in above image)</li>
<li>Posts (also not shown) (<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-my-business-posts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guide to Google posting here</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>It also means keeping this information accurate and up-to-date. Eaters love to do research online – in fact, <a href="http://www.grabstats.com/statcategorymain.aspx?StatCatID=23">89% of consumers research a restaurant</a> online prior to dining. This is why it’s of <strong>vital importance that all your</strong> <strong>restaurant details are online and up to date, </strong>including address, phone number, hours, your current menu, etc. The stronger and more accurate your online details are, the better.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2b50.png" alt="⭐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Get all the tips you need to collect more reviews in this free guide download &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/how-to-get-more-reviews?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_howtogetreviews_Download&amp;itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links">How to Get More Reviews: 8 Tips to Boost Ranking, Reputation, &amp; Revenue</a></p>
<h3>7. Have a sleek, functional online menu</h3>
<p><strong>Don’t make users scramble to find your menu or squint to see it. </strong>Provide a high-quality, easy-to-read menu that is up to date and accurate. Not sure how? Some delivery sites like those mentioned below offer to publish your menu online for free. <a href="http://openmenu.com/">Open Menu</a> is another great site that can help you get your menu looking sleek and stylish (it even offers some handy social integration, for both paid and free users).<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/restaurant-marketing-sleek-menu-example.jpeg" alt="restaurant marketing ideas - attractive menu example" width="500" height="607" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58198" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/restaurant-marketing-sleek-menu-example.jpeg 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/restaurant-marketing-sleek-menu-example-480x583.jpeg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /><br />
Still, you’ll want to make sure to have your menu published on your website, since that’s often the #1 piece of information users are looking for when visiting your site (along with hours, location, and contact info).</p>
<p>If you don’t have a good menu online and available for customers, most of your other restaurant marketing strategies are basically useless! In this day and age <strong>customers <em>need </em>to have access to an online menu</strong>, otherwise they’ll simply look elsewhere. And speaking of restaurant marketing strategies&#8230;</p>
<div id="restaurant-marketing-strategies"></div>
<h2>Restaurant marketing strategies</h2>
<p>Now that you have your basic foundation established, it&#8217;s time to get into the specific strategies that will help you to attract customers to your restaurant and keep them coming back.</p>
<h3>1. Ask for reviews</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/online-review-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">power of online reviews</a> is undeniable, and customers are almost always happy to leave them. But the thing is, they still need a little prompting. This means that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">asking for reviews</a> should be a part of your restaurant marketing strategy.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have an artistic and framed sign near the mints with an easy-to-remember link or QR code.</li>
<li>Include a request and link on your website, menus, coupons, punch cards, and receipts.</li>
<li>Ask for them in person</li>
<li>Occasionally ask in social posts</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/restaurant-marketing-strategies-ask-for-reviews.png" alt="how to market a restaurant - twitter post asking for review" width="400" height="566" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58241" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/restaurant-marketing-strategies-ask-for-reviews.png 400w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/restaurant-marketing-strategies-ask-for-reviews-212x300.png 212w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<h3>2. Respond to reviews</h3>
<p>Whether and how you respond to your customers&#8217; reviews shapes the public&#8217;s perception of your restaurant.  Here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Respond to positive reviews to show that you value your customers&#8217; input and to encourage more of them.</li>
<li>Thank customers for their reviews, positive and negative.</li>
<li>Respond to negative reviews promptly, publicly, politely, and professionally, then offer to take the resolution offline.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve seen this work in favor of many businesses, as reviewers are often flattered at the consideration shown and are more generous in their critique knowing the restaurant owner values their opinion and is working hard to improve.</p>
<h3>3. Send out an email newsletter</h3>
<p>Your restaurant&#8217;s newsletter can include new menu items, upcoming events, coupons, customer stories, and more. And it doesn&#8217;t have to be weekly. In fact, users will probably appreciate a less flooded inbox if you simply send them a newsletter every month or so. Some quick tips:</p>

<h3>4. Turn your Facebook business page into a community</h3>
<p>Businesses with a<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-increase-social-media-presence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> strong social media presence</a> are the ones that fare the best, and in the competitive food industry, ignoring social media is a death sentence. We already mentioned creating a Facebook page above, but not about leveraging its power to market your restaurant. Here&#8217;s how to do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Treat your page like a listing: Facebook is a business directory! Fill out all fields, encourage reviews, and keep it updated.</li>
<li>Post regularly: customer photos, upcoming events, special offers, hours updates, etc.</li>
<li>Engage with your followers: Inspire discussions, respond to comments, follow them back.</li>
<li>Change out your cover photos seasonally.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<h3>5. Loyalty programs</h3>
<p>Partnering with online apps encourages visitors to check out your restaurant through gamification and <a href="/blog/ws/2016/11/10/customer-loyalty">customer loyalty programs</a>, which offer visitors a free purchase or discount for visiting a certain number of times.</p>
<p>Popular foodie apps that offer integrated loyalty programs include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bellycard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Belly</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thelevelup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LevelUp</a><a href="http://www.loyalblocks.com/"></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.perka.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perka</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You could also kick it old school and hand out punch cards. They aren’t quite as cool as apps, but they still show that you value customers and appreciate their loyalty.</p>
<h3>6. Local SEO</h3>
<p>While Google can infer your location based on your online information, and a searcher&#8217;s location based on their IP address, that doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;ll rank in local results for every relevant search. In other words, you need to do your<a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> local SEO:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Get listed on the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/best-free-business-listing-sites/">top local listing sites</a> (we&#8217;ve touched on this already).</li>
<li>Embed a Google Map of your location in your Contact Us page.</li>
<li>Publish content specific to your location regularly.</li>
<li>Get online reviews (the number one <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/09/google-ranking-factors">ranking factor</a> in local SEO)</li>
<li>Make sure your information is as identical as possible across all your online assets. Google doesn&#8217;t like inconsistencies!</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Invest in paid ads</h3>
<p>Running paid ads on platforms like Google and Facebook will get your restaurant in front of large volumes of qualified eyes. For help incorporating paid media into your restaurant marketing plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/07/google-ads-geotargeting">location targeting</a> to ensure only users in certain cities or within a specific radius see your ads (eliminating non-relevant clicks, which can cost you big ad bucks).</li>
<li>Follow these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/20/facebook-ads-for-restaurants">Facebook ad tips for restaurants</a> to get the most out of the platform.</li>
<li>Check out our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/04/optimize-google-local-advertising">guide to Google local advertising</a> to make sure you&#8217;re optimizing your account for the highest ROI.</li>
<li>Have a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/16/mobile-ppc-strategy">mobile PPC strategy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mobile ads tend to be cheaper than desktop ads, and <a href="/blog/ws/2014/10/16/mobile-ppc-strategy">mobile boasts impressive conversion rates.</a> What’s really cool is that Google Ads allows for all kinds of <a href="/blog/ws/2014/08/18/mobile-ad-strategies">mobile customization and targeting options</a> that let you get the most out of your bids. For example, you can increase your bids around dinnertime, when users are often looking for fast food on their mobile phones. Boosting your bids during the dinnertime period increases your chances for showing up for a specific query. This means you could be the first ad to show up for a “pizza” search when pie-hungry users are on the search for a slice. If you’re a restaurant marketer, don’t miss out on digging into a slice of the mobile ad pie (we’re talking deep dish).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/restaurant-marketing-strategies-paid-targeted-ad.png" alt="restaurant marketing strategies - location targeted ad example" width="720" height="354" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58243" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/restaurant-marketing-strategies-paid-targeted-ad.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/restaurant-marketing-strategies-paid-targeted-ad-480x236.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>8. Start a blog</h3>
<p>Starting your own blog is a great way to build community and engage with your customers. Blogs offer the chance to experiment with your restaurant’s voice and personality. Share your successes and struggles, funny stories, recipes, and anything else you think might interest your customers.</p>
<p>A blog can be a huge project, but it doesn’t <em>have</em> to be. <strong>Keep your blog as simple or complex as you’d like</strong>. You don’t have to be constantly posting (quality over quantity), but it’s good to have your restaurant blog set up for when you have an announcement or news you want to get out to the world. If you’re serious about taking over the world, check out more <a href="/blog/ws/2014/11/24/blogging-tips">blogging tips</a> here.</p>
<h3>9. Offline marketing strategies</h3>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget about the physical world in your restaurant marketing plan! These tactics are still effective, especially if you&#8217;re a local restaurant.</p>
<ul>
<li>Postcards</li>
<li>Menus</li>
<li>Care packages</li>
<li>Free samples</li>
<li>Local newspaper, radio, and TV</li>
</ul>

<h2>Restaurant marketing ideas</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s take these strategies one step further with some easy and creative <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/restaurant-marketing-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restaurant marketing ideas</a>.</p>
<h3>10. Foodie photos</h3>
<p>If you’ve ever logged onto<a href="/blog/ws/2017/07/06/instagram-marketing-for-restaurants"> Instagram</a>, you’ll understand that food porn is alive and well.</p>
<p>Arguably the very best way to promote your restaurant online is with high-quality, drool-inducing photos. Visual content is in high demand online these days, and having delicious-looking photos on your website and across various social media outlets is essential for drawing hungry eyes.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/restaurant-marketing-ideas-food-art.jpg" alt="restaurant marketing ideas - food photos" width="720" height="395" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58245" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/restaurant-marketing-ideas-food-art.jpg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/restaurant-marketing-ideas-food-art-480x263.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /><br />
Be warned though – taking really great food photos can be tougher than it looks, as lighting is often a key factor. Consider hiring a pro to take some top-notch photographs, or try it DIY style with your smartphone (you can use our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/26/product-photography">product photography tips!)</a>.</p>
<h3>11. Offer coupons &amp; discounts</h3>
<p>Providing coupons and discounts for your restaurant is always a surefire way to bring customers running. Offer a free dish to your new email newsletter subscribers (<a href="/blog/ws/2014/08/05/increase-email-signups">we can show you how to get more of those too</a>).</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can try advertising a discount through Groupon or Living Social – if you go that route, you’ll get a TONS of exposure, but you’ll end up paying a hefty portion of sales to the deal website, so keep that in mind.</p>
<h3>12. Share your reviews</h3>
<p>Not only does the quantity and quality of reviews impact how high you rank in results and whether customers click on your result, but also, the content of those reviews makes for excellent marketing material. Sync them to appear on your website, share them on social, and even incorporate reviews on specific dishes into your menu.</p>

<h3>13. Be an Insta-ham</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/06/instagram-marketing-for-restaurants">Instagram marketing for restaurants</a> is a no-brainer.</p>
<p>Show off your storefront, get up close with your top dishes, and use this social media main stage as a place to <strong>play around with your brand identity</strong>. For example, an all-natural health food store might try snapping pics of people kayaking, cooking, farming, or other activities you think your fan base will enjoy.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/restaurant-marketing-ideas-instagram-style.jpg" alt="restaurant marketing ideas - instagram feed" width="600" height="829" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58191" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/restaurant-marketing-ideas-instagram-style.jpg 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/restaurant-marketing-ideas-instagram-style-480x663.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Also be sure to <strong>have some fun with hashtags</strong> – whether jumping on the hype of existing popular <a href="/blog/ws/2015/07/02/twitter-hashtags">Twitter hashtags</a> like #ThrowbackThursday or inventing your own, hashtags are a great way to have some fun with fans.</p>
<p>Instagram is a no-brainer for those in the food business – learn even more about <a href="/blog/ws/2015/01/06/instagram-marketing">Instagram marketing here.</a></p>
<h3>14. Food blogger outreach</h3>
<p>When you’re a new restaurant, you may find it difficult to generate reviews and hype about your business. One great way to get reviews and press on the web is to invite food bloggers to your restaurant to give you a try, and consider offering a free meal or appetizer to get them in the door. Politely ask if they’d be willing to review your restaurant and share their experience online.</p>
<p>You can’t outright ask for a positive review, as that would be dishonest, but it’s fine to simply ask them for an objective restaurant review. Some bloggers might decline your offer, but the more you ask, the better your chances are of getting some positive feedback and generating more interest online.</p>
<p>Some food bloggers have big followings, and getting their attention can have a huge influence on your restaurant. Even just one write-up or mention from a major foodie can be huge for <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/restaurant-promotion-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restaurant promotion</a> efforts.</p>
<h3>15. Show off your staff</h3>
<p>In an age of robotic customer service reps and soon to be self-driving cars, the human element is severely lacking. Show off your 5-star staff doing what they do best! Seeing happy, smiling employees does wonders for your reputation, as customers long to be served by joyful workers.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/restaurant-marketing-ideas-show-your-staff.jpg" alt="retaurant marketing ideas - example of staff pic" width="600" height="515" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58193" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/restaurant-marketing-ideas-show-your-staff.jpg 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/restaurant-marketing-ideas-show-your-staff-480x412.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /><br />
Showing off your pleasant employees also provides major reputation points – happy workers say a lot about a business, and fans are sure to take notice.</p>
<h3>16. Share positive press</h3>
<p>Another major restaurant marketing tip – when you’re mentioned in a news outlet or magazine, be sure to <strong>show off your good publicity on your website and via social media</strong>. Fans will spread the word, and newcomers will be encouraged to visit in person when they see trusted sources celebrating your restaurant.</p>
<h3>17. Social media contests</h3>
<p>The key to Facebook and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/05/11/instagram-giveaways">Instagram giveaways</a> is to have an appealing prize. Don&#8217;t do a boring gift card, offer something specific like, free sides, an extra pizza, dinner for two, swag, free delivery for a month. and more. Have people enter by posting about and tagging your business and/or using your hashtag on Instagram. This is a great way to increase your followers and bring in your local audience (especially for a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/restaurant-grand-opening-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grand opening</a>).

<p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 22px;">18. Source local ingredients</span></p>

<h3>19. Partner up with delivery services</h3>
<p>In today’s online-driven environment, ease of use is the name of the game. Many online delivery services streamline the ordering process, and internet-savvy patrons often love taking advantage of such delivery services.</p>
<p>Consider partnering with services like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seamless</li>
<li>Eat24</li>
<li>Foodler</li>
<li>Delivery.com</li>
<li>GrubHub</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some customers may even discover you for the first time</strong> through services such as these!</p>
<h3>20. Trivia nights</h3>
<p>Weekly or monthly trivia nights are always a hit with restaurants. Offer great prizes to the winners, good in-between music, and promote it on social media and your newsletters to spread the word.</p>
<h3>21. Fishbowl business card giveaways</h3>
<p>Let customers drop their business cards into a bowl for a raffle. The reward can vary – a lunch for the winner and 10 friends, a 2-hour happy hour with discounted drinks, whatever you feel like!</p>
<p>Not only are these raffles fun, but you can also make use of those business cards by emailing customers. Let them know that while they didn’t win this time, they can sign up for your newsletter to be notified of their next chance to enter, plus the opportunity to hear about discounts and other offers they’d enjoy. Then tadaa – you’ve got yourself a bunch of super valuable new newsletter subscribers!</p>
<h3>22. Start a food truck</h3>
<p>Starting a food truck isn’t for the faint of heart – it’s a tremendous endeavor and, depending on the kind of truck you want to buy, it can be very pricey. However, starting a food truck enables you to dish out your food to folks you might never normally come in contact with. You can greatly extend your reach, build more press, and acquire new fans who might love you so much that they become patrons of your brick-and-mortar location as well!</p>

<h3>23. Get creative with national days</h3>
<p>There are dozens of awareness causes and observance days throughout each month of the year that are restaurant-friendly. Here are some, just to name a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>National Food Safety Month in September</li>
<li>National Pizza Day in February</li>
<li>International Beer Day in August</li>
<li>National Baked Scallops Day in March</li>
<li>National Picnic Day in April</li>
</ul>
<p>And <a href="http://scottroberts.org/complete-listing-of-national-food-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the list</a> goes on. And on. And on. We&#8217;re talking, National Corn Chip Day, National Glazed Spiral Ham Day, Chicken Tetrazzini Day. You can have a field day with these. Here are some local marketing ideas based on months of the year (with plenty more to come):</p>

<h2>Final restaurant marketing tips</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ll leave you with some final tips to help you save time, maintain a positive reputation, and make the most of every penny and minute you spend marketing your restaurant.</p>
<h3>24. Promote user-generated content</h3>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2014/04/28/user-generated-content">User-generated content</a> (lovingly dubbed UGC) is a great way to develop personal and intimate engagement with users. Host a photo contest by asking customers to share their favorite meal at your establishment, and share the entries on a dedicated content page (and/or share submissions across your various social networks). Consider awarding some random lucky contestants with a free appetizer or other prize!<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/restaurant-marketing-ideas-user-generated-content-barking-crab.jpg" alt="restaurant marketing ideas - user-generated content example" width="450" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58192" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/restaurant-marketing-ideas-user-generated-content-barking-crab.jpg 450w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/restaurant-marketing-ideas-user-generated-content-barking-crab-226x300.jpg 226w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p>Hosting and promoting user-generated content <strong>shows customers that you appreciate them</strong>, turning occasional visitors into die-hard devotees.</p>
<h3>25. Use online reservation tools</h3>
<p>One fine dining restaurant marketing idea is to consider signing up for <a href="http://www.opentable.com/start/home">Open Table</a>. Open Table is an online reservation tool that lets customers book reservations for your establishment online! Patrons love it when you make life a bit easier for them, and Open Table already has a base of loyal customers you can tap into.</p>
<h3>26. Time those Tweets</h3>
<p>Twitter can be a true treasure for restaurants, and timing your tweets can have a big influence on hungry stomachs. Try crafting and scheduling tweets at different times of the day to specifically target the breakfast, lunch, or dinner crowds (depending on your offerings).</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/restaurant-management-ideas.png" alt="restaurants twitter marketing" width="554" height="573" /></div>
<h3>27. Monitor your online reputation</h3>
<p>One of the most important things to know in restaurant marketing is that there are countless places online where customers can review and talk about you—even if you didn&#8217;t set up a listing on that platform!  As a part of your <a href="https://localiq.com/resources/guide/online-reputation-management-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reputation management</a>, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google yourself regularly to identify any auto-created listings that need to be claimed so you can control their information.</li>
<li>Set up <a href="https://www.google.com/alerts">Google Alerts</a> to notify you when your business name (or other designated keyword term) appears in a new piece of content on the web.</li>
<li>Invest in paid <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/17/best-free-social-media-management-tools">social media management tools</a> like Hootsuite or Buffer to stay on top of posts, mentions, and direct messages.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the best purchases I ever made was signing up for Spotify Premium in college. I even remember when it happened, in March 2014. I had just signed a job offer for after graduation and Spotify released premium pricing for students. It was beautifully serendipitous and we’ve been in a committed, monthly-fee relationship everx since. In fact, now I pay for a family plan and have gotten all my family members (and maybe some roommates) hooked on it.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20market20to20college20students20ians20pizza.png" alt="how to market to college students ian's pizza" width="800" height="593" /></div>
<p>Moral of the story: if you market to college students early, they can become your most loyal customers. Look at Apple! The shiny-fruit company consistently gives discounts to college students, creating lifelong Mac users.</p>
<p>If you’re not completely convinced that college students are a valuable market, here are some stats before we dive in…</p>
<h2>Why market to college students?</h2>
<p>College students are a huge demographic in the US, consisting mostly of 18 to 24-year-olds. These young adults have spending power: the <a href="https://www.business.com/articles/marketing-to-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>15M group spends more than $200B annually</u></a>. Not only are they age-stable, but they also are geographically stagnant for 4-5 years. That means you have a lot of time to develop branding and marketing specific to this group to see what will really stick.</p>
<p>While this is most likely already living in the back of your mind, Gen Z is the tech-native generation. They are constantly online (especially during quarantine), consuming content, shopping, and engaging with peers. And they’re cleverer than previous generations when it comes to advertising: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/11/generation-z-avoids-advertising-uses-ad-blockers-and-skips-content.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>almost 70% of Gen Zers use ad blockers</u></a>. But don’t despair; if you do get through to these college students, <a href="https://www.sheerid.com/blog/4-problems-with-edu-college-student-verification-and-how-to-fix-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>94% said an exclusive offer</u></a> would get them to shop at a brand more frequently. Here are our best tips for <a href="https://localiq.com/industries/education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reaching college students through the power of marketing</a>.</p>
<h2>10 effective ways to market to college students</h2>
<h3>1. Leverage trials and samples</h3>
<p>Let’s just address the elephant in the room outright: college kids love free stuff. I can’t tell you the number of events I attended in college because they offered free food. What better way to hook some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/18/loyalty-marketing">long-term loyal customers</a> than offering your product for free?</p>
<p>There are a few ways you can actually get your free samples or trials <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/22/free-marketing-during-covid-19">in front of your audience</a>; try coordinating with residence life to have a move-in kit available for the fall semester or sponsored study break during midterms or finals. If you’re a food service on Seamless, GrubHub, or DoorDash, you can offer a discount for first-time diners; once they get a taste, they’ll keep coming back for more.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20market20to20college20students20grubhub.png" alt="how to market to college students grubhub" width="800" height="417" /></div>
<h2>2. Offer targeted discounts</h2>
<p>Just like <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/23/personalized-video-marketing">personalized</a> ads, discounts specific to your audience are a great way to engage them. Everyone wants to think that their school is the best—what better way to reinforce that than advertising “For a limited time, Villanova students get free fries with every cheeseburger.”</p>
<p>If you want an easier, more direct way to get feet in the door (or online orders), offer discounts if a student provides their student ID at the time of purchase. You can often get those types of deals listed in a coupon catalog handed out in Student Unions or in Move-In Day packets. Free advertising for all!</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20market20to20college20students20mac.png" alt="how to market to college students mac" width="800" height="554" /></div>
<h2>3. Write clever copy</h2>
<p>Have you hung out with college kids recently? If you haven’t, you’re missing out. I truly learn new words every time I’m around the youths. Since college came into existence, kids have been creating their own lingo for academia and partying (and I’m really trying to make “groovy” come back into style).</p>
<p>While I wouldn’t recommend trying *too* hard to speak their language, catching students’ eyes with clever marketing and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/01/12/how-to-write-great-advertising-copy">ad copy </a>is a must. Whatever you do, don’t be lame. Not sure where to start? Here are some tips for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/15/copywriting-tips">writing creative copy</a> that may help.</p>
<h2>4. Mind your social accounts</h2>
<p>If you’ve run <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/30/social-media-advertising-tips">social ads</a> before, you probably already know that it is a great way to reach Millennials and Zillennials. When it comes to marketing to college students, make sure you’re leveraging those platforms; even if you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/01/marketing-ideas-for-small-businesses">don’t have the budget</a> to spend on ad campaigns.</p>
<p>There are easy ways to engage college students on social media.</p>
<ul>
<li>Leverage <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/28/user-generated-content">user-generated content</a>; encourage your customers to tag your products in their posts so you can easily re-post.</li>
<li>Spend time liking and commenting on related posts; this will help the algorithms show your account to more potential customers.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">Announce new products</a> or releases on your social accounts; if you’re a big, national brand, think about making an account specifically for the college crowd you’re serving, e.g. “VillanovaDominos” or “MaybellinePHL.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Try out traditional tactics</h2>
<p>Don’t worry about going old school when it comes to advertising. College kids are still pinning coupons to their fridge or digging them out when it’s time to order food. Think about sponsoring on-campus events, or having an on-campus pop-up shop in the middle of the main through-way to get the most out of student foot traffic.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20market20to20college20students20coupons.png" alt="how to market to college students coupons" width="800" height="389" /></div>
<p>I can’t tell you the number of coupons just like this that were stacked in my kitchen drawer in my college apartment. They came in handy when we didn’t want to go grocery shopping or cook, but still needed to stick to a college kid budget!</p>
<h2>6. Host a giveaway, raffle, or competition</h2>
<p>If you’re trying to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/30/social-media-engagement">build up your social following</a> or your email listserv, or simply get a lot of students engaged with your business, host a giveaway. You’ll need to make it tempting enough for college students to actually give away their information and/or money to win. That could be a Sonos speaker system to boost the music at parties, covering the cost of a parking pass on campus, offering a lifetime of free sides (french fries forever!), naming a product after them, the list goes on and on.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20market20to20college20students205k.png" alt="how to market to college students 5k" width="800" height="513" /></div>
<p>You can also pay into the competitive nature of college kids! Just like emphasizing exclusive discounts for colleges, if you have more than one university in your area, make a little friendly competition like this 5K did.</p>
<h2>7. Engage student ambassadors</h2>
<p>Pay attention to the students who are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/11/10/customer-loyalty">loyal patrons of your business</a>. Whether that means engaging with them in your store or restaurant or keeping track of recurring orders online, make sure you’re acknowledging their loyalty. Think of your student ambassadors as nano-influencers.</p>
<p>Make some ambassador kits, including simple pieces of swag like a t-shirt, bottle opener, water bottle, etc. and arm them with materials to give away to their peers. This can work best if they get referral discounts themselves!</p>
<p>While not college-student-specific, Aerie is great at leveraging user generated content on their social accounts. They are regularly #regram-ing content from their customers—which just makes it easier to fill your social calendar!</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20market20to20college20students20user20generated.png" alt="how to market to college students ambassadors" width="800" height="585" /></div>
<h2>8. Consider social causes</h2>
<p>I was in college during KONY 2012. What a movement. And let me tell you, everyone was talking about it. I mean professors, students, residential life, school administrators, food service employees, and more. It was the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/02/facebook-ads-boycott">social justice</a> cause of the year.</p>
<p>By nature, college students are bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to save the world. And this generation in particular is invested in social justice. Reflect on an issue that affects the community your business is in. Not only will it make the world a better place to have another contribution to the plastic-free or BLM fight, but students will also be more inclined to give your brand a second look if their money is also going to a cause they believe in.</p>
<h2>9. Look for college media sources</h2>
<p>Meet college students where they are and with what they’re consuming. Most likely, the students you’re targeting have a student-lead newspaper, weekly newsletters, or even a popular online student forum or app. Reach out to those publications to sponsor a post or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/23/google-display-ads">display ad</a>.</p>
<p>SImilar to reaching out to student ambassadors, look for student-run social media accounts to offer sponsored posts. Most schools will have an instagram account for their mascots or an “overheard at *school name*”. ICYMI, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/22/tiktok-ads"><u>TikTok is taking over the world</u></a>; reach out to student organizations (believe me, the dance team definitely has a TikTok account) and ask to be featured in a video.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20market20to20college20students20tiktok.png" alt="how to market to college students media sources" width="800" height="585" /></div>
<h2>10. Influence their parents</h2>
<p>In the instance that your price point is a little too steep for the average college kid, target their parents. The best time to do this? Move-in day and parents weekend. Yes, this gets a bit complicated during, say, a <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/02/marketing-during-covid-19">pandemic scenario</a>. But it’s not impossible! Do not underestimate the tenacity of college kids to bribe a buck out of their loving parents.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for ways to get to parents, think about care packages! Emphasize how your product will help their child slay their midterms, finals, job interviews, presentations, you name it. Or maybe it will help them stay healthy, or make their tiny college dorm feel like home (my mother bought me *many* <a href="https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/verilux-reg-happylight-lucent-trade-light-therapy-lamp/5324719" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>happy lights</u></a> to make it through the winter).</p>
<p>If you’ve seen success marketing to college students, we want to see it! Even better, if you became brand-loyal to a business that targeted you as a student, tell us what got you!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are in the construction industry marketing may be the furthest thing from your mind—well, unless you are having trouble booking jobs. Then marketing your business is likely the top thing on your mind.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a single-person operation or you have a dedicated construction marketing team, the industry comes with unique challenges. From the dangers of the job to competing for larger projects with other companies, it is important to not let your marketing strategy sit on the back burner while your competitors capture all the local jobs. So what can your construction company do to stand out? Here are <strong>11 construction marketing tips</strong> to out-book and out-build your competitors.</p>
<h2>1. Ensure your number is super easy to find everywhere</h2>
<p>There are a few industries where <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/01/google-call-only-ads">phone calls</a> are critical, construction being one of them. Whether it’s a local homeowner looking for help remodeling their kitchen or a big development company looking for a construction firm to take on some larger projects, your leads won’t get in contact with you if there are too many barriers.</p>
<p>To get as many calls as possible, your well-managed phone number should be tied directly to the name of your company, whether your ad is appearing on a Google search, a billboard on the street, or a flyer at the local supermarket.</p>
<p>I did a search for “construction companies in Boston,” and these three listings showed up immediately. While all three had numbers tied to their <a href="https://localiq.com/products/listings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listings</a>, only Sula Valley had a number that was super easy to find at the top left-hand corner of their website.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/construction-marketing-boston-results.png" alt="Google SERP results for construction in Boston" width="630" height="321" class="aligncenter" /><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/construction-marketing-sula-valley.jpg" alt="Sula Valley homepage with phone number" width="589" height="316" class="aligncenter" /><br />
Then, as I clicked along to their Facebook page, I immediately spotted their number in the “About” section.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/construction-marketing-sula-valley-facebook.jpg" alt="Sula Valley Facebook" width="303" height="264" class="aligncenter" /><br />
This is a great example of a company doing this well. To ensure you’re also making it as easy as possible for your leads to contact you, make sure your number is above the fold on your website, tied to all branded material on other sites and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business">social media</a> platforms, and, of course, ensure there is someone responsible for answering and following up with incoming calls to maximize the potential business.</p>
<p>Check how your directory listings with this <a href="https://localiq.com/free-business-listings-grader/?cid=Web_WS_InContentTextLink_Freemium_Listings&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free business listings grader</a> from LocaliQ.</p>
<h2>2. Set up Google Local Services Ads</h2>
<p>While I would definitely recommend running your standard Google Search and Display ads, for construction marketing, you should take advantage of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/11/google-local-service-ads">Google’s Local Services Ads.</a> Why? Because this ad type is made for your industry! When these ads are configured properly and someone searches for “construction company near me” your service ad with a “<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-guarantee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Guaranteed Badge</a>” will appear alongside a direct link to your phone number.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/construction-marketing-google-local-service-ads.jpg" alt="Google local service ad" width="696" height="303" class="aligncenter" /><br />
“One of the really cool things about this is that you only pay for leads, rather than per click,” says <a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/construction-marketing-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Bermudez</a>, marketing manager at Yael Consulting.</p>
<p>An endorsement from Google, the top spot on the SERPs, breaking down barriers to allow your leads to easily call you, and only paying for leads. What could be better than that?</p>
<h2>3. Make your website helpful for customers</h2>
<p>Did you know that<strong> 63% of customers primarily use a contract companies website to find and engage with them</strong>, and <strong>30% do not consider a business that does not have a website</strong>, according to <a href="https://www.bluecorona.com/blog/contractor-digital-marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Corona</a>.</p>
<p>Having an attractive, simple, and easy-to-navigate website that helps your leads get the information they need without feeling overwhelmed or turned off is critical for construction marketing success.</p>
<p>I love the example below from <a href="http://www.killco.com/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Killian Construction Co.</a> The entire website experience is pleasant, with a simple and visual homepage, as well as easy-to-navigate tabs with all the critical information a lead would be looking for. There is also a clear contact us section in the top left corner.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/construction-marketing-website.jpg" alt="construction marketing website example" width="756" height="366" class="aligncenter" /><br />
Another thing Killian’s website does well is including slideshow highlights from their portfolio to help leads get an idea of projects they have completed in the past.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/construction-marketing-website-example.jpg" alt="construction marketing website example with portfolio" width="758" height="320" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<h2>4. Get super niche with your audience targeting on social media</h2>
<p>The popularity and widespread use of social media is no secret. In fact, <strong>75% of construction companies now promote their businesses on social media</strong>, according to <a href="https://jbknowledge.com/2018-construction-technology-report-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JBK</a>. This is a good and bad thing for construction companies. The great news is that there are now even more places and opportunities to promote your construction business, but with such a crowded space it can be challenging to stand out.</p>
<p>The great thing about social platforms like Facebook and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/20/instagram-advertising">Instagram</a> is that you can get super specific with your targeting. The first thing you should do on these platforms is specify the location you are targeting.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/construction-marketing-social-media-targeting.jpg" alt="social media targeting for construction marketing" width="571" height="397" class="aligncenter" /><br />
Next, consider your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a>. What do they look like in terms of income? How about interests and behaviors? Perhaps you have a few target audiences and creating specific campaigns to align your content with each makes the most sense. Whatever you decide, the options are plentiful so explore what works and soon enough you’ll be speaking directly to your target audience and gaining even more jobs through social media.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/construction-marketing-social-media-detailed-targeting.jpg" alt="detailed targeting for construction marketing example" width="604" height="305" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<h2>5. Follow up with past customers</h2>
<p>A big part of building your audience is keeping the one you already have—yup, I mean encouraging your past customers to keep coming back. Whether it’s a smaller job you completed for a family last year or a commercial project that you completed several years ago, if your customer&#8217;s experience was positive, then it might be worth seeing if they have any upcoming needs that they haven’t yet had time to address.</p>
<p>“You should be following up with your existing customers a few months after completing a job, just to check in to see if you can help them with anything else,” says <a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/construction-marketing-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jonathan Weinberg</a>, founder and CEO of Builder Prime. “The customer will be impressed that you called and it could lead to more business.”</p>
<p>Maintaining these positive relationships is a great construction marketing strategy—not only does it help you work with happy customers, but it can also lead to new business through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/06/referral-marketing">referrals</a>!</p>
<h2>6. Create compelling video content</h2>
<p>With <strong>one-third of internet activity being spent watching video</strong> and <strong>video leading to a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/08/video-marketing-statistics">157% increase</a> in organic SERP traffic for businesses</strong>, it is clear that video is a marketing strategy that cannot be ignored! This is especially true in such a visual industry like construction. Often, many beautiful things result from construction projects so why not show them off with engaging video content?</p>
<p>Video is also a great way to give your brand personality. A video showing off your projects, a timelapse video of the construction process, or a fun company culture video showing off the unique personalities of your team could all help make your company more personable and help build your audience.</p>
<p>I love the quick Facebook video below from S+H Construction, where one of the co-founders shows off her pride for being a part of the company’s growth over the last 40 years. Very cool!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/construction-marketing-video.jpg" alt="construction marketing video exmaple" width="727" height="542" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<h2>7. Feature your employees</h2>
<p>The truth about construction marketing is that it is challenging not only because of the high level of competition but also the fact that you need to gain the trust of your leads in order to have any chance of converting them into future customers. We have all heard of the construction horror stories that make the trust threshold higher for this industry.</p>
<p>That’s why showing off the human side of your business is so important. By featuring your staff in your marketing campaigns, your leads can see the smiling human faces behind your business—and they can feel as though they are getting to know you and your business in a way. This is one small step in increasing their trust in your offerings.</p>
<p>Try inserting a human element into every one of your marketing campaigns. This can be as simple as having some your staff on the homepage, like McCormick Home Solutions does in the example below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/construction-marketing-employees.jpg" alt="employees on construction marketing website" width="754" height="456" class="aligncenter" /><br />
Grogan Building Supply, on the other hand, frequently posts photographs of their employees on Instagram to celebrate a work-related success or a birthday. People like to see the human side because it makes them feel more connected to your business, in turn increasing their level of trust.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/construction-marketing-employee-birthday.jpg" alt="employee birthday post" width="796" height="527" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<h2>8. Prioritize reviews and customer testimonials ALWAYS</h2>
<p>Bouncing off of my last rant about building customer trust, there is no better way to do this than by allowing your happy customers to speak for you. In the construction industry, you absolutely need good reviews in multiple places to instill trust in your leads. This is likely the first thing new leads are going to seek out when researching your business.</p>
<p>So how can you make sure you&#8217;re covering your bases in terms of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">reviews</a>? Here are a few starting points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include customer case studies and testimonials on your website.</li>
<li>Ensure your Google and paid search campaigns have reviews configured.</li>
<li>Check the status of your Yelp page, Google Reviews, Ang, etc.</li>
<li>Encourage your happy customers to write reviews on all major review sites (incentivize them with a reward or raffle).</li>
<li>Produce customer testimonial videos to promote across your social channels.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/construction-marketing-customer-reviews.jpg" alt="customer marketing reviews" width="693" height="638" class="aligncenter" /><br />
And once you have these reviews, make sure to direct your lead to them!</p>
<h2>9. Build a super informative blog</h2>
<p>Construction marketers might hear the word “blog” and think of food bloggers, fashion bloggers, or even business blogs—but “construction blog” cannot possibly be a thing, can it? The answer is not only is it “a thing,” but it is a super smart and compelling way to build trust and bring in more customers.</p>
<p>“In this industry, people do a great deal of research,” says <a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/construction-marketing-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jorge Fontan</a>, owner of Fortan Architecture. “Having a website that is a resource for people can lead to potential clients who want to work specifically with you after getting help from the information you post.”</p>
<p>Blogging on construction-related topics can not only build your knowledge credibility, but it can also help you strengthen your website quality, leading to more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/03/organic-traffic">organic traffic</a> and better SEO. Really, the benefits of a strong educational blog are endless for construction marketers!</p>
<h2>10. Try some guerilla marketing tactics</h2>
<p>We’ve been talking a lot about the online space for construction marketing, but what about stepping outside into your community to do some real in-person marketing experiences?</p>
<p>Guerilla marketing is not only a fun way to step away from your computer; it also allows you to let your creative juices flow and can often be the most compelling way to get new customers in the door. Try an old stand-by like signs on your current jobsite or something outside of the box like a flash mob to “Brick House” at a local hardware store. Whether you’d rather play it safe or experiment, the options are endless when it comes to guerilla marketing.

<h2>11. Partner with similar businesses for co-marketing campaigns</h2>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, a great way to take your construction marketing efforts to the next level is by partnering with a business similar to yours to do some cross-promotion and expose your construction company to an entirely new market.</p>
<p>“Co-marketing campaigns will take on different forms for B2B vs. B2C, for products vs. services, for new startups vs. established brands,” says <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/195109129-co-marketing-strategic-partnerships" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Braveen Kumar</a> from Shopify. “However, with a little creativity, you can connect the dots between you and a partner brand to expand the impact of both of your marketing efforts.”</p>
<p>So what are the best brands to co-market with? Well, think about your target audience. Where else do they shop? What other needs do they have? A few rules for building strong partnerships that can lead to impactful co-marketing campaigns include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building these relationships with similar brands, but not direct competitors.</li>
<li>Ensuring the brand you partner with has a reasonable (if not large) audience.</li>
<li>Partnering with a company that you can help in some way in return.</li>
</ul>
<p>Teamwork makes the dream work!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getting a B.A. or an M.Phil. or a Ph.D. or an M.D.—<em>any</em> higher education degree—is a huge accomplishment. But enrolling in a degree program is a huge, life-altering decision that typically involves a lot of deep and personal contemplation. At least, that’s how it was for me. As a previous full-time account manager at a video software company, deciding to quit my job to enter graduate school as full-time nutrition student was a decision that required a lot of research, thought, budgeting, and soul-searching.</p>

<h2>What is higher education marketing?</h2>
<p>Higher education marketing is marketing an institution to those seeking any type of higher education degree, which in the U.S. is defined as any degree beyond a high school diploma.</p>
<p>The higher education space is one of the most challenging marketing industries to be in. Not only is making this decision a huge personal commitment, but it also a huge financial investment. Current <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2016/12/19/national-college-enrollments-continue-slide#.WGP1xqEOiCZ.twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research</a> also shows that <strong>higher education student enrollment is on the decline</strong>, making the state of the industry even more challenging for marketers.Making sure your marketing plan has strategies that actually work is more important than ever.</p>
<p>And with that, let&#8217;s jump in.</p>
<h2>1. Create personalized, targeted social campaigns</h2>
<p>We all know that social media has become a popular space not only for teenagers, but also young, middle-aged and even older adults to spend their time online. So whether your target audience is the teenage high school student starting their college search or the middle-aged parent looking to make a career change, they are spending lots of their time browsing through their Instagram feeds and checking their Facebook messages.</p>
<p>This is why your institution absolutely needs a robust social media marketing plan for all <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/03/social-media-networks">social media networks</a>. The one thing to ensure you are doing with this plan is personalizing your ad experience for each audience. Luckily, platforms like Instagram and Facebook make this easy.</p>
<p>For instance, let’s say your school often has success enrolling high school students interested in environmentalism and politics. You can configure personalized campaigns to find those prospective students (see example below).</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="ed787382-cece-474a-aedc-d13bfe833b7e" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Pay attention to the age and location settings as well as interest and demographic targeting in Facebook’s Ad Manager platform to ensure your campaigns are reaching your target audience. Then, make sure to cater your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/15/copywriting-tips">ad copy</a> and content to these same people.</p>
<h2>2. Appeal to the emotions of your prospective students</h2>
<p>Something like a higher education degree can truly impact a person’s life in many ways. So it’s not a surprise that obtaining such a degree is often a very emotional and meaningful experience. Why not play this up in your marketing?</p>
<p>Emotional marketing is one of the post effective strategies. A <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/02/26/lets-get-emotional-the-future-of-online-marketing/#4abd878c4d0c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nielson study</a> found that <strong>individuals are 8.4x more likely to trust a company and 7.1x more likely to make a purchase when they feel a positive emotion from that brand</strong>.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are so many ways to use the power of emotion when marketing in this industry because school is often the start of a life-altering path. Whether it’s inspiring people through stories of how one graduate’s financial life improved significantly by obtaining an education or showing how people who met through school changed their lives, think outside the box and pull together some compelling story lines to draw new leads in.</p>
<p>Take the example below from Harvard University, showing how two graduate students with disabilities were able to connect and work together to form a resource to support and empower other students. Combining a story with a human photograph or video is key to communicating these emotions and stories properly.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="adea9fc0-1e8a-4250-8827-826b04f9ed0a" data-langcode="en">

</div>
<h2>3. Make your school stand out</h2>
<p>So you work for a well-known institution, with highly regarded professors, an array of activities, sports, and clubs to involve the student body, a food program, and plenty of housing options for on-campus students. COOL—but what <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/seo-for-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makes your school truly stand out</a>? Most leads are aware of what is out there in terms of what higher education programs have to offer, and there is a LOT of overlap. <strong>To successfully hook a new lead, you need to promote what makes your school unique.</strong></p>
<p>For me, when doing my research as a young and carefree seventeen-year-old, Fairfield University hooked me with their close proximity to New York City and Fairfield Beach. Okay, perhaps I was a bit young and naïve then, but if it works, then flaunt it!</p>
<p>Check out the example below from Northeastern University that often distinguishes itself with a very unique co-op program, where students gain a year of real-life internship experience before graduation.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="d59bf678-3817-4254-a8c0-b8aec4306565" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/higher-education-marketing-make-your-school-stand-out.jpg" alt="higher education marketing example from Northeastern's website" width="756" height="581" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>The key is to find the thing that makes your different and desirable and then highlight that in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/24/best-instagram-marketing-campaigns">marketing campaigns</a>.</p>
<h2>4. Let your happy and successful students do the talking</h2>
<p>You may not realize it, but as a higher education marketer it might just be best to keep your lips sealed. Think about it: You&#8217;re helping your school to gain more tuition and that can come off too salesy for your prospective students. Instead, you should let your happy current and former students do the talking—this is one of the best ways to market your school.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/customer-testimonials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>88% of consumers</strong></a><strong> trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations</strong>, and <strong>72% say that positive reviews allows them to gain trust in a business</strong>.</p>
<p>Lucky for you this is the perfect industry to gain student testimonials. Students who have had a positive experience at school typically love to speak up and help other incoming students. Just take the example below that Elon University shared of a video showing a current student sharing her wisdom with incoming freshmen.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="7416b6d4-11ba-441f-95f8-6c113184e18c" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<h2>5. Hold events IRL to make personal connections</h2>
<p>What better way to turn skeptical applicants into excited future students then to make real, in-person connections? I’m not the only who believes this. In fact, <a href="https://blog.bizzabo.com/event-marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>84% of leadership</strong></a><strong> believe in-person events are a key component to their company’s success</strong>.</p>
<p>Higher education marketers can greatly benefit from taking things offline and doing some in-person networking with some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/04/25/event-marketing">event marketing</a>. Create a list of event ideas to bring new potential students together. For instance, host a summer barbeque on campus where you have current students and/or alumni join to speak with potential applicants.</p>

</div>
<p>At the end of the day, there is nothing better then making an in-person connection to get new students onboard so plan ahead to make your events frequent, organized, publicized, and successful.</p>
<h2>6. Partner with successful alumni to show off your school</h2>
<p>There is nothing like having your alumni succeed in major ways. Why? Because your alumni represent your institution, and when they are interviewed and profiled it will likely say where they obtained their degrees, giving you a little boost in credibility.</p>
<p>So how you can you take things to the next level with your successful alumni? Build and nurture stronger relationships with these individuals so they can partner with you to promote how amazing and wonderful your school is.</p>
<p>One great way to get this ball rolling is by honoring your successful alumni with awards. Take the example below from Fairfield University, which gave Kathleen Murphy, president of Personal Investing at Fidelity, an Alumni Professional Achievement Award. This is pretty inspiring for future students looking to be successful in the financial world.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="3e0b7487-dd4a-4cb2-bb8c-9f4fba7467b9" data-langcode="en">

<h2>7. Use the power of video marketing</h2>
<p>Not all prospective students have the ability to travel to every institution they are considering applying to. Whether it be time, financial, or other logistical reasons, seeing an institution in-person before applying is not possible for many, which is why <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/08/video-marketing-statistics">video</a> should be a huge tool in your marketing playbook. Not to mention, video can serve as a way to get on the radar of students who may not have even considered looking at your programs.</p>
<p>Video has also been a growing tool that has proven to be effective for marketers. <strong>Marketers who use video </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/08/video-marketing-statistics"><strong>grow revenue 49% faster</strong></a> than marketers who don’t. It is also no secret in the higher education industry, with <a href="https://www.focusedusolutions.com/blog/higher-education-marketing-videos-are-a-great-outreach-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>86% of universities</strong></a><strong> and colleges having a presence on YouTube</strong>.</p>
<p>Take a look at how Boston College is using video on Facebook to show the excited students returning to campus. What a great way to show off the campus and get potential applicants excited!</p>

</div>
<h2>8. Start a well-written and inspiring blog</h2>
<p>For higher education marketers, having a well-written, quality blog for marketing purposes is key. While this venture may serve as more of a long-term conversion strategy, it is a great way to get <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/26/marketing-strategies-college-students">potential students</a> invested in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/08/brand-story">brand</a>. And if you can run niche blogs for different interests, even better.</p>
<p>Take the example from Dartmouth University, which writes a blog for business folks called “<a href="http://exec.tuck.dartmouth.edu/news-insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tuck Education Executive Blog</a>.”</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="43fec2ab-16e0-49db-ba96-5c946632dd93" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>This blog features articles shared to teach and inspire current or future business leaders, but this type of content also includes <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/29/great-cta">CTAs</a> to learn more about the program, like the one below.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="8509179e-7b70-47b2-93b6-fc75a565652e" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>I love this strategy of marketing because it feels genuine and not pushy, allowing potential students to do their own research without feeling pressured to convert.</p>
<h2>9. Promote your positive press</h2>
<p>Did your institution win a prize? Get voted into the top 10 colleges by the Princeton Review? Whatever it is, this positive press should not be ignored! Use it in your marketing campaigns to show off how well loved your school is to potential students. Why? Because these positive press moments are another way to instill trust in leads that your school is worth the investment.</p>
<p>Take the example below from Elon University. This school was ranked for several categories in the U.S. News and World Report and promoted this on their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/07/25/social-media-management-tips">social media platforms</a> to share with the world—because why wouldn’t they?</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="5cbff6be-5d69-4805-80d3-2d924da8a50c" data-langcode="en">

</div>
<h2>10. Advertise on popular podcasts</h2>
<p>Did you know that <a href="https://musicoomph.com/podcast-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>51% of the US population</strong></a><strong> has listened to a podcast with 32% listening every month</strong>? Podcasts are also most popular among young adults, i.e. those who are more likely to be pursuing degrees in higher education, according to <a href="https://musicoomph.com/podcast-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Music Oomph</a>.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="2c6f054f-f4f2-4816-8549-8c892dabcced" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/higher-education-marketing-podcast-ads.jpg" alt="higher education marketing podcast ad graph of popularity" width="717" height="386" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>I would only assume that podcasts are going to continue to grow in popularity as more and more are added. So why are you not running <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/05/podcast-advertising">podcast advertisements</a>?</p>
<p>Advertising on popular podcasts is a great way to sneak into a potential students mind as they are doing something they enjoy. For instance, let’s say you are recruiting for students to join your graduate business program. Sponsor some of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/20/small-business-podcasts">most popular business podcasts</a> that these folks would be most likely to listen to in order to get your name on their radar.</p>
<h2>11. Get out there with some guerilla marketing</h2>
<p>Why not take things offline and into the wild? Whether it’s a simple poster on a bus or something fancier like a performance in the street, guerilla marketing is a great way to let your creative marketing juices flow to capture a potential future student’s attention as they’re living their day to day lives.</p>
<p>The other great thing about guerilla marketing is that it is often more budget-friendly since the campaigns are localized. If you’re in need of some guerilla marketing inspiration <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/09/22/guerrilla-marketing-examples">check out this post</a> for 20+ guerilla marketing examples.</p>

<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/03/fashion-marketing">31 Fabulous Fashion Marketing Tips</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unless you live in a temperature stable nudist colony, it is likely that clothing is a pretty critical component of your day-to-day. That makes fashion a part of your day-to-day.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fashion-marketing-tips.jpg" alt="fashion marketing tips" width="788" height="525" /></div>
<p>This widespread need makes fashion a great industry to be in—which presents a challenge for fashion marketers. Like the food and beverage industry, the fashion industry is a highly crowded and competitive space. In order to stand out, your fashion marketing needs to be full on FABULOUS. Why? Because <strong>the US apparel market happens to be the largest in the world</strong>, according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/965/apparel-market-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statista</a>. Not to mention that <strong>retail sales in clothing stores in the United States regularly exceed $15 billion on a monthly basis!</strong></p>
<p>With ecommerce becoming more and more prevalent, fashion brands aren’t just competing for foot traffic and brick-and-mortar sales. They’re competing for those late-night clicks or early-morning purchases from online customers, too.</p>
<p>So how can a fashion marketer stand out among the competition? We’ve compiled an extensive list of 31 fashion marketing tips—for better ads online and offline—to become the most fashionably popular clothing brand around.</p>
<h2>1. Keep your brand’s look consistent across all your marketing efforts</h2>
<p>The most successful fashion brands have a style that remains consistent. Take Ralph Lauren, for instance. The brand’s look has remained consistent over my entire lifetime: Navy blues, whites, reds, polo, preppy, and classic all come to mind when I think of this brand. The company has a done a phenomenal job at keeping their brand style and marketing consistent year after year.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fashion-marketing-tips-brand-consistency.jpg" alt="Polo ad" width="728" height="411" /></div>
<h2>2. Focus on your best sellers</h2>
<p>This might seem like an obvious tip, but fashion marketers are often tempted to hop on new trends or new styles they have coming out. While these can be successful strategies, as well, never forget who the real stars are. After all, your best sellers are deemed “best sellers” for a reason!</p>
<h2>3. Invest in your website</h2>
<p>Well, duh! But you would be surprised how many fashion marketers allow their websites to sit on the back burner. It is important to treat your website with the same love and care that you would treat your child.</p>
<p>… Okay, perhaps that’s a bit dramatic. But the point is this: <strong>The look, feel, and functionality of your website are so critical because your site serves as your brand’s virtual storefront. </strong>Ensure you are continuously updating, testing, and keeping your website looking completely fabulous at all times—just like you would for your store window display.</p>
<h2>4. Remind your shoppers about their shopping carts</h2>
<p>Did you know that roughly <a href="https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70% of online shoppers</a><strong> abandon their shopping carts</strong>? I’m frequently one of those shoppers. With so many distractions each day, it’s easy to understand why. That means that YOU, the fashion marketer, need to implement ways to remind these distractible shoppers of what is still in their cart. Whether it’s an email campaign, remarketing ads, or social reminders, set up a system (or several) to get these shoppers to finish what they started!</p>
<h2>5. Instill DEAL FOMO as often as possible</h2>
<p>Okay, “Deal FOMO” may be a term I just made up, but it is truly a thing! If one of your favorite brands is running a 50% off sale, handing out free shipping, or including a surprise gift with your next purchase, you DO NOT want to miss out on the opportunity to take advantage of these special offers.</p>
<p>Take the example below for GILT with their 24-hour special prices for Father’s Day.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fashion-marketing-tips-deal-fomo.jpg" alt="Gilt last minute gifts ad" width="669" height="431" /></div>
<p>This ad has multiple signals that it’s a fleeting offer: “24-hour,” “special prices,” “final chance.” Use similar tactics to stress the DEAL FOMO to your target market.</p>
<h2>6. Create style guides</h2>
<p>Being in the fashion marketing industry, pairing shoes, clothing, and accessories might feel like an easy and natural thing to you. However, your audience likely does not have the same level of fashion ease. To help your shoppers look their best, create style guides. These will not only serve as helpful, educational tools for shoppers—they will also be great tools to use on your websites, email marketing campaigns, and social ads. With all the potential uses, creating some well-put together style guides is definitely worth the effort!</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fashion-marketing-tips-style-guide.jpg" alt="style guide image" width="787" height="355" /></div>
<h2>7. Use video whenever possible</h2>
<p>It is not secret that video is hot, hot, hot. <strong>Marketers who use video grow revenue </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/08/video-marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">49% faster</a><strong> than those who do not</strong>! So if you are not using video, then get on the video marketing train! There are so many ways to use video in the fashion world. Whether it be modeling your best sellers, showing off your Summer collection, or giving a sneak peak into a new line. Video marketing can be helpful for social media ads, your website, email marketing campaigns, and the list goes on.</p>
<h2>8. Create a YouTube channel</h2>
<p>Now that you are using video in your fashion marketing, why not create a YouTube channel to expand your efforts to an entirely new audience? A lot of fashionistas spend time on YouTube so creating a presence there is not a bad idea. Bonus: You can also use YouTube to run <a href="https://www.youtube.com/ads/?&amp;subid=us-en-ha-yt-bk-c-plt!o3~EAIaIQobChMI6-3rzcjI4gIVAlcNCh1u0gU8EAAYASAAEgI5AfD_BwE~%7badgroup%7d~kwd-24815532313~1695551494~329932453147&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6-3rzcjI4gIVAlcNCh1u0gU8EAAYASAAEgI5AfD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video marketing ads.</a></p>
<h2>9. Run a consistent and quality blog</h2>
<p>Blogging is not only a great way to share free and useful information with your audience, but it can also be a super effective fashion marketing tool. Running a consistent and quality blog can help build your website’s SEO, leading to more free traffic. It’ll also help you connect with your audience to build brand loyalty, which can lead to new brand partnerships. Ensure your blog maintains a frequent and consistent publishing calendar with high-quality content to keep your audience engaged.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fashion-marketing-tips-blog-quality.jpg" alt="blog image" width="788" height="566" /></div>
<h2>10. Partner with well-known fashion bloggers</h2>
<p>Recently, my fiancé and I attended a wedding where a fashion blogger with over 1 million Instagram followers was also in attendance. This got me thinking: How powerful would it be for a brand to partner with this “social media influencer” of such high popularity?</p>
<p>This is not a new strategy, but one that is often used my effective fashion marketers. If you can build a list of social media influencers and find ways to connect with them to get them to share your brand and content, your audience will simultaneously grow with theirs.</p>
<h2>11. Partner with your local brick-and-mortar stores</h2>
<p>It can also be a useful strategy to take things offline and build partnerships in your own community. Whether it be a local tapas restaurant, or a popular décor store in town, build relationships with brick and mortar businesses to help promote each other’s brands.<br />
12. Become a hashtagging pro</p>
<p>#Hashtagging might seem like a useless tool to you, but I am definitely a supporter in using hashtags as a marketing strategy in every industry. Why? Because hashtags can help you reach new people, connect with others, build branded contests, and—well, the list goes on. If you’re new to the hashtag game, check-out my <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">recent guide to Instagram hashtags here</a>!</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fashion-marketing-tips-instagram-hashtags.jpg" alt="Instagram hashtags guide" width="716" height="536" /></div>
<h2>13. Remarket EVERYWHERE</h2>
<p>If you are not using the power of remarketing, YOU NEED TO BE! Why? Because remarketing allows you to capture recent visitors who left for some reason or another. Whether that’s an abandoned shopping cart, a blog drop-off, or a new visitor who did not explore your new line of summer sandals, those users are opportunities. Remarketing is an effective way to say, <em>“Hey there! Remember me? Come on back, and I’ll show you exactly what you want </em><em>J.”</em></p>
<h2>14. Use Carousel ads on Instagram and Facebook</h2>
<p>Assuming you already have a social media presence on the biggest channels like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, it is critical to use these channels in the most effective way to reach your fashion marketing goals. One way to do this on Instagram and Facebook is by choosing the best ad formats. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/21/facebook-carousel-ads">Carousel ads</a> allow you to display several images in a magazine style format. You can even think of them as mini style guides. Use this ad format to show off your products—whether it’s your best sellers, a summer dress collection, or a new line of men’s golf shirts!</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fashion-marketing-tips-carousel-ads.jpg" alt="Carousel ads on Facebook" width="659" height="459" /></div>
<h2>15. Run Collection ads on Instagram and Facebook</h2>
<p>Did you know that there is a way to allow your customers to purchase without even leaving their precious Instagram and Facebook accounts? It’s called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/collection-ad-format">Collection ads</a>. You may have seen them before; these beauties display a primary image or video with four accompanying images or videos, and then when a user clicks they can purchase as they wish. Pretty, neat right? And why not give your audience another way to spend money with your brand?</p>
<h2>16. Show off sneak peeks in Stories</h2>
<p>Instagram’s Snapchat like feature, Stories, is a non-committal way of sharing content since it only lives for 24 hours. Use stories to help your target audience build a bond and connection with your brand. Sharing “sneak peaks” of new styles coming out, showing some behind-the-scenea footage, or giving your audience a peak of your company culture are all great ways to use the story feature on Instagram.</p>
<h2>17. Launch a social contest</h2>
<p>Social media contests are a great way to get your audience involved with your brand. They can also be critical in expanding your reach to a new set of potential customers. A contest can be as simple as tagging a few friends, sharing your post, or using your branded hashtag. Or, you could make it more complex, like the one below, which requires you to make a purchase to enter.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fashion-marketing-tips-social-contest.jpg" alt="social contest Instagram" width="750" height="504" /></div>
<h2>18. Run compelling email marketing campaigns</h2>
<p>Email marketing is a critical tool for any fashion marketer. Make sure you have a robust email campaign strategy in place to regularly communicate with leads about special offers, sales, new styles, or popular items that are back in stock. Automating your email flow tied to specific behavior will help improve relevancy; For instance, if someone completes a certain purchase that leads you to believe they would be interested in a specific upsell, then enter them into an email flow that prompts that purchase.</p>
<h2>19. A/B Test ad copy, email subject lines, and other content</h2>
<p>A/B testing is a great way to take your fashion marketing strategy to a new level of success. Running A/B tests is a simple and effective way to determine what resonates best with audience members. While you should A/B tests several components of a campaign, make sure to focus on one component at a time. For instance, A/B test your email subject lines to see which gets the best open rates. Once you’ve found a winner, then A/B test the video thumbnails in your email to see which one is clicked on most.</p>
<h2>20. Plan holiday campaigns far in advance</h2>
<p>As many fashion marketers know, holiday season is a critical selling time! Whether it’s a hyped-up holiday like Christmas or a Hallmark holiday like Valentines Day, planning for these seasonal peaks is critical to getting the most sales possible during these busy times. Start planning far in advance!</p>
<h2>21. Take advantage of ad scheduling</h2>
<p>Did you know that for the majority of online marketing campaigns (Google Ads, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter), you can schedule what time of day and day of week your ads run? Perhaps you know this but haven’t taken advantage of this feature. Either way, you should know when your shoppers are most likely to be active online. Take this knowledge and implement it so that you are only paying to run your ads during these busy hours and days.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fashion-marketing-tips-ad-scheduling.jpg" alt="ad scheduling" width="420" height="281" /></div>
<h2>22. Encourage your happy customers to write testimonials</h2>
<p>Whether you are primarily an ecommerce business, a retail store, or in another sector of the fashion industry altogether, reviews matter! Especially when it comes to purchasing clothing. No one wants to go through the hassle of visiting a store or purchasing clothing online to then have to deal with returning unwanted items. That’s why shoppers use reviews to influence their decision to purchase. To get those shoppers to become customers, encourage your existing customers to write testimonials.</p>
<p>Rent the Runway is an example of a company that does an amazing job at encouraging their happy customers to write reviews (they even got me to do it, and I’m not one to often write reviews). Check out an example of an email they sent me after using their services.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fashion-marketing-tips-testimonial.jpg" alt="Rent the Runway testimonial" width="394" height="545" /></div>
<h2>23. Get on TV!</h2>
<p>Easier said than done, I know! But if you work at making the right connections, anything is possible. This might mean starting off on your local TV station, yes, but just imagine what it would do for your brand to be exposed to an audience as large as <em>The Today Show</em>! Consider hiring a PR professional to help make these connections if you do not know where to start.</p>
<h2>24. Take advantage of the Google Shopping Network</h2>
<p>If you are not taking advantage of the Google Shopping Network you are missing out on a huge untapped audience! We all know that Google has become the sidekick for most individuals looking for anything. Now more and more people are shopping on Google so ensure your brand has a strong presence there.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fashion-marketing-google-shopping.jpg" alt="sneaker google shopping network" width="808" height="446" /></div>
<h2>25. Use Google Display Ads to appear in relevant places to interested parties</h2>
<p>Between Google Search, Shopping, and Display, it can get confusing as to which to use. While you should have a presence on all three, it is critical to not ignore Google Display Network (GDN). The GDN will let show your ads on websites based on keywords, topics, and site names so you can target your audience where they like to spend time online with a beautiful and compelling visual advertisement like the one below.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fashion-marketing-tips-google-display-network.jpg" alt="Google Display Network ads" width="670" height="626" /></div>
<h2>26. Target your audience by specific interests through social media marketing</h2>
<p>The level of targeting that you can do on various online platforms is pretty remarkable. One of my favorites for the fashion industry is using interest-based targeting. Why? Because you likely know what your target audience is interested in so why not target them based on these interests? For example, if you sell running clothing, why not target those interested in running and physical fitness?</p>

<h2>27. Take things offline with guerilla marketing</h2>
<p>Lots of the ideas we have been discussing are online marketing strategies. But why not take things offline and onto the streets? Thankfully, the world is vibrant and alive IRL. Incorporating some guerilla marketing campaigns into your playbook is a great way to stand out and make a real impact. Here are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/09/22/guerrilla-marketing-examples">some fun examples</a> to spark inspiration.</p>

<h2>28. Run a local fashion show at a popular place</h2>
<p>Another great way to take things offline and doing some in-person fashion marketing is by hosting a fashion show at a popular restaurant or tourist spot. For instance, partner with a local art gallery and host a show showing off your new spring line. Provide champagne and discounts to get the purchases flowing!</p>
<h2>29. Get celebrities to love and wear your brand</h2>
<p>Even if you can’t get Taylor Swift to start wearing your new summer dresses, but what about a local celebrity? This tip is another one where a PR professional could be helpful to make prominent connections in your community.</p>
<h2>30. Appeal to your audience’s emotions</h2>
<p>If you can build an emotional connection with your viewers, you can win them over and get them invested in your brand. Whenever drafting a new campaign idea consider the emotion you want your audience to feel. Happiness? Calm? Nostalgia? Then create content that evokes these emotions. Whether that be through video ads, image and copy, or something else all together, emotions are truly powerful in pushing people towards action.</p>
<h2>31. Get involved in a good cause</h2>
<p>Is there a charity or cause that your company supports? If not, there should be! For instance, the online fashion company, Everlane, is all about ethical clothing (think safe work environments and fair wages).</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fashion-marketing-tips-cause-marketing.jpg" alt="cause marketing" width="772" height="419" /></div>
<p>This tip ties in well with sparking emotion because if you can find a cause that your company is passionate about it is likely there is a large audience that is emotionally invested in this cause as well and therefore more likely to purchase with you over your competitors.</p>
<p>With these tips, your fashion marketing efforts will likely lead you to needing more clothing in stock, ASAP. Shoppers beware, new brands are coming your way!</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that 95% of car sales today are made at the dealership, but <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/data/auto-industry-service-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search is the first place people go</a> to begin their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/21/customer-journey-mapping">buyer’s journey</a>? It is clear to most automotive marketers that online advertising is key to bring new leads into the dealership. Yet, this automotive marketing strategy comes with many challenges (and costs).</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges <a href="https://localiq.com/industries/automotive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automotive marketers</a> face is gaining the trust of their leads. After all, the job of a marketer is to help bring leads in the door so the sales team has people to sell to. But in such a competitive industry—one where the consumer is making a rather large financial decision that will affect their everyday life—automotive marketers do not have it made in the shade.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/automotive-marketing.jpg" alt="image of woman on car" width="778" height="519" /></p>
<p>So how can automotive marketers deal with these challenges? By being smarter about their online advertising. <a href="https://medium.com/automotive-cars-updates-blogs-news/effective-advertising-tips-for-the-automotive-industry-b960019b9f86" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>97% of people</strong></a><strong> looking to purchase, repair, or customize a car start their journey online</strong>.</p>
<h2>9 killer automotive marketing strategies</h2>
<p>As daunting as it is to advertise in the auto industry, there are some tried-and-true ways to achieve sustained success. Here are nine <strong>automotive marketing strategies</strong> that you can use to drive more sales this year.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Build trust with customer reviews </strong></h3>
<p>I will never forget leasing my first car. I went for the reliable, affordable, and decent-looking (in my opinion) Honda Accord, but I was terrified at making this decision. I spent months doing research, calling local dealerships, considering whether leasing or buying a used car was the better route to go. At the end of day, I decided where to look in person by reading <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/18/google-shopping-reviews">customer reviews</a> on Yelp and Google.</p>
<p>The point of this anecdote is this: <strong>Reviews are probably the most effective automotive marketing strategy there is. </strong>As an automotive marketer you need to not only ensure you have GOOD reviews, but you need to go above and beyond to ensure these glowing reviews are everywhere they can possibly be. Yelp, Google, social networks, your own website—ensure you are covering all your bases! You can also take things a step further by creating <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/19/customer-testimonial-examples">customer success stories</a> and videos with your most valued customers, and use these in various places, like paid social ads, your website, or your newsletter.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/automotive-marketing-reviews.jpg" alt="automotive marketing customer reviews" width="652" height="421" /></p>
<p>When it comes to automotive marketing, there is no better way to instill trust than to let your customers speak for you!</p>
<p>PS: Make sure your review sites have the right business information! Use this <a href="https://localiq.com/free-business-listings-grader/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free business listings grader</a> to check.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Be at the top of the Google SERP</strong></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, when I first started searching for my new car where did I turn to? Google, of course! I am not alone in this. According to a study from <a href="http://searchenginewatch.com/sew/study/2340699/70-of-consumers-researching-cars-turn-to-search-engines-first-stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kenshoo</a>, <strong>70% of consumers researching cars turn to search engines first</strong>.</p>
<p>Since Google is the first line of defense you need to be at the very top! Especially considering how often people scroll to the bottom of the SERP (HINT: it is not often). The first few listings always get the most clicks, so ensuring you&#8217;re in the top positions is critical to your automotive marketing success. To do this your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/11/easy-adwords-bidding-strategies">Google Ads strategy</a> need to be extremely effective. So how can you get to the top of the page without completely breaking the bank? There are certain strategies that Google tends to favor, and will help you get in higher positions without spending more. Follow these tips to get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure your Google Ads account is structured properly with tight-knit ad groups (aim to have 15-20 keywords per ad group).</li>
<li>Keep keywords tightly related to your ad text, and include 2-3 ads per ad group/keyword list.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/12/automated-ad-extensions">ad extensions</a>! Google loves them, and they will help you get more ad real estate and chances of lead interaction.</li>
<li>Add <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/06/negative-keyword-guide">negative keywords</a> to block out irrelevant searches (and keep a close eye on your search query report).</li>
<li>Allocate your budget properly between campaigns. What are your highest sellers? What is your target audience most likely to search for? Bid higher on these items to capitalize on what is popular among your audience</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s also important not to forget about other search networks, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/12/18/john-gagnon-bing-ads-interview">like Bing</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bing-ads-audience-breakdown.png" alt="Bing Ads breakdown by audience" width="598" height="420" /></p>
<p>While Bing might seem like the neglected cousin of Google, they do account for a section of the search market that typically attracts older folks—people who are probably more financially established and able to invest in expensive cars.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Bid on competitor keywords</strong></h3>
<p>While we’re talking about search engine marketing, it’s important to not only be bidding on the obvious keywords like “new Honda Accord.” You should also set up an automotive marketing campaign to tackle your competition.</p>
<p>It is a fierce and competitive world in automotive marketing, so being able to show up every time your competition does with compelling <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/14/ppc-ad-copywriting">ad copy</a> is key. While I would not recommend saying anything negative or using your competitor’s name in your ad copy (which Google could put you in time out for), you should bid on your top competitors brand names, and create highly persuasive ads to get leads to visit your website over your competition.</p>
<p>I love this ad from Toyota for instance:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/automotive-marketing-ad-for-college-grads-1.jpg" alt="automotive marketing search ad for college grads" width="603" height="95" /></p>
<p>While I can’t see if they’re bidding on competitor keywords or not, I love how they are appealing directly to a specific demographic, and adding value for that individual right in the headline of their ad.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong>Pump the breaks for a second!

<h3><strong>4. Actively manage your negative keyword list</strong></h3>
<p>Did you know that your ads can show up for searches that are not relevant to your business? And if anyone clicks on them, you still have to pay? Whenever you are bidding on broad or phrase match keywords the potential to show up for irrelevant searches is present.</p>
<p>While just bidding on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/07/exact-match-keywords-even-more-variants">exact match</a> might seem like a nice solution, this will greatly limit your reach potential, which makes the process of identifying negative keywords critical to your automotive marketing strategy. While searching your search query report might feel like a time-consuming task it is an absolute necessity, especially in the automotive industry. If your ads are appearing for irrelevant search terms your business instantly loses credibility. This is why being cognizant about setting up negatives to avoid irrelevant search queries is not only going to save you face, but also going to save you money.</p>
<p>For instance, imagine if you’re bidding on the keyword “affordable cars” and your ad appears for the search “toy cars,” and then a busy parent accidentally clicks. This is not only a waste of time for the parent, but it’s a waste of money for you!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/automotive-marketing-serp-for-big-toy-cars.jpg" alt="search results for &quot;big toy cars&quot;" width="757" height="926" /></p>
<p>WordStream Advisor makes it quite easy for you to manage your negative keyword list through tools like the 20-Minute Work Week, which helps weed out irrelevant searches, and our search query report to find and configure your negative keyword lists.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Adjust your campaign budgets based on car-buying trends</strong></h3>
<p>Is Black Friday the hottest day to buy a car? What about Memorial Day Weekend? There are many unofficial “car-buying holidays.” According to an analysis done by TrueCar.com and U.S. News &amp; World Report, you can purchase a vehicle for 7.5% to 8% below MSRP if you’re strategic about when you buy it. Assuming your audience has done their fair share of research, they are aware of these automotive deal times. Check out <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/25/6-best-times-to-buy-a-car.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the report here</a> to read more about the days of the week and times of year that deal-shoppers are likely to browse for their next vehicle.</p>
<p>Figure out when things are busy, steady, and slow and then adjust your online advertising budget accordingly. Make sure your windows aren’t too narrow. This often requires planning ahead, but Google and other ad platforms make it fairly easy to adjust <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/09/14/adwords-budget-guide">your budget</a> on an ongoing basis. Just make sure you’re actually doing this!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/automotive-marketing-budgeting-for-campaigns.jpg" alt="automotive marketing ad schedule" width="692" height="366" /></p>
<p>Another thing to take advantage of is ad scheduling. When do customers typically come into the store? Weekends? Weekdays post work? Look at the data to determine this and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/07/30/ad-scheduling">set an ad schedule</a> so your ads are only running at a higher budget right before these key times, reminding your future customers to come on by.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Target the right people with your automotive campaigns</strong></h3>
<p>What type of automotive business are you marketing? Who is your typical customer? There needs to be a different automotive marketing strategy for marketers of luxury Porshe and BMWs versus marketers of used cars or more affordable brands like Honda and Toyota. The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/adwords-income-targeting">prospective customers</a> have drastically different concerns, questions, wants and needs when it comes to investing in a new car. While your Mercedes customer may be more concerned about their heated seats and leather interior, your Honda buyer most likely care more about gas mileage and longevity.  Although this might not always be the case…</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/automotive-marketing-car-image.jpg" alt="image of people on car" width="781" height="585" /></p>
<p>“Those who buy luxury cars more likely crave social status and material wealth, as opposed to utilitarian cars which consumers buy out of necessity,” says <a href="https://www.limelightplatform.com/blog/psychology-luxury-car-buyers-considerations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Julia Manoukian</a>.</p>
<p>Different automotive marketing audiences need to be broken down and targeted separately. <strong>Considering the main things your audience cares about is a critical way to get the right message to the right person and increase the chance of conversion.</strong></p>
<p>If necessary, you may need to split your audiences into two, three, or even four separate campaigns to ensure you’re sending the right message to the right prospect. And, of course, with tools like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/27/facebook-ad-targeting-options-infographic">Facebook’s targeting options</a> this is not as complex as it once was. Just ensure you spend the time to define your audiences so you can craft the right message to the right person at the right time!</p>
<h3><strong>7. Compel shoppers to come into your store with unique offers </strong></h3>
<p>Why should I buy a car with you versus the automotive dealership down the street—or one that’s more conveniently located or better priced? A crucial part of your automotive marketing strategy is convincing your prospects to choose you over your competition.</p>
<p>If there are not any obvious reasons, like having the lowest prices or the best reviews, brainstorm some unique incentives and offers you can provide to prospects. For example, you could offer all new car buyers a 5% discount or perhaps free oil changes for the first two years. Incentives are also great for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/05/how-to-increase-urgency">creating a sense of urgency</a> to spur people to buy with you before they miss out on a special limited-time offer.</p>
<p>Check out the deal below for $1,000 for college graduates. What a great incentive to bring new car buyers in at a time when they are likely searching for their post-college vehicle.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/automotive-marketing-deal-for-college-grads.jpg" alt="automotive marketing deal for college grads" width="784" height="378" /></p>
<h3><strong>8. Use all call features possible</strong></h3>
<p>Call-only campaigns, call extensions, mobile bid-adjustments, and call tracking—these are just a few of the Google Ads features that the automotive marketer should be prioritizing. <strong>Phone calls are common and important within the automotive industry, and phone leads are easier to turn into sales</strong>.</p>
<p>Here’s a run down of the various options when it comes to increasing your call volume:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Call-only campaigns</strong>: With call-only campaigns, your bidding and paying to get a call rather then a visit to your website. It’s important to realize that your strategy need to be different for these compared to a regular search campaign. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/11/11/call-only-campaigns">Check out this post</a> for some tips on doing these right.</li>
<li><strong>Call extensions</strong>: <a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2453991" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call extensions</a> are a bit different than call-only campaigns. The option to visit your website is still there, but now you can add an extension to allow for phone calls, as well. You can also schedule these to only show during business hours, when people are available to answer the phone, which is pretty neat.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile bid-adjustments</strong>: Where are people most likely to call from? Their cells phones, duh. Luckily, Google allows you to adjust your mobile bids, so you can make sure to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/07/26/device-level-bid-adjustments">bid higher on mobile</a> traffic to bring in more rings.</li>
<li><strong>Call tracking</strong>: Lastly, it’s critical to track your calls in order to understand where your ROI is coming from. For more on call tracking, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/adwords-call-tracking">check out this post</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/automotive-marketing-cold-call.jpg" alt="cold calling in The Wolf of Wall Street" width="564" height="423" /></p>
<p>While optimizing your automotive marketing campaigns for phone calls might sound like a lot of work, it will be well worth the effort once your phones start ringing off the hook.</p>
<h3><strong>9. Remarket!</strong></h3>
<p>Remarketing is a critical component for automotive marketing. Since there is so much comparison shopping going on, and the sales process is such a key component of the car buying process, it is important to not lose new leads in the marketing stage of things. Giving them reminders through intriguing remarketing ads is one great way to ensure no leads fall out of the funnel.</p>
<p>With remarketing, you can lower your abandonment rate and close more deals by showing enticing Display ads to people who recently visited your site, in order to remind them you’re there and lead them through the process. Try showing them a deal to get them to come into the store. This will ensure you’re able to get them connected with your stellar sales team.</p>
<p>You can configure <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-remarketing">remarketing campaigns through Google Ads</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/04/facebook-retargeting">social platforms, including Facebook</a>.</p>

<p>With the help of these automotive marketing strategies, your campaigns should take off at a lightning pace. You&#8217;ll be delivering new leads to your sales team in no time!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The biggest challenge in hotel marketing is competition. How do you stand out from the sea of other hotels, not to mention options like Airbnb? We've got you covered with ten simple and effective hotel marketing and advertising strategies.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/07/hotel-marketing">10 Smart Hotel Marketing Strategies to Increase Bookings</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two types of people: those who love staying in hotels and those who hate it. I must say that I lean more towards the latter, and often find myself choosing Airbnb over hotel stays when traveling for leisure. Why? It’s often more affordable, feels less sterile, and can offer unique touches that make the place feel more homey. However, if the hotel is able to market themselves right, offer a reasonable price, and treat me like a queen, then this decision could easily shift.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hotel-marketing-tips-and-ideas.jpg" alt="hotel marketing strategies " width="800" height="560" /></div>
<p>The challenge of being in the hotel marketing industry is the overwhelming amount of competition. Especially with the growth in popularity of websites like Airbnb and Home Away, it’s become even more challenging to stand out against the competition to gather more bookings. While hotel marketers are all too familiar with these challenges, they are still tasked with hitting (and hopefully exceeding) their metrics, which are often tied to bookings.</p>
<p>So what can a struggling hotel marketer do? How do you make sure people can find your hotel in the first place, and then get so excited they can’t wait to book their stay? Have no fear: here are 10 no-fail tips to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/09/02/hotel-marketing-advertising">hotel marketing</a> success!</p>
<h2>Tip #1: Be Easily Searchable Online!</h2>
<p>Let’s face it, technology has taken over. Long gone are the days of travel agents. Today’s travelers are empowered to do their own <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/13/comparative-advertising">comparative research</a> without even leaving their beds. So if your hotel isn’t easy to find online, no wonder your bookings are few and far between. You need to be EVERYWHERE relevant online for potential bookings so people can find you in the window when they need to book a place to stay.</p>
<p>Most travelers (75%!) <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/09/02/hotel-marketing-advertising">start by using a search engine</a> to find places to stay, so <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/30/seo-basics">stay on top of your SEO</a> and <a href="https://localiq.com/free-business-listings-grader/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make sure your business listings are in tip-top shape</a>. Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/popular-keywords/hotel-keywords">popular hotel keywords</a> in your site copy, and make sure <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/22/google-speed-update">your site loads super fast</a>.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google_mobile_benchmarks_CPC_small.png" alt="Google Ads Mobile Benchmarks Average CPC" width="900" height="1000" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Travel companies have <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/13/google-ads-mobile-benchmarks">high CTR’s and low costs on mobile</a> in particular</em></p>
<p>But don’t rely on organic optimization alone! The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/serp">SERP</a> (search engine results page) for hotel-related searches is heavily monetized, meaning people will see ads first. In the example screenshot below, the whole screen is taken up by ads. You need to be bidding aggressively on Google’s Search and Display Networks (don’t forget <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/03/19/hotel-ads">hotel ads</a>!), Bing, social platforms like Facebook and Instagram, and websites like Trip Advisor and Kayak.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/serp-for-hotel-searches.jpg" alt="seo for hotels" width="550" height="978" /></div>
<p>Don’t limit yourself to just one social platform, search engine, or travel website. While it might not be necessary to have a strong presence on every website imaginable, you should dig into your website analytics, find out where people are typically booking from, and create an engaging and competitive presence on those platforms.</p>
<h2>Tip #2: Remarket, Remarket, Remarket</h2>
<p>Did you know that the <a href="https://www.tnooz.com/article/online-travel-booking-abandonment-forecast-infographic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abandonment rate</a> for booking hotels online is<strong> 75%</strong>?! That’s right, a whopping three out of four people start the booking process, get distracted, and abandon their experience. Who knows whether it was the pizza man interrupting their purchase, or a suspicion that they might be able to find a better deal elsewhere. Whatever the reason may be, this does not mean you should give up as a hotel marketer.</p>
<p>Remarketing is a critical component for hotel marketing due to the fact that travelers are distracted not only by everyday distractions (like pop-up phone notifications and crying babies), but to the fact that there are hundreds of other options they can choose from.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/retargeting-ads-fomo.png" alt="expedia last minute ad" width="437" height="391" /></div>
<p>With remarketing, you can lower your abandonment rate and close more bookings by showing enticing display ads to people who recently visited your site, in order to remind them you’re there and lead them through the process. Try showing them a deal for a little extra incentive to book with you instead of your competitors, and make the booking process as easy as possible.</p>
<p>Configure <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-remarketing">remarketing campaigns through Google Ads</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/04/facebook-retargeting">social platforms including Facebook</a> ASAP!</p>
<h2>Tip #3: Ensure You’re Targeting the Right Audience</h2>
<p>What type of hotel are you marketing, and who is your typical guest? There needs to be a different strategy for marketers of a Super 8 Motel off Route 9 compared to the Ritz Carlton on the sandy beaches of the Caribbean shores. These people book differently, travel differently, and have different budgets. That’s why tools like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/adwords-income-targeting">income targeting</a> will come in handy. While this might seem obvious, there are even further ways to break down your audiences when it comes to marketing your hotel.</p>
<p>Many hotels have a variety of customers of different income levels, since they may offer rooms on the more extravagant side (like the presidential suites) and other rooms that are often sold at discount prices. These two audiences need to be broken down and targeted separately. There is even a difference for the same hotel chain in different locations. All of these things are critical to consider when crafting your marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>If necessary, you may need to split your audiences into two, three, or even four separate campaigns to ensure you’re sending the right message to the right prospect. And of course with tools like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/27/facebook-ad-targeting-options-infographic">Facebook’s targeting options</a> this is not as complex as it once was. Just ensure you spend the time to define your audiences so you can craft the right message to the right person at the right time!</p>
<p>Take a look at this Facebook ad, for example – probably targeted at a savvy business traveler with a relatively high travel budget.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hotel-advertising-targeting-tips.jpg" alt="targeting strategies for hotel advertising" width="501" height="597" /></div>
<p>But if you work at a hip hotel in LA’s Koreatown, you might want to target a younger demographic of single people, for example.</p>
<h2>Tip #4: Allocate More Marketing Budget During Peak Booking Seasons</h2>
<p>If you’re running a ski resort in the Alps or a strip of beach rentals on the Cape, your peak booking seasons are going to be very different. As a hotel marketer, you are most likely fully aware of when your peak booking season is, but you may be a step behind when it comes to ad budgeting. It just makes sense to spend more of your annual budget in your busiest season.</p>
<p>Figure out when things are busy, steady, and slow and then adjust your budget accordingly. Make sure your windows aren’t too narrow. This often requires planning ahead, but Google and other ad platforms make it fairly easy to adjust your budget on an ongoing basis. Just make sure you’re actually doing this!</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adwords-ad-scheduling-data-2.png" alt="ad sheduling tips" width="692" height="366" /></div>
<p>Another thing to take advantage of is ad scheduling. When do people typically book their trips? Perhaps you run a hotel that gets frequent business travelers; these individuals may tend to book more during business hours compared to the folks traveling for leisure who are more likely booking during weeknights or weekends. Look at the data to determine this and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/07/30/ad-scheduling">set an ad schedule</a> so your ads are only running at a higher budget during these peak times.</p>
<h2>Tip #5: Provide Incentives to Get People Interested</h2>
<p>Why should I stay with you over the hotel down the street – or one that’s more conveniently located or better priced? Your hotel needs to have a reason that leads your prospects to choose you over your competition.</p>
<p>If there are not any obvious reasons, like having the lowest prices or the best reviews, brainstorm some unique incentives and offers you can provide to prospects. For example, you could offer all first-time guests a 15% discount. Incentives are also great for creating a sense of urgency to spur people to book with you before they miss out on a special limited-time offer.</p>
<p>See the example below for a luxury hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico. They provide an entire area of their website for special offers. The one below shows a deal for 30% off when staying two or more nights, 15% off dining, and 24-hour access to their fancy fitness center. Not bad!</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hotel-marketing-special-offers.jpg" alt="hotel marketing special offers" width="1015" height="567" /></div>
<h2>Tip #6: Build Local Partnerships</h2>
<p>The chances are your hotel is not located in the middle of a desert. More likely you’re surrounded by <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/06/local-marketing-ideas">local businesses and attractions</a>. Whether that be well-known restaurants, shops, or yoga studios, you need to get to know your neighbors. Making friends with the local business owners is a great way to build partnerships and co-promote each other, especially if you’re marketing a boutique hotel rather than a chain.</p>
<p>For instance, you could partner with a popular brewery and run a contest where the winner gets a free brewery tour and beer tasting along with a discounted stay at your hotel. Building these relationships will lead to easy, effective, and affordable marketing that will definitely increase your booking rates.</p>
<h2>Tip #7: Don’t Just Market the Hotel, Market the Location</h2>
<p>Chances are many future vacationers are still indecisive whether or not the city or town where your hotel is located is the place where they want to use their precious PTO. This is why you shouldn’t just be focusing on the amenities your hotel has to offer. While, yes, it is smart to promote your top-rated room service and infinity pool, it is just as important to promote your location. What makes your city or town a desirable place to visit? Future visitors want to know this.</p>
<p>Check out this great example from The W Chicago. Rather then solely promoting their modern hotel amenities, they also promote local happenings by targeting a specific audience of festival goers. Chances are this strategy has helped them attract festival fans who weren’t even considering Chicago as a vacation option. <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/hospitality-marketing-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Take advantage of the local attractions and events</a> in your marketing, and promote what your city is famous for!</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/festival-hotel-marketing.jpg" alt="location based hotel marketing strategies" width="500" height="482" /></div>
<h2>Tip #8: Ensure Your Website Is Both Simple and Breathtaking</h2>
<p>While this might seem like common sense, there are so many hotel websites out there that are slacking in their website design. This is an instant turnoff for hotel bookers. If your website isn’t clean and attractive, then why would your physical location be? The website is often the first impression a person has of your hotel, so you need to make it breathtaking, but also <em>usable</em>. That means it’s simple and straightforward for users (on any type of device) to find the information they need as well as to complete a reservation.</p>
<p>When overhauling your website, focus on keeping the design and navigation clean, crisp, and simple. Ensure your hotel photographs are professional, high-res, and displayed in the correct formats and ratios to work for both desktop and mobile. Keep the language clear and simple, and ensure the booking process is easy to avoid mid-booking abandonment. Videos also tend to work well since they show off your space in a more thorough and engaging manner.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.badruttspalace.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Badrutt’s Palace</a> is a great example of a hotel website that embraces all of these clean and attractive design elements. Their background homepage video does an excellent job at showing off the beauty of their destination. In such a visual industry, it’s important to take advantage of the beauty surrounding your location.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hotel-website-examples.jpg" alt="best hotel websites" width="1359" height="697" /></div>
<h2>Tip #9: Go Above and Beyond in Customer Service Before, During, and After Their Stay</h2>
<p>Marketing and customer service go hand in hand, especially in the hospitality industry. If you go above and beyond for your customers, then they are much more likely to pay it forward and do the same for you in terms of stellar online reviews, referrals, and return visits.</p>
<p>So what does superior customer service mean? The first step is ensuring your staff is hired and trained with a customer-first mentality. While working with people can be very challenging, always putting the customer first is critical. For instance, say your hotel visitor is upset with the view from their room and there are no other open rooms available. Try to figure out if you can move them for the remainder of their stay later on, and to compensate for the trouble, provide them with a bottle of bubbly and a hand-written note apologizing for the inconvenience. These types of gestures can make a lasting impact and show the customers how you value them.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hotel-marketing-strategy-reviews.jpg" alt="hotel marketing review strategy" width="772" height="210" /></div>
<p>When customers are treated exceptionally well they will be much more likely to share their experiences with others, leading to more business for you. Check out <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/micahsolomon/2017/07/29/5-wow-customer-service-stories-from-5-star-hotels-examples-any-business-can-learn-from/#25900c0e33e6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these customer service stories</a> if you’re curious about additional ways you can go above and beyond for your visitors.</p>
<h2>Tip #10: Build a Customer Loyalty Program</h2>
<p>Sometimes <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/30/cross-selling-upselling">your past customers can make the best audience to market to</a> – if they had a positive experience in the past, why wouldn’t they want to return?</p>
<p>Customer loyalty programs are a wonderful way to ensure customers come back again and again. Why? These programs are designed to give large discounts and special perks to returning visitors. Perhaps your program works by allowing guests to earn points and reach certain levels each year (Gold, Platinum, etc.).</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hotel-marketing-strategy-customer-loyalty-program.jpg" alt="hotel customer loyalty programs" width="1010" height="477" /></div>
<p>Check out some of your favorite hotel websites and see how they run their programs.</p>
<h2>No Reservations</h2>
<p>If your bookings haven’t increased after implementing all these tried and true tactics, then your hotel must be located in the middle of nowhere! Seriously, though, this guide should put you back on the track to booking frenzy success.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Personal injury law is a highly competitive field, and costs can be high. But there are plenty of ways to make sure your advertising spend delivers a return. Check out these eight effective marketing strategies for personal injury law firms.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/03/15/personal-injury-lawyer-marketing">8 Marketing Tips for Personal Injury Law Firms</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>$935.71 cost per click.</em></p>
<p>That’s not a typo: in the United States it can cost a personal injury attorney $935.71 every time someone searches for the “best mesothelioma lawyer” and clicks their ad on Google. Furthermore, <a href="https://searchenginewatch.com/2016/05/31/the-most-expensive-100-google-adwords-keywords-in-the-us/">Search Engine Watch</a> found that 19 of the top 25 most expensive keywords on Google are searches related to personal injury law firms.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="32f899f8-0c80-42bb-aaf9-68e569118691" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/personal-injury-lawyer-keywords-cost-per-click.jpg" alt="personal injury law firm keyword costs" width="556" height="666" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>However, these numbers become a little less surprising when you consider that in many cities you can’t turn on a television for more than 30 minutes or walk down the street without seeing an ad for a personal injury lawyer. <strong>It’s an extremely competitive industry</strong>, thus the extremely high prices it can cost for just one click to a legal website. And this trend is not stopping anytime soon, due to high competition and the potentially large return a lawyer can get from just one click.</p>
<p>Simply put, personal injury law firm business models are unique. It’s important to understand the basics of how they operate before planning for a <a href="https://localiq.com/industries/professional-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal marketing campaign</a>. So let’s take a quick look at how these firms work and what makes them so unique (lawyers and those familiar with the industry – feel free to skip this next section).</p>
<h2>How Personal Injury Law Firms Work</h2>
<p>To use an overly basic story to illustrate, Joey was in an accident that wasn’t his fault. Now he needs to get his car fixed, has medical bills to pay for his injured shoulder, and is missing work while he is healing. Meanwhile he begins receiving phone calls from the insurance company saying they will be willing to pay him for only half of what his medical bills cost.</p>
<p>Before working in this industry, I was naive to the fact that similar scenarios happen quite frequently to those who have been injured in an accident. So Joey’s 3 options are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take the money the insurance company offered</li>
<li>Negotiate with the insurance companies himself to get reimbursed for all of his expenses from the accident</li>
<li>Hire a personal injury lawyer to do the negotiating and other work for him</li>
</ol>
<p>What does Joey decide to do? Who cares, I know you’re only here for marketing tips and not my terrible made up stories. Which we’ll get to after one more area I feel is very important to discuss: how PI lawyers charge for their services.</p>
<h2>How personal injury lawyers charge their clients</h2>
<p>Most injury lawyers work on a contingency fee basis (but not the terrible lawyer Lionel Hutz from The Simpsons, seen changing his fee structure below). A contingency fee is simply a percentage of what the final settlement is, and in most states law firms’ fees average around 33%.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="053b0985-efe3-490f-a62e-0a51df360a83" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/personal-injury-lawyers-simpsons.jpg" alt="advertising for personal injury law firms" width="800" height="206" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>The larger the settlement, the more income is generated for the law firm. Pretty straightforward, right? So why am I painting this long drawn-out picture of the industry? Besides the obvious, <strong>I’m trying to demonstrate why it can be so difficult to find an ROI for legal marketing campaigns</strong>. Every case is different and income is percentage-based. It’s all variable. And it can take years for a case to settle and receive the revenue that your pay-per-click (PPC) campaign generated years ago.</p>
<p>When you throw in the fact that case value is largely determined by insurance limits for both parties, now you have an analytical marketer’s nightmare. But this also presents the opportunity for high returns if you can figure out how to outsmart competitors in your market.</p>
<p>With that being said, let’s look at some legal digital marketing tips and tricks that I use for use for my personal injury lawyer clients.</p>
<h2>My 8 Best Marketing Strategies for Personal Injury Lawyer Law Firms</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s everything I&#8217;ve learned from working with personal injury law firms to ensure they achieve ROI from their ad spend.</p>
<h3>1.) Forget ROI – Set “Cost Per Case” Goals</h3>
<p>You might be surprised by the uncomfortable look I get from some lawyers when I ask what their desired Cost Per Case (CPCase) is. In their defense, it can be a tough question to answer because a legal case could be worth $2,000 or millions of dollars. The practice area also plays a large role because an attorney specializing in car accidents may only want to pay $500 per case, while a Mesothelioma attorney may be willing to pay $100,000 per case.</p>
<p>CPCase is a great way to set expectations for yourself and the firm. If you don’t currently know what your firm’s desired CPCase is, drop everything and start with this. Even if it is a loose number, it will guide your marketing decisions and significantly decreases the importance of not being able to calculate immediate ROI. For those who don’t know how to come to this number or who can’t get an answer from the law firm, I suggest the following steps:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Find the firm’s average case settlement value from the past 2 years. <em>(Advanced: To exclude outlier data, you can use the </em><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/TRIMMEAN-function-d90c9878-a119-4746-88fa-63d988f511d3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>TRIMMEAN</em></a><em> function in Excel. Be careful with the percentage of outliers you use – you don’t want to shave too much off.)</em></li>
<li>Take your average case settlement and multiply by 10%, 20%, and 30% to get three possible CPCase numbers.</li>
<li>Take these three numbers to the owner or partners and show them how you arrived at the CPCase. They should then make the business decision whether they are willing to spend 10%, 20%, or 30% of the average case on marketing (or anywhere in-between). That is a business decision that is different for every firm, so I unfortunately can’t give insight on what is right for your firm.</li>
</ol>
<h3>2.) Track, Track, Track</h3>
<p>Now that you have a target Cost per Case, it’s time to make sure you are tracking every lead you can. Let’s start with the easy tracking first – website submissions and online chats. These are pretty simple to set up conversion tracking in Google Analytics. If you aren’t sure how, here is a guide from Google on <a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/6095821">setting up conversion tracking</a>.</p>
<p>But law firms tend to be most focused on driving phone calls, so I always add phone call tracking to client websites and landing pages. The image below from Wordstream demonstrates how call tracking works. You can read more about it <a href="/adwords-call-tracking">here</a>.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="02cf2dfa-370e-42db-b5a1-d9a8f9e144ce" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adwords-call-tracking-diagram.jpg" alt="Third Party PPC tools WordStream Advisor Call Tracking" width="1253" height="756" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Here are four call tracking services that I’ve used in the past to help with campaigns (no affiliation to any):</p>
<h4><a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/6095882?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Call Tracking</a></h4>
<p>Pros: Integrates great with Google Ads (formerly known as AdWords). And it’s free!</p>
<p>Cons: Very little data about the call. Doesn’t show full phone number that called. Only integrates with Google Ads Campaigns</p>
<h4><a href="http://marketing.wordstream.com/wordstream-call-tracking">WordStream Call Tracking</a></h4>
<p>Pros: Shares detailed information about phone call. Works on a keyword level.</p>
<p>Cons: Limited to PPC. Have to already be using WordStream software.</p>
<h4><a href="https://www.calltrackingmetrics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call Tracking Metrics</a></h4>
<p>Pros: Extremely detailed call data. Dynamically changes number on website depending on source of website visitor.</p>
<p>Cons: More expensive than some of the others.</p>
<h4><a href="https://www.callrail.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CallRail</a></h4>
<p>Pros: Dynamically changes number on website depending on visitor. A little less expensive than others.</p>
<p>Cons: Not as many options as some of the other call tracking services.</p>
<p>I’m sure there are plenty of others out there that can do what these can, so what is most important is finding software you feel comfortable implementing and using.</p>
<h3>3.) Bid on Your Brand Name on Google</h3>
<p>If you’re reading WordStream, I’m sure you know what PPC is (and if not, you sure are in the right place to learn). As confusing and technical as PPC can be, the easiest and best investment you can make is bidding on your own brand name. Average <a href="/cost-per-click">costs per click</a> on a brand name ranges anywhere from $.50 to $3.</p>
<p>Now the first question that probably comes to mind is, “Why would I spend money on brand searches if I already show in organic?” Great questions and here is the number one reason:</p>
<p><strong>Brand protection.</strong> If you aren’t bidding on your brand name, your competitors might, and that will mean the first thing a user sees is your competitor’s message and not yours. Do you want the people trying to steal your clients to have the power of being seen first? I wouldn’t. Here is an example of this in the wild. If Shopify wasn’t bidding on their brand name, look at the second ad, which would otherwise be the first result on the page with a message of “Don’t Waste your Time and Money.” That’d be bad news.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="abe073bf-b06a-4386-8369-ca07b2a33eef" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-ads-for-brand-protection.jpg" alt="bidding on your own brand term in google" width="700" height="380" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>There are additional benefits to advertising on your brand terms, like being able to control the message put in front of potential clients. If you are relying on organic results you are letting Google choose what they show a potential client. I don’t know about you, but I would much rather talk about my firm as opposed to letting Google choose how to do it.</p>
<p>Brand bidding is relatively cheap in the grand scheme when you consider the value you get for it. You’ve worked hard to build up a brand name, make sure you protect it!</p>
<h2>4.) Make Friends with Mobile</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="81e751b4-3a01-4f14-bed4-32edf598c515" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/mobile-friendly-test-for-pi-lawyers.jpg" alt="mobile friendly test" width="748" height="414" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>More than 50% of all searches are from a mobile device. That shouldn’t be news to you; just think about how often you reach into your pocket or purse to Google something that is on your mind (sorry Bing). The mobile trend is no longer a trend, but a necessity for many businesses.</p>
<p>Users are 5x more likely to leave a site that is not mobile friendly. “Mobile Friendly” here means a completely functional responsive site design, as opposed to a site that just has a different URL on mobile. Having a fast page is important, too: a 10-second page load time has a 123% higher bounce rate than a 1-second page load time.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to make sure your website is ready in this mobile-first world:</p>
<ol>
<li>This one’s obvious – make sure your website is responsive or at the very least is usable on a mobile device. If it’s not, sorry, you need a better website.</li>
<li>To double-check that your site is mobile ready, go to this URL to make sure you have Google’s mobile friendly approval: <a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Mobile Friendly Test</a>. This tool will give you detailed insights as to why your page is or is not mobile friendly.</li>
<li>Check your speed. <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visit this page to test your mobile page speed</a>. If your number is in the red, follow the instructions to get your speed back up in the green. Some suggestions such as image optimization or cache issues are as simple as downloading a few WordPress plugins.</li>
</ol>
<h3>5.) Use Ad Extensions to Dominate Search Results</h3>
<p>Ad Extensions are features search advertising platforms give as options to enhance your ads. When used, they can both improve your ad performance as well as give you an advantage over the competition. The image below points out a couple of the common ones:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="9f8eb8d7-7c73-4488-a4a1-37896ecb2d4e" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adwords-ad-extensions-for-personal-injury-lawyers.jpg" alt="personal injury law firm adwords" width="700" height="483" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sitelinks </strong>(“client testimonial” link shown above): additional website links that allow you to send users to different areas of your site</li>
<li><strong>Call extensions</strong>: adding a phone number to your ad. These calls can also be tracked as conversions in your performance metrics.</li>
<li><strong>Location extensions</strong>: adds your business address pulled from Google My Business</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of other extensions, but these are the most common ones for localized businesses like law.</p>
<p>So why use ad extensions?</p>
<ol>
<li>The use of ad extensions has shown to increase ad performance because it gives your potential clients more options and drives them further down the lead funnel. On average, use of ad extensions lifts click-through rate by 10-15%. More clicks can mean more opportunities for clients.</li>
<li>The more extensions you show the more search real estate your ad takes up. In competitive spaces like law, driving a competitor down the page can make a big difference in the long run. In some cases, Google Ads even <a href="/blog/ws/2016/04/08/ad-format-impact-on-ad-rank">ranks you higher in results</a> if you include ad extensions, because they view this as a better experience for users.</li>
</ol>
<p>Implement ad extensions today to drive more clicks and calls to your business.</p>
<h3>6.) Test Google Ads Call-Only Campaigns (But Be Careful…)</h3>
<p>Years ago I was interviewed in a <a href="/blog/ws/2015/06/29/law-firm-marketing">WordStream article about PPC for lawyers</a> where I was raving about call-only campaigns using call extensions on PPC ads. They were very cheap and very successful for us. Times change, Google changes, and I’ve unfortunately had a change of heart towards my love of call-only campaigns for personal injury law firms.</p>
<p>Here’s the issue with call-only campaigns – if someone clicks your ad you are then charged just like any other click on AdWords. But a click does not mean a phone call, a click means that the phone number popped up on the user’s phone (as shown below).</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="64b7fb28-e9c6-46cc-8013-f95393da949d" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Depending on the market, I’ve seen clicks turn into phone calls at percentages that range anywhere between 30-80%. Whether the user accidentally clicked the ad, didn’t realize it was an ad to make a phone call, or any other scenario that leads to clicking “Cancel” rather than “Call”, the cost per conversion can add up quickly.</p>
<p>My suggestion: test. Call-Only ads tend to work better if a firm has an old website that doesn’t help anyone, thus leading to people not calling. However, for firms who have websites and landing pages that are helpful to readers on the page, regular ads can result in lower costs and more leads.</p>
<h3>7.) Get More Google Reviews</h3>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="cf9e1a68-65e7-46f9-b09d-eddbba7be898" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/personal-injury-law-firm-reviews.jpg" alt="law firm marketing reviews" width="800" height="649" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>If you’re choosing from the list of law firms above (I intentionally blurred out their names because I didn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings…) who would you choose? #3, because you want to give the underdog a shot? I wouldn’t, nor would most consumers.</p>
<p>In an industry where trust is so extremely important, Google reviews are a great way to show the world how great your business truly is. A simple reminder to clients about your appreciation of them sharing their experience on Google can be the difference between Law Firm #2 and Law Firm #3.</p>
<p>There are many review sites that you could also focus on, including <a href="https://www.yelp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yelp</a>, <a href="http://www.avvo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avvo</a>, <a href="http://lawyers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lawyers.com</a>, and <a href="https://www.martindale.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Martindale-Hubbell</a> to name a few. Regardless of what site you are focusing on, what you really need to do is <strong>create a company culture of not being afraid to remind clients that you would love to read online how their experience was working with your firm</strong>. If they share their experience online it not only helps your firm learn, but it also helps educate others who have been in the unfortunate situation your client was in. Be polite, don’t be shy, and get some more reviews!</p>
<h3>8.) Take Better Advantage of Ad Spend with Facebook Retargeting</h3>
<p>Very rarely in the digital world do people see one solution to their problem and sign up on the spot. Consumers search around, click a variety of ads, investigate a number of sites, and read reviews before making a purchasing decisions.</p>
<p>Law firm lead cycles are no different. To get the most out of your digital presence you need to stay in front of your audience. One of the most effective and efficient ways for doing this is <a href="/blog/ws/2015/11/16/facebook-remarketing">retargeting on Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>Why retargeting?</p>
<p>Retargeting is the most effective and efficient way to stay in front of your potential clients for a couple reasons:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>There is no one more qualified as a lead than a someone who has already visited your site, meaning they’ve shown interest in your firm in the past. Staying in front of these users can lift your website conversion rate by as much as 50% by bringing these qualified people back to the site.</li>
<li>As mentioned above, some ad clicks for law-related searches cost as much as $950. Retargeting clicks on the other hand average about $1.35 in the legal space on Facebook. Spending a few more dollars to bring that expensive first click back increases ad spend efficiency greatly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Why Facebook vs. other retargeting? Two reasons:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2017/01/05/social-media-marketing-statistics">People spend more time on Facebook than any other website</a>. On average people spend 20-40 minutes per day on Facebook and visit the social network 14 times per day. Point being once someone leaves your site they are likely to be on Facebook. You want to be where your potential clients are, reminding them of your firm.</li>
</ol>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="7da39aa5-5729-43e2-989a-8bf61cc2902c" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-users-vs-other-social-networks1.png" alt="facebook users versus users of other social netoworks" width="738" height="415" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The click-through rate on Facebook ads compared to traditional display ads can be as much as double, meaning the likelihood of bringing clients back to your site is much higher than other ad types.</li>
</ol>
<p>Start retargeting on Facebook and watch your cost per case start to drop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Publishers publish. They don’t necessarily promote.</p>
<p>They might “distribute” (heavy on the air quotes).</p>
<p>But…to where? Borders?</p>
<p>Oh that’s right. They don’t exist anymore. And good luck finding a Barnes &amp; Noble or any other needle-moving retail chain out there.</p>
<p>You want a bestseller? The fact is, you’re gonna have to roll up your sleeves and <em>make</em> it a bestseller. And you can do that by thinking like a smart marketer.</p>
<p>The time to think about promoting your book is before it comes out. Here’s how to do it, with book promotion lessons learned from bestselling authors who’ve taken matters into their own hands.</p>
<h2>1. The Old Guards are Gone. Here’s What to Do Instead</h2>
<p>Steven Pressfield, acclaimed author of <em>The Legend of Bagger Vance</em> (among many others), also wrote a book for first-time authors looking to hit it big.</p>
<p>The title? <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nobody-Wants-Read-Your-Sh-ebook/dp/B01GZ1TJBI"><em>Nobody Wants to Read Your Sh*t</em></a>.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-promote-a-book-nobody-wants-to-read-your-shit.png" alt="How to promote a book Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit Pressman" width="345" height="503" /></div>
<p>I’m sure your book is fantastic. But I’m going to go out on a limb and say it’s not going to get the Oprah’s Book Club sticker.</p>
<p>But that’s ok. You don’t need her. You don’t need Oprah. (I know you’re reading this Oprah, so just go with me on this).</p>
<p>What used to be the norm for book promotion isn’t anymore. Instead, a targeted, niche approach will see more results than a traditional “throw it at the wall and see what sticks” campaign.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Education-Millionaires-Everything-College-Successful-ebook/dp/B0052RDJFE/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1493410379&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+education+of+millionaires">Michael Ellsberg</a> learned this firsthand after trying out the old ways first:</p>
<ul>
<li>Radio interviews</li>
<li>National media</li>
<li>And an email blast to a miniscule list</li>
</ul>
<p>Even after all this, his book didn’t break the 1,000 rank marker on Amazon.</p>
<p>But then his <em>4-Hour Work Week</em> buddy, Tim Ferriss, came along.</p>
<p>Tim wrote up a blog post featuring Ellsberg and recommending it highly. Within an hour, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelellsberg/2012/01/11/the-tim-ferriss-effect/#6edc8072363e">the book reached 45 on Amazon</a>. It even hit #1 in the Job Hunting and Career Guides section on the site.</p>
<p>In the weeks to follow, Ellsberg tried to capitalize on the increased attention, continuing to do traditional press. Nothing, though, was ever able to give him another boost like Ferriss’s post.</p>
<p>So why did one simple blog post perform better than weeks of tireless promotion?</p>
<h2>2. Solo Author Blogs Benefit from the ‘Halo Effect’</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect">Halo Effect</a> is a real thing.</p>
<p>It’s a cognitive bias that explains why some people (or brands or products) are seen as more credible, smarter, or more attractive than their peers. That’s why Apple gets the benefit of the doubt over Microsoft. Or Samsung, Google, and any of their other competitors for that matter.</p>
<p>The Halo Effect commonly applies to people with devoted followings, too. Like crazy televangelists. And Oprah.</p>
<p>The “<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oprah-effect.asp">Oprah Effect</a>” was coined because if she featured you on her show, you became an overnight sensation.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-promote-a-book-oprah-frey-book-sales.png" alt="How to promote a book James Frey Million Little Pieces sales figures Oprah trade paperback edition" width="555" height="254" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Nielsen sales data for James Frey’s heavily embellished memoir, ‘A Million Little Pieces’ in both<br />
hardcover and Oprah Trade Paperback editions</em></p>
<p>Popular solo-author blogs cultivate the same devotion. Even if their numbers pale in comparison.</p>
<p>One reason is convenience. Get featured on the biggest radio show (I literally cannot name one), and someone still needs to wait until they get home or to the office to remember to look you up.</p>
<p>Online, you’re just a link away. So there’s no delay. Less friction between the devoted reader and the Amazon One-Click to Purchase button.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-promote-a-book-amazon-one-click.png" alt="How to promote a book Amazon One Click button" width="350" height="241" /></div>
<p>Ferriss has spent years cultivating a following. So when he recommended Michael Ellsberg’s work, it translated into intense action. (More so than anything CNN or the New York Times was able to generate).</p>
<p>Because Ferriss was appealing to a tight-knit group that was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)"><em>primed</em></a> and engaged.</p>
<p><a href="https://janefriedman.com/use-guest-blogging-promote-book/">Online marketer Beth Hayden agrees</a>, and even goes one step further. If you don’t have a Tim Ferriss type to write for you (and not everyone does), connect with blogs with an audience that looks just like yours. This gives you a chance to claim your status as an expert in your book’s topic and puts your book in front of the right people.</p>
<p>Do a little digging and research high-traffic blogs in your book’s niche. Hayden suggests coming up with a few topic ideas that would connect well with the blog’s readers, and then email the blogger to pitch a guest submission.</p>
<h2>3. Your Title Is a Headline. So Test It</h2>
<p>In Tom Hanks’ 1996 cult hit <em>That Thing You Do</em>, the fledgling band the “Oneders” are taken under the wing of Hanks’ character, record-label exec Mr. White. Mr. White eventually gives them a fresh look and image, but first deals with the most pressing issue: the band’s baffling name.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-promote-a-book-that-thing-you-do-trimmed.jpg" alt="How to promote a book Tom Hanks That Thing You Do" width="1500" height="1076" /></div>
<p>“Next, this ‘Oneders,’ with the O-N-E, it doesn&#8217;t work. It&#8217;s confusing. From now on, you boys&#8217;ll just be simply, The Wonders,” White said.</p>
<p>“As in, I wonder what happened to the O&#8217;Needers?” quipped bandmate Kenny.</p>
<p>Why am I telling you all this? First, because you should see the movie—it’s great.</p>
<p>But, second, because no one cares about, or understands, your obscure or kitschy title. When it comes to marketing your book, picking a bad title can be catastrophic.</p>
<p>Instead, <a href="/blog/ws/2017/05/17/how-to-write-great-headlines">think of book titles as an ad or article headline</a>. Because they, like book titles, are often the single biggest determinant of who sees your finished work. <a href="/blog/ws/2015/02/02/ppc-ad-headlines">A great headline</a> entices people to read what’s inside.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-promote-a-book-childrens-book-parody.jpg" alt="How to promote a book children's book parody" width="1318" height="1600" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Masterful.</em></p>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2017/03/09/ogilvy-advertising">Ogilvy once said</a>, “<em>On the average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy. When you have written your headline, you have spent eighty cents out of your dollar.</em>”</p>
<p>Some headlines will routinely work better than others. That’s why you do things like use <a href="/blog/ws/2017/02/13/power-words-ad-writing">power words</a> and <a href="/blog/ws/2016/12/19/adwords-headline-formulas">headline formulas</a> online to boost your chances of success.</p>
<p>The point is that even book titles should be tested in order to determine what works best, and what should eventually appear on that book cover. A simple Google AdWords test can give you some insight into what your potential reader wants to see. <a href="http://thulme.com/2010/10/64-the-4-hour-workweek-escape-9-5-live-anywhere-and-join-the-new-rich/">AdWords made all the difference</a> for Tim Ferriss.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-promote-a-book-tim-ferriss-4-hour-workweek.jpg" alt="How to promote a book Tim Ferriss 4 Hour Work Week" width="1000" height="665" /></div>
<p>For a quick $200, Ferriss tested six different title and subtitle combinations using AdWords and creating text ads for the titles, monitoring the <a href="/click-through-rate">click-through rates</a> for each.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357">The 4-Hour Work Week</a>” emerged from what could have been “Broadband and White Sand” or “Millionaire Chameleon.” The winning title and subtitle combo were not even his first choice, proving how important it is to test the market first (instead of relying solely on your own intuition, or worse, your publisher’s).</p>
<h2>4. Go to Where Your Most Devoted Target Audience Is</h2>
<p>When Lewis Howes of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1623365961/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1623365961&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=lewhow07-20&amp;linkId=55LKTZNPWBNBKYNA"><em>The School of Greatness</em></a> fame set out to market his book, he knew he needed to identify his audience and then go to every one of their favorite corners of the internet.</p>
<p>He outlined the interests of his readers, their professions, where they lived, and even their age – basically he defined a <a href="/blog/ws/2015/09/23/buyer-personas">customer persona</a>. From there, he designed a plan tailored to their interests.</p>
<p>He then <a href="https://sumo.com/stories/lewis-howes-book-promotion-plan">created content</a> based on themes and ideas from his book, but more digestible for the format. In other words, he <a href="/blog/ws/2015/02/03/repurposing-content">repurposed his content</a> so that it could expand into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scannable blog posts</li>
<li>Pithy social updates</li>
<li>Short videos for Instagram and Snapchat</li>
<li>Interviews on related <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/goal-talk">podcasts</a></li>
<li>And longer-form clips for YouTube that still stay on message and on brand for the book</li>
</ul>
<p>James Altucher turned to Reddit when promoting his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Choose-Yourself-James-Altucher/dp/1490313370"><em>Choose Yourself</em></a>. He <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/">hosted an AMA (ask me anything) conversation</a> with the help of marketing agency <a href="http://brasscheck.net/">Brasscheck</a>, and ended up with <strong>3,200 </strong>comments and questions between him and interested readers.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-promote-a-book-stephen-king-reddit-ama.png" alt="How to promote a book Stephen King Reddit AMA" width="462" height="209" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>One of the more memorable moments from </em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gqzn2/i_am_stephen_king_novelist_executive_producer_on/">Stephen King’s Reddit AMA</a><br />
<em>from several years ago.</em></p>
<p>“The ability to put a link on the page where people are seeing you talk about your product is really powerful,” said <a href="https://blog.markgrowth.com/how-authors-use-reddit-to-promote-their-books-1a64b0880578">Mignon Fogarty, creator of Grammar Girl and Reddit user</a>.</p>
<p>“It’s much easier to get people to take action online than it is on radio or TV where they have to take that extra step to go to their computer or phone to find the address or page. I really like doing things online where you can provide links to what you’re talking about. It’s very effective.”</p>
<h2>5. Incentivize the Action You Want People to Take</h2>
<p>Years ago, there was the videotape.</p>
<p>You know, that big, blocky, black thing that would literally have film coiled up inside.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-promote-a-book-blockbuster-ruins.jpg" alt="How to promote a book Blockbuster Video store ruins overgrown" width="1280" height="720" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>You find yourself in a small clearing, in which the ruins of a once-great civilization<br />
are being slowly reclaimed by the vegetation that surrounds them…</em></p>
<p>Then DVDs started appearing. Not only was the quality superior. But the storage capacity was too.</p>
<p>So in order to actually raise the price, DVDs started offering extra bonus material or footage to those who decided on the more expensive purchase.</p>
<p>In other words, consumers were <em>incentivized</em> to spend a few more dollars than they were used to.</p>
<p>James Altucher did a good job going to where his audience was in order to promote his book. But then he took it one step further with a too-good-to-be-true incentive.</p>
<p>Altucher created a special Slideshare to promote his latest book (to business people).</p>
<p>On Slideshare, authors can upload their own PowerPoint presentations and visitors to the site can search for slide decks by keyword or topic. Good presentations should be full of pictures and exclusive snippets from the book.</p>
<p>Altucher did all of that. But then at the very end, he included a call to action, promising the reader <em>their money back</em> if they could prove they bought and read the book.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-promote-a-book-slideshare-presentation.png" alt="How to promote a book Slideshare presentation" width="662" height="617" /></div>
<p>In other words, he was creating his own echo-chamber, <em>incentivizing</em> people to leave reviews (that would only help to expose others to his work) and further cultivating the relationship with his audience.</p>
<h2>6. Establish Your Own Halo Effect By Recording an Audiobook</h2>
<p>Initially, a professional voice actress was going to perform Geraldine DeRuiter’s memoir.</p>
<p>Geraldine was a first-time author. And this was like “standard procedure.”</p>
<p>However, Geraldine didn’t like the idea. She’d spent years building a loyal audience at her blog <a href="http://www.everywhereist.com/">The Everywhereist</a>. The story was personal. And so she wanted the performance for listeners to be personal, too.</p>
<p>Recording your own audiobook is like the equivalent of someone having a conversation with you for ~10 hours during their commutes.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-promote-a-book-audiobooks.jpg" alt="How to promote a book audiobook concept" width="1024" height="481" /></div>
<p>That was no small hurdle, though. She had to convince her agent. Who then had to convince her publisher, Hachette. When they relented, it took another <a href="http://www.everywhereist.com/whats-it-like-to-record-your-own-audiobook/">18-23 hours</a> of studio recording time.</p>
<p>But it was worth it.</p>
<p>In the first three quarters of 2016, audiobook sales have continued to climb by <a href="http://www.talkingnewmedia.com/2017/02/24/aap-print-and-audiobook-sales-revenue-increase-through-first-3-quarters-of-2016-but-ebook-sales-by-member-publishers-falls-18-7/">nearly 30 percent</a>.</p>
<p>And with everyone carrying around a portable library in their pocket (thank you iPhone!), audiobooks are becoming more the norm. In fact, The Wall Street Journal recently called audiobooks the “<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/best-selling-audiobooks-amazon-2016-7">fastest growing format in publishing</a>.”</p>
<p>Even <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Claudia-Azula/Posts/THE-28-POINT-ULTIMATE-CHEAT-SHEET-ON-HOW-TO-SELF-PUBLISH-A-BEST-SELLER-BOOK">Altucher saw a 500% profit</a> on his initial investment to record an audiobook.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-promote-a-book-book-sales-by-format.png" alt="How to promote a book book sales by format 2015 to 2016" width="684" height="367" /></div>
<p>Recording your own audiobook is a powerfully simple way to establish your expertise in your field. Your reader is not just seeing your words, but hearing them come out of your mouth. It’s like listening to a good friend give you advice or tell you an interesting story.</p>
<p>Is this thing on? Get recording!</p>

<h2>7. Sell Your Writing Better with through a Visual Book Trailer</h2>
<p>Tim Ferriss had dabbled with book trailers in the past.</p>
<p>But for the release of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005NJU8PA/">The Four Hour Chef</a>, he had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgaQv0frGFk">two</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzyvvkiUIKY">professional</a> trailers created with the help of an ad agency.</p>

<p>The extra expense was worth it in the end, generating <a href="http://www.tubefilter.com/2012/11/19/tim-ferriss-book-trailer-youtube-4-hour-chef/">1.5 million and 550 thousand views respectively</a>. Here’s what Tim had to say about the process:</p>
<p>“The [previous] book trailers were all fairly dry and they were relatively low budget; maybe there was some sort of Animoto type text being used. I wanted to make a book trailer that from a cinematic standpoint looked just like a movie trailer.”</p>
<p>Tim pointed to the success of other cooking-related online properties, like <a href="http://www.epicmealtime.com/">Epic Meal Time</a> (and their three million subscribers), as evidence of these “micro communities” that are rabid online.</p>
<p>Joanna Penn, of The Creative Penn, sees <a href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2015/03/02/book-trailers/">five obvious benefits of book trailers</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Videos are popular</li>
<li>They are easy to share</li>
<li>They help the reader get to know you</li>
<li>They keep your book fresh in the reader’s head</li>
<li>They can be easy to make and don’t require further investment.</li>
</ol>
<p>You don’t necessarily need a Michael Bay Transformers-level budget to create a quality trailer. <a href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2011/01/07/how-to-create-a-book-trailer/">Write the script for the video</a> and pick the photos you want to include. If you’ll be featured on screen, come up with a good location or backdrop for filming. Wistia has everything you need to <a href="https://wistia.com/library/diy-office-video-studio">create a DIY studio</a>.</p>

<p>And if your production skills aren’t Oscar-caliber just yet, there are <a href="https://thewritelife.com/free-apps-for-book-trailer/">lots of apps and programs out there</a> that take the guesswork out of the final product.</p>
<p>Finally, make sure people actually see your book trailer! You can <a href="/blog/ws/2016/04/25/facebook-video-ads">promote your video through platforms like Facebook</a>.</p>
<h2>8. Get as Many Reviews as Possible</h2>
<p>You’ve found who’s gonna read your book. You’ve found who they follow (and who will tell them to read your book). And you’ve found where they find out about your books.</p>
<p>Now, find the people who’re gonna <em>talk</em> about your book.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em>Classic Amazon reviews</em></p>
<p>A Dimensional Research study found that <a href="https://www.orderhive.com/impact-of-reviews-and-ratings-for-sellers-on-amazon/">90% of those surveyed consider positive</a> reviews when making a purchasing decision. And the more reviews you have, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/penny-c-sansevieri/how-to-get-more-reviews-o_b_4551985.html">the higher your book goes</a> in the Amazon search rankings. So play the algorithm-game and get as many stars as humanly possible.</p>
<p>Start with the low-hanging fruit.</p>
<p>You should have advance copies at the ready (whether galley editions or simple digital copies) for readers from previous books or publications.</p>
<p>From there, <a href="http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2012/09/16/get-amazon-book-reviews/">connect with Amazon’s top reviewers</a>. Their reviews are highly-valued and can be the push that your book needs. Top reviewers are public domain on Amazon, and you can search for those who write reviews in your book’s topic or genre. Milena Canizares of <a href="https://blurb.com/">Blurb.com</a> suggests <a href="http://www.blurb.com/blog/how-get-reviews-amazon-once-you-have-launched-your-book/">coming up with a list of 100 or more</a> in hopes of walking away with 25 or so reviews.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-promote-a-book-amazon-reviews.jpg" alt="How to promote a book Amazon reviews" width="400" height="271" /></div>
<p>Explore outside of Amazon, too, to connect with book bloggers who would be willing to read and review your book. You can search a nerdy SEO tool like <a href="https://followerwonk.com/">Followerwonk</a> to find niche-specific bloggers on Twitter.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-promote-a-book-followerwonk.jpg" alt="How to promote a book Followerwonk" width="655" height="411" /></div>
<p>And <a href="http://www.blogmetrics.org/books">Blogmetrics.com will rank bloggers</a>, so you can prioritize which ones will come with the most cachet and biggest following.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Where-Hell-Tesla-Novel-Dircks-ebook/dp/B00U05YSCQ"><em>Where the Hell is Tesla</em></a> author Rob Dirks used this method to help sell 10,000 copies of his book. By his own account, <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/279385">no one knew he was</a>, and yet he was able to self-publish and sell lots of books. On his publish day, he had already lined up 25 reviews to be live on Amazon. He gave free books to reviewers and reaped the rewards of credibility of having others confirm his book’s quality.</p>
<h2>See Your Name on the Bestseller List</h2>
<p>Authors can’t afford to write anymore.</p>
<p>Literally.</p>
<p>Instead, the promotion-monkey is now falling squarely on the backs of authors themselves. And because of your already jam-packed schedule (of you know, actually writing the damn book in the first place), you need a viable, repeatable promotion system.</p>
<p>Start by recognizing the ramifications. And how you’ll need to find the new influencers, like solo author blogs within your niche, who’ll promote your book to those that matter most.</p>
<p>You can also take a cue from mainstream digital marketing campaigns, like testing your headlines, repurposing content for different formats (even video), and then incentivizing them to leave reviews that will help bring in brand new people in the future.</p>
<p>It’s not easy. It takes time and tons of effort. But it also means that the ultimate success of your soon-to-be bestseller is entirely within your own control.</p>
