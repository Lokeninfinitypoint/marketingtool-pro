										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Instagram is one of the most powerful social media platforms in the game right now. It has over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 billion</a> monthly active users, and that number will likely continue to climb year over year. But with so many active users scrolling through their feeds at all hours of the day, how in the world can a small business stand out with organic posts alone?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where Instagram advertising comes into play. It allows you to focus on the right people, at the right time, with the right message and imagery. Instagram ads tell visual stories through various formats, and many advertisers have seen this channel yielding higher ROI in comparison to their other advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>In this walkthrough, you’ll learn everything you need to know to get started with an Instagram advertising campaign.</p>

<h2>What is Instagram advertising?</h2>
<p>Instagram advertising is a method of paying to post sponsored content on Meta’s Instagram platform to reach a larger and more targeted audience. While there are many reasons a business or individual may decide to advertise, Instagram ads are often used to grow brand exposure, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drive website traffic</a>, generate new leads, and move current leads down the funnel (and hopefully towards conversion).</p>
<p>Since Instagram is such a visual platform, you’ll need a single image or video, or a set of images and videos, paired with a caption and a call-to-action (CTA) button to reach your audience with Instagram ads.</p>

<h2>Why advertise on Instagram?</h2>
<p>Consider these Instagram advertising statistics and facts when evaluating whether this strategy is right for your business.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instagram users spend about <a href="https://backlinko.com/instagram-users" target="_blank" rel="noopener">34 minutes</a> daily and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1294879/time-spent-instagram-app-selected-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 hours</a> monthly on the app on average.</li>
<li>Instagram is the <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/instagram-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most popular</a> platform for product discovery, with <a href="https://business.instagram.com/getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60%</a> of people saying they discover new products on Instagram. <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29%</a> of Instagram users make purchases directly from the platform.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1284484/social-media-platforms-highest-return-on-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29%</a> of businesses say Instagram yields them the highest <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-roi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing ROI</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/instagram-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">44%</a> of social media users wished that brands used Instagram more often (higher than any other network).</li>

<li><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-marketing-trends-report-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">74%</a> of businesses use Instagram for marketing and advertising in 2025, which is up from 2024’s number of 63%.</li>

<div id="types-of-instagram-ads"></div>
<h2>Types of Instagram ads</h2>
<p>Now that you know Instagram ads would be a slam-dunk strategy for your business, let’s explore the types of Instagram ads you could start taking advantage of.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Image or video ads:</strong> Ads that use a single image or video up to 60 seconds long, along with a CTA button and caption, to promote your offer.</li>
<li><strong>Carousel ads: </strong>Ads that compile multiple images and videos into slides viewers can scroll through. Although organic carousel posts can be up to 20 slides, carousel ads have a limit of 10 slides.</li>
<li><strong>Reels: </strong>Short-form video ads that take up the user’s full screen as they scroll through the Reels tab or Explore page on Instagram. These can be up to 15 minutes long, but typically, the best performing Reels are anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes long.</li>
<li><strong>Story ads: </strong>Ads on <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/instagram-story-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram Stories</a> can include images and videos and take up a user&#8217;s full screen as they scroll through the Stories section of the app. Organic Stories only stay up for 24 hours, but you can re-run Story ad campaigns for longer periods of time. Instagram Story video ads can only be 15 seconds max unless you are using the carousel format. With Instagram Story video carousel ads, you can select up to 10 cards with a maximum of 120 seconds of video content.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-types.webp" alt="instagram ads - types of instagram ads chart" width="900" height="800" class="aligncenter wp-image-95280 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-types.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-types-480x427.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>All Instagram ad formats include a CTA button, and you can include captions, hashtags, and more in your ad content. Every ad will appear with an automatically added “Sponsored” text when shown in user feeds, like you see at the bottom of this example Story ad below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-story-example.webp" alt="instagram ads - example instagram story ad" width="340" height="650" class="aligncenter wp-image-95282 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-story-example.webp 340w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-story-example-157x300.webp 157w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /></p>
<p>Users can perform a few different actions once they see your ad. For instance, most ad formats allow people to like, share, comment, or replay your content, and they all have the ability to click your added links or CTA buttons.</p>
<p>With that comes tons of different metrics you could track within your Instagram campaigns, so check out this resource on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-media-audit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to audit your social media performance</a> to see which interactions on your ads might matter most for your business.</p>
<div id="how-to-run-instagram-ads"></div>
<h2>How to run Instagram ads</h2>
<p>Ready to run Instagram ads for your business? Follow these seven steps.</p>
<h3>1. Get your Meta Business Suite and Instagram accounts set up</h3>
<p>Instagram ads are configured directly on the Meta Ads Manager, which you can access and sync with your Instagram account via the Meta Business Suite. So, first, you’ll need both those accounts set up.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-create-a-new-instagram-account/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Instagram account</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Navigate to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instagram.com</a> directly and follow the prompts to create an account. Alternatively, you could download the Instagram app and sign up that way. Just be sure that you switch your new account to a professional account.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-professional-account.webp" alt="instagram marketing - professional account option" width="276" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94268 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-professional-account.webp 276w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-professional-account-138x300.webp 138w" sizes="(max-width: 276px) 100vw, 276px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meta Business Suite: </strong>You’ll access the Meta Ads Manager and connect your Instagram account through the Meta Business Suite. You can get your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-advertise-on-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">account set up on Meta Business Suite</a> via <a href="https://business.facebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://business.facebook.com/</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-create-account.webp" alt="instagram ads - meta business suite" width="843" height="650" class="aligncenter wp-image-95283 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-create-account.webp 843w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-create-account-480x370.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 843px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Note that you can boost organic Instagram posts and manage your Instagram ads directly from the Instagram app itself, too. Professional accounts will have access to <strong>professional tools</strong>, such as <strong>ad tools</strong>, under the <strong>creator tools </strong>menu, shown at the bottom of this screenshot here.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-professional-tools.webp" alt="instagram ads - professional creator tools menu screenshot" width="299" height="650" class="aligncenter wp-image-95281 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-professional-tools.webp 299w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-professional-tools-138x300.webp 138w" sizes="(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px" /></p>
<p>The steps we’ll continue to walk through will be creating your Instagram ads campaign from the Meta platform, which can be easier (and typically more popular) if you’re running ads on both Facebook and Instagram, or using a desktop to dig into all aspects of your ads.</p>
<h3>2. Create your campaign and select its objective</h3>
<p>Since you run your Instagram ads through Meta, it’ll basically feel like you’re creating a Facebook campaign until you select your Instagram page and placements in your ad set to turn your build into an Instagram-only strategy.</p>
<p>Click the green<strong> +Create</strong> button to create a new Meta Ads campaign and choose your campaign goal. Luckily, the goals are named in a self-explanatory manner. Need more traffic? Select the traffic objective. Looking to increase brand awareness? Choose the awareness objective. You get the gist.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-creating-new-campaign.webp" alt="instagram ads - create an instagram campaign" width="950" height="378" class="aligncenter wp-image-95284 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-creating-new-campaign.webp 950w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-creating-new-campaign-480x191.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 950px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>3. Configure your target audience</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve selected your objective, you need to target the appropriate audience to get your ads in front of the right people. This is the true beauty of Instagram ads since you’ll be using Facebook’s depth of demographic knowledge to reach the right people.</p>
<p>If you’ve done this for Facebook ads before, you likely already have several audiences built and are quite familiar with the process. If you’re new to this process, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-targeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here’s a run-down of your targeting options</a>, which you can layer to get a precisely targeted audience. (For instance, if you want to target women, in New York, between the ages of 19 and 65, who are interested in yoga and health food, you can do just that!)</p>
<h3>4. Choose your placements</h3>
<p>Now that you’re targeting your ideal demographic, it’s time to choose your placements! <strong>This is a critical step to only show ads on Instagram</strong>. If you choose to ignore this step, Facebook will allow your ads to appear on both platforms.</p>
<p>This isn’t necessarily a negative thing, but if you have content that you’ve created specifically for Instagram, you’ll have to opt into <strong>manual placements</strong> under the <strong>audience controls</strong> portion of the <strong>placements </strong>settings within your ad set.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-placements.webp" alt="instagram ads - manual placements" width="865" height="1021" class="aligncenter wp-image-95285 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-placements.webp 865w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-placements-480x567.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 865px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>5. Set your budget</h3>
<p>If you are familiar with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-budget" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how budgets work through Google Ads</a> or other digital advertising platforms, this step should feel familiar. If not, don’t fret; while you might not know exactly where to set your daily or lifetime budget when running your first Instagram ad campaign, this comes with trial and error, as well as experience. And the good thing is you have the control to pause or stop your campaign at any time if you feel your budget is not being properly allocated.</p>
<p>However, to start, check out <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ads-benchmarks-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">industry benchmarks</a>, like the example below, to see what you can expect for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ads-cost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average costs across Facebook and Instagram ads</a>.</p>

<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Download our free </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/facebook-benchmarks?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2025FBAdsBenchmarks_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Facebook Ads Benchmarks report</strong></a> to estimate average costs for ads in your industry across the Meta platform!</p>
<h3>6. Create and publish your Instagram Ad</h3>
<p>Now it is time to create your Instagram ad!</p>
<p>Hopefully, after taking the steps above, you already have some content in mind for the ad you are looking to promote. This part of the setup may look different depending upon your campaign objective, but you’ll always have a few ad format options to choose from, so don’t be afraid to test a few different ad variations.</p>
<h3>7. Measure your Instagram campaign performance</h3>
<p>Once you start advertising on Instagram, you’ll want to track your progress regularly to be sure you’re pacing towards your goals. You could rely on the campaign dashboard within Meta Ads, third-party tools, or Instagram insights to see how your ads are impacting your business growth.</p>

<h2>6 #winning Instagram ads tips</h2>
<p>Once your Instagram advertising campaigns are up and running, keep these tips in mind.</p>
<h3>1. Be careful using Advantage+</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advantage+</a> is a suite of AI-powered automated solutions you can apply to your Meta campaigns. You won’t be able to use certain <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-vs-manual-settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advantage+ features</a>, like Advantage+ placements, to have a true Instagram-only campaign. However, Advantage+ options could still be helpful when drafting your Instagram ad creative.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-advantage-plus-ad-catalog.webp" alt="instagram ads - advantage plus ad catalog option screenshot" width="704" height="393" class="aligncenter wp-image-95279 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-advantage-plus-ad-catalog.webp 704w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/instagram-ads-advantage-plus-ad-catalog-480x268.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 704px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>2. Reinforce your brand in your Instagram ad creative</h3>
<p>When it comes to using images in your Instagram ads, incorporate the essence of your brand by using your brand guidelines, such as the colors, fonts, and your logo, so it is recognizable to your target audience. Use bright colors so that these visual features can stand out amidst the white or black background of the app.</p>
<p>If you are using a carousel with images, organize them with a common theme, such as a summer line of shoes, your best sellers, or have them tell a story in a linear fashion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-carousel-ads-copy.jpg" alt="Instagram carousel ad with bowl of food" width="327" height="432" class="aligncenter wp-image-11350 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-carousel-ads-copy.jpg 327w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-carousel-ads-copy-227x300.jpg 227w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-carousel-ads-copy-76x100.jpg 76w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-carousel-ads-copy-151x200.jpg 151w" sizes="(max-width: 327px) 100vw, 327px" /></p>
<p>Here’s a cheat sheet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use your brand guidelines (colors, fonts, logo).</li>
<li>Make sure your ad copy complements your images.</li>
<li>Keep a strong focal point using your logo or another element of your brand.</li>
<li>Organize carousel ads by theme or a linear storyline.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Create easy-to-digest video ads</h3>
<p>Instagram users love video—so much so that Instagram Stories seem to be engaged with more these days than in-feed posts, as <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/instagram-stories-statistics/#gref" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70% </a>of users view them daily. While static images can and do perform well in the various Instagram ad placements, video posts, Reels, and Stories are where it’s at. It’s a quick and easily digestible content format, and you don’t necessarily need high-end equipment or hire more staff to be able to create successful video ad content.</p>
<p>In most cases, you’ll want to create video ads that are 60 seconds or shorter. While that&#8217;s the max duration for a standard Instagram video ad, people tend to drop off after viewing the first 10 seconds, regardless of how interesting, entertaining, or helpful it is. While of course, a fraction do watch the entire video, it’s important to show your brand, logo, product, or service in those first 10 seconds so people clearly understand who you are and what you are advertising. Don’t leave it until the end of your video to show your product, as it’ll be too late to possibly capture more people engaging and taking action.</p>
<p>With any ad placement, if you are using video, make sure to also add captions. Many people view Instagram content on mute, and we also want to make sure our content is accessible to anyone who may be hearing impaired. You can easily do so right through Meta Ads Manager at the ad level when you are selecting your video creative.</p>
<p>If you opt to have Meta scan your video and provide captions, just be sure to review them and edit as needed; sometimes the system can miscaption words if they aren’t clear, if you have an unusual brand name or it has a unique spelling, or if you have someone speaking with an accent on your video.</p>

<h3>4. Use testimonials and UGC for relatable ads that feel organic</h3>
<p>People enjoy looking at people and giving them an image that they can relate to, be inspired by, or yearn to be more like; it naturally boosts views, clicks, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization-marketing">conversions</a>. The more organic you can make it feel to the platform, the less it will stick out like an advertisement, and people will feel more inclined to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/user-generated-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Using user-generated content (UGC)</a> and appending testimonials, especially in retargeting campaigns, is a win. Pair them up to put a face with a real testimonial, and you are bound to increase your conversion rates.</p>
<p>Using images that your customers share is not only as authentic as you can get, but this type of content will also typically get better engagement since most people enjoy having brands share their content. Another benefit? It makes your brand look real and trustworthy, so it can help manage expectations for prospective customers.</p>

<h3>5. Be mindful of your Instagram placement options</h3>
<p>Currently, you can advertise in the Instagram Feed, Instagram Stories, and the Instagram Explore tab. However, you’ll likely find that certain ad formats or offers work best on one placement type versus another. You may need to test and customize your ad placements according to your different ad sets.</p>
<h3>6. Use polls in Instagram Story ads</h3>
<p>Instagram Stories ads with interactive polls are an excellent way to catch your target audience’s attention with your ads and to get them into your funnel.</p>
<p>If you want to use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/04/instagram-story-ads-polls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram Story ads polls</a> for added engagement, you’ll first have to be sure to select the Instagram Stories placement only. If you select any additional placements in the ad set level, then this feature will not be available at the ad level.</p>

<h2>Factors that influence the cost of Facebook ads</h2>
<p>Just like <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/08/instagram-ads-cost">Instagram ads costs</a>, Facebook ad costs are influenced by a number of variables.</p>
<h3>1. Campaign objectives</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-objectives">Facebook campaign objectives</a> are a prominent factor in pricing since they relate to the value of the desired goal and where in the funnel your users are.</p>
<p>For example, Awareness or Engagement campaigns will cost less than lower-funnel campaigns like Sales that drive purchases. It’s easier to get someone to engage with an ad than it is to entice them to click through, open up their wallet, and complete a purchase.</p>
<h3>2. Audience size</h3>
<p>Facebook ads targeting larger and broader audiences will generally cost less than for smaller audiences.</p>
<p>You will typically see lower costs in prospecting, upper-funnel, cold-audience campaigns compared to retargeting, lower-funnel, warmer-audience campaigns, because the audiences of the latter tend to be more specific, smaller in size, and therefore more <a href="/blog/ws/2017/04/27/how-to-compete-in-facebook-ads">competitive</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/facebook-ads-trends-audience-size-indicator.jpg" alt="how much does facebook cost - audience size indicator" width="520" height="349" class="aligncenter wp-image-79160 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/facebook-ads-trends-audience-size-indicator.jpg 520w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/facebook-ads-trends-audience-size-indicator-480x322.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 520px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>3. Daily budget</h3>
<p>If your daily budget is on the lower end, it may take longer for Facebook&#8217;s algorithm to exit the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-learning-phase">learning phase</a>. For this reason, costs for new ad sets are often higher upfront while the system understands how your audience behaves with your ads and how to optimize them for the highest engagement. If your ads are well-engaged with, Facebook and Instagram will reward you with lower costs over time.</p>
<h3><span>4. Bidding strategy</span></h3>
<p><span>Similarly, the way you instruct Facebook to spend your ad budget affects how much your ads cost. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/31/facebook-ads-bidding-strategies">Facebook bidding strategies</a> include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span></span><span>Highest volume (formerly lowest cost)</span><span></span></li>
<li>Highest value</li>
<li>Cost per result (formerly cost cap)</li>
<li>ROAS goal (formerly minimum ROAS)</li>
<li>Bid cap</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Click-through rate</h3>
<p>Click-through rate (CTR) can also play a role in your Facebook ad costs. If CTR is low, especially in a website traffic campaign, you may then see higher costs as Facebook understands that there may be some disconnect between your target audience and the <a href="/blog/ws/2016/06/29/best-facebook-ads">messaging in your ads</a>.</p>
<p>A healthy Facebook CTR is about 1-3%. More often than not, the higher your CTR climbs, the lower your CPCs will be.</p>
<h3>6. Industry</h3>
<p>As you saw in our benchmarks above, Facebook costs vary by industry, which also includes varying click-through rates. Your market and industry will play a big role in what to expect in terms of your Meta Ads costs. For instance, the chart below indicates pretty big differences between CTRs across various industries, which could indicate how more or less competitive your vertical may be.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-fb-benchmarks-leads-ctr-846x1024.webp" alt="2025 fb benchmarks - 2025 leads click-through rate" width="846" height="1024" class="aligncenter wp-image-93930 size-large" /></p>
<h3>7. Seasonality</h3>
<p>Historically speaking, in the latter part of Q3 and Q4, costs tend to temporarily increase as the advertising landscape changes for the <a href="/blog/ws/2019/08/08/holiday-marketing-tips">holiday ecommerce season</a>. Competition ramps up as brands increase their budgets and gain more impression share, thus increasing costs for all advertising brands.</p>
<p>Keep seasonality in mind as you budget for the year. If you aren’t in ecommerce or running promotions during the end of the year, you may want to strategize on whether to keep a presence or to scale back.</p>
<div id="lower"></div>
<h2>How to lower Facebook ad costs</h2>
<p>There are a number of ways to lower your Facebook ad costs, but here are some of our favorite strategies.</p>
<h3>1. Create a full-funnel strategy</h3>
<p>To use your budget wisely and set yourself up to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/08/how-to-scale-facebook-ads">scale your Facebook ads</a>, choose funnel-appropriate campaign objectives. In general, Awareness and Consideration campaigns are suited for the top of the funnel; Consideration and Conversion campaigns align with the middle of the funnel, and Conversion campaigns are best for <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/01/bottom-funnel-conversions">bottom-funnel conversions</a>.</p>
<p>In short, begin with upper-funnel campaigns to reach more people in your target audience at a lower cost, and then move your way toward conversion campaigns that optimize for your purchase-driving conversion events.</p>
<p>You can learn how to create a <a href="/blog/ws/2019/02/21/facebook-funnel">full-funnel Facebook advertising strategy here</a>.</p>
<p>Note that some brands can certainly run a Sales campaign targeting upper-funnel audiences with lower-priced products or something that may make for a good impulse buy.</p>
<p>People can and do <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/13/facebook-ecommerce-tips">make purchases</a> upon first interaction with a brand on Facebook, however, most will need more touch points from a brand so you can gain their trust, showcase your benefits, and entice them to convert.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Want more Facebook ads tips like these?</strong> Download our free guide to the top <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLFBFundamentals.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FacebookFundamentals_Download">seven fundamental Facebook advertising tips</a> every advertiser should know.</p>
<h3>2. Broaden your audience</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, audience size impacts how much Facebook ads cost. So while you want to keep your targeting narrow, you should strive to make those targeted audiences as large as possible. This has become trickier as a result of privacy measures, but we&#8217;ve got some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/11/facebook-advertising-strategies">recommended Facebook ad strategies</a> to help you out with that.</p>
<h3>3. Check audience overlap</h3>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s audience overlap tool can be instrumental in saving money. Let’s say you have one ad targeting an audience of people interested in startups and another ad for people interested in entrepreneurship. You have different<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/07/facebook-ad-copy-examples"> Facebook ad copy</a> and creative to appeal to these different audiences. However, the overlap tool shows you that half of the startup audience overlaps with the entrepreneurship audience. Knowing this, you can use exclusions so those ads don’t overlap. Otherwise, you’d lose money bidding against yourself.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ad-costs-audience-overlap-tool.png" alt="" width="800" height="403" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18248" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ad-costs-audience-overlap-tool.png 800w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ad-costs-audience-overlap-tool-480x242.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>4. Use bid caps</h3>
<p>This is the manual bidding <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-tactics">strategy in Facebook ads</a>, where you can set a maximum bid instead of allowing Facebook to dynamically bid based on your goals. But this should be used with caution. It’s for advertisers who have a solid understanding of the conversion rate and profit margin and require regular maintenance. If you set your bid cap too low, Facebook might have a hard time spending all of your budget.</p>
<h3>5. Use the Pixel AND the Facebook Conversions API</h3>
<p>The goal of both of these pieces of technology is for you to track your ad performance. With visibility into what’s working and what’s not, you can allocate budget accordingly. You can also gain insights about the people viewing your ads, which you can use to further optimize your campaigns and maximize your budget.</p>
<p>The Facebook Pixel is still a thing, but it is losing its power since it’s cookie-based and cookies are crumbling. The Facebook Conversions API does not rely on cookies, but it doesn’t pick up the same exact information as the pixel. So, using the two together will ensure you capture the most accurate data. You can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/06/facebook-conversions-api">learn how to use the Facebook Conversions API here</a>.</p>

<h3>6. Run Facebook A/B testing</h3>
<p>You can also help lower your costs at the ad level by <a href="/blog/ws/2021/05/11/facebook-ab-testing">A/B testing</a> variables in your ads—one at a time—to better understand what is and is not working well. Test out the text, <a href="/blog/ws/2018/08/28/facebook-ad-headlines">headline</a>, images and/or videos, landing pages, and more.</p>
<p>Facebook is not the set-it-and-forget type of platform, so it is best to continuously test and aim for better results. Running tests at the ad level can help improve your engagement rates and CTR and stretch your budget further. Check out our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/23/facebook-ad-examples">Facebook ad examples</a> to get ideas and inspiration.</p>
<h3>7. Try Meta Advantage+</h3>
<p>Over the last couple of years, Facebook ads has rolled out <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-plus">Advantage+</a> settings that allow Facebook&#8217;s machine learning to automate campaign audience and placement targeting, ad creative, and more. These settings, which you choose to opt into, are easy to use and can be a timesaver for advertisers looking to scale more quickly. However, just know that there will be a trade-off of manual control with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Advantage Plus</a>, so be sure to keep a close eye on your campaign behavior and any AI-powered assets to maintain consistent performance.</p>

<h2>What makes Facebook Ads worth the price?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/02/reasons-to-advertise-on-social-media">Advertising on social media</a> in general has its benefits, but let&#8217;s finish off with some of the money-saving advantages Facebook has over other platforms like Pinterest, LinkedIn, and Instagram.</p>
<h3>Facebook is still the most popular social media platform</h3>
<p>With over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3 billion active users</a> worldwide, Facebook currently ranks as the largest and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">most popular social media platform</a> in the world. This is compared to other front-runners like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok.</p>
<h3>&#8230;and the most widely used</h3>
<p>Facebook has the most even distribution of users compared to other popular social media platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn—which means you can target a larger range of age groups with your ads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/facebook-ads-cost-2021-facebook-even-age-distribution_0.png" alt="age distribution for facebook vs instagram and linkedin" width="720" height="196" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<h3>Precise targeting means higher ROI</h3>
<p>Precise targeting means reduced Facebook ad costs. If you want to target someone in a 15-mile radius of a particular address or zip code, you can do that. If you want to reach parents with children 3-5 years old who love ice cream, you can do that, too. And we haven&#8217;t even touched lookalike and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/27/facebook-custom-audiences">custom audiences</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/facebook-ads-cost-2021-targeting-example.png" alt="facebook ad targeting example" typeof="foaf:Image" width="620" height="376" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/facebook-targeting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Though we have faced some targeting limitations as a result of Apple iOS updates, Facebook still remains one of the best PPC channels for targeted advertising. This does require changes, however, so be sure to visit our guide to Facebook ad targeting.</p>
<h3>You have flexibility with budgeting</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="/blog/ws/2019/02/19/facebook-ads-daily-vs-lifetime-budgets">Facebook offers two types of budgeting</a> to accommodate different advertising strategies. Lifetime budgets, which are good if you run ads on a schedule and/or a fixed budget and end date; and daily budgets, which are good for maximizing ongoing campaigns and pacing and planning around a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/stretch-your-marketing-budget">fluctuating budget</a>. You can also use the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/audience-overlap-tool">Audience Overlap Tool</a> to save money.</p>
<h3>It&#8217;s affordable</h3>
<p>Facebook ads are among <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/30/cost-effective-ad-types">the most cost-effective </a>ad types for any business, whether it spends $10 a day or thousands. With testing, <a href="/blog/ws/2018/09/04/facebook-retargeting">retargeting</a>, and reporting capabilities, you have the tools to make the most of every dollar you spend.</p>
<p>For context, the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-google-ads-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> average cost per click in Google Ads</a> is higher than Facebook&#8217;s at $5.26. So, while you still want to hit all<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/26/marketing-channels" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> marketing channels</a>, including search advertising, Facebook ads can help fill any gaps in your strategy at a lower and more stable cost.</p>

<h2>What is Instagram marketing?</h2>
<p>Instagram marketing is the practice of using the social media platform, Instagram, to grow your business through tactics like organic (a.k.a. free) posts, Reels, Stories, follower interactions, account partnerships and more.</p>
<p>Instagram has different feeds available that allow users to browse and discover image and video content, which is how your customers can connect with your business on the app.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-example-home-feed.webp" alt="instagram marketing - home feed" width="297" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94273 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-example-home-feed.webp 297w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-example-home-feed-149x300.webp 149w" sizes="(max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px" /></p>

<h3>What’s the difference between Instagram marketing and Instagram advertising?</h3>
<p>Instagram marketing includes all your free, organic efforts on Instagram.</p>
<p>Instagram advertising is done through the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-advertise-on-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Ads platform</a> and requires campaign budgets to pay for your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/08/instagram-ads-cost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ad placements across the Instagram network</a>. That said, though, <strong>you can always “boost” a single organic Instagram post with a smaller, one-time budget</strong>—which can be done directly from the Instagram platform.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-ad.webp" alt="instagram marketing - ad example" width="284" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94278 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-ad.webp 284w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-ad-142x300.webp 142w" sizes="(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Unlike organic Instagram posts, Instagram Ads and boosted posts will have a “sponsored” line as well as a CTA button attached to them, like </em><a href="https://www.creatopy.com/blog/instagram-ads-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>the above example</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>While Instagram marketing might still require some budget to really take off, it’s generally cheaper than Instagram advertising—making it a no-brainer for every business type out there.</p>
<p>However,<strong> Instagram advertising allows you to tap into more audiences </strong>that might not necessarily be following your business but are more likely to convert into customers. That’s why <strong>it’s best to use a combination of both Instagram marketing and advertising</strong> to maximize your brand’s success on the platform.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/instagram-advertising" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learn more about Instagram advertising</a> here, but for this post, we’ll be focusing on Instagram marketing. After all, your Instagram ads will be more impactful if you have your Instagram marketing solidified first.</p>

<div id="instagram-marketing-benefits"></div>
<h2>Why market on Instagram?</h2>
<p>Marketing on Instagram is a low-cost option for growth that any business can take advantage of. Aside from that, though, there are tons of other benefits to Instagram marketing. Consider these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/20/instagram-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram facts and statistics</a>.</p>
<h3>Instagram holds a captive audience</h3>
<p>Instagram has a captive audience ready to pay attention to your business’s marketing. In fact, users spend about <a href="https://backlinko.com/instagram-users" target="_blank" rel="noopener">34 minutes</a> daily and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1294879/time-spent-instagram-app-selected-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 hours</a> monthly on Instagram on average—which is part of the reason why Instagram marketing is such a popular strategy.</p>
<p><span>Instagram users like to interact with businesses </span></p>
<p>Did you know that <a href="https://business.instagram.com/getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20%</a> of Instagram users visit a business profile every single day? <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/social-media-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90%</a> of Instagram users follow at least one business on the platform. Not only that, but <a href="https://business.instagram.com/getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">33%</a> of the most popular Instagram stories are shared by business accounts.</p>
<p>Instagram isn’t just favored for brand discovery, either, as you can use the platform to address <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-pain-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer pain points</a> and improve the overall customer experience your business provides. In fact, <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/instagram-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">72%</a> of Gen Z consumers are most likely to use Instagram for customer service over any other platform.</p>
<h3>Instagram users are ready to convert</h3>
<p>Instagram is the <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/instagram-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most popular</a> platform for product discovery, with <a href="https://business.instagram.com/getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60%</a> of people saying they discover new products on Instagram. <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29%</a> of Instagram users make purchases directly from the platform, and <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">36%</a> of people say they use Instagram as a search tool like they would Google (although you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-posts-indexed-on-google">optimize your Instagram posts for Google Search</a>, too).</p>
<p>Needless to say, Instagram users are ready to convert. <a href="https://www.businessdasher.com/instagram-statistics-for-business/#:~:text=87%25%20of%20Instagram%20users%20say,23%25%20more%20engagement%20than%20Facebook." target="_blank" rel="noopener">87%</a> of Instagram users take action, like visiting a website or making a purchase, after seeing a business’s Instagram post.</p>
<h3>Your competitors are likely already marketing on Instagram</h3>
<p>Odds are, your competitors are already finding success on Instagram. After all, Instagram is the third <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most popular</a> social platform and the fourth most visited site in the world. Over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/259379/social-media-platforms-used-by-marketers-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80%</a> of small businesses market their brand on Instagram, and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1284484/social-media-platforms-highest-return-on-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29%</a> of businesses say Instagram yields them the highest <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-roi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing ROI</a>.</p>

<div id="instagram-marketing-types"></div>
<h2>Types of Instagram posts</h2>
<p>There are a few types of Instagram posts your business can use to market to potential customers. Let’s review:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard Instagram image posts: </strong>The original Instagram post type, which requires an image in order to be published.</li>
<li><strong>Instagram Reels: </strong>A short-form video post type that can be up to 3 minutes long.</li>
<li><strong>Carousel posts:</strong> This post type can be a combination of up to 20 different images and videos in a row that viewers can swipe through.</li>
<li><strong>Stories: </strong>Stories are a temporary style of an image or video post that only stays up for 24 hours. They are accessible by clicking on an account’s profile picture. However, note that you can also <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/instagram-highlight-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">save a story as a “highlight”</a> that stays at the top of your page. Or, you can go live on your story, too, and save any live footage as a story later. Check out some <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/instagram-story-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram story ideas</a> here.</li>
</ul>
<p>All Instagram post types allow you to add a caption, hashtags, music, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-add-location-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">location</a>, stickers, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-tag-someone-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">user tags</a>, and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-post-types.webp" alt="instagram marketing - types of instagram posts" width="885" height="775" class="aligncenter wp-image-94258 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-post-types.webp 885w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-post-types-480x420.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 885px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Where can your Instagram posts show up?</h3>
<p>All your Instagram posts (no matter the format) will be shown in your followers’ home feeds, which will look like the example we saw above.</p>
<p>Your business’s posts and Reels can also appear on the Instagram explore page, where people can view your content regardless of whether they follow you or not.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-explore-page.webp" alt="instagram marketing - explore page screenshot" width="277" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94274 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-explore-page.webp 277w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-explore-page-139x300.webp 139w" sizes="(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://about.instagram.com/features/reels" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Your Reels can also be viewed by both followers and non-followers in the Reels tab. The Reels tab is where users can scroll through Reels similarly to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-reels.webp" alt="instagram marketing - reels page screenshot" width="337" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94279 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-reels.webp 337w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-reels-169x300.webp 169w" sizes="(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.socialpilot.co/blog/instagram-reels-algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>Instagram post sizes and specs</h3>
<p>With so many options and flexibility when it comes to Instagram post placements, the sizing and specs you should aim for when creating images and videos will vary. Here’s a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-media-image-sizes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breakdown of Instagram sizing</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instagram profile photo: 320 x 320 px</li>
<li>Instagram image posts: 1080 x 1440 px</li>
<li>Instagram landscape image posts: 1080 x 566 px</li>
<li>Instagram portrait image posts: 1080 x 1350 px</li>
<li>Instagram Stories and Reels: 1080 x 1920 px</li>
<li>Instagram Reel cover image size: 420 x 654 px</li>
</ul>
<p>As a bonus, if you want to plan out your profile tiles for a top-tier account aesthetic, try testing out how your images might look in the 161 x 161 px thumbnail size.</p>
<p>Note that there is also some flexibility with sizing on Instagram. For example, the Instagram profile picture minimum size is technically 110 x 110 px. Or, when creating a carousel post of image and video slides in different sizes, there’s a square button that allows you to opt to have the slides stay in their original sizes rather than being automatically cropped to the same size. Also, <span data-teams="true">Instagram image posts used to be square but they have since <a href="https://help.instagram.com/1631821640426723" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated the display size</a>, although you can still upload square images as long as they&#8217;re 1080 height. </span></p>
<p>Instagram also tends to compress images in posts that are uploaded in a larger file size than allowed, so try saving your Instagram content files in the most compact format possible without sacrificing quality. Read on for some tools to help with this.</p>

<p>Ready to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-drive-traffic-from-instagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jumpstart your business’s Instagram</a> marketing journey? Follow these six steps.</p>
<h3>1. Create your Instagram business account</h3>
<p>There are two ways you can <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-create-a-new-instagram-account/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create a new Instagram account</a>. The first option is navigating to <a href="https://www.instagram.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.instagram.com</a> directly and following the prompts to create an account. Alternatively, you could download the Instagram app and sign up that way.</p>
<p>For either of these two options, you could also sync your Facebook account to have your new Instagram account loaded up with your Facebook profile details. If you want to go this route, you’ll need an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-advertise-on-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">account set up on Meta</a> via <a href="https://business.facebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://business.facebook.com/</a>.</p>
<p>There’s no right or wrong account creation option, and they’re all equally popular, so it depends on what might be best for your Instagram marketing needs. For example, if your business is already well established on Facebook, it may be easiest to just sync your Facebook page. Or, maybe you’re launching a full Meta marketing strategy for a new brand, in which case you might want to get set up via the Meta Business Manager first.</p>
<p>Once you have your account, <strong>be sure it&#8217;s set as a business Instagram account </strong>by clicking the “edit profile” button at the top of your account’s page. Tap the <strong>switch to professional account</strong> prompt at the bottom of the edit profile page. From there, you can follow the prompts to select a category for your business, add contact details, and so on.</p>
<p>Here are some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/10/best-business-instagram-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">example Instagram business accounts</a> to get some ideas of how to arrange your own account.</p>

<h3>2. Decide what to track and set your goals</h3>
<p>Your Instagram marketing goals will help you determine what types of Instagram content you want to focus on, how much of your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing budget</a> will be put towards your strategy, and more. The SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and timely) goal structure can <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/instagram-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guide your Instagram</a> goal planning during this step.</p>
<p>You might also want to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ads-benchmarks-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out industry benchmarks</a> to see the average performance for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/01/instagram-analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">key Instagram metrics</a> in your industry.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some Instagram marketing metrics to consider including in your goals:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Likes: </strong>Total number of users who clicked the “heart” button on your post.</li>
<li><strong>Comments:</strong> Total number of users who commented on your post.</li>
<li><strong>Shares: </strong>Total number of times a user sent your post to other users via <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-dm-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram direct messages</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Saves:</strong> Total number of users who saved your content to their archives.</li>
<li><strong>Views:</strong> The number of times your post or reel was displayed on a user’s screen.</li>
<li><strong>Profile visits: </strong>Total number of times users visited your business’s Instagram profile.</li>
<li><strong>Reach:</strong> Total number of unique accounts that saw your Instagram content at least once.</li>
<li><strong>Follower count: </strong>The number of accounts that follow your business’s page. Ideally, you want more or roughly the same number of accounts to be following you as you follow, known as your <strong>follower ratio</strong>. This makes your brand appear more desirable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there are a ton of other actions and engagements you can track to measure your Instagram marketing results—don’t forget about end-goal conversions like website visits, sales, or leads. The point is to add a bit of structure to your strategy here.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-metrics.webp" alt="instagram marketing metrics chart" width="868" height="659" class="aligncenter wp-image-94259 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-metrics.webp 868w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-metrics-480x364.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 868px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>3. Identify your target audience</h3>
<p>Now that you know your big picture goals for your Instagram marketing strategy, you can start thinking about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-ad-targeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who you want to tailor your content to</a>. Check out some <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/target-market-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">target market examples</a>, and don’t be afraid to creep on your competitors’ or ideal customers’ follower and following lists. That way, you can get an idea of what types of users might see your Instagram content and how to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/27/brand-messaging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adjust your messaging</a> accordingly.</p>
<h3>4. Plan your posts</h3>
<p>Time to start brainstorming what to post when. A social media <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-calendar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing calendar</a> can come in handy during this step. You may need to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/always-on-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">factor in seasonality</a>, upcoming product launches, events, promotions, and sales to get your post ideation and planning off the ground.</p>

<h3>5. Create and publish your posts</h3>
<p>This is arguably the most fun step in the Instagram marketing process: executing on your posts! You can <strong>click the plus sign </strong>at the bottom center of your Instagram screen to start posting.</p>
<p>Instagram allows you to create posts ahead of time and save them as drafts, or you can use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/17/best-free-social-media-management-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third-party tools</a> and marketing partners to do the heavy lifting for you when it comes to post creation, scheduling and optimization.</p>
<h3>6. Track your performance</h3>
<p>As you continue to post and engage on Instagram to promote your business, you’ll need to keep a close eye on how everything is going. You’ll probably want to use third-party tools and marketing partners for complete Instagram reports, but the first place you should go during this step is directly into the <strong>dashboard</strong> of creator tools offered within the platform.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-creator-tools.webp" alt="instagram marketing -creator tools screenshot" width="304" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94255 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-creator-tools.webp 304w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-marketing-creator-tools-152x300.webp 152w" sizes="(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px" /></p>

<h2>Our top Instagram marketing tips</h2>
<p>Once you get up and running on Instagram, keep these tips in mind.</p>
<h3>Be active and engage with content</h3>
<p>A critical step in the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/instagram-marketing-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram marketing process</a> is interacting with your followers and the people you want to follow you.</p>
<p>If you’re already posting follow-worthy content, then start liking, commenting, and following others. For instance, search popular hashtags and like away! Write complimentary comments on people’s posts and repost from others to gain attention.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> You can opt to get notifications when accounts you’re targeting share a new post, so you can interact with it sooner rather than later.</p>
<h3>Test out different types of content</h3>
<p>You might find that certain post types resonate best with different audiences. Don’t be afraid to flex your content and test as needed. For example, Reels tend to <a href="https://www.socialinsider.io/blog/instagram-benchmarks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">double</a> your reach as opposed to standard posts. So, if you’re prioritizing reach, you could post more Reels instead of image posts.</p>
<h3>Set up an Instagram Shop</h3>
<p>For businesses promoting products, an Instagram Shop is a quick and easy way to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/15/selling-on-instagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sell on Instagram</a>. Users can click on your Instagram Shop to make purchases without having to leave the platform. You can learn more about Instagram Shops and how to set them up <a href="https://help.instagram.com/194353285783006/?helpref=breadcrumb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/introducing-shops-on-instagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<h3>Sync your Instagram strategy with other marketing channels</h3>
<p>Consider how your Instagram marketing could impact your other <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-channels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promotional channels</a>, and vice versa. For example, you’ll likely want to be promoting your business’s Instagram account across other placements like your website, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-youtube-channel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube channel</a>, and more. Additionally, always be thinking about how you can recycle other marketing materials into Instagram posts.</p>
<p>You should be striving to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/22/cross-channel-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provide a seamless cross-channel experience</a> for your potential customers, so be sure that whatever you’re posting on Instagram aligns with what you’re promoting elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Use hashtags carefully</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-use-hashtags-with-hashtag-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hashtags</a> can be a game-changer when you’re trying to get found on Instagram. However, there are some outdated hashtag practices you’ll want to avoid. It’s best to prioritize only the most popular or relevant hashtags in your post captions, as stuffing your captions with tons of custom hashtags is a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Not only that, but you might consider moving your hashtags down in your post caption so they’re not as apparent. Today, users are much more aware of how hashtags help businesses gain more traction on social media. Using them too prominently in your post captions could come off a bit “desperate” for views and likes.</p>
<h3>Try using AI</h3>
<p>There are a ton of different <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-prompts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ways you can use AI to optimize your Instagram</a> creative, brainstorm captions, and more. Whether you’re using the Meta AI features within the Instagram platform or trying out third-party AI tools, be sure to give any AI-generated content an extra edit manually to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/brand-consistency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maintain brand consistency</a> and credibility.</p>

<h2>What is the Facebook algorithm?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/08/facebook-marketing-ideas">Facebook</a> algorithm is a system that combines artificial intelligence and rules-based decision-making to determine which content users see when they scroll through their feed. The algorithm creates a personalized experience, attempting to expose the posts, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/22/instagram-reels-ideas-for-businesses">Reels</a>, and Stories each user is most likely to engage with.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-plumber-297x300.webp" alt="Facebook algorithm - Facebook post from a plumber." width="297" height="300" class="aligncenter wp-image-94107 size-medium" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The Facebook algorithm seeks to </em><em>share content</em><em> that its users will engage with, like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/r/1CFaXEmBuE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this tutorial</a> on fixing a sink that has over 5,000 likes.</em></p>
<p>The complex algorithm evaluates thousands of signals, including previous user interactions, content type, content publishers, and previous engagements, to set its recommendations.</p>
<p>It’s helpful to remember that, above all else, Facebook prioritizes <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/06/10/facebook-post-engagement">increasing user engagement</a>. So as its algorithm evolves, it’s mostly done to serve that goal.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>How much should your Facebook ads cost?</strong> Download <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/facebook-benchmarks?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2025FBAdsBenchmarks_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links">The 2025 Facebook Ads Benchmarks Report</a> to find out.</p>

<h2>How does the Facebook algorithm work?</h2>
<p>The Facebook algorithm works by ranking all <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/10/facebook-post-ideas">possible posts</a> you could potentially see and predicting which ones you’re most likely to find meaningful or engaging. It gathers signals and uses predictive models to rank content in your feed.</p>
<p>Every time you open the app, the algorithm has to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>What content can it show?</li>
<li>What does it know about the post?</li>
<li>How relevant will it be to the user?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at how the Facebook algorithm answers these questions.</p>
<h3>The four steps of ranking content</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/718033381901819?id=208060977200861" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The algorithm uses a four-step process</a> to fill your screen with unskippable images, text, and videos:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Review the inventory:</strong> Facebook collects and reviews the set of posts shared by your friends and from the pages you follow.</li>
<li><strong> </strong><strong>Consider the signals: </strong>Then, the algorithm considers hundreds of thousands of signals from the available inventory of posts. It looks at things you’d expect, like who posted the content and when it was posted, as well as more subtle signals like what time it is now and how fast the internet connection is.</li>
<li><strong>Predict how the content will be received:</strong> Here’s where the magic of Facebook&#8217;s over <a href="https://transparency.meta.com/features/ranking-and-content/#prediction-models-used-in-ranking-connected-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 prediction models</a> comes in. They assess all the information from the first two steps to make an educated guess at how likely you are to do things like watch a video to completion, comment on a Story, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Apply a relevancy score:</strong> Finally, the algorithm gives every piece of available content a score based on how relevant it is to you. The highest-scoring content lands in your feed first.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-lsu.webp" alt="Facebook algorithm - Facebook post from LSU" width="530" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94108 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-lsu.webp 530w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-lsu-480x543.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 530px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/16sCwdzdS2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Great content</em></a><em>, relevant to your audience, will make its way through Facebook’s selection process.</em></p>
<h3>Recommended vs. connected content</h3>
<p>The Facebook algorithm serves up two types of content: connected and recommended. The system strives to show you a mix of both, and there are nuances to how each is ranked.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connected content: </strong>These are posts from friends, accounts you’re following, and groups you’ve joined. Most of the posts you see fall in this category, and it’s chosen based on how you’re connected to the publisher and how you’ve interacted with similar content.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended content:</strong> This includes posts published by accounts you aren’t friends with or following, but that may have some relevance to you. Facebook recommends this content based on how you’ve interacted with similar content from similar publishers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Facebook content standards</h3>
<p>You can’t discuss the Facebook algorithm without mentioning the platform’s two sets of content standards. If you run afoul of these rules, no amount of relevance or connection will get your post past the algorithm’s filters.</p>
<p>Facebook’s <a href="https://transparency.meta.com/en-gb/policies/community-standards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Community Standards</a> are rules about what people can and can’t share on the platform. They cover areas like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Violence and criminal behavior:</strong> Threats, terrorism, organized crime, and the like.</li>
<li><strong>Safety:</strong> Think bullying, harassment, suicide, or self-injury content.</li>
<li><strong>Objectionable content:</strong> Includes hate speech, adult nudity, and sexual exploitation.</li>
<li><strong>Integrity and authenticity:</strong> This covers misinformation, fake accounts, spam, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Respecting intellectual property:</strong> Things like copyright and trademark rights are covered here.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1257205004624246/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recommendation Guidelines</a> are the rules that govern what content Facebook will <em>not</em> suggest to users in areas like Groups, Pages, Marketplace, or the main feed. Even if a post doesn’t break Community Standards, it may still be downranked or excluded from recommendations if it could create a poor or unsafe experience.</p>
<p>These guidelines restrict things like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Borderline content</strong>: Sensational, misleading, or low-quality posts.</li>
<li><strong>Sensitive topics</strong>: Health claims, political or civic content, and unverified information.</li>
<li><strong>Potentially unsafe or inappropriate material:</strong> Violence, sexually suggestive content, and spammy links.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Facebook algorithm vs. other social media algorithms</h3>
<p>Another way to contextualize how the Facebook algorithm works is to compare it to other popular social media sites. Here’s a quick rundown of their key differences:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook algorithm:</strong> It prioritizes meaningful interactions between friends, family, and groups. Its ranking factors lean heavily on relationship strength, type of content, engagement, and recency.</li>
<li><strong>TikTok algorithm:</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-algorithm">The TikTok algorithm</a> focuses on the discovery of new-to-you creators through its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/07/how-to-get-on-tiktok-fyp">For You Page</a> (FYP). Ranking factors center around previous interactions (watch times, likes, etc.), video information, and your device and account settings.</li>
<li><strong>Instagram algorithm:</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-algorithm">Instagram’s algorithm</a> takes a blended approach that balances both personal connections and trending, engaging content. Its ranking factors rely on relationship history, engagement signals, and relevance to your interests, among others.</li>
<li><strong>X (formerly Twitter) algorithm: </strong>Real-time conversations and trending topics are at the forefront of what X’s algorithm shares most. It ranks content heavily on recency, engagement, and personalization to the user.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/giveaway-ideas">Giveaways</a> like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/r/14Jofhu3Vgj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one</a> are a great way to juice the Facebook algorithm with engagement.</em></p>
<h3>User controls</h3>
<p>Even though the algorithm is always working in the background to order the content on your feed, you have considerable control over what it chooses to show you. Here are several of the most prominent user controls you can apply to influence the algo:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Favorites: </strong>You can mark certain friends or Pages as Favorites so their posts appear higher in your feed.</li>
<li><strong>Snooze:</strong> Temporarily hide posts from a person, Page, or Group for 30 days without unfriending or leaving.</li>
<li><strong>Unfollow:</strong> Stop seeing posts from someone entirely while still staying connected.</li>
<li><strong>Hide Post/See Fewer Like This: </strong>Tell the algorithm you don’t want to see similar content in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Feed Preferences:</strong> A settings hub where you can manage Favorites, Snooze, Unfollows, and reconnect with people/Pages to shape your feed experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Facebook algorithm updates and trends to know about</h2>
<p>If there’s one thing constant about Facebook’s algorithm, it’s change. Here are some trends to be conscious of as you post throughout 2025 and beyond.</p>
<h3>Prioritizing Reels</h3>
<p>Starting around 2023, Facebook began increasing the weight given to short-form video content. They started pushing Reels into feeds and recommendations. This was likely a response to the popularity of TikTok.</p>
<p>For brands, that means it’s time to experiment with some quirky, little, fun, and educational videos if you want to expand your Facebook reach.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-dentist.webp" alt="Facebook algorithm - Facebook post from a dentist." width="399" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94110 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-dentist.webp 399w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-dentist-200x300.webp 200w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/r/17GHc5F3CF/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Even dentists</em></a><em> can have some fun with Facebook Reels.</em></p>
<h3>AI-driven content recommendations</h3>
<p>Given <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-meta-ends-ai-200401578.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s big AI push</a>, it’s no surprise that Meta rolled out more AI-powered suggestions in the Feed, surfacing posts from outside your friend network if they’re predicted to be relevant.</p>
<p>Hyper-relevance for your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a> is the name of the game here. Learn their vernacular and pay attention to the content they react to. Use that insight to publish posts they’ll like and share.</p>
<h3>Clickbait and engagement bait downranking</h3>
<p>Meta is <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/04/cracking-down-spammy-content-facebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explicitly targeting</a> obviously spammy content and taking steps to lower its reach. That either means penalizing their content in the rankings or removing accounts that coordinate fake engagement posts.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-clickbait.webp" alt="Facebook algorithm - Facebook post example from Facebook." width="690" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94111 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-clickbait.webp 690w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-clickbait-480x417.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 690px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/04/cracking-down-spammy-content-facebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>It’s a good time to steer clear of spammy tactics. If you’re not sure whether what you’re about to publish is clickbait, ask yourself, “Will this genuinely help my target audience, or am I posting this strictly for engagement?”</p>

<h2>10 ways to work with the Facebook algorithm (with examples)</h2>
<p>Now that we understand how the Facebook algorithm prioritizes content, let’s look at 10 ways you can work with it to give your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/02/facebook-marketing-for-small-business">Facebook marketing</a> a big boost.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-tips-list.webp" alt="Facebook algorithm - list of Facebook algorithm tips." width="675" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94112 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-tips-list.webp 675w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-tips-list-480x427.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 675px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>1. Spark real conversations</h3>
<p>While this list of tips isn’t in any specific order, this one is probably the most important of the bunch. Facebook’s algorithm prioritizes engagement. Make sure some of your posts ask questions, start conversations, and poll people for their opinions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-engagement.webp" alt="Facebook algorithm - Real estate Facebook post." width="483" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94113 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-engagement.webp 483w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-engagement-480x596.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 483px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1AeJ8YD736/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Bonus: Want a fast and free focus group? Share a few options of a new product or design and see what your followers prefer (plus juice the algorithm with all that engagement!).</p>
<h3>2. Post consistently, not constantly</h3>
<p>While content recency is a Facebook ranking factor, you don’t want to overwhelm your audience. So create a consistent<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/24/editorial-calendar"> publishing calendar</a> so the algorithm has something new to share, but avoid over-publishing so it looks like you’re spamming.</p>
<p>There’s no hard and fast rule about how often to post on Facebook. Instead, think about your audience and plan seasonally. If you sell sunscreen, ramp up posts at the beginning of summer.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="👋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Not sure what to post?</strong> Get <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/social-media-calendar-template?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Template_MonthlySocialMediaCalendar_Download">Your Copy &amp; Paste Social Media Calendar</a> for a year’s worth of content ideas.</p>
<h3>3. Lean into video and Reels</h3>
<p>Facebook is boosting short-form, native, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/31/facebook-live-guide">live video</a> in feeds, so now’s a good time to publish that type of content, especially on Facebook Reels.</p>
<p>Beauty brand ColourPop regularly posts popular videos in a variety of formats.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-skincare.webp" alt="Facebook algorithm - Facebook post from colourpop." width="354" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94114 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-skincare.webp 354w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-skincare-177x300.webp 177w" sizes="(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/r/16VLWvgDXk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Copy the brand’s<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-media-strategy"> strategy</a> by posting some quick tutorials and product videos. Or try a funny “Day in the Life” clip to show what it’s like behind the scenes at your business.</p>
<h3>4. Write scroll-stopping intro hooks</h3>
<p>Facebook truncates long captions. To stop those thumbs from scrolling past your content (and showing the algorithm it’s worth promoting), put something thought-provoking and provocative in the first lines of your post.</p>
<p>Check out this post from the beverage brand Innocent.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-innocent.webp" alt="Facebook algorithm - Facebook post from Innocent." width="937" height="571" class="aligncenter wp-image-94115 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-innocent.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-innocent-480x293.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1G1BFFSQVg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Readers will see the first three items and want to click for the rest of the list. The top comment is the icing on the engagement cake, as it lets you know there is some really good content further down the post.</p>
<h3>5. Mix up your formats</h3>
<p>Variety is the spice of life. Keep your feed fresh by posting text, videos, images, and carousels. Not only will you give your audience something new to view, you’ll be able to test which content types work best.</p>
<p>For a little inspiration, scroll through Hype’s Facebook account.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-hype.webp" alt="Facebook algorithm - Facebook post from Hype." width="504" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94116 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-hype.webp 504w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-hype-480x571.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 504px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1FNq9ysiv7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>You’ll see some shoppable posts, image collages, Reels, and other content types. It gives people a reason to spend more time rummaging around the brand’s Facebook page.</p>
<h3>6. Reply fast and often</h3>
<p>We’ve established that the algorithm loves to share content that gets comments. You can quickly amplify the discussions on your posts by simply replying when someone comments.</p>
<p>Look at how this physical therapy office nearly doubled the number of comments in its post by continuing the conversation.</p>

<p>Engagement with your followers like this will also help you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/27/trust-signals">build trust</a>, a key factor when they decide who to buy from.</p>
<h3>7. Avoid clickbait content</h3>
<p>Social media users have become savvy to the trick some less-scrupulous businesses use to generate inauthentic engagement.</p>
<p>Facebook’s algorithm has too. If you try to fudge your way into people’s feeds, the system will flag your content as engagement bait and throttle your chances of greater placement.</p>
<p>Here are several ways to keep your content from being tagged as clickbait:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deliver what your post promises: </strong>If you say you’ll share four unique, unheard of ideas, don’t just list things everyone already knows.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid clickbait titles:</strong> Don’t use captions like “You won’t believe what happened next!” or “#5 will shock you!”</li>
<li><strong>Stay consistent with your brand:</strong> Don’t post about a topic just because it&#8217;s popular if it has nothing to do with your business or typical content.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t beg for reactions:</strong> Stay away from copy like “Like if you love pizza.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>8. Post at the right time</h3>
<ol start="8"></ol>
<p>Get a little early engagement boost by posting content when your audience is most likely to be online.</p>
<p>If you look at studies into the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/06/best-time-to-post-on-facebook">best time to post on Facebook</a>, you’ll see they mostly don’t agree.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-best-times.webp" alt="Facebook algorithm - Graphic if best times to post research." width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94118 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-best-times.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-best-times-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Your best bet is to take an educated guess based on your audience, then home in on it through trial and error.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to reach professionals in their 30s, you might post after the typical workday. But if your audience is active retirees, you could try a little earlier in the day.</p>
<h3>9. Be active in groups</h3>
<p>Content shared in<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/16/create-facebook-group"> Facebook groups</a> gets prioritized in feeds because it’s considered meaningful interactions with people you’re connected to. As a brand, you can leverage this ranking factor by becoming a regular participant in a relevant Facebook group.</p>
<p>Sometimes, customers will create a Facebook group to talk about your brand. That’s what happened for this travel trailer manufacturer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-camper.webp" alt="Facebook algorithm - Facebook post from Scamp Travel Trailers group." width="937" height="413" class="aligncenter wp-image-94119 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-camper.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-camper-480x212.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But even if that hasn’t happened, you can look for groups that tie into what you sell. For example, this brand could search for camping, travel trailer, or off-road adventure communities.</p>
<p>A word of caution. Don’t be overly salesy on any <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reddit-marketing">online forum</a>. Go in to be helpful, answer questions, and participate. Your educational posts will get an algorithm boost and you’ll grow an engaged, targeted audience.</p>
<h3>10. Track your analytics</h3>
<p>Facebook offers a robust dashboard of analytics you can track that’ll help you understand how the algorithm works for your brand.</p>
<p>For example, you can see which content type gets the most views and engagements. Then, use that data to inform your next campaign.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/facebook-algorithm-wordstream-analytics-300x101.webp" alt="Facebook algorithm - analytics dashboard." width="300" height="101" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-94120" /></p>
<p>All this data will tell you when, what, and where to share on Facebook for maximum reach.</p>
<div id="facebook-algorithm-faqs"></div>
<h2>Facebook algorithm FAQs</h2>
<p>We’ve covered a lot of ground. Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about the Facebook algorithm.</p>
<h3>How does the Facebook algorithm decide what I see?</h3>
<p>To decide which posts end up in your feed, Facebook looks at who posted, the type of content, how likely you are to interact, and how recent it is.</p>
<h3>How often does the Facebook algorithm change?</h3>
<p>Constantly. Meta makes small tweaks to its algorithms all the time, with major updates a few times a year.</p>
<h3>How can businesses beat the Facebook algorithm?</h3>
<p>You can’t “beat” the Facebook algorithm, and you shouldn’t try. Instead, work with the algorithm by posting a variety of engaging, high-quality content that your audience will find educational and entertaining.</p>
<h3>How can I reset my Facebook algorithm?</h3>
<p>You can’t fully reset your Facebook algorithm, but you can influence it by adjusting your feed settings like prioritizing friends, unfollowing pages, hitting the “Snooze” button on content you don’t want to see, and so on.</p>
<h3>Is the Facebook algorithm the same as Instagram’s?</h3>
<p>Facebook and Instagram’s algorithms are similar, but not identical. Both emphasize engagement, but Instagram relies more heavily on visual discovery and trending audio.</p>
<h3>What’s the best time to post on Facebook?</h3>
<p>The best time to post on Facebook depends on when your audience is most active on the platform, which you can find in your Facebook analytics dashboard and by tracking your content success.</p>
<h2>Learn how the Facebook algorithm works</h2>
<p>Too often, social media algorithms are portrayed as some type of sophisticated lock that needs to be bested for success. You’ll do a lot better if you think of it like a suggestion engine you need to work with instead of against.</p>
<p>Remember that the algorithm’s biggest priority is fostering engagement. Let that knowledge guide what you post and when. Publish content that gets people commenting and sharing. And don’t hesitate to jump into the conversation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Advertising on social media remains a top strategy for businesses looking to thrive despite growing competition. In fact, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-marketing-trends-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our recent small business marketing trends report</a> found that half of small businesses are planning to invest in social ads this year.</p>
<p>Those businesses are seeking advertising opportunities on key social platforms like Meta Ads, which allows them to target users on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and other Meta-owned apps.</p>
<p>So, you know you want to dedicate resources towards Facebook ads to stay competitive and effectively engage your target market. But how much will that cost you? And what can you expect in terms of results?</p>
<p>We’ve got the answers to all these questions and more in this year’s annual Facebook ads benchmarks report, analyzing data from over 1,000 campaigns to provide you with industry-specific KPIs including average cost per click (CPC), click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate (CVR), and cost per lead (CPL) for two core Facebook ads campaign objectives: traffic and leads.</p>

<div id="meta-trends"></div>
<h2>Key trends: The big picture</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-tactics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook ads</a> with a traffic objective saw strong improvement year over year, with both higher CTR and lower CPC <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ads-benchmarks-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compared to 2024</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook leads campaigns saw performance declines, with a 20% increase in CPL. However, CPC and CPL for this ad type are still significantly <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-google-ads-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower than comparable ads on Google</a>. Despite rising advertising costs and economic challenges, Facebook Lead Ads maintain a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-cost#:~:text=The%20average%20starting%20budget%20to,per%20month%20on%20Google%20Ads." target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost advantage over Google Ads</a>. This means that social ads are the perfect complement to your search strategy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook Lead Ads click-through rates increased for 9 out of 15 industries</strong>, with an overall slight increase year over year. This shows that Facebook users are still engaging with ads on the Meta platform.</li>
<li><strong>The cost per click for Facebook leads objective campaigns increased overall</strong>, but 10 out of 15 industries (67%) saw stable or decreased CPCs. Advertising costs are increasing across the board—87% of industries saw increases in CPC for Google Ads, with an overall increase of 12.88%. Lead Ads saw a slower rate of increase—only 2.13% compared to 2024. And CPC is still relatively low for Lead Ads at $1.92, compared to $5.26 in Google Ads.</li>
<li><strong>For Facebook leads campaigns, 12 out of 15 industries (80%) saw a decrease in conversion rate year over year.</strong> This follows an overall increase we saw last year. Many of the industries impacted could be seeing decreases due to the economy. For example, fewer people may be looking for entertainment, taking on home improvement projects, or investing in beauty and personal care—leading to a decrease in CVR for these industries.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook leads campaigns cost per lead increased for 9 out of 15 (60%) industries</strong>, and CPL increased 20.94% overall to $27.66. This, again, could be due to the overall increase in advertising costs we’re seeing across the board due to increased competition, privacy restrictions that impact ad targeting, and inflation. However, Lead Ads CPL is substantially lower than the average CPL of Google Ads at $70.11.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>For Facebook traffic campaigns, click-through rates increased YOY for 11 out of 22 industries</strong> (71%) after a year of increases last year as well, with an overall increase of 8.23%. This could speak to better messaging and/or targeting alignment in this category.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook traffic campaign CPCs decreased for 10 out of 21 industries</strong> (48%), with an overall cost per click of only $0.70, which is a 6.67% decrease in CPC YoY as well as much lower than the average CPC of $5.26 in Google Ads. This speaks to the effectiveness of this Facebook ads objective in driving clicks to your website.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, if you’re wondering if Facebook traffic or leads campaigns are right for your business in 2025, this data proves they can be a stable and reliable strategy in light of market fluctuations.</p>
<p>“We are finally starting to see inflation’s impact on campaign metrics. Although CPC, CVR, and CPL have all taken a hit this year, CTR improving in spite of higher costs means that consumers are continuing to engage with advertising, which is a good sign for businesses having to front more marketing dollars behind their campaigns,” said Tyler Mask, Director of Optimization Strategy at<a href="https://localiq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> LocaliQ</a>.</p>

<h2>Facebook ads benchmarks: Traffic campaigns</h2>
<p>Traffic campaigns are a universally popular Facebook ads objective used by small businesses because they effectively prioritize driving clicks. This Facebook objective guides your campaigns to serve your ads to audiences most likely to click.</p>
<p>Traffic to your website, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/social-media-landing-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">landing page</a>, app, or event, is half the battle when securing conversions—so traffic objective campaigns are a go-to for most advertisers on Facebook.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-fb-benchmarks-traffic-916x1024.webp" alt="2025 facebook ads benchmarks - chart of both traffic metrics" width="916" height="1024" class="aligncenter wp-image-93923 size-large" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-fb-benchmarks-traffic-scaled.webp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Click to enlarge</em></a></p>
<p>Note: Since this campaign objective is specifically designed to drive traffic, cost per lead and conversion rate metrics tend to be on the higher side. It’s important to focus on the metrics that matter most for your ad objective, so we’ve omitted those metrics here.</p>
<div id="meta-traffic-ctr"></div>
<h3>Average click-through rate for traffic campaigns</h3>
<p>Click-through rate is a core metric when it comes to traffic campaigns because, after all, they’re optimized for clicks.</p>
<p><strong>The average click-through rate in Facebook ads for traffic campaigns across all industries is 1.71%. </strong>This is higher than last year’s overall average of 1.57%.</p>

</table>
<p>The industries with the highest click-through rates were Shopping, Collectibles, and Gifts (4.13%), Travel (2.76%), and Sports and Recreation (2.60%).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the industries with the lowest click-through rates were Automotive—Repair, Services, and Parts (0.80%), Physicians and Surgeons (0.83%), and Finance and Insurance (0.98%).</p>
<p>The industries with the highest CTRs, such as Shopping, Collectibles, and Gifts, or Sports and Recreation, are typically those that offer “anytime treats.” In other words, you don’t need to be in the market to respond to these types of ads as people can be tempted into shopping or recreation anytime.</p>
<p>On the other hand, industries such as Automotive—Repair, Services, and Parts and Finance and Insurance, can’t always rely on compelling visuals to increase their Facebook ad CTRs. It’s harder to get clicks on ads for industries where only some of the audience is going to be in market. These business types need to focus on engaging ads and pairing the right copy and creative with the right audience targeting strategy to maintain competitive CTRs.</p>
<h4>Average click-through rate: YoY</h4>
<p>While the overall CTR for Facebook ads traffic campaigns increased slightly year over year, the industries that saw the biggest decreases in average CTR compared to 2024 were Real Estate (down 36%), Automotive—Repair, Services, and Parts (down 27%), and Restaurants and Food (down 25%).</p>
<p>On the opposite end, the industries that saw the biggest year-over-year increases in average CTR were Shopping, Collectibles, and Gifts (up 146%), Sports and Recreation (up 102%), and Attorneys and Legal Services (up 80%).</p>

<h3>Average cost per click for traffic campaigns</h3>
<p>Cost per click is a critical <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/19/ppc-metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PPC metric</a> for Facebook ad traffic campaigns. If you’re not maintaining a low CPC consistently, an increase in clicks due to the campaign&#8217;s behavior can accelerate your spend.</p>
<p><strong>The average cost per click in Facebook ads for traffic campaigns across all industries is $0.70. </strong>This is lower than last year’s overall CPC average of $0.77.</p>

<h3>Average click-through rate for leads campaigns</h3>
<p>A high click-through rate on Facebook leads campaigns tends to equate to high-quality ad copy and creative elements. When your Facebook Lead Ads are effective at driving clicks, it means your ads are compelling enough to draw people in and become leads with your business. So, naturally, click-through tends to be prioritized by businesses looking to generate more leads through Meta Ads.</p>
<p><strong>The average click-through rate in Facebook ads for leads campaigns across all industries is 2.59%.</strong> This is about the same as last year’s average of 2.58%.</p>

<h3>Average cost per lead for leads campaigns</h3>

<p>Industries with the highest cost per lead were Dentists and Dental Services ($76.71), Health and Fitness ($52.98), and Beauty and Personal Care ($51.42).</p>
<p>On the other end, industries with the lowest cost per lead were Restaurants and Food ($3.16), Real Estate ($16.61), and Career and Employment ($17.64).</p>
<p>For businesses on the higher end of the CPL spectrum, like Dentists and Dental Services and Health and Fitness, people tend to spend more on these types of services. So, a higher CPL in this case correlates with higher value leads.</p>
<p>“Regardless of the advertising platform, we’re starting to see cost-related metrics rise. CPL is the main metric many businesses look to as a core KPI on Facebook, and it’s gone up by 20% this year. However, just because prices are rising doesn’t mean businesses should necessarily pare down their advertising,” Tyler said.</p>
<p>“In fact, businesses that can afford to remain in the market will become more visible, since a lot of competition tends to pull back on advertising in harsh economic times,” Tyler said.</p>
<h4>Average cost per lead: YoY</h4>
<p>The biggest cost per lead increases year over year were found in industries such as Arts and Entertainment, which increased by 242%, Dentists and Dental Services, which increased by 97%, and Industrial and Commercial, which increased by 62%.</p>

<h3>Use Advantage+ carefully (and sometimes sparingly)</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-vs-manual-settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advantage+ is a suite of AI-powered features</a> advertisers can apply to their campaigns, ad sets, and ads. Advantage+ can help streamline your ad creation and targeting. However, there are some<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> pros and cons to be aware of</a>. Using Advantage+ can sway your Facebook ads results if you’re not 100% confident in the data you feed it to help guide and optimize your campaigns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-ads-benchmarks-advantage-plus.webp" alt="meta ads benchmarks - advantage+ infopage screenshot" width="842" height="327" class="aligncenter wp-image-93946 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-ads-benchmarks-advantage-plus.webp 842w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-ads-benchmarks-advantage-plus-480x186.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 842px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>“You will likely see better metrics in your Meta advertising reports with Advantage+, but who are you actually advertising to? My suggestion is to either use Advantage+ sparingly or have quality control in place to limit the amount of bots that submit forms,” said Brett McHale, founder of<a href="https://empiricmarketing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Empiric Marketing</a>.</p>
<p>For example, you could have your forms block specific email domains or phone numbers to limit lead spam and keep your lead quality high when implementing Advantage+ targeting.</p>

<h3>Focus on lead <em>quality</em> over quantity</h3>
<p>Speaking of lead quality, you’ll want your lead types to be top of mind when building out your Facebook ads campaigns. Consider your ideal audience members and tailor your ads to them specifically, rather than going after the whole crowd.</p>
<p>“The most important metric for success is who you are driving actions from, or in other words, lead quality. You have to be twice as diligent about targeting and campaign settings to ensure you are targeting the highest quality users possible,” Brett said.</p>
<p>While this tip applies across all campaign objectives, this is especially true for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook leads campaigns</a>.</p>
<p>“Traffic campaigns are getting more efficient, which is great to see, but the rise in CPL for Lead Ads shows that getting quality leads is tougher than it used to be.  It’s not just about getting clicks anymore, it’s about making sure those clicks actually convert,” said Cliff Sizemore, Senior Marketing Manager at LocaliQ.</p>
<h3>Keep your goals top of mind</h3>
<p>It can be easy to get lost in the sauce when you’re analyzing specific metrics at a granular level. However, try not to lose sight of your overall Facebook advertising goals. All of the metrics in your account paint a bigger picture of your overall account health when looked at in tandem with one another.</p>
<p>“A single metric does not necessarily determine a campaign&#8217;s success. Your business’s advertising outcomes typically depend on your overall objectives,” said Mat Wendler, Senior Manager of Optimization Strategy and Custom Solutions at LocaliQ.</p>
<p>“For instance, you could have a low cost per lead, but the number of qualified leads may still be insufficient, potentially impacting your business’s advertising results. Each metric provides information about the campaign&#8217;s performance, and it is the responsibility of the advertiser and their marketing partners to interpret their significance,” Mat said.</p>
<p>So, whether or not a specific metric is doing great or in need of improvement, try to think about how it could be related to other performance indicators and your overall account health.</p>
<p>“It’s incredibly rare that a well-tuned campaign meeting or exceeding benchmarks isn’t providing value for a business. That said, given the fact that most metrics are taking a hit this year due to economic headwinds, it’s more important than ever to scrutinize every data point and ensure marketing dollars are producing more than just good metrics,” Tyler said.</p>
<p>It’s also good to remember here that no two Facebook ad accounts are exactly alike—and what might work for one business might not for another.</p>
<p>“The metric that matters most is the one that ties directly to your goals. All others can be helpful indicators, but the one we need to prioritize over all the others is the main goal,” said Michelle Morgan, Co-Founder of <a href="https://www.paidmediapros.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paid Media Pros</a>.</p>
<p>“For those trying to generate more business sales, that ties directly to conversion rate, cost per lead, and return on ad spend. For those trying to attract and engage new audiences, that’s likely more focused on CTR and CPC. It’s all case dependent, but just because a metric is important to another business owner or marketer, doesn’t mean it needs to be a priority for you,” Michelle said.</p>
<h3>Use a mix of campaign objectives</h3>
<p>While the leads and traffic objectives are the pillars of most <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/scale-meta-ads-with-first-party-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta advertising strategies</a>, don’t forget there are a few other campaign objective options. All the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-objectives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">different Facebook ads campaign objectives</a> complement each other, so try to include a variety of campaign types in your account.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/facebook-ad-objectives-e1749239041209.webp" alt="facebook ad objectives" width="419" height="515" class="aligncenter wp-image-84952 size-full" /></p>
<p>“Facebook provides a range of advertising objectives. It is a common misconception that advertisers should focus solely on the objective aligned with their final goal. For instance, if the intended outcome is to generate leads, it may be beneficial to consider running branding and traffic campaigns in addition to a lead campaign,” Mat said.</p>
<p>“Small and medium-sized businesses might not have substantial brand recognition, which can impact their ability to attract leads right off the bat. Facebook&#8217;s platform offers tools to support both branding and lead generation within a single source,” Mat said.</p>
<p>Testing a mix of campaign objectives and ad types in your strategy also helps you balance out any performance gaps.</p>
<p>“All of these metrics play together, and you have to balance them out for your own goals. The most common misalignment I hear is expecting a high CTR and high CVR, especially for lead generation companies. You’re likely going to see decreasing CTRs (and increasing CPCs) as you focus in on your audience and improve your CVR. This is just part of the lead quality game that we all play,” Michelle said.</p>
<p>“When you’re ad copy testing and looking to drive high-quality leads, don’t be discouraged by lower CTRs. Keep things in a manageable range but be flexible with where your CTR ends up. Be willing to sacrifice a few points here and there to make it up on the back end and in your bank account,” Michelle said.</p>
<h3>Prioritize your unique value proposition in ad copy and creative</h3>
<p>You want to take users on a journey through your sales funnel when they view and interact with your ads. Focus on engaging and enriching ads that will convey your brand messaging in a unique way.</p>
<p>“It’s better to tell a good story than a perfect one. Consumer demand for authenticity is at an all-time high. As AI becomes more prevalent, it’s important to leverage it in ways to make more meaningful connections with customers. Do not use it just for the sake of using it. Consumers aren’t looking for businesses to cut corners, they are looking for value,” Tyler said.</p>
<h2>What these 2025 Facebook ads benchmarks mean for your strategy</h2>
<p>Use this industry data as a guideline to inform your strategy. These benchmarks can help you understand how your campaign performance might be pacing against your average competitor. This can be helpful when you want to make confident, data-backed marketing and advertising decisions this year and beyond.</p>
<p>If your results don’t always exactly match up to the averages in your industry, that’s okay! Just be ready to flex and shift your strategy as trends in your industry evolve. And, remember, you don’t have to manage the ups and downs of Facebook advertising all alone. See how <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/marketing-services?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Demo_Blog_Demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our solutions</a> can help transform your strategy into a goal-crushing machine.</p>
<h4>About the data</h4>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years, Instagram has been treated like a closed ecosystem: what you post stays on the app, and the only way to grow was through hashtags, shares, and the ever-changing (and often ambiguous) algorithm. But now, Google is indexing Instagram content—meaning your posts can show directly in search results.</p>
<p>Why would Instagram do this? What’s the opportunity for business owners and marketers? Let’s break down what’s happening, and how you can take advantage of the update.</p>

<h2>What’s happening?</h2>
<p>On July 10, 2025, many users in the app received this notification:</p>
<p><em>“Your public photos and videos may soon appear in search engine results. From 10th July 2025, search engines will automatically be allowed to show all photos and videos on result pages.”</em></p>
<p>That’s right. Google has started pulling Instagram content from professional accounts into its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/serp">search results</a>. That means your posts are no longer confined to your followers’ feeds. They can show up<strong> right where people are actively searching for answers, ideas, and inspiration</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/best-coffee-near-me-google-search-results.webp" alt="best coffee near me google search with instagram post result" width="900" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93852" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/best-coffee-near-me-google-search-results.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/best-coffee-near-me-google-search-results-480x251.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Social and search have blurred considerably in recent years. Instagram joins the likes of TikTok, YouTube, and X (among others) to index content on Google. Think about it: that carousel of brunch spots in Austin, Reel on low-impact workouts, and static post showing minimalist office setups were all once siloed within the Instagram app.</p>
<p>Today? They can all surface when someone types similar semantic queries into Google.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f50e.png" alt="🔎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Need help understanding the modern rules for SEO?</strong> Download our free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/how-to-do-seo-right?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SEOstrategies_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links/">How to Do SEO Right—Right Now!</a></p>
<div id="why-is-instagram-indexing-content-on-google"></div>
<h2>Why Instagram is indexing content on Google</h2>
<p>From Meta’s point of view, the business case for indexing content on Google is pretty clear. Instagram has been criticized for years for the short lifespan of its content. Feed posts peak in a day or two, Stories disappear in 24 hours, and Reels burn out quickly.</p>
<p>By making posts visible in the search results, Meta extends the shelf life of that content, giving creators and brands the ability to capture traffic <strong>long after the initial posting window has passed</strong>. This makes Instagram more competitive with platforms like YouTube, Pinterest, and TikTok, where videos and pins can rank and drive discovery for months or even years.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dance-trends-google-search-results.webp" alt="dance trends google search with tiktok result highlighted" width="900" height="487" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93853" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dance-trends-google-search-results.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dance-trends-google-search-results-480x260.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The value added is so obvious that it begs the question: Why did it take them so long? Over the last few years, Meta has been consciously reshaping itself as a discovery engine, not just a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">social platform</a>. Threads launched with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO-friendly</a> public posts, Facebook Marketplace has long been indexed by Google, and now Instagram joins the mix. Add in the clear competitive pressure of losing out on visibility to the other media platforms, and this move was really a no-brainer.</p>
<div id="how-does-this-impact-creators-businesses-and-marketers"></div>
<h2>How does this impact creators, businesses, and marketers?</h2>
<p>For creators and marketers, this move increases Instagram’s value prop<strong>.</strong> A single post can now generate both social engagement <em>and</em> organic search visibility, which means a higher return on the effort it takes to produce content.</p>
<p>Until now, an Instagram post’s reach was mostly determined by the platform’s algorithm, your followers, and a bit of luck with hashtags. That meant most posts had a <em>super</em> short shelf life, often peaking within 24-48 hours before fading into the background.</p>
<p>Contrast that with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-copywriting">SEO-optimized blog posts</a>, which can drive traffic for years, sometimes tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of hits per month. With Google indexing, that same Instagram post can live far beyond its initial boost. Suddenly, that Reel you produced for your business or client can potentially accrue a lot more value if it goes evergreen on Search.</p>
<p>This is especially powerful for small businesses and local brands. According to Think With Google, <a href="https://business.google.com/us/think/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">46%</a> of all Google searches have local intent. Previously, a boutique coffee shop’s Instagram post about a new seasonal latte would mostly be seen by followers. Now, that same post gains access to all that local traffic if it can rank in the search results.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/seasonal-latte-google-search-results.webp" alt="seasonal latte google search results" width="900" height="516" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93854" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/seasonal-latte-google-search-results.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/seasonal-latte-google-search-results-480x275.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Creators also gain a new level of leverage. Building an audience on Instagram has always carried risk: if your reach gets throttled by the algorithm, your content dies on the platform. But now, your best work is no longer trapped on Instagram. That means more visibility, more followers, and more opportunities for sponsorships and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/26/partner-marketing">brand partnerships</a>.</p>
<p>The generational trend makes this even more urgent. Google itself has acknowledged that nearly <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/gen-z-prefers-tiktok-google-searches" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40%</a> of Gen Z prefer searching TikTok or Instagram over Search for things like restaurants, products, and travel ideas. By allowing posts to rank in Google, Instagram bridges that gap: it keeps Gen Z happy with in-app discovery while also meeting Google searchers where they are.</p>

<div id="how-to-take-advantage-of-indexable-instagram-content"></div>
<h2>5 ways to take advantage of indexable Instagram content</h2>
<p>It all sounds great in theory (the theory being that by effectively search-optimizing your Instagram content, you can increase exposure many times over). But do creators actually have control over that kind of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">compounding traffic</a>, or is this still just a game of luck?</p>
<p>We think they do.</p>
<p>But, first, to give your posts the chance of showing up in Google, there are a few requirements: You must have a professional account, your account must be public, and you must have enabled the setting that allows your content to be indexed (you can find this in Settings &gt; Account privacy).</p>
<p>Now that that&#8217;s out of the way, here are five strategies that you can use to rank your Instagram content high in the search results and drive more value.</p>
<div id="treat-captions-like-mini-blog-posts"></div>
<h3>1. Treat captions like mini blog posts</h3>
<p>Writing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/23/instagram-captions">Instagram captions</a> has always been a fairly casual exercise. They’re typically short, witty, or emotional. That kind of brevity and wit still has a place, but now, consider the fact that captions are going to be a key signal for search engines. Just like Google scans the body content of a blog post, it will now do the same to the keywords in your caption to determine whether your post will provide value to users in the search results.</p>
<p>Keyword density will be important. Depth, maybe even more so.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-post-caption-finalstraw.webp" alt="long instagram post caption example from finalstraw" width="454" height="850" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93855" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-post-caption-finalstraw.webp 454w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-post-caption-finalstraw-160x300.webp 160w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" /></p>
<p>For example, imagine you’re a fitness coach posting a Reel on “5 at-home workouts for beginners.” Instead of a vague caption like “get moving with me today,” try either transcribing your video or actually detailing the five workouts you’re talking about.</p>
<p>Your caption should explicitly mention <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/keyword-mapping">keywords</a> that drive volume on Google: queries like <em>beginner workout</em>, <em>at-home exercise</em>, or <em>fitness tips</em>. You can use Google’s Keyword Planner, Ubersuggest, or even autocomplete in the Google search bar to identify keywords to weave naturally into your captions. (You can also try <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">WordStream&#8217;s Free Keyword Tool</a> for more ideas!)</p>
<div id="optimize-alt-text-for-seo-and-accessibility"></div>
<h3>2. Optimize alt text for SEO and accessibility</h3>
<p>Instagram quietly added an alt text feature a few years ago, primarily for accessibility. Most users let Instagram auto-generate alt text, but now, marketers have a bigger incentive to customize it. Just like with website images, alt text on Instagram gives Google context about what your post contains.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-alt-text.webp" alt="instagram alt text example" width="900" height="473" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93856" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-alt-text.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-alt-text-480x252.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Let’s say you post a carousel showcasing “Minimalist Office Setup Ideas.” Instead of letting Instagram auto-tag it as “Photo of a desk,” you could write: <em>“Minimalist office setup with standing desk, white monitor, and ergonomic chair. Modern home office inspiration.”</em> This not only helps visually impaired users but also gives Google exactly the keywords it needs to rank your post.</p>
<div id="geotag-for-local-seo"></div>
<h3>3. Geotag for local SEO</h3>
<p>Nearly half of all Google searches have local intent, and <a href="https://business.google.com/us/think/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">76%</a> of people who search for something nearby on their smartphone visit a business within a day. That’s massive for brick-and-mortar stores, restaurants, and service providers. With Instagram posts now indexable, a geotag could mean your content surfaces in those local searches.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/summer-instagram-captions-home-services.webp" alt="summer instagram captions - example home services caption for summer" width="781" height="557" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91466" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/summer-instagram-captions-home-services.webp 781w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/summer-instagram-captions-home-services-480x342.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 781px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This Instagram post is geotagged for Phoenix, Arizona, and includes Arizona-related hashtags.</em></p>
<p>The takeaway? Always use location tags when posting about <strong>events, products, or services tied to a physical place</strong>. And when possible, pair your geotags with localized keywords in your caption to maximize visibility.</p>
<div id="build-evergreen-content-themes"></div>
<h3>4. Build evergreen content themes</h3>
<p>As mentioned, one of the biggest challenges with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-marketing">Instagram marketing</a> has been its content treadmill. Posts spike in engagement, then disappear in the algorithm’s black hole. Indexing changes that dynamic.</p>
<p>For marketers, that means rethinking <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-plan">content strategy</a>. Instead of only chasing trends, try deliberately building a library of posts around evergreen themes relevant to your brand. For example, a skincare brand might post Reels about “morning skincare routines,” “how to apply retinol,” or “best sunscreens for sensitive skin.” Those topics get searched year-round, giving your posts long-tail relevance in Google.</p>
<p>As an added layer to your current trends strategy, try identifying 5–10 <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/10/16/guide-to-evergreen-content-marketing">evergreen themes</a> in your industry using keyword research. Create Instagram posts around these topics consistently, so you build a bank of content with lasting value in both places.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Get copy-and-paste social media posts ready for the whole year</strong> in our <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteMonthlySocialMediaCalendarTemplate.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Template_MonthlySocialMediaCalendar_Download">free social media template</a>!</p>
<div id="encourage-engagement-as-a-ranking-signal"></div>
<h3>5. Encourage engagement as a ranking signal</h3>
<p>While Google doesn’t use Instagram “likes” directly in its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-algorithm">algorithm</a>, engagement still matters. Posts that get more comments, shares, and saves are more likely to be surfaced by Instagram, and that visibility in turn boosts signals to Google that the content is relevant. In other words, an engaged audience still helps your post rank better.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/vuori-instagram-post-example.webp" alt="vuori instagram post example with lots of engagement" width="900" height="662" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93857" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/vuori-instagram-post-example.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/vuori-instagram-post-example-480x353.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Marketers should treat engagement prompts as part of their SEO strategy. Instead of ending a caption with “Thoughts?” try something more specific: “Which of these office setups could you see yourself working in? Comment below!” or “Tag a friend who needs a new at-home workout routine.” These <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/13/call-to-action-examples">calls-to-action</a> not only drive comments, but also send positive signals that your post is worth surfacing.</p>
<div id="prevent-instagram-indexing"></div>
<h2>How to keep your Instagram content from being indexed on Google</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve talked about what to do to get your Instagram posts found on Google, but what if you DON&#8217;T want your content to show there? You have a couple of options:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Set your profile to private.</strong> Google will not index private Instagram profiles (and they also are not currently indexing personal Instagram account posts&#8211;only professional ones). We don&#8217;t really recommend this approach for business accounts, because it will limit who can see your posts within the app and create a barrier to entry for growing your page.</li>
<li><strong>Disable the indexing setting.</strong> If you don&#8217;t want to set your account to private but you also don&#8217;t want your posts indexed, you can toggle this setting off. Simply go to Settings &gt; Account privacy and then toggle off &#8220;Allow public photos and videos to appear in search results.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-index-settings.webp" alt="instagram indexing settings" width="900" height="502" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93864" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-index-settings.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-index-settings-480x268.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>Drive cross-channel value on Instagram</h2>
<p>For years, Instagram has been a closed loop: your content lived and died within the app. With Google now indexing content, marketers finally have a way to extend the lifespan of Instagram content and connect with audiences beyond their followers.</p>
<p>While that doesn’t mean you should turn every post into a blog article, it does mean you should be intentional about your strategy. The marketers who learn to balance creativity with SEO will be the ones whose Instagram content not only trends but also earns a lasting spot on Google.</p>

<h2>How Reddit ads pricing works</h2>
<p>If you’re going to be <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reddit-marketing">using Reddit for marketing</a>, let’s first lay down the foundation on how Reddit ad pricing works. It’s primarily a CPM bidding model (cost per 1,000 impressions), which allows you to set a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/10/26/marketing-budget">daily budget</a> and bid for visibility across the platform.</p>
<p>Reddit Ads Manager also supports CPC (cost per click) and CPV (cost per view) bidding for certain campaigns, like those optimized for engagement or video views. More on that later.</p>
<p>Note that Reddit does have minimums:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimum daily spend: $5</li>
<li>Minimum bid: Varies by objective but often starts around $0.20–$0.50 CPM</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is the average Reddit ad cost?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/online-advertising-costs">Online advertising costs</a> are never cut and dry—and Reddit ads are no exception—so the best answer to this question is to provide a range. Since Reddit Ad CPMs vary depending on your targeting, ad type, and competition, we generally say that <strong>campaigns typically range in CPMs from $0.50 to $15</strong>, but advertisers have reported CPMs as low as $0.20 and as high as $100+, especially for premium placements (like front-page takeovers).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a chart of ranges from various sources:</span></p>

<h2>Reddit ad costs by ad type</h2>
<p>Now that you have a feel for how Reddit ad costs compare to other social media platforms, let’s go a layer deeper and take a look at average costs by ad type. There are several different Reddit ad types, and their names are always evolving, but this should give you a general idea of ad formats and prices:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Ad type</b></td>
<td><b>CPM range</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image ads</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">$0.50 &#8211; $12</span></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Takeover ads</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">$20+</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As you can see, Takeover ads have the highest CPMs as they are a premium placement.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that pricing fluctuates based on audience size, targeting options, and competition. More on this in a bit.</span></p>

<p>So the good news is that Reddit typically offers lower CPMs than larger social platforms, but success depends largely on message fit and community relevance.</p>
<p>Side note: If you’re looking to understand the costs of other advertising platforms, we have posts on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/12/facebook-ads-cost">Facebook ad costs</a>, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-cost">Google Ads costs</a>, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/linkedin-ads-cost">LinkedIn ad costs</a>, and more.</p>
<h2>Factors that affect Reddit advertising costs</h2>
<p>As we’ve established, advertising on Reddit can be cost-effective, but rates vary based on how, where, and to whom you&#8217;re advertising. Here&#8217;s a breakdown of the key factors that influence your CPM and overall ad performance:</p>
<h3>Audience targeting</h3>
<p>Reddit offers granular <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/15/audience-targeting">targeting options</a>, and your selections play a major role in determining ad cost. Here’s what we’re working with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Broad targeting:</strong> Here, you’re targeting general interests (gaming, technology, or entertainment). These typically have lower CPMs because you&#8217;re reaching a wider pool of users, which reduces competition in the ad auction.</li>
<li><strong>Narrow targeting: </strong>Here, you’re targeting specific subreddits, device types, or precise geolocations. This increases specificity but also competition. The more niche your audience, the higher your CPM is likely to be.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our advice? Start broad to gather performance insights, then layer in subreddit or interest-based targeting once you know where engagement is strongest. We have more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/24/reddit-advertising">Reddit ad targeting tips here</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/reddit-advertising-costs-wordstream-vacuum-ad.webp" alt="Reddit advertising cost - Ad for a vacuum on Reddit." width="361" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93026 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/reddit-advertising-costs-wordstream-vacuum-ad.webp 361w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/reddit-advertising-costs-wordstream-vacuum-ad-181x300.webp 181w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Pretty good targeting for the r/Adulting subreddit.</em></p>
<h3>Ad placement</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve just covered who your ads appear to; now we’re talking about where they appear. Here are your options and how they impact Reddit ad costs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Premium placements: </strong>Front Page Takeovers or Trending Takeovers give you tons of visibility across the platform, but they come at a hefty price (five to six figures per day). These are typically reserved for enterprise campaigns or major product launches.</li>
<li><strong>In-feed promoted posts: </strong>These appear within users&#8217; home feeds or subreddit threads, and are a better fit for small to mid-sized businesses. They function similarly to native ads, allowing for flexible budgeting and optimization.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/reddit-advertising-costs-wordstream-answer.webp" alt="Reddit advertising cost - Ad for an intelligence test on Reddit." width="351" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93027 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/reddit-advertising-costs-wordstream-answer.webp 351w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/reddit-advertising-costs-wordstream-answer-176x300.webp 176w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>In-feed placement example (and good content for the r/law subreddit if you ask me).</em></p>
<h3>Campaign objective</h3>
<p>Reddit&#8217;s ad platform lets you choose from several objectives, and each one affects your bidding strategy and cost. Let’s break them into two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Awareness-based objectives:</strong> Objectives like reach or impressions generally lead to lower CPMs, since you&#8217;re paying for visibility, not engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Performance-based objectives:</strong> Objectives like conversions, clicks, or app installs usually require higher bids to remain competitive, but you’re also getting solid engagement. Reddit will prioritize showing these ads to users more likely to take action, which increases value (and cost).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Quality and relevance</h3>
<p>Reddit is a community-driven platform, perhaps the most community-driven out of all the social media platforms, so relevance matters more here than on many other ad networks. What that means is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ads should fit in:</strong> Ads that feel native, align with subreddit culture, and generate upvotes, comments, or click-throughs can reduce CPMs over time.</li>
<li><strong>Ads shouldn&#8217;t stir the pot:</strong> Ads that are downvoted, reported, or ignored may get deprioritized by Reddit’s delivery algorithm, which can drive up costs or hurt delivery altogether.</li>
</ul>
<p>Quick tip: Consider testing multiple ad variations with community-minded copy and creative. Redditors respond well to authenticity and humor that respects subreddit norms.</p>

<h2>5 tips to maximize Reddit ad ROI</h2>
<p>If you’re looking to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/drive-traffic-from-reddit">drive traffic from Reddit</a> at optimal costs, here are some final tips:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Be authentic</strong>: Reddit users value transparency and do not like being “sold to.” Use a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/05/conversational-tone"> conversational tone</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Remember the communities</strong>. Reddit ads are particularly effective for SaaS products, B2B tech, gaming and entertainment, niche e-commerce brands, and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/17/direct-to-consumer-marketing"> direct-to-consumer</a> products. That doesn’t mean that if you aren’t in that category, you won’t be successful, but you may need to work a little harder to match your messaging to the tone, interests, and culture of the communities you&#8217;re targeting. Which leads me to my next tip…</li>
<li><strong>Engage in the community</strong>: Try blending in by participating in relevant threads before running a campaign. Get familiar with the culture so you can find the best ways to resonate.</li>
<li><strong>Test multiple subreddits</strong>: A/B test targeting to discover where your audience actually converts.</li>
<li><strong>Use video or GIFs</strong>: Reddit users engage more with visual storytelling than static banners, so add some movement into the mix.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The verdict: Are Reddit advertising costs worth it?</h2>
<p>Reddit advertising presents a unique opportunity for brands that want to (and can) lean into community culture. While costs are generally lower than those of other platforms, success depends more on messaging, market fit, and authentic creative content than on pure budget.</p>
<p>So it can be a low-risk arena to test out ad experiments, but if you&#8217;re looking for plug-and-play campaigns requiring minimal creative effort, Reddit may not be your best bet.</p>
<p>If you’re curious to test Reddit for your brand, start small, engage organically, and optimize from there. With the right strategy, Reddit can deliver outstanding ROAS.</p>

That’s a massive population of potential buyers you can sell to…as long as those potential buyers can actually see you in their feeds. And for that to happen, you have to know how the Instagram algorithm works.</p>
<p>Or, should we say, you have to know how to work the Instagram algorithm?</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll break down how Instagram decides which content to show, when to show it, and who to show it to. We also have some tips to help your posts, Reels, and Stories appear in more feeds, allowing you to attract more of those eager buyers.</p>

<h2>What is the Instagram algorithm?</h2>
<p>The Instagram algorithm is a set of instructions that decides when to display a particular <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-to-post-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">piece of content</a> to an individual user. It continuously reviews and assesses a user’s behavior with the goal of improving their experience on the platform.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-panel1.webp" alt="Instagram algorithm - Explore Page." width="644" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92638 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-panel1.webp 644w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-panel1-480x447.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 644px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Whether you’re searching or scrolling, the Instagram algorithm decides which content ends up on your screen.</em></p>
<p>In more practical terms, the Instagram algorithm acts like a personalized content curator, showing you what it thinks you&#8217;ll like most across your feed, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/instagram-story-ideas/">Stories</a>, Explore page, and Reels. It learns from how you interact with the content it shows you to predict which content and creators will keep you engaged and encourage you to spend more time on the app.</p>
<p>This is a really important concept for marketers to understand. The algorithm’s primary goal is to keep users engaged in the app. If your content serves that purpose, it’ll show it to more people more often. We’ll dig <em>way</em> into how to align your goals with the algorithm throughout this guide.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Not sure what to post on Instagram?</strong> Get the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/social-media-calendar-template?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Template_MonthlySocialMediaCalendar_Download">Copy &amp; Paste Social Media Calendar</a> for a year’s worth of ideas.</p>
<div id="how-does-the-instagram-algorithm-work"></div>
<h2>How does the Instagram algorithm work?</h2>
<p>In general terms, the Instagram algorithm uses a set of signals, or ranking factors, to prioritize the content it places at the top of a user’s feed.</p>
<p>But that’s not the whole story. There isn&#8217;t just one Instagram algorithm. It’s actually a collection of algorithms, processes, and classifiers that prioritize content. And increasingly, <a href="https://transparency.meta.com/features/explaining-ranking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI does the job</a> more than algorithmic code.</p>
<p>Each part of the app, such as your main feed, Stories, Explore page, and Reels, has its own method for selecting your content and sometimes uses different signals to do so. As you expand the type of content you post on Instagram, it’ll help to know how each one works.</p>
<div id="top-instagram-ranking-factors"></div>
<h2>Top Instagram algorithm ranking factors</h2>
<p>Things get real murky when you look under the hood of Instagram’s decision-making AI systems. For our purposes, the most important thing to remember is that it still relies on a set of ranking factors to inform its decisions. And that’s what we can use to nudge our content up to the top.</p>
<p>To that point, three ranking factors play the most significant roles in how Instagram prioritizes content.</p>
<h3>Relationship between creator and viewer</h3>
<p>If you’ve interacted with content from a creator, Instagram is more likely to place more of their content in your feed. As a marketer, that’s why it’s so important to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/27/how-to-increase-instagram-engagement">get engagement</a> on your content. The more likes, comments, and shares you get, the more often your posts will be visible.</p>
<h3>User interest</h3>
<p>This ranking factor is based on the type of content a user typically interacts with. If someone engages with content that’s similar to yours (or a creator that’s similar to you), the algorithm will show them your posts more often.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-yarn.webp" alt="Instagram algorithm - Instagram post about knitting." width="378" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92639 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-yarn.webp 378w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-yarn-189x300.webp 189w" sizes="(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Into knitting? Expect to see content from new knitters on Instagram.</em></p>
<h3>Relevancy</h3>
<p>Instagram assigns a relevancy score to every piece of content. It’s based on factors like recency and connection to trending topics. Consistent publishing and staying up-to-date with trends will help your content succeed.</p>
<h3>Adherence to guidelines</h3>
<p>While not officially a ranking factor, content that <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">violates Instagram’s<a href="https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Community Standards</a> will be withheld</span> from showing up on users’ feeds. It’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with what Instagram considers unacceptable content.</p>
<div id="instagram-ranking-factors-by-platform-feature"></div>
<h2>Instagram ranking factors by platform feature</h2>
<p>There are different rules and signals for each feature in the app. Notice, though, that they all fall into two buckets: How have other users treated this content so far? And how has this user behaved in the past?</p>
<h3>2025 Instagram Feed algorithm</h3>
<p>Instagram uses a dedicated AI called the <a href="https://transparency.meta.com/features/explaining-ranking/ig-feed/?referrer=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram Feed AI system</a> to select, rank, and deliver content to your feed.</p>
<p>Here’s how the system works. When you log in, the system gathers 500 posts from accounts you follow. Then it uses a model to predict which you’ll “find most relevant and valuable.” And finally, the AI assigns a relevance score to each post and places them in order by that score (with a little nudge to make sure you’re seeing a variety of content).</p>
<p>Here are some of the predictions the AI system makes and some of the signals that influence it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How likely are you to reshare a post?</strong>
<ul>
<li>How often you’ve shared that creator’s posts in the past.</li>
<li>How many times that post has already been shared.</li>
<li>How many times you’ve shared any post.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How likely are you to click on the profile of the post’s author?</strong>
<ul>
<li>How many times you’ve viewed the creator’s profile and posts in the past.</li>
<li>How many times the creator’s profile has been clicked by followers.</li>
<li>How many times users in general have clicked on the creator’s profile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How likely are you to spend 10 seconds on the first post? </strong>
<ul>
<li>How much time you’ve spent viewing the creator’s posts.</li>
<li>How many videos you’ve viewed.</li>
<li>How many times you’ve viewed the creator’s content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For marketers, the key takeaway is that if your content is generating clicks, shares, and views, it’ll likely receive more exposure on Instagram. Check out the tips later on to see how you can give that process a boost.</p>
<h3>2025 Instagram Reels algorithm</h3>
<p>For Reels, the AI system behind ranking and displaying content is called <a href="https://transparency.meta.com/features/explaining-ranking/ig-reels-chaining/?referrer=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram Reels Chaining</a>.</p>
<p>Just like with the Instagram Feed AI system, there is a similar list of predictions and influential signals for Reels. However, Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, recently provided a more impactful and succinct explanation of ranking on Reels.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-adam.webp" alt="Instagram algorithm - Instagram post from head of Instagram." width="671" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92640 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-adam.webp 671w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-adam-480x429.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 671px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFFyRp-pINJ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>In his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFFyRp-pINJ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram post</a>, Adam first explained the two types of rankings on Instagram:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connected reach:</strong> The accounts that follow you.</li>
<li><strong>Unconnected reach:</strong> The accounts that don’t follow you yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, he listed the three most important metrics creators should follow to improve their Reels rankings and why they’re important to Instagram.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Average watch time:</strong> The average amount of time a Reel is watched by all users. It tells Instagram how much of a video a user is likely to watch.</li>
<li><strong>Likes per reach:</strong> The ratio of likes a real received compared to the number of unique accounts that have seen it. This tells Instagram whether future users are likely to enjoy a video.</li>
<li><strong>Sends per reach:</strong> The number of times a video has been shared via direct message, compared to the number of unique accounts that have seen the Reel. This helps predict whether a user will share a video with other accounts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2025 Instagram Stories algorithm</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://transparency.meta.com/features/explaining-ranking/ig-stories/?referrer=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram Stories AI system</a> shares some crossover with the Feed AI system. Here are a few of the predictions and signals that are unique to how Stories are ranked:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How likely are you to click on a Story that appears at the top of your page? </strong>
<ul>
<li>How much time you spend viewing Stories.</li>
<li>How many Stories you’ve viewed from that account.</li>
<li>How often you view posts from the Story’s creator.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How likely is it that you and the Story’s creator are closely connected?</strong>
<ul>
<li>How many times you’ve reacted to the creator’s Stories in the past.</li>
<li>Your stated relationship to the creator.</li>
<li>The number of messages you’ve exchanged with the creator.</li>
<li>Your connection to the creator on Facebook.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How likely are you to click to reply to a Story after viewing it?</strong>
<ul>
<li>How much time you’ve spent viewing the creator’s Stories.</li>
<li>How many times you’ve interacted with the creator’s Stories.</li>
<li>How many Stories you have not seen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How likely are you to send a like?</strong>
<ul>
<li>How many of the creator’s posts you have clicked to like.</li>
<li>The first type of reaction you had to a post in the group.</li>
<li>The number of times you’ve viewed a Story by that creator.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2025 Instagram Explore Page algorithm</h3>
<p>And finally, there’s the<a href="https://transparency.meta.com/features/explaining-ranking/ig-explore/?referrer=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Instagram Explore Page AI system</a>. Since the Explore Page is where users go to find content from accounts they don’t follow yet, understanding this algorithm is crucial for follower growth.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-explore-panel.webp" alt="Instagram algorithm - Explore Page" width="365" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92641 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-explore-panel.webp 365w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-explore-panel-183x300.webp 183w" sizes="(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The Explore Page is where new viewers can spot your content.</em></p>
<p>Before content is scored and ranked for a user&#8217;s Explore Page experience, it undergoes an initial filtering process. Specifically, Instagram creates a list of 1,500 photos and videos for possible selection. Instagram’s AI then trims the list based on user behavior and features of the content. What ends up in the Explore grid is content that the user is most likely to engage with.</p>
<p>The Explore recommendation engine uses a very long list of predictions and ranking factors. Here are a few of the ones you should know about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How much time will you likely spend watching a Reel?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The total amount of time people have spent watching the Reel.</li>
<li>The authors of videos you’ve watched in the past.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Are you likely to click “like” on a Reel?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Reels you’ve clicked to like before.</li>
<li>The authors you tended to give likes to before.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How likely are you to follow the author of a Reel?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Which authors you’ve followed in the past.</li>
<li>The number of followers the author received through the Reel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>8 tips to use the Instagram algorithm to your advantage</h2>
<p>When it comes to the Instagram algorithm, knowing is half the battle. Doing is the other half. So let&#8217;s apply what we’ve learned to some<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/09/instagram-marketing-strategy"> Instagram strategies</a> that’ll help your content reach more users’ screens.</p>
<h3>1. Post at the right time</h3>
<p>When you publish content on Instagram matters for two reasons.</p>
<p>First off, recency is an important ranking signal for the Instagram algorithm. So if you post around the times your audience is looking, yours will be the freshest content available.</p>
<p>Second, you’ll have a better chance of getting some initial engagement on new content early if you post at the right time. Since Instagram likes to show us content that other users have liked and shared, that early bump could snowball into more views.</p>
<p>Here’s a guide that’ll help you figure out the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/01/best-time-to-post-on-instagram">best time to post on Instagram</a> for your brand based on several studies.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-time.webp" alt="Instagram algorithm - when to post chart." width="897" height="424" class="aligncenter wp-image-92940 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-time.webp 897w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-time-480x227.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 897px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>2. Post for engagement</h3>
<p>Instagram mentions engagement in almost every discussion of how its algorithms and AI systems rank content. Getting more likes, shares, and comments should be a top priority for all the content you publish there.</p>
<p>Here are some ways you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/27/how-to-increase-instagram-engagement">boost the engagement</a> on your Instagram posts, Stories, and Reels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish quizzes, questions, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/04/instagram-story-ads-polls">polls</a> that encourage a response.</li>
<li>Post current topics people want to talk about.</li>
<li>Review the<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/social-media-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> analytics</a> for various content types to determine which ones are most effective.</li>
<li>Use carousel posts, as they<a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/instagram-carousels/379311/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> tend to receive higher engagement</a> on average.</li>
<li>Run <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/giveaway-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contests and giveaways</a> for likes and shares.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-giveaway.webp" alt="Instagram algorithm - Giveaway post" width="382" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92642 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-giveaway.webp 382w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-giveaway-191x300.webp 191w" sizes="(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Use </em><em>giveaways like this to expand your following and quickly generate a high level of engagement.</em></p>
<h3>3. Loop your Reels</h3>
<p>Here’s a little hack to increase the time people spend watching your videos: loop them.</p>
<p>Looping a video means it automatically replays from the beginning without a pause. Many people who view it will let it roll a few times before moving on, effectively doubling or tripling your average view time.</p>
<p>To loop a Reel, make the end flow into the beginning so it seems to go on forever.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-loop-1.webp" alt="Instagram algorithm - Loop post on Instagram" width="277" height="489" class="aligncenter wp-image-92644 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-loop-1.webp 277w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-loop-1-170x300.webp 170w" sizes="(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px" /></p>
<h3>4. Be active in the comments</h3>
<p>Another way to multiply those engagement numbers and catch the algorithm’s attention is by jumping into the conversations happening on your content.</p>
<p>When someone comments on your post, reply to them as quickly as possible. Ideally, they’ll respond to you, and you’ll get credit for more engagement.</p>
<p>You can really go big here and tag another account in your caption or comments. That’ll encourage them to respond and maybe even pull in some of their followers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-questions.webp" alt="Instagram algorithm - Brand answering questions in Instagram." width="413" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92647 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-questions.webp 413w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-questions-207x300.webp 207w" sizes="(max-width: 413px) 100vw, 413px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Answering questions is good for engagement, ranking, and sales.</em></p>
<h3>5. Create content people want to share and save</h3>
<p>Sharing is another strong signal to the Instagram algorithm that people like what you publish. Plan to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/13/content-creation">create content</a> that&#8217;s designed to be shared, and watch your impressions soar!</p>
<p>What type of content is shared the most? That’ll depend on your specific audience. But humor is a great place to start. Find some inside jokes that your followers will relate to, and they’ll hit the share button on it hard.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-humor.webp" alt="Instagram algorithm - Real estate Instagram joke post." width="338" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92645 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-humor.webp 338w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-humor-169x300.webp 169w" sizes="(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A little inside humor will get shared amongst your followers.</em></p>
<p>Don’t forget about content saves—they also tell the algorithm to get your posts in front of more people. Think about the type of information you save for later. Sure, it could also be funny posts. But how-to content, such as recipes and DIY videos, is also a good option, as people often need to refer back to it as they work on the task.</p>
<h3>6. Use Instagram SEO</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/products/search-engine-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO</a> isn’t just for Google (although you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-posts-indexed-on-google">optimize your Instagram posts</a> to get found on search). Instagram has a keyword search function, which means you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/07/instagram-seo">optimize your content and account</a> to take advantage of it. And if you’re the top post for popular searches, you’ll get more views and engagement, which feeds into Instagram’s content ranking process.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-bio.webp" alt="Instagram algorithm - Instagram profile." width="840" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92646 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-bio.webp 840w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-bio-480x343.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 840px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Work your most important keywords into your profile bio.</em></p>
<p>Here’s how to do SEO on Instagram:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keyword research:</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">Find broad and niche keywords</a> your audience would search for to find content like yours.</li>
<li><strong>Optimize your profile:</strong> Include relevant keywords in your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/09/instagram-bios"> bio</a> and, if possible, your username.</li>
<li><strong>Optimize your posts:</strong> Use more of those keywords in your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/instagram-captions-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">captions</a>, voiceover scripts, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">hashtags</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Optimize your images: </strong>Add even more keywords to your image alt texts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Publish a variety of content</h3>
<ol start="7"></ol>
<p>As we’ve seen, Instagram has a different ranking system for every content type on the app, and they all interconnect (likes to posts can boost your Reels, for example).</p>
<p>To get the entire ranking machine working in your favor, keep a steady flow of different types of content in your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/social-media-marketing-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media</a> publishing calendar.</p>
<p>Tight on time? Try <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-repurposing">repurposing content</a>. Pull a still image from a Reel and use it as a static post. Or post part of a longer feed video to your Stories. With a bit of creativity, you can increase how often you publish on Instagram without a lot more work.</p>
<h3>8. Promote your Instagram account</h3>
<p>While your Instagram account will help promote your business, you can flip the script and use your business to<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> promote your account</a> (and multiply your viewer and follower counts).</p>
<p>Here are several ways to get more eyes on your Instagram content:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In email: </strong>Let your subscribers know there’s more great content available on your Instagram account</li>
<li><strong>On your website: </strong>Add links to your account and preview some of the content there.</li>
<li><strong>On other social networks: </strong>Have a big Facebook or TikTok audience? Ask them to follow you on Instagram, too.</li>
<li><strong>In-person:</strong> If you have a physical location or local customers, post scannable signs or cards that link to your account.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-promote.webp" alt="Instagram algorithm - Instagram images on a website." width="936" height="472" class="aligncenter wp-image-92648 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-promote.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/instagram-algorithm-wordstream-promote-480x242.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>Make the Instagram algorithm work for you</h2>
<p>Believe it or not, you and Instagram are on the same team. The app wants to keep people scrolling and watching longer. You want more people to spend more time with your brand. Work with the app, instead of trying to game it, and you’ll have a much smoother road to success.</p>
<p>The key to success is momentum. If you can increase your follower count, views, and engagements early on, you’ll be aligned with Instagram’s mission, and your next round of content will be ranked higher. Follow the eight tips we provided, measure the results, make adjustments, and repeat. And get even better results if when you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-algorithm">understand the Facebook algorithm</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lead generation ads are one of my favorite formats across all paid media channels. I’ve been using them ever since they launched and have seen great results for all kinds of businesses.</p>
<p>A common struggle I hear is that people can set up and launch Facebook lead generation campaigns, but they’re unsure how to optimize them afterward.

<div id="how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-ad-text-creative"></div>
<h3>1. Focus on your ad text and creative</h3>
<p>Before we get to the form itself, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/24/facebook-lead-ad-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your Facebook lead ad copy and creative</a> are an important starting place. This is the impression you’re going to make on your audience, and it needs to align with your optimization goal.</p>
<h4>Facebook lead ad copy and creative tips for everyone</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use highly engaging visuals</strong>: This could be for static images, carousels, or video. Make sure you’re standing out from the crowd.</li>
<li><strong>Make the most of your copy</strong>: Use emojis or numbers in text to stand out.</li>
<li><strong>Test different text lengths</strong>: All industries and customer personas are different. Some want longer copy, others want something more succinct. Test different permutations and see what works best for your folks.</li>
<li><strong>Use vibrant, contrasting colors</strong>: More often than not, the ads I see work best have some sort of high contrast in the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/website-color-scheme" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> color scheme</a>. This creates a harsh experience that can often get users to stop scrolling and see what your ad is about.</li>
<li><strong>Format creatives for each placement size</strong>: There are lots of different placements on the Meta network, and they let you upload custom creatives for each. There’s no reason you should deal with dead space around the top and bottom, or sides of your visual assets. Try <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-image-prompts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using AI to create and upload images or videos</a> that fit each dimension for each placement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Use the power of AI to optimize your Facebook lead ads</strong> with our free guide on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/ai-advertising?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_AIAdvertising_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener">key ways to use AI in Google and Facebook Ads</a>!</p>
<h4>How to adjust your Facebook assets for higher lead volume</h4>
<p>To get more form fills, you need more people clicking on your ads. To <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/14/improve-google-ads-click-through-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improve click-through rate</a>, try some of these tactics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make your ads broadly appealing</strong>: Try to strike a tone of “all are welcome.”</li>
<li><strong>Change your offer</strong>: Test different things to give away. What does your audience want the most that you’re willing to “give away”? If you’re not seeing the volume you want, you might need to have something more appealing.</li>
<li><strong>Play on your audience&#8217;s emotions</strong>: If someone is going to work with you, are they happy, sad, fearful? While I would suggest you use some level of discretion so as not to be manipulative, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using emotion</a> in ads can get users to engage and convert more.</li>
<li><strong>Use social proof or industry awards:</strong> Showcase yourself through either reviews from your customers or awards you’ve won for your business. These help you differentiate yourselves from your competition and show that others think your products or services are high value.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How to optimize your Facebook ad copy and creative for better lead quality</h4>
<p>For <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-quality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher-quality leads</a>, our tactics need to be a bit different. We still want highly attractive and engaging creatives, but there are some tweaks on the theme to attract only the right users. The biggest thing to remember with tactics to improve lead quality is that you’ll almost always see less overall lead volume, but your percentage of high-quality leads should be better, bringing up your batting average.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tell your audience who you’re a good fit for:</strong> Speak only to the users you want to engage with. If your product only works for certain groups of people, call that out. Have a minimum spend on our site that lower budget folks can’t afford? Make that known.</li>
<li><strong>Incorporate your ideal persona in creatives</strong>: Don&#8217;t stop at ad text. If you’re able to visually showcase your actual target audience, do that in the imagery.</li>
<li><strong>Change your offer to fit a narrower one</strong>: Move away from the “everyone is welcome” offer and promote something only a serious buyer would want.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Choose the right form type</h3>
<p>Whenever you build a new lead gen form on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/scale-meta-ads-with-first-party-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Ads</a>, the first choice you have is what type of form you want to use. There are two choices for this: <strong>more volume</strong> and <strong>higher intent</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-type.webp" alt="how to optimize facebook lead ads - form type screenshot" width="849" height="267" class="aligncenter wp-image-92265 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-type.webp 849w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-type-480x151.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 849px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>More volume Facebook lead ad forms</h4>
<p>The “more volume” option is going to align perfectly with anyone trying to get a higher number of lead-gen forms submitted to their campaigns. This form, as Meta says, is quick to fill out and submit on a mobile device.</p>
<p>There are almost no breakpoints with these forms (the only exception would be with your question strategy, which we’ll get to in a minute). These should be free-flowing and easy to zip right through.</p>
<h4>Higher quality Facebook lead ad forms</h4>
<p>While the options for this form are almost identical to the more volume option, a &#8220;higher Intent&#8221; form adds a step in the form submission process that acts as a speed bump for the user.</p>
<p>During this review step, the user can see their information based on the answers they provided to the questions and is reminded that the information they see is going to be submitted to your business. Additionally, the user has to slide the submit arrow rather than simply clicking a Submit button. A subtle change, but a meaningful one.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form.webp" alt="optimize facebook lead ads - user answer review options" width="850" height="409" class="aligncenter wp-image-92271 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form.webp 850w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-480x231.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 850px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This review step, while fairly basic, does a good job of reminding the user what this form is for and scaring off users who are less serious about engaging with a company. Just like I warned above, you’ll likely see fewer form fills with a higher intent form type, but the users who do submit should be higher quality since they were given the option to back out and didn’t.</p>

<h3>3. Create a form intro section that pops</h3>
<p>The intro of a lead gen form gives even more text space for you to set the stage for your potential customers. Think of this greeting in much the same way you thought about the ad copy and creative itself.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </strong><strong>Looking for more ways to improve your Facebook lead ads?</strong> Start with an instant account report using our free <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-advertising?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FBGrader_FBGrader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Ads Grader</a>!</p>
<h4>Facebook lead ad form greeting tips for everyone</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using the ad image is fine: </strong>If you have the design capabilities and bandwidth and want to design new images for the forms, that’s great. They likely will perform really well. But I’ve been using the same image from the ads for a long time and haven’t seen any slowdown in performance because of it. We talk a lot about making sure your ads look their best in all placements, and this is one of them, but this is likely one of the few scenarios that you can let it slide.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-.webp" alt="how to optimize facebook lead ads - background image for form intro" width="711" height="361" class="aligncenter wp-image-92266 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-.webp 711w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads--480x244.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 711px, 100vw" /></li>
<li><strong>Set the stage in the greeting</strong>: Let the user know who they’re engaging with and what they’ll receive in return once they fill out the form. This should be a continuation of the messaging in your ad creative, but you get more of an opportunity to talk to your prospective customers.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ad-tips.webp" alt="how to optimize facebook lead ads - form greeting" width="705" height="501" class="aligncenter wp-image-92267 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ad-tips.webp 705w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ad-tips-480x341.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 705px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>How to make your Facebook lead ad form intro appeal to more people</h4>
<p>If you’re aiming for more volume, the best thing you can do in this section is to echo the same “all are welcome” message you used in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/03/ad-copy-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ad copy</a>.</p>
<p>That said, if you’re really trying to limit the friction in your lead gen forms, you could test not using the greeting text at all and sticking only with the image. There’s a blue toggle in the upper right of the greeting where you can turn it off, and users will go straight from the image to the form fields.</p>
<h4>How to make your form greeting attract more high-quality leads</h4>
<p>To improve lead quality, I suggest you use the greeting every time and use it to further prequalify your customers. Keep adding information that will help weed out the users who are less serious and focus only on those with higher intent.</p>
<div id="how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-question-strategy"></div>
<h3>4. Add the right questions to your form</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve got the form type down, the biggest differentiator in optimizing your Facebook lead ads is going to be the questions you add to your forms. Everything matters in this section, from the types of questions you ask to the substance of them. Note: Only ask for relevant information! No matter your end goal, keep your questions focused on data points that are most important for you to know or helpful to your sales teams. Don’t get distracted.</p>
<h4>Optimize your Facebook lead ad form questions for increased lead volume</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on the prefill questions:</strong> All questions in this section will be auto-filled by Meta if it knows the information based on someone’s profile information. By using these questions, you’ll limit the work your audience has to do to fill out the form since there’s a higher likelihood of the information populating for them in the form.</li>
<li><strong>Ask fewer questions:</strong> The fewer questions you ask (or the less amount of information you ask for), the better chance you’ll see an increase in volume. Depending on your business, you might be able to get away with only a first name and phone number or a name and email. Even a form with two fields can be valuable if you have the right follow-up in place.</li>
<li><strong>Keep the information high level:</strong> Using prefill questions can help, but the less invasive you are in the form, the more likely you are to get users to fill it out. If your sales team is willing and able to get the other needed information out of the customers on the phone, then keep it simple here and let them do their thing.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ads-contact-form.webp" alt="optimize facebook leads - contact field option" width="733" height="666" class="aligncenter wp-image-92264 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ads-contact-form.webp 733w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ads-contact-form-480x436.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 733px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Try question strategies to get higher-quality leads</h4>
<p>We’re gonna take pretty much everything from the “more volume” section here and turn it on its head.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leverage the custom questions:</strong> Make the user think about their answer and type something in, or make a choice. Everything in the questions section is going to require you to craft the question and provide the space for the answers. Or, in the case of multiple choice, you get to select the possible answers too.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ads-question-logic.webp" alt="optimize facebook lead ads - conditional logic" width="803" height="367" class="aligncenter wp-image-92268 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ads-question-logic.webp 803w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ads-question-logic-480x219.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 803px, 100vw" /></li>
<li><strong>Ask more questions:</strong> Follow the best practice of keeping all questions relevant, but ask for more in the form. Users who are less serious won’t want to take the time to answer five or more questions.</li>
<li><strong>Get the details in the form:</strong> Do the job of a salesperson. Ask about the budget, timeline, and other important details right in the form. The serious buyer knows this information is necessary for you to do your job, so they’re willing to share it.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage conditional logic:</strong> In the first image of this section, you can see there’s a toggle in the upper right for conditional logic. With this activated, you can choose how the form will react based on how the user interacts with it. You can either send them a follow-up question, complete and submit the form, or send the user to an end page and not submit the form. This lets you create an entire experience directly in the form and allows them to choose the next step.</li>
<li><strong>Give the user an out:</strong> While it might seem strange to let people opt out of submitting the form, it’s actually in your best interest. Many times, forms get opened by accident, and the user isn’t sure how they got there. In your questions, specifically multiple choice, give the option (or something similar to) “I’m not interested,” then send the user to an end screen. They’re let off the hook in a nice way, and your sales team isn’t reaching out to folks who don’t want to talk to them.</li>
</ul>

<div id="master-lead-follow-up-strategy"></div>
<h3>5. Master your lead follow up</h3>
<p>Your job isn’t finished once you receive someone’s form. It’s on<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/11/03/lead-nurturing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> your nurture sequences</a> and sales team to close the leads that are coming through from your campaigns. For this stage, we don’t really have any different strategies for volume or quality plays, but here are some overall best practices that you should be doing when you generate leads through Meta Ads.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Offer a timely follow-up:</strong> As crazy as it sounds, if you’re not following up with your lead gen form submissions within about 24-48 hours, they’re likely going to forget they interacted with you in the first place. Be sure to reach out as soon as possible to keep the user engaged with your company, whether it’s through an email nurture sequence or a sales call follow-up.</li>
<li><strong>Make the next step logical and meaningful</strong>: Speaking of that next step, make sure it’s the right fit for your initial call to action. Someone who downloaded an infographic likely doesn’t want to talk to a salesperson right away. On the flip side, someone who opted for a demo likely doesn’t want to get tons of content from you right away. Use your follow-up to further the conversation with the potential customer in a logical way; don’t jump around the funnel too much.</li>
<li><strong>Remove users after a period of time</strong>: Regardless of how interested they were when they filled out the form, there are going to be people who simply don’t want to engage anymore for one reason or another. Set up safeguards to remove people from sales call sheets and email nurtures after a certain amount of time with no activity. It’ll save your team&#8217;s time and not leave a bad taste in the potential customer’s mouth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why advertise on Facebook?</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re reading this post, chances are you&#8217;ve already made up your mind as to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/10/14/advertising-on-facebook">whether you should advertise on Facebook</a>. But in case you&#8217;re still on the fence, here are some reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build brand awareness.</strong> Unlike Google Ads, which are all text, Facebook ads allow you to use images and video, which can support your branding. And while purchase intent is not as high on Facebook as on Google, imagery gives you the power to stand out in users&#8217; feeds through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/01/13/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing">emotional marketing</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Cost-effective. </strong>Because Facebook ads offer such specific targeting, you can rest assured that you&#8217;re making the most of your ad budget.</li>
<li><strong>Versatility. </strong>Between the wide range of ad formats and the different objectives available, you can use Facebook ads to target users at every stage of your marketing funnel.</li>
<li><strong>Gain audience insights.</strong> People spend a lot of time on Facebook and use it for a number of reasons in their day-to-day lives. The data you collect through Facebook ads provides invaluable <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/17/customer-insights">customer insights</a> you can use to inform your strategy elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
<p>And if that&#8217;s not enough, here are some numbers for ya:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nearly <a href="https://www.sender.net/blog/advertising-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90%</a> of businesses use Facebook advertising.</li>
<li>The average Facebook user clicks on <a href="https://adespresso.com/blog/facebook-statistics/#FacebookAdsStatistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11</a> ads per month.</li>
<li>Facebook ads have the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/872682/social-media-advertising-cpc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lowest</a> average cost per click of all social media advertising platforms.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ads-benchmarks-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average CPC in Facebook ads</a> is $1.88 for lead campaigns and $0.77 for traffic campaigns. That&#8217;s significantly lower than the overall<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-google-ads-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> average CPC in Google and Microsoft Ads</a>, which is $5.26.</li>
</ul>

<div id="overview"></div>
<h2>Facebook ad account overview</h2>
<p>When you<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/21/how-to-run-google-ads"> run Google Ads</a>, you set up a Google Ads account and then off you go, but with the Meta Business Suite, there are several different properties involved. If you&#8217;re new to Facebook advertising or Meta Business Suite in general, you&#8217;re highly susceptible to falling into a black hole of confusion surrounding which accounts you need.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the breakdown (and don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m going to walk you through setting up all of these):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meta Business Suite</strong> (formerly Facebook Business Suite) is the umbrella account that encompasses everything. It&#8217;s a free account where you can manage your Facebook and Instagram pages in one place. You can create and schedule posts, reply to messages, get insights and notifications, and more.
<ul>
<li><strong>Business Manager </strong>is now one and the same with Business Suite. It used to be the backend where you manage permissions, payments, pixels, and more things that don&#8217;t begin with a P. All of these functions are now part of Meta Business Suite, but if you really want to perform them outside of the old Business Manager interface, you can click the help button and select Switch to Business Manager.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ads Manager.</strong> This is where your ad account(s) live. If you&#8217;re an agency, you will have multiple ad accounts in one Ads Manager account. If you&#8217;re the only one managing your properties, you don&#8217;t need a Meta Business Suites/Business Manager account to use Ads Manager, but it is recommended (and it&#8217;s free, so it can&#8217;t hurt).</li>
<li><strong>Ad account. </strong>This is what you create within Ads Manager. You should only have one ad account per business (or per Facebook business Page)</li>
<li><strong>Facebook Page</strong>. You need a Facebook Page in order to advertise on Facebook, but you don&#8217;t need to be advertising on Facebook in order to create a Page. In fact, this is a staple in any organic <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">social media marketing strategy</a>. You can create a Page entirely separate from all of the above, right from your Facebook profile. Or you can create one out of Business Suite.</li>
<li><strong>Ad campaign.</strong> This is where you choose an objective. You can (and should) have multiple campaign types within one ad account.</li>
<li><strong>Ad set.</strong> This is where you determine your ad budget/<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/31/facebook-ads-bidding-strategies">bidding</a>, schedule, and audience targeting, such as by demographics, interests, age, and more. You can have multiple ad sets in one campaign.</li>
<li><strong>Ad.</strong> This is your actual copy and creative. You&#8217;ll want to have at least two ads per ad set. We&#8217;ll talk more about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/30/facebook-ads-account-structure">Facebook ad account structure</a> later on.</li>

<p>You&#8217;ll be asked to add your business name, your name, and then your business email. Upon confirming your email, your account will be set up.</p>
<p>Here is where you&#8217;ll be brought to the Meta Business Suite interface.</p>
<div id="page"></div>
<h3>2. Connect or create your Facebook Page</h3>
<p>Head down to the bottom left and click on Settings.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-suite-settings.png" alt="how to advertise on facebook - business settings" width="720" height="465" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60741" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-suite-settings.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-suite-settings-480x310.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul></ul>
<p>From there, click the second gear you see, or you might see a prompt to go to Business Settings. Both take you to the same place. Business settings is basically the legacy Business Manager.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-business-account-settings.png" alt="how to advertise on facebook - business settings" width="720" height="466" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60742" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-business-account-settings.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-business-account-settings-480x311.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You need a Facebook Page in order to advertise. On the left window, select Pages and then click Add. Here you can either add an existing Page, create a new Page, or request access to a Page (such as if you&#8217;re running ads for another business).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-add-page.png" alt="how to advertise on facebook - add facebook page" width="720" height="479" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60743" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-add-page.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-add-page-480x319.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>While you can supply the bare minimum just to get your page created, it&#8217;s best to build it out fully before you start advertising since users can navigate to your Page from your ad. Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/16/facebook-business-page">our guide to creating a Facebook Business Page</a> to set your page up in full and optimize it for marketing purposes.</p>
<div id="account"></div>
<h3>3. Create your ad account</h3>
<p>Okay, now navigate back to Ad accounts in that left-hand pane. You&#8217;ll see an option on the right to create a new ad account.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-ad-account.png" alt="how to advertise on facebook - create ad account" width="720" height="478" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60744" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-ad-account.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-ad-account-480x319.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Provide your Ad account name, time zone, and currency, then click Next. Facebook will then ask you whether the ad account is going to be used to manage ads for the business account through which you&#8217;ve created this ad account or for another business or client.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-run-facebook-ads-who-this-ad-account.png" alt="how to advertise on facebook - select account" width="303" height="355" class="aligncenter wp-image-60745" /></p>
<p>Next, you&#8217;ll be asked to add people and permissions. Select your name and give yourself full control over everything.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-full-control.png" alt="how to advertise on facebook - user permissions" width="720" height="561" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60746" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-full-control.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-full-control-480x374.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Click Assign and then click Add Payment Info. Now you have an ad account set up.</p>
<div id="pixel"></div>
<h3>4. Add the pixel to your website</h3>
<p>You don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to do this step now, but you&#8217;re going to have to do it eventually, so you may as well get it over with! The pixel is a little snippet of code that will tell you what your ad viewers do once they land on your website. Insights from the pixel help you to further optimize your ads as well as create <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/04/facebook-retargeting">Facebook retargeting audiences</a> that tend to perform well.</p>
<p><strong>Note! </strong>For a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/scale-meta-ads-with-first-party-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> strong first-party data strategy in Meta</a>, it&#8217;s highly recommended you set up the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/06/facebook-conversions-api"> Facebook Conversions API</a> as well, as this is the best way to get the most complete picture of your data possible.</p>
<p>To set up the pixel, go to Data Sources, select Pixels, and on the right, click Add.</p>

<p>Facebook will ask you whether you want to install it manually or use a partner integration.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-install-facebook-pixel-choose-method.png" alt="facebook pixel installation methods" width="720" height="457" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60437" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-install-facebook-pixel-choose-method.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-install-facebook-pixel-choose-method-480x305.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The partner integration methods are designed to make the process easier without using code, so I&#8217;d encourage you to go that route first. Current partners include:</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress</li>
<li>WooCommerce</li>
<li>Tealium</li>
<li>Shopify</li>
<li>Makeshop</li>
<li>Magento</li>
<li>Google Tag Manager</li>
<li>Conversions API Gateway</li>
<li>Cafe24</li>
<li>Zapier</li>
<li>Segment</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/facebook-conversions-api-integrations.png" alt="facebook conversions api integrations" width="720" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60439" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/facebook-conversions-api-integrations.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/facebook-conversions-api-integrations-480x313.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If the partner integration method doesn&#8217;t work or you don&#8217;t use any of those platforms, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ynTNs5FAUm8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video tutorial on setting up the Facebook pixel manually</a> from <a href="https://ivanmana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ivan Mana </a>is super helpful.</p>
<h4>Set up your web events</h4>
<p>As part of the pixel setup process, you&#8217;ll have to verify your domain and configure your web events (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/20/facebook-aggregated-event-measurement">Aggregated Event Measurement</a>). Paid Media Pros offers an <a href="https://youtu.be/6ldKyiVkT4U" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easy tutorial video for configuring your web events</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-web-event-configuration.png" alt="how to advertise on facebook - configure web events" width="720" height="529" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60452" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-web-event-configuration.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-web-event-configuration-480x353.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Note that you can always revisit the domain verification process by going to Brand Safety &gt; Domains, and revisit the event setup process by going to Events Manager.</p>

<div id="campaign"></div>
<h3>5. Create your Facebook ad campaign</h3>
<p>Now, click the hamburger menu at the top left (All tools) and select Ads Manager.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-run-facebook-ads-ads-manager.png" alt="how to advertise on facebook - ads manager" width="720" height="552" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60748" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-run-facebook-ads-ads-manager.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-run-facebook-ads-ads-manager-480x368.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>On the left, select &#8220;Create.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-create-ad.png" alt="facebook ad manager - create ad" width="720" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60454" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-create-ad.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-create-ad-480x300.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Choose your campaign objective</h3>
<p>Facebook offers six ad objectives: awareness, traffic, engagement, leads, app promotion, and sales.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/facebook-ad-objectives-e1749239041209.webp" alt="facebook ad objectives" width="419" height="515" class="aligncenter wp-image-84952 size-full" /></p>
<p>In terms of which objective to choose, it will depend on what your offer is and who you&#8217;re targeting. Ultimately, you want to have a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/21/facebook-funnel">full-funnel Facebook ad strategy</a> where you create different campaigns for each stage of your funnel.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/facebook-ad-objective-chart.webp" alt="how to advertise on facebook - facebook ad objective chart" width="708" height="270" class="aligncenter wp-image-91936 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/facebook-ad-objective-chart.webp 708w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/facebook-ad-objective-chart-480x183.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 708px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Campaign settings</h4>
<p>Next, depending on the objective you choose, you may be prompted to choose your setup type. You can either go for an automated, &#8220;recommended settings&#8221; route or a manual setup route. We break down all the differences between the two<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-vs-manual-settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Facebook ad setup options</a> here.</p>
<p>Facebook ad campaigns built using recommended settings rely on the Meta Advantage+ suite, which is a set of AI-powered ad functions that behave similarly to Smart campaigns in Google Ads.</p>
<p>There is no right or wrong answer here, as you might want to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> try an Advantage+ campaign</a> if you&#8217;re not sure where to start. Or, Advantage+ can be helpful if you&#8217;re tight on bandwidth and can&#8217;t optimize and manage your campaigns to the fullest capacity.</p>
<p>On the opposite end, you may want more manual control over specific settings, placements, and audiences, as you test and scale your strategy. It all comes down to you and your team&#8217;s preferences and goals, so don&#8217;t be afraid to try both to see what works best.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-advantage-plus.webp" alt="how to advertise on facebook - facebook ad setup" width="652" height="434" class="aligncenter wp-image-91937 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-advantage-plus.webp 652w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-advantage-plus-480x320.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 652px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you opt for manual setup, you&#8217;ll see a panel of options like this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-campaign-settings.webp" alt="how to advertise on facebook - campaign settings" width="644" height="539" class="aligncenter wp-image-91944 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-campaign-settings.webp 644w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-campaign-settings-480x402.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 644px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Campaign name: </strong>Use whatever you want, as long as it makes sense to you.</li>
<li><strong>Campaign details:</strong> Here you can change your objective if you need to. Under &#8220;Show more options&#8221; you can also set a campaign spending limit.</li>
<li><strong>Advantage+ Campaign Budget:</strong> With this setting turned on, instead of choosing your budget separately for each ad set within a campaign, Meta Advantage+ machine learning will decide which ad sets should<span> receive a higher percentage of the spend based on performance.</span></li>
<li><strong>A/B test: </strong>We&#8217;re going to skip this for now, but you can learn more in our guide to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/11/facebook-ab-testing">Facebook A/B testing</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Special Ad Categories:</strong> If you fall into any of those special categories, declare that here so you can take care of any further documentation you may need to provide, depending on Facebook advertising policies.</li>
</ul>
<div id="set"></div>
<h3>6. Create your Facebook ad set</h3>
<p>Now we&#8217;re in the ad set stage. There are more features and settings here, too, but here&#8217;s what matters.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance goal:</strong> Choosing a performance goal helps Meta&#8217;s algorithms know how to best serve your ad according to your desired results. This may look different for different objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Cost per result goal</strong>: If you&#8217;re familiar with search ads, think of this like a maximum CPC bid target. You&#8217;re telling Meta your desired cost per result to help it deliver your ads according to your budget goals. However, know that way over- or under-shooting here could throw off the algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-run-facebook-ads-facebook-ad-set-delivery.webp" alt="how to advertise on facebook - facebook ad ad set settings" width="650" height="455" class="aligncenter wp-image-91940 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-run-facebook-ads-facebook-ad-set-delivery.webp 650w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-run-facebook-ads-facebook-ad-set-delivery-480x336.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frequency control:</strong> Depending on your campaign setup, you could set a cap or target for the number of times a user sees your ad.</li>
<li><strong>Delivery.</strong> Under &#8220;more options&#8221; you may be able to edit your ad set&#8217;s delivery settings depending on your overall campaign settings. This i<span>s where you tell the algorithm what you see as success for your ad set so that Facebook can further refine who it shows your ads to.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-run-facebook-ads-frequency-controls.webp" alt="how to run facebook ads - facebook ad frequency controls" width="653" height="652" class="aligncenter wp-image-91939 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-run-facebook-ads-frequency-controls.webp 653w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-run-facebook-ads-frequency-controls-480x479.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 653px, 100vw" /></p>

</ul>

<p><span>Scrolling further, there are a few more settings to set at the ad set level you&#8217;ll have to select before moving on. Again, the options here will vary depending on your campaign objective, but here is a quick guide on how to choose: </span></p>
<h4>Budget &amp; schedule</h4>
<p>Here is where you choose a daily budget or a lifetime budget. You can learn about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/19/facebook-ads-daily-vs-lifetime-budgets">daily vs. lifetime budgets here</a>, but in general</p>
<p>Choose<span> <strong>daily budgets</strong><span> when:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Your campaign will be evergreen</li>
<li>You want to maximize strong performance</li>
<li>You expect to change your budget regularly</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose<span> <strong>lifetime budgets</strong><span> when:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>You need to run your ads on a schedule</li>
<li>Your campaign has a set budget and end date</li>
</ul>
<p>If you go with a daily budget, it&#8217;s best to start with something like $5-10 a day. If you set it too low, your ad may not compete as well, meaning it will show less and not collect enough data for Facebook to further optimize for the best results. More on that in this list of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/05/facebook-ad-mistakes">Facebook advertising mistakes</a>.</p>
<p>You also have the option here to set up your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/13/how-to-set-up-ad-scheduling">ad scheduling</a>, which is fairly easy on Facebook. You can tell Facebook to only run your ads when it makes sense for your business (such as only during your operating hours) or audience (such as only running your breakfast cafe ads in the morning).</p>
<h4>Audience controls</h4>
<p>In this step, you select exactly <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-targeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who you want to reach with your Facebook ad</a>, which you can define based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Gender</li>

<p>You can check out our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/13/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-world">full guide to Facebook ad targeting</a>, but here&#8217;s a quick crash course:</p>
<p>Though it has taken a bit of a hit due to privacy changes, Facebook&#8217;s targeting is still among the most powerful out there since users provide such detailed information about themselves on this platform—their age, marital status, job, interests, and more. There are four types of audiences you can target in Facebook ads.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core audiences:</strong> target users based on their demographics, interests, and behaviors.</li>
<li><strong>Custom audiences:</strong> target and retarget customers and leads. These are pixel-based.</li>
<li><strong>Lookalike audiences:</strong> target people similar to your existing customers and leads.</li>
<li><strong>Advantage+ audiences:</strong> target people who fit your chosen &#8220;audience themes&#8221; using AI.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-advantage-plus-audience-suggestions-e1749241307119.webp" alt="facebook ad targeting - advantage plus audience suggestion example" width="713" height="593" class="aligncenter wp-image-87464 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-advantage-plus-audience-suggestions-e1749241307119-713x551.webp 713w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-advantage-plus-audience-suggestions-e1749241307119-480x270.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 713px) 713px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li>For <strong>detailed targeting</strong>, you can create rules so that the ad targets users with one OR another or one AND another interest. Either way, it&#8217;s best to stick to just one or two interests or demographics per ad set. Otherwise, you won&#8217;t know what audiences are working for you. If you have more interests to target, you can always create new ad sets.</li>
<li>On the right, <strong>Audience definition</strong> will tell you how large or small your audience will be based on the criteria chosen, and <strong>Estimated daily results</strong> will tell you how many people you&#8217;re estimated to reach based on your daily spend. Keep in mind that these are just estimates and aren&#8217;t always 100% reliable, so take them with a grain of salt.</li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>

<h4>Choose your placements</h4>
<p>Now you&#8217;ll choose your placements. Placements refer to where your Facebook ad will appear on the Facebook network. Between mobile and desktop, Instagram and Facebook, there are a number of placements to choose from.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/b2b-facebook-ad-placement-priority-selection-1.png" alt="" width="650" height="377" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18759" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/b2b-facebook-ad-placement-priority-selection-1.png 650w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/b2b-facebook-ad-placement-priority-selection-1-480x278.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll have three options here: automatic, manual, or Advantage+ placements. You may be tempted to manually choose which placements you want, but if you&#8217;re just starting out, it&#8217;s best to leave it on the default, automatic placements, or choose Advantage+, and let your ad show on every possible placement to start. Then, after a week or two, you can look at which placements are performing best, switch to manual, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/08/facebook-ad-placement-optimization">optimize your placements</a> from there.</p>

<h3>7. Create your ad</h3>
<p>Now the fun part—creating your ad! The possibilities here are endless, but if you need a little inspiration, check out these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/23/facebook-ad-examples">Facebook ad examples</a>.</p>
<h4>Create your ad creative</h4>
<p>The creative refers to the visual part of your ad, and this should be the focal point of the ad. Facebook supports three ad formats: single image and video ads, carousel ads, and collection ads, and you have three creation options: use an existing post, a Creative hub mockup, or upload your own design.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/facebook-ad-setup.png" alt="facebook ad setup" width="413" height="586" class="aligncenter wp-image-60760" /></p>

<h4>Write your copy</h4>
<p>Next, it&#8217;s time for your ad copy, which consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary text:</strong> above the ad creative; only the first 125 characters show.</li>
<li><strong>Headline:</strong> just below the creative, 40 characters or less.<span> </span></li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong><span> just below the headline, 30 characters or less.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/facebook-ad-copy-ad-components.png" alt="facebook ad copy components" width="500" height="665" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55402" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/facebook-ad-copy-ad-components.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/facebook-ad-copy-ad-components-480x638.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>According to a study by <a href="https://adespresso.com/blog/we-analyzed-37259-facebook-ads-and-heres-what-we-learned/#:~:text=The%20median%20length%20for%20a,to%20the%20point%20each%20time." target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdEspresso</a>, The perfect Facebook ad headline length is five words. In terms of sentiment, split test both positive and negative <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotions</a> in your headlines. By using the same targeting, but switching up the ad copy, you’ll be able to see which emotional appeal resonates best with your audience.</p>

<h4>Choose your call to action</h4>
<p>Once you enter your ad copy, enter your website URL and choose the call to action that makes the most sense for your offer. You can always A/B test this later!</p>

<h4>Confirm your tracking</h4>
<p>Last but definitely not least, make sure your website event tracking is set up (if you skipped it earlier). You&#8217;ll have the option to set up app and offline events if applicable, as well as set a unique URL parameter so you can identify visitors to your website from this ad.</p>

<h3>8. Publish!</h3>
<p>That green button on the bottom right of your screen never looked so beautiful. Once you hit publish, an algorithm (and sometimes a person) will review for any <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/16/facebook-ad-not-approved">Facebook Ad disapprovals</a>, so your ad can take 24 hours (sometimes more) to get approved. Once it&#8217;s up and running, your ad will go through a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/13/learning-period">learning period</a> during which Facebook will gather the performance data it needs to optimize who it delivers the ad to and when.</p>

<h3>How does the Facebook ad auction work?</h3>
<p>The Facebook ad auction works differently from the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/14/how-does-google-ads-work">Google Ads auction</a>. The key factors involved in determining who wins the Facebook Ads auction include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your bid</li>
<li>Your ad quality and relevance</li>
<li>Your estimated action rates</li>
</ul>
<p>These qualities ultimately determine your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/14/facebook-advertising-cost"></a>Facebook cost per click, which goes a long way in determining Facebook metrics that are tied more closely to revenue, like cost per action and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/18/facebook-ads-cost-per-lead"></a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/18/facebook-ads-cost-per-lead">cost per lead</a>.</p>
<p>In order to make your ads as relevant as possible, make sure your audience is meticulously crafted, your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/best-facebook-ads"></a>Facebook ad creative and messaging resonate with said audience, and you’re rotating new ads in and out of your campaign periodically.</p>
<h3>How much do Facebook ads cost?</h3>
<p>Depending on industry, campaign objective, and other factors, the average Facebook cost per click can range anywhere from a quarter to $5. For a deeper dive, refer to our post on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/12/facebook-ads-cost">Facebook ad costs</a>.</p>

<h3>How does Facebook remarketing work?<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/11/16/facebook-remarketing"></a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/11/16/facebook-remarketing">Facebook remarketing </a>(or retargeting) allows you to advertise to users who have already engaged with your business, such as on your website, app, Facebook Page, other Facebook ads, or even offline. You can upload lists of leads or customers to target, or the pixel and Conversions API can also help identify these users. You can even layer audiences by combining retargeting with detailed targeting.</p>
<p>However, as pixel data is less reliable due to privacy, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/06/facebook-ads-on-platform-engagement">retargeting users based on their engagement with your business on Facebook</a> itself is the way to go.</p>
<h3>How should I structure my account?</h3>
<p>For <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/13/facebook-advertising-tips">effective Facebook advertising</a>, your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/30/facebook-ads-account-structure"></a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/30/facebook-ads-account-structure">Facebook Ads account structure</a> should resemble a typical marketing funnel, with upper funnel campaigns devoted to prospecting, mid-funnel campaigns devoted to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-lookalike-audiences"></a>Facebook lookalike audiences and other audiences with mid-tier granularity, and lower-funnel campaigns devoted to highly refined Facebook remarketing audiences.</p>
<p>If you have the volume, you can also add broader Facebook lookalike audiences to your upper-funnel ad sets. And don’t forget to adjust your campaign objective based on the goal of each campaign. Your upper funnel campaigns should be geared toward driving awareness, getting clicks, and swelling your remarketing audiences, while your mid-and-lower-funnel audiences should be geared toward conversions (purchases, form fills, etc.). <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/26/how-to-optimize-facebook-ads">Head here for more Facebook ad optimization tips</a>.</p>
