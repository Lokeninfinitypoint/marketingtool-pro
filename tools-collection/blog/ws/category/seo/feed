<h2>SEO checklist for blog posts that rank</h2>
<p>Follow this fairly simple SEO checklist to give your content the best chance of ranking for relevant queries.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/seo-checklist-wordstream.webp" alt="seo checklist" width="900" height="770" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94797" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/seo-checklist-wordstream.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/seo-checklist-wordstream-480x411.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="check-your-target-keywords"></div>
<h3>1. Check your target keywords</h3>
<p>If you’re even interested in a checklist for blog posts that rank, you probably know to incorporate <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide">keyword research</a> into the process. Making sure your content is targeting the right keywords is obviously an important first step&#8211;with traditional considerations still being relevant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keywords with search volume</li>
<li>Keywords that are likely to be relevant to your audience</li>
<li>Keywords that your site is able to compete for</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/09/18/best-keyword-research-tools">Keyword tools</a> can help you get to this data, but now there are additional considerations for the terms you’re targeting. We’ll cover those next.</p>
<h4>Ensure topical alignment and authority</h4>
<p>Let’s say we have a website dedicated to a chain of medspas. We want to write an article about how long Botox lasts, and it looks like there’s enough search volume and low enough competition that targeting the term makes sense.</p>
<p>An initial check will be whether this term fits in with the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/topical-authority">topical authority</a> of our site.</p>
<p>What other kinds of terms does our site rank for?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ranking-search-terms-medspa.webp" alt="ranking terms for medspa in ahrefs" width="900" height="453" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94721" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ranking-search-terms-medspa.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ranking-search-terms-medspa-480x242.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It’s not uncommon that the top terms on the site will be branded or for a broad term the site ranks for. Still, you can also filter and dig down to see if you have terms of a similar competition level to the one you’re targeting that are semantically similar that you’re ranking for:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ranking-terms-botox-ahrefs.webp" alt="how often terms including botox are ranking for site in ahrefs" width="850" height="554" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94722" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ranking-terms-botox-ahrefs.webp 850w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ranking-terms-botox-ahrefs-480x313.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 850px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is a great sign for this site&#8211;they have related keywords that they’re already ranking for that are at a similar level of competition to our target term here.</p>
<p>We could also look at the number of pages on the site targeting these terms&#8211;if there’s already a cluster of 10+ pages on this topic, plus the site is ranking for related terms, that’s a great indication that we’re on the right track and will be able to create a blog post that ranks.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f50e.png" alt="🔎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Need help finding the right keywords?</strong> Try our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">Free Keyword Tool</a>!</p>
<h4>Check what’s in the SERP</h4>
<p>The next step is to check the actual search results to make sure that you’ll be able to get prominent placement (so that you both rank and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drive traffic</a>):</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/serp-for-botox-search.webp" alt="google serp for query about botox" width="399" height="1000" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94723" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/serp-for-botox-search.webp 399w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/serp-for-botox-search-120x300.webp 120w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /></p>
<p>This is a pretty common SERP, and a couple of things are concerning here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Overview</strong>: Multiple <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-ai-overviews-hurt-click-through-rates-454428" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies</a> (and even <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-explains-the-great-decoupling-39609.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admissions from Google</a>) have indicated that click-through rates on search results with an AI Overview are down. That doesn’t mean you can’t rank and drive clicks in this search result, but it complicates things somewhat.</li>
<li><strong>Medical sites:</strong> The presence of the Cleveland Clinic and The American Society of Plastic Surgeons at the top of the search results indicates that there may be a bias towards medical and authority sites in this SERP, but down the search result, we do see a medspa site and a couple of local-focused services sites ranking, so there’s some “hope” there.</li>
</ul>
<div id="give-google-what-they-want"></div>
<h3>2. Give Google what they want</h3>
<p>Next, you want to make sure that your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-write-a-blog-post">blog post</a> is a content type that Google “wants” to rank or has identified as an answer that searchers want.</p>
<p>This is more difficult than just copying the content type of the first result:</p>
<ol>
<li>Google will frequently list different content formats in the same SERP if some searchers are looking for a quick answer to the question, and others may be looking for a listicle or tool.</li>
<li>The “rules” are different for different types of sites. A highly authoritative site (like the Cleveland Clinic) may be able to rank first with a content type that your less authoritative medspa site can’t rank with.</li>
</ol>
<p>So you want to look at what’s ranking and build a better version of the asset type that sites with similar profiles (site type and level of authority) to yours are ranking with.</p>
<p>In the example above, you see the Cleveland Clinic has a general Botox guide ranking, but the medspa and services sites all have more specific answers to the question:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/types-of-content-ranking.webp" alt="types of content ranking in google for search" width="694" height="425" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94724" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/types-of-content-ranking.webp 694w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/types-of-content-ranking-480x294.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 694px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="demonstrate-eeat"></div>
<h3>3. Demonstrate EEAT</h3>
<p>There’s debate about the importance of “expertise, experience, authority, and trust” (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/14/google-e-e-a-t">EEAT</a>) in rankings for individual blog posts, but it’s a good idea to run through checks around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear author bios with additional information about authors, relevant video/social content, etc.</li>
<li>Information about the company, why readers should trust you, etc. (e.g., information about years of experience and expertise, development hours going into creating the product or service, number of customers/patients/clients).</li>
<li>Trust images and icons like major companies you work with, awards won, partners, testimonials, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Healthline ranks for the example query we used here&#8211;they rank well for many “Your Money or Your Life” queries and go above and beyond in this regard, with information on the medical reviewer on the post, as well as the author:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/your-money-your-life-medical-reviewer.webp" alt="reviewer bio for your money your life content" width="368" height="395" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94725" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/your-money-your-life-medical-reviewer.webp 368w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/your-money-your-life-medical-reviewer-279x300.webp 279w" sizes="(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px" /></p>
<p>And the article’s review history at the end of the post:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/content-review-transparency.webp" alt="content review transparency for EEAT" width="760" height="527" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94726" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/content-review-transparency.webp 760w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/content-review-transparency-480x333.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 760px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Including elements like this at the start of the post, in the right sidebar, or at the end of the post, and weaving in trust elements in the introduction of your post can help satisfy EEAT.</p>
<p>With best practices like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-increase-website-speed">improving page speed load times</a> and getting more branded mentions and searches, incorporating EEAT into your blog posts helps not only with SEO but also with conversion and visitor trust.</p>
<p>You don’t necessarily need to go to the lengths Healthline does if you’re a local business creating blog content in a less competitive non-YMYL niche, but baking EEAT elements into blog content helps that content rank and perform better.</p>
<div id="breakup-and-intelligently-format-content"></div>
<h3>4. Breakup and intelligently format content</h3>
<p>How you format your content is important for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ranking well in search engines (having the right content quickly and easily accessible to search engines).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/04/seo-content-readability">Readability</a> and ensuring your readers consume your content (which also impacts your engagement metrics and search engine rankings).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/generative-engine-optimization">Ranking well in AI tools</a> or LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure that your post is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Answering the core question quickly and succinctly. Look at the SERP again here&#8211;don’t just copy and paste an answer from an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-overviews-statistics">AI Overview</a> or featured snippet, but use the type of result (length, tone, etc.) that Google is returning as guidance for your own content.</li>
<li>Offering multiple formatting options where it makes sense (e.g., include an ordered list as well as the items as subheads within the post in a listicle).</li>
<li>Breaking up long blocks of text with numbered and bulleted lists, images, videos, social media posts, etc.</li>
</ul>
<div id="include-multiple-types-of-media"></div>
<h3>5. Include multiple types of media</h3>
<p>Along those lines, sourcing relevant images, videos, and social media posts can help with the engagement of your post, making it a more comprehensive resource, and allowing you to rank in different search results, like image search.</p>
<p>Set a word count (e.g., every 500 words) and make sure you include a piece of multimedia at that cadence through the article.</p>
<p>You can also look for opportunities to embed relevant video, or even create a relevant video based on your article (much easier now with AI voice and video generators).</p>
<div id="optimize-title-tags-and-meta-descriptions"></div>
<h3>6. Optimize title tags and meta descriptions</h3>
<p>If you’re focused on optimizing your blog post for SEO at all, you’re likely making sure you create a custom meta title tag and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/meta-description">meta description</a> as part of your process.</p>
<p>To optimize here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Think about the intent of the searcher&#8211;<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/06/irresistible-blog-post-titles">create a compelling title</a> and description that creates curiosity and makes a promise that searchers will want fulfilled.</li>
<li>Look at the search result&#8211;what types of titles and descriptions are present? Strike a balance between using any language you think will entice a click and differentiating your result (and remember to avoid “stealing” from larger sites that may just be there because of their authority).</li>
<li>Use tools like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/05/chatgpt-seo">ChatGPT</a> or similar to get ideas for optimized titles</li>
</ul>
<p>In our example result, there are a lot of title tags with variations of “how long does Botox last.” As you’re looking for language to include in your meta description or additional items to include in a title tag, the discussions and forums subsection can help:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/title-tag-sourcing-from-google-search-results.webp" alt="title tag and description ideas from google search results and forums" width="870" height="529" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94727" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/title-tag-sourcing-from-google-search-results.webp 870w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/title-tag-sourcing-from-google-search-results-480x292.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 870px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Some items to consider including based on the result:</p>
<ul>
<li>When will you be “back to normal”</li>
<li>Is it safe?</li>
<li>Factors that impact how long they last</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f50e.png" alt="🔎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Need help understanding the modern rules for SEO?</strong> Download our free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/how-to-do-seo-right?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SEOstrategies_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links/">How to Do SEO Right—Right Now!</a></p>
<div id="use-clean-simple-keyword-optimized-urls"></div>
<h3>7. Use clean, simple, keyword-optimized URLs</h3>
<p>Make sure that the URL of the post you’re publishing is clean, descriptive, and includes keywords (without being unnaturally crammed in).</p>
<div id="add-internal-links-to-relevant-pages"></div>
<h3>8. Add internal links to relevant pages</h3>
<p>Your writers should be looking for opportunities to link to relevant pages as they write, but before publishing, you also want to make sure there are internal links added where appropriate&#8211;e.g., if the article about Botox talks about facelifts and you have a page or post about it, make sure the link is included.</p>
<p>You can also look at your top-performing pages as well as pages on your site that are on the topic of the article, and include links to those. 5-10 is typically a good number to shoot for here.</p>
<div id="add-internal-links-from-relevant-pages"></div>
<h3>9. Add internal links from relevant pages</h3>
<p>Similarly, you want to find relevant pages on your site and include them in your new post. A quick site search operator is a good way to do this, and shows you which articles Google deems relevant for the topic of your post:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/find-internal-link-opportunities-google.webp" alt="how to find internal link opportunities" width="844" height="606" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94728" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/find-internal-link-opportunities-google.webp 844w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/find-internal-link-opportunities-google-480x345.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 844px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="implement-schema"></div>
<h3>10. Implement Schema</h3>
<p>Schema is a great opportunity to optimize for AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, etc.</p>
<p>Two types showing up frequently in those tools, and that will help Google better understand your blog content as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/faqpage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAQ schema</a></li>
<li><a href="https://schema.org/HowTo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HowTo schema</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re not sure about how your schema has been implemented, you can use Google’s <a href="https://search.google.com/test/rich-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rich results test</a>.</p>
<div id="check-that-post-is-ready-to-publish"></div>
<h3>11. Check that the post is indexable, images are optimized, etc.</h3>
<p>You can’t <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-ranking-factors-2025">rank in search results</a> if search engines aren’t indexing your content. Make sure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your page doesn’t have a noindex meta tag or a robots directive blocking it.</li>
<li>Items within the post (e.g., images) aren’t making your page unusually slow.</li>
<li>You actually published the page (and didn’t leave it as a draft, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>This is obviously an important round of checks to run as part of your publishing process.</p>
<div id="seo-checklist-template"></div>
<h2>SEO checklist template</h2>
<p>We pulled all of these items into an editable Google Sheets template&#8211;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/188_BkdsIt6ikpLG1UGhA5Jgv9_wxiT4fe0MEYrvzRA0/copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make a copy of it here</a>. Reference it as you brainstorm, write, and publish your content to give your posts the best chances for ranking in SERPs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/seo-checklist-template-wordstream-by-localiq.webp" alt="seo checklist template" width="900" height="667" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94729" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/seo-checklist-template-wordstream-by-localiq.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/seo-checklist-template-wordstream-by-localiq-480x356.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/188_BkdsIt6ikpLG1UGhA5Jgv9_wxiT4fe0MEYrvzRA0/copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click to copy</a></em></p>
<h2>Check all these items off your list for better SEO results</h2>
<p>If you run through these checks, you can continue to create blog content that ranks and drives traffic, leads, and sales through Google updates and the growth of AI tools.</p>

<h2>Top SEO trends and predictions for the rest of 2025</h2>
<p>Let’s break down what each of these trends and predictions is and what they mean for you and your strategy.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-predictions-2025.webp" alt="seo trends and predictions for the rest of 2025" width="900" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93394" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-predictions-2025.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-predictions-2025-480x427.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="seo-plus-geo"></div>
<h3>1. SEO now means “SEO” and “GEO”</h3>
<p>Whatever you want to call it, there’s been a lot of talk about SEO versus what I’ll call “GEO” (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/generative-engine-optimization">Generative Engine Optimization</a>)—the optimization of a site or business for visibility and placement within <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-ai-tools">AI tools</a> like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-geo-google-trends-searches.webp" alt="google trends result for searches for seo and geo" width="900" height="506" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93397" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-geo-google-trends-searches.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-geo-google-trends-searches-480x270.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There are several challenges in thinking about SEO and GEO right now:</p>
<ol>
<li>For most sites, SEO (or search traffic that comes primarily from Google or Bing) drives much more traffic than <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-referral-traffic">referrals from sites like ChatGPT, Claude, etc</a>. Even for sites that have lost traffic from Google.</li>
<li>It seems likely that that gap will close quickly in the coming months, but it’s difficult to tell how quickly and how much share will be directly “stolen” by AI tools or LLMs.</li>
<li>Many tactics that are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO best practices</a> are also best practices for gaining visibility in LLMs.</li>
<li>Some tactics will be much more valuable for placement in LLMs or won’t matter at all in SEO results, and some more aggressive GEO tactics could even get sites penalized in traditional <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-ranking-factors-2025">search rankings</a>.</li>
<li>SEO results are increasingly becoming a hybrid of traditional search results and AI-generated search results, with the increasing presence of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-overviews-impact-on-seo">AI Overviews in Google search results</a>.</li>
<li>Agentic search, or users using specific AI agents to perform specific tasks or answer specific questions, is in its infancy, and optimizing for placement in AI agents will likely require different tactics than either SEO or GEO.</li>
</ol>
<p>My prediction for the rest of 2025 is that for most businesses, the responsibility of “SEO” will encapsulate both optimizing for search placement on Google and placement in LLMs. Marketing teams or agencies will be expected to work on tasks that aid with both of these things. And, as the numbers for referrals from LLMs get more and more interesting, businesses will want to understand the optimization process and be willing to focus more resources on getting placement and visibility there. I also believe that in many cases, where <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/03/organic-traffic">SEO traffic</a> is less accessible for some sites, they’ll look to shift focus and investment from traditional SEO to GEO.</p>

<div id="schema-markup"></div>
<h3>2. Schema will be a focal point</h3>
<p>As Martha van Berkel <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/factors-to-consider-when-implementing-schema-markup-at-scale/543935/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently pointed out</a>:</p>
<p><em>“In March 2025, Fabrice Canel, principal program manager at Bing, confirmed that Microsoft uses structured data to support how its large language models (LLMs) interpret web content.</em></p>
<p><em>Just a day later, at Google’s Search Central Live event in New York, Google structured data engineer Ryan Levering shared that schema markup plays a critical role in grounding and scaling Google’s own generative AI systems. ‘A lot of our systems run much better with structured data,’ he noted, adding that ‘it’s computationally cheaper than extracting it.’”</em></p>
<p>As businesses become more interested in GEO in the remainder of 2025, the use of schema will become more of a focus.</p>
<p>The specific form of schema you’d use will vary from niche to niche, but a few that I predict will be more commonly used:</p>
<ul>
<li>FAQ</li>
<li>Carousel</li>
<li>Data Set</li>
<li>Q&amp;A and Forums</li>
<li>How-To</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-schema-detected.webp" alt="google search console showing structured data aka schema detected on site" width="834" height="340" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93398" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-schema-detected.webp 834w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-schema-detected-480x196.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 834px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And sites will continue to use schema like organization, product or software, recipe, etc. (but may be even more diligent in implementing these kinds of schema).</p>
<div id="brand-mentions-on-listicles"></div>
<h3>3. Brand mentions on listicles will be a big goal for many businesses</h3>
<p>As LLMs gain more and more traction through the rest of 2025, businesses will be looking for tactics that have characteristics like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving SEO traffic, particularly with mid to lower funnel terms.</li>
<li>Improving GEO visibility and rankings/traffic.</li>
<li>Helping with general marketing.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.siegemedia.com/conversation/aeo-playbook-how-to-optimize-for-ai-w-profounds-josh-blyskal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data suggests</a> that listicles get cited more than any other content type by LLMs currently. Additionally, GEOs are looking at <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/ai-overview-brand-correlation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how frequently your brand is mentioned</a> in conjunction with specific terms.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-search-for-inventory-management-software.webp" alt="chatgpt result for inventory management software search" width="900" height="501" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93399" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-search-for-inventory-management-software.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-search-for-inventory-management-software-480x267.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here’s an example of the power of listicles—a search for “email outreach software:”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/email-outreach-software-search-results-ai-overview-listing.webp" alt="email outreach software search result and ai over overview listing" width="900" height="479" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93400" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/email-outreach-software-search-results-ai-overview-listing.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/email-outreach-software-search-results-ai-overview-listing-480x255.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The results show a best of list from Saleshady. On the list itself, they rank themselves first, and list competitors:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-listicle-with-brand-names-saleshandy.webp" alt="listicle with brand names example from saleshandy" width="900" height="408" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93401" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-listicle-with-brand-names-saleshandy.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-listicle-with-brand-names-saleshandy-480x218.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Focusing on creating and getting listed on listicles and having your brand mentioned alongside the categories you want to show up for will be an increasingly emphasized and executed tactic as 2025 wears on.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Looking for more ways to drive people to your site?</strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website</a></p>
<div id="ai-overview-optimization"></div>
<h3>4. We’ll see more emphasis on AI Overview optimization<a href="http://rankhouse.pl"></a></h3>
<p>The image below is an example of “The Great Decoupling” in SEO, where many sites with AI Overviews in their highest traffic search results are seeing an increase in impressions from search but a drop in actual clicks or visits.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/great-decoupling-ai-overviews-plus-organic-traffic.webp" alt="picture of person presenting great decoupling in web traffic and impressions due to ai overviews" width="600" height="633" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93402" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/great-decoupling-ai-overviews-plus-organic-traffic.webp 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/great-decoupling-ai-overviews-plus-organic-traffic-480x506.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="http://rankhouse.pl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>This is because their site is getting featured in AI Overviews, but their listing in traditional search results is getting pushed down, resulting in less traffic.</p>
<p>As AI Overviews show up in an increasing number of search results in 2025, I predict there will be an increase in advice and emphasis on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-overviews-optimization">AI Overview optimization</a>.</p>
<p>Even though the click-through rate on those placements is much lower than traditional search, finding ways to get featured in and extract clicks from those listings will be the only available traffic in many SERPs, so businesses will turn to optimizing for that real estate (even if the traffic feels like crumbs compared to top rankings previously).</p>
<div id="mid-to-lower-funnel-content"></div>
<h3>5. We’ll see a shift toward mid-to-lower funnel content</h3>
<p>Along those same lines, as it becomes obvious that traffic from some top funnel, informational search queries “isn’t coming back,” sites will shift focus within their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/keyword-mapping">keyword targeting</a>.</p>
<p>While many search results may not be safe from AI Overviews, certain content types will perform better in a “post AI world,” and those will be more of a focus for websites and publishers looking to get traffic from SEO and GEO.</p>
<p>Let’s say you had an inventory management software company that had been generating a lot of top-funnel traffic from &#8220;what is X&#8221; types of queries, and traffic to glossary-style pages has dropped due to AI Overviews:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/inventory-management-ai-overview-result.webp" alt="ai overview result for search for what is inventory management" width="900" height="411" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93404" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/inventory-management-ai-overview-result.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/inventory-management-ai-overview-result-480x219.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The software category itself—while a competitive query—does allow for real estate for a software company:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/inventory-management-software-search-result.webp" alt="inventory management software search result" width="879" height="606" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93405" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/inventory-management-software-search-result.webp 879w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/inventory-management-software-search-result-480x331.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 879px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Similarly, the software category + the industries you serve, while not driving as much top-line traffic as what is X queries, could offer traffic and much stronger conversion rates:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hvac-inventory-management-software-search-results.webp" alt="hvac inventory management software search result" width="854" height="609" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93406" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hvac-inventory-management-software-search-results.webp 854w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hvac-inventory-management-software-search-results-480x342.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 854px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And you see here, by building comparison pages, this company is jumping ahead of the AIO (on desktop at the time of searching, anyway):</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-comparison-pages.webp" alt="example of comparison content pages" width="877" height="606" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93407" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-comparison-pages.webp 877w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-comparison-pages-480x332.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 877px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As the traffic opportunity for top-funnel, informational pages dries up, emphasis on these types of lower to mid-funnel content types will be even greater for the rest of 2025.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/first-page-of-google?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_10WaysFirstPageGoogle_Download">10 Tangible &amp; Free Ways to Get on the First Page of Google</a></p>
<div id="businesses-release-ai-tools"></div>
<h3>6. More businesses will release AI tools</h3>
<p>With the rapid improvement of AI coding tools (and the introduction of AI into various types of tools), creating simple, useful, free tools is easier than ever, but most sites and companies still aren’t taking advantage of it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-tool-website-speed-test-gtmetrix.webp" alt="example of an ai tool for a website speed test" width="900" height="399" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93408" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-tool-website-speed-test-gtmetrix.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-tool-website-speed-test-gtmetrix-480x213.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Additionally, while many affiliate sites have been wiped from search results after the <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-march-2024-core-update-rollout-is-now-complete-438713" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helpful Content Update</a>, many sites built around a core tool or set of tools are still thriving.</p>
<p>I predict the second half of 2025 will see more sites recognize this opportunity, and tools like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calculators</li>
<li>Interactive checklists or planners</li>
<li>Document generators (templates)</li>
<li>Niche-specific tools like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">The Free Keyword Tool</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And other tool types will be introduced to both answer search queries as a page and even serve as more and more businesses&#8217; homepage or above-the-fold experience.</p>
<p>Think about the types of problems your prospects have that can be solved with things like templates:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-ai-tools-research.webp" alt="example of ai tools opportunity research" width="900" height="511" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93409" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-ai-tools-research.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-trends-ai-tools-research-480x273.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And whether those templates can be turned into tools and calculators. A template could be transformed into empty fields for a visitor to input a project plan, or questions that imply a calculation. “How big should my dog crate be?” could be a dog crate chart and/or calculator. “What size TV should I get?” could be a TV size calculator.</p>
<p>These assets can help your SEO focused page rank, can generate links from other sites, and can be referenced in LLM results.</p>
<div id="link-building"></div>
<h3>7. Link building will become even more valuable</h3>
<p>If the above predictions are correct and more sites are attempting to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimize for both SEO and GEO</li>
<li>Focus more on mid to lower funnel topics for SEO</li>
<li>Increase brand mentions and placement on listicles</li>
</ul>
<p>Then “<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/link-building">link building</a>” as a tactic will become even more valuable and get more investment as the year goes on.</p>
<p>Specifically, the link-building tactics that best fit these three priorities include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Digital PR</strong>: High-quality links from major publications where thought leaders within a company and the industry itself is mentioned in conjunction with category terms help both SEO and GEO. Things like quotes in relevant articles, data-rich articles with specific insights for journalists, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Deep links</strong>: Deep links from tactics like guest posting into specific pages that are mid to lower funnel help support that strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Listicle placements</strong>: Again, with listicle placements, the links from these types of posts help SEO, and placement on these types of assets seems to disproportionately help with GEO placement and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/11/29/referral-traffic">referral traffic</a>. As a tactic, this can be either reaching out to existing assets for placement or creating an asset to be placed on a third-party site.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stay ahead of the changing SEO landscape throughout 2025</h2>
<p>For the remainder of 2025 (and into 2026), the overarching theme for businesses and websites looking to drive traffic from SEO will be to <strong>identify and exploit the opportunities that help drive both SEO and GEO traffic and leads</strong>.</p>
<p>Which specific tactics you focus on will vary depending on your site and your niche and will include a mix of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Link building</li>
<li>Brand mentions</li>
<li>Mid to lower funnel content</li>
<li>Tools</li>
<li>Schema</li>
</ul>
<p>Identifying the right mix of tactics for your business will help with both SEO and GEO growth for most sites.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2025 has been a crazy year in search engine optimization.

<h2>7 SEO ranking factors you need to optimize for in 2025</h2>
<p>Let’s get into the most important ranking factors to keep an eye on if you want your SEO strategy to excel this year.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/seo-ranking-factors-2025.webp" alt="seo ranking factors 2025" width="900" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93316" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/seo-ranking-factors-2025.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/seo-ranking-factors-2025-480x427.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="authority-and-links"></div>
<h3>1. Authority and links</h3>
<p>Domain authority, external links to specific pages, and internal links still matter a lot in Google searches.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/seo-ranking-factor-domain-authority.webp" alt="domain authority measurement from ahrefs" width="907" height="308" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93254" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/seo-ranking-factor-domain-authority.webp 907w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/seo-ranking-factor-domain-authority-480x163.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 907px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Semrush found <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/ai-mode-comparison-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a recent study</a> that AI Overviews showed significant overlap—around 86% domain and 67% URL—with traditional Google search results.</p>
<p>So whether your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-overviews-impact-on-seo">search results are being impacted by AI Overviews</a> or not, authority and links to your site (which have a massive impact on traditional organic rankings) are still important.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/link-building">Link building</a> can be done via a number of different methods. Some that “still work” to help impact this basket of ranking factors include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Links from profiles and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-citations">local citations</a> pointing to your domain and helping Google understand more about your business.</li>
<li>Digital PR links and general public relations links.</li>
<li>Guest posting.</li>
<li>Traditional link outreach.</li>
</ol>
<p>Within even those broad tactics, there are many more specific approaches (studies, data-focused articles, city-specific or localized content, etc.), but regardless of your approach, the volume and quality of links to your domain and to your site’s individual pages is a very important basket of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/09/google-ranking-factors">ranking factors</a> to keep in mind in 2025.</p>

<div id="engagement-metrics"></div>
<h3>2. Engagement metrics</h3>
<p>Google has <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long said</a> that factors like how quickly pages load and their mobile-friendliness are ranking factors. In recent years, through leaked documents and testimony, Google has <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/an-anonymous-source-shared-thousands-of-leaked-google-search-api-documents-with-me-everyone-in-seo-should-see-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted </a>that metrics like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/10/13/organic-seo-ctr-infographic">click-through rate</a> and how a searcher interacts with a search results page are ranking factors for Google.</p>
<p>This means that it’s still important to optimize for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pages that load quickly and are mobile-friendly.</li>
<li>Title tags and headlines that generate high click-through rates and deliver on the promises of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/meta-description">meta titles and descriptions</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/seo-meta-description-optimization.png" alt="seo meta description optimization" width="720" height="308" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63402" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/seo-meta-description-optimization.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/seo-meta-description-optimization-480x205.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="page-speed-and-page-experience"></div>
<h3>3. Page speed and page experience</h3>
<p>You can use free tools like <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s PageSpeed tool</a> or the <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GT Metrix testing tool</a> to get quick suggestions about tasks to clean up to help your pages load more quickly:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ranking-factors-page-speed-insights.webp" alt="google pagespeed tool recommendations" width="900" height="418" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93255" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ranking-factors-page-speed-insights.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ranking-factors-page-speed-insights-480x223.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you’re a small business owner, these insights may not mean much to you, but a web developer should be able to review these and address the highest impact, simplest items. Most often, we see sites with issues like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legacy JavaScript:</strong> This may be from a tool you no longer use, or some code that a developer added to your site previously that the site no longer needs—this is a great opportunity because it “costs” you nothing in terms of the site’s performance and helps speed things up.</li>
<li><strong>Render blocking:</strong> Often, your site may have a specific tool (like tracking tools or some specific code) that isn’t needed for the visitor to see your site immediately, but that you want to load eventually. You can load those elements later in the process and create a much better experience for visitors.</li>
</ul>
<p>These opportunities vary from site to site, but for most small businesses, there will be some opportunities like this.</p>
<p>Improving load times is especially valuable because it can also help your site’s conversion rates.</p>
<div id="click-through-rate-improvements"></div>
<h3>4. Click-through rate improvements</h3>
<p>Having pages—particularly your most popular pages—that are frequently clicked on when visitors see them in search results will have a major impact on your rankings.</p>
<p>The percentage of times searchers click on your website listings is your click-through rate, and you want to optimize this for key pages and for all of your pages. Your main opportunities here are a page’s meta title tag, and its meta description:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ranking-factors-click-through-rates.webp" alt="seo ranking factors - meta description example to increase ctr" width="900" height="308" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93256" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ranking-factors-click-through-rates.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ranking-factors-click-through-rates-480x164.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>How do you know what to include in the page title and meta description? Think of it like you would ad text in a pay-per-click ad:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understand basic marketing</strong>: Does your title and description satisfy the search queries that <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drive the most traffic</a> to the relevant page? What is the searcher really looking for? Try to find a way to:
<ol>
<li>Promise that thing.</li>
<li>Do it in a way that’s differentiated from other sites.</li>
<li>Make sure you deliver on that on the page.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Look at the SERP</strong>: A good place to look for ideas is in the search result itself. What is the title tag of sites ranking higher than yours? There may be multiple reasons those sites rank, so don’t just copy their titles and descriptions blindly, but it may give you some food for thought.</li>
<li><strong>Use AI tools</strong>: Title tags and meta descriptions are an area where tools like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/08/chatgpt-prompts">ChatGPT</a> or Perplexity are very good at ideation and giving you possible formats you can use. Give the tool as much information as you can (your title tag, the title tags of other pages that rank, the search terms your page shows up for, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Include your own data:</strong> Look in Google Search Console at your own pages. If there are specific pages that get a particularly high click-through rate (outside of your homepage, which likely does well because of branded traffic to your site), the title tag you use there may be a strong one to consider for other, similar pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Along those lines, if you have a site that’s getting a few hundred or even a few thousand visitors a month, you don’t need to spend a lot of time optimizing title tags and meta descriptions throughout your site. Focus on the few pages getting the most traffic from search, and the formula for collections of pages.</p>
<p>For instance, if you have a music lessons site with a series of local pages targeting terms like piano lessons in Kalamazoo, piano lessons in Portage, etc., look at the click-through rates for those pages, look at the ideas you have for the most highly trafficked pages there, and make changes across those pages and measure accordingly. You can do this periodically as well—probably every six months or so.</p>
<p>The more traffic your site and individual pages have, the more it makes sense to spend more time optimizing CTR and titles and descriptions.</p>

<div id="branded-search"></div>
<h3>5. Branded search</h3>
<p>Google has <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/googles-branded-search-patent-for-ranking-search-results/524083/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patents</a> for using branded search traffic as a proxy for how trusted a site should be. This can be a difficult thing to “optimize” for, but some ways to think about this include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PR.</strong> Traditional PR and getting featured in the publications your prospects read most often is a great way to get people to search for your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Signage, trucks, etc.</strong> Having signage for your business, wrapping trucks if you have a business where those are in the wild, etc., is another way to drive branded search.</li>
<li><strong>Partnerships.</strong> Partnering with relevant businesses (in the case of a local business, this could be other businesses in your area, particularly those that your best prospects would be likely to use—e.g., if you offer music lessons, a local musical instrument store, or even different companies offering kids’ activities).</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/branded-search-ranking-factor.webp" alt="example of a branded search" width="872" height="607" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93257" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/branded-search-ranking-factor.webp 872w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/branded-search-ranking-factor-480x334.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 872px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There are similar advantages to increasing branded search to improving page speed, in that you’re getting more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">brand awareness</a> generally and helping your business, not just your search rankings.</p>
<p>One note here: While Google has explicitly <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/unlinked-citations-google-rankings-29490.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that branded mentions that aren’t links are not a ranking factor, there is evidence that these help power your visibility in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-ai-tools">AI tools</a> like ChatGPT, Claude, etc., and that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-citations">citations</a> help with local rankings if you have a business focused on local SEO.</p>
<div id="content-relevance"></div>
<h3>6. Content relevance</h3>
<p>The idea that you would need to have a page be relevant to a search query is obvious, but becoming a “<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/topical-authority">topical authority</a>” and creating “<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/topic-clusters-for-local-seo">topic clusters</a>” for SEO is an additional factor that Google and Google patents have referenced many times.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topic-clusters-png.webp" alt="topic clusters how they work" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89790" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topic-clusters-png.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topic-clusters-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here are some of the things Google has said about topic clusters and building authority:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google prioritizes topic clusters</strong>: Google’s patents explicitly use the notion of “topical clusters” when weighting links. For example, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US7716225B1/en#:~:text=higher%20probability%20of%20being%20selected,or%20combinations%20of%20feature%20data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Google patent on ranking documents</a> notes that “<em>when a topical cluster associated with the source document is related to a topical cluster associated with the target document, the link has a higher probability of being selected.</em>” In other words, links between pages on the same topic (same topical cluster) are considered more likely (and thus more valuable) than links between unrelated pages.</li>
<li><strong>Internal links are important:</strong> In another Google patent on onsite ranking, Google describes how links from pages within the same site signal importance. It <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US8843477B1/en#:~:text=computers,include%20the%20number%20of%20keywords" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explains</a> that if “<em>numerous other web pages associated with the same domain contain links to that particular web page, the web page may be of greater importance within the domain compared to other web pages.</em>” This underscores that pages heavily linked by other pages on the same site (often topically related pages) are treated as more central within that site.</li>
<li><strong>It helps to merge related pages:</strong> Google’s John Mueller has <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/combining-web-pages/276633/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoken about</a> combining related pages to improve relevance. He explained that if you merge several weaker pages on a common topic into one, the resulting page becomes “<strong>a stronger page</strong>” because <em>“more parts of the site are referring to this one single piece of content, so it’s probably more relevant than those individual small pieces you had before.” </em>This reflects that internally linking and consolidating semantically related content boosts that content’s perceived relevance.</li>
<li><strong>A topic focus is essential:</strong> Mueller also <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/combining-web-pages/276633/#:~:text=,topic%20of%20this%20page%3F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cautioned against combining unrelated content</a>. He noted that merging “two completely separate pages” on different topics forces Google to ask <em>“What’s the primary topic of this page?”</em> This implies Google expects a clear, focused topic per page (and by extension per site section), suggesting a site should group similar topics rather than mix them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f698.png" alt="🚘" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Looking for more ways to drive people to your site?</strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website</a></p>
<div id="content-accessibility"></div>
<h3>7. Content accessibility</h3>
<p>Making pages and content accessible to search engines is the most fundamental way you can give your content a chance to rank.</p>
<p>If your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/no-website-traffic">site currently isn’t getting traffic</a>, you can run diagnostics and make sure that you don’t have issues with things like noindex tags, robots.txt directives, or other technical issues keeping your content from being crawled, indexed, and then returned in search results.</p>
<p>Google Search Console has helpful tools to identify whether pages have been discovered, crawled, or indexed:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indexation-ranking-factor.webp" alt="report for why pages aren't indexed in google search console" width="813" height="511" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93258" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indexation-ranking-factor.webp 813w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indexation-ranking-factor-480x302.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 813px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="ranking-for-search-everywhere-optimization"></div>
<h2>Bonus: Search “everywhere” optimization ranking factors</h2>
<p>While there’s a lot of back and forth about what to call getting visibility in tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc., some have argued that this kind of visibility <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/its-still-seo-search-everywhere-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is still SEO</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-overviews-optimization">AI Overviews</a> and placement in LLMs have their own set of ranking factors, and a lot of overlap with traditional SEO ranking factors (which still drive the majority of referred traffic from search for most sites).</p>
<p>Beyond these factors, specific things like using schema formatting, showing up prominently in listicles with brand mentions, and other factors can help your site show up in AI search results as well as traditional SERPs.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The latest statistics claim that Google search is <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-search-bigger-chatgpt-search-453142" target="_blank" rel="noopener">373 times</a> bigger today than ChatGPT search, yet most of us feel like it’s the other way around.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because lots of people aren&#8217;t clicking anymore. They&#8217;re <em>asking</em>.</p>
<p>Instead of browsing through search results, they&#8217;re getting instant, conversational answers from tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity. These generative engines are rapidly changing how people discover and consume information, and in many cases, your website isn&#8217;t even part of the equation.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-ctr-study-ai-overviews-rise-as-click-rates-decline/541465/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Search Engine Journal</a>, click-through rates for informational queries are dropping in sectors where AI Overviews appear in Google. At the same time, another report found that ChatGPT is processing <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/blog/insights/ai-news/chatgpt-daily-peak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 1.7 billion</a> visits per month, traffic that might have previously gone through traditional search.</p>
<p>This shift challenges the way we think about SEO and underscores the importance of abandoning outdated playbooks and developing new, more effective strategies that are better suited to this new terrain.</p>
<p>In this guide, I&#8217;ll break down what <strong>Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)</strong> really is, how it differs from classic SEO, and how you can evolve your strategy to stay discoverable no matter where or how people search.</p>

<div id="what-is-generative-engine-optimization-geo"></div>
<h2>What is Generative Engine Optimization?</h2>
<p>Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is the practice of optimizing content to appear as authoritative sources or direct responses within generative AI platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">traditional SEO</a>, which focuses on ranking in search engine results pages (SERPs) to earn clicks, GEO aims to position your content as the primary source that AI engines reference when generating answers. <strong>The goal shifts from earning a click to having your information included in the AI&#8217;s response.</strong></p>
<p>This represents a fundamental change in how we approach content optimization:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional SEO</strong>: Optimize for visibility in search results → Earn clicks → Convert users on your site</li>
<li><strong>GEO</strong>: Optimize to be the authoritative source → Get cited in AI responses → Build brand recognition and authority</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/seo-vs-geo-definition.webp" alt="geo vs seo differences and example" width="900" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93156" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/seo-vs-geo-definition.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/seo-vs-geo-definition-480x427.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This distinction is crucial because generative engines operate on different principles than traditional search:</p>
<ul>
<li>They don&#8217;t prioritize sending traffic to external websites.</li>
<li>They synthesize information from multiple sources into a single response.</li>
<li>They evaluate authority and trustworthiness differently from Google.</li>
<li>They prioritize content that fits their training parameters and retrieval mechanisms.</li>
</ul>

<div id="how-generative-ai-is-reshaping-the-search-landscape"></div>
<h2>How generative AI is reshaping the search landscape</h2>
<p>The shift toward generative AI as a primary information source is happening faster than many marketers realize. And the numbers back it up:</p>
<ul>
<li>According to Gartner, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/topics/generative-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">35%</a> of Gen Z now uses AI tools as their first stop for research questions, compared to 19% for millennials and 7% for Gen X.</li>
<li>Perplexity.ai, which launched in late 2022, already processes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/25/perplexity-says-its-now-serving-100m-search-queries-a-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 10 million</a> unique queries daily.</li>
<li>Stack Overflow reported a <a href="https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/the-fall-of-stack-overflow-fde10c0bab4e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">35%</a> reduction in question volume for programming topics since the launch of ChatGPT, as developers increasingly turn to AI for coding solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>This shift is particularly evident in specific sectors. “Technical searches (programming, data analysis), factual queries, and how-to content are migrating rapidly to AI platforms, while commercial searches still largely happen on traditional search engines,” explains <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-yoder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stephanie Yoder</a>, Director of Content at <a href="https://www.rebrandly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebrandly</a>.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve also seen a dramatic shift in discovery patterns, especially for deep-dive educational content,” Stephanie said. “People who used to spend 15–20 minutes reading multiple articles now get a synthesized answer from AI in under five minutes.”</p>

<p>This evolution creates both challenges and strategic opportunities. While websites providing straightforward factual information may experience traffic declines, those delivering unique insights, original research, and expert perspectives can position themselves as the authoritative sources that AI engines rely upon.</p>

<div id="geo-vs-seo-5-major-differences"></div>
<h2>GEO vs. SEO: What’s the difference?</h2>
<p>Let’s dive into the five major differences between GEO and SEO.</p>
<h3>1. Citations replace links (and they&#8217;re optional)</h3>
<p>In traditional SEO, links are everything. They <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drive traffic</a>, pass authority, and serve as the primary way users navigate to your content.</p>
<p>In the generative AI world, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-citations">citations</a> have replaced links. Links are now few or absent from the generated content.</p>
<p>When ChatGPT provides an answer synthesized from multiple sources, it rarely mentions where the information came from, let alone links to it.</p>
<p>Here’s a real-world example: I asked ChatGPT what plants keep mosquitoes away. It provided me with a list and tips but didn&#8217;t provide any sources.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/chatgpt-answer-no-links.webp" alt="example of chatgpt answer with no links or sources" width="900" height="543" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93134" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/chatgpt-answer-no-links.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/chatgpt-answer-no-links-480x290.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Even Perplexity, which does provide source attribution, typically lists references at the bottom of responses where, according to industry Reddit discussions, many users never scroll.</p>
<p><strong>GEO tip</strong>: Create &#8220;citation bait&#8221; content that generative engines will naturally pull in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop unique statistics through original research.</li>
<li>Craft clear, concise definitions that are easy for AI to extract.</li>
<li>Structure information in a way that makes it easy for AI to parse (tables, lists, step-by-step guides).</li>
<li>Create memorable statements and frameworks that are distinctive to your brand.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Authority signals matter more than ever</h3>
<p>Generative AI engines draw from sources they consider authoritative, making it harder for smaller or newer websites to gain visibility. However, what constitutes &#8220;authority&#8221; for an AI differs from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/09/google-ranking-factors">Google&#8217;s traditional ranking factors</a>.</p>
<p>While Google uses metrics like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/10/link-building-secrets">backlinks</a>, domain age, and engagement signals, generative AI models are trained on vast datasets where certain sources appear more frequently and are treated as more reliable. This creates a new paradigm for establishing authority.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ai-overviews-ranking-content.webp" alt="google ai overviews - top sources" width="500" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92056" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ai-overviews-ranking-content.webp 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ai-overviews-ranking-content-480x768.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For AI platforms, authority comes from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consistent presence across multiple high-quality platforms.</li>
<li>Recognition from established industry voices.</li>
<li>Clear expertise signals (author credentials, professional affiliations).</li>
<li>Structured content that follows well-established formats.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GEO tip</strong>: Build multi-dimensional authority signals that generative AI can recognize:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish on your domain but also on respected industry platforms.</li>
<li>Secure mentions from recognized experts in your field.</li>
<li>Include clear author credentials and expertise markers.</li>
<li>Create content that demonstrates specialized knowledge AI can&#8217;t synthesize.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Structured, fact-rich content becomes premium fuel</h3>
<p>Generative AI models love structure. They&#8217;re designed to identify patterns, extract key information, and recognize relationships between concepts. This makes highly structured, fact-dense content particularly valuable for these systems.</p>
<p>Content that performs best in generative engines includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear headings and subheadings that follow logical hierarchies.</li>
<li>Bulleted and numbered lists that organize information.</li>
<li>Tables that present comparative data.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/24/faq-page">FAQ sections</a> that directly address specific questions.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overview-faq-content-example.webp" alt="ai overview example with faq content structure" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91620" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overview-faq-content-example.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overview-faq-content-example-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Step-by-step guides with numbered instructions.</li>
<li>Clear definitions and explanations of concepts.</li>
</ul>
<p>This preference for structure explains why Wikipedia content appears so frequently in AI responses. It follows consistent formatting patterns that make information easy to extract.</p>
<p><strong>GEO tip</strong>: Structure your content for maximum AI parsing efficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use clear, descriptive headers that signal content relevance.</li>
<li>Organize information in lists, tables, and other structured formats.</li>
<li>Include concise definitions and explanations of key concepts.</li>
<li>Add <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/15/what-is-schema-markup">schema markup</a> to enhance AI understanding of your content.</li>
<li>Create dedicated FAQ sections that directly answer common questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>As Stephanie puts it: &#8220;The content that performs best in both traditional and generative search follows similar principles: it&#8217;s well-structured, authoritative, and clearly addresses user needs. The difference is that AI can extract and synthesize this information without requiring the user to visit your site.&#8221;</p>

<h3>4. Brand visibility must expand beyond traditional search</h3>
<p>In traditional SEO, ranking your own website is the primary goal. In GEO, your content needs to exist wherever generative AI might draw from.</p>
<p>When answering a question about local marketing strategies, generative AI might pull information from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook community groups</li>
<li>Yelp reviews and responses</li>
<li>Local business directories</li>
<li>Small business forums</li>
<li>Industry-specific blog comments</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/chatgpt-best-lawncare-dallas-source.webp" alt="chatgpt results for best lawncare dallas with source from angi" width="900" height="495" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93135" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/chatgpt-best-lawncare-dallas-source.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/chatgpt-best-lawncare-dallas-source-480x264.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This means relying solely on your website for visibility is no longer sufficient. Your brand needs to be present across multiple platforms in a consistent, recognizable way.</p>
<p><strong>GEO tip</strong>: Distribute expertise across the platforms that feed AI systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participate actively in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reddit-marketing">industry forums and communities</a>.</li>
<li>Publish on major content platforms (Medium, LinkedIn, etc.).</li>
<li>Create video content with optimized transcripts.</li>
<li>Engage in podcast interviews to generate transcribed content.</li>
<li>Contribute to open-source projects and public knowledge bases.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Brand mentions across diverse platforms create a network effect for AI visibility,&#8221; said <a href="https://oskarduberg.com/">Oskar Duberg</a>, a Freelance Content Specialist.  &#8220;When AI sees your brand referenced in multiple authoritative contexts, it&#8217;s more likely to include you in responses, even without direct links.&#8221;</p>
<h3>5. Content strategies are now prompt-driven</h3>
<p>People interact with generative AI differently than they do with search engines. Instead of short keyword phrases, they use conversational language, ask follow-up questions, and specify exactly what they want.</p>
<p>This creates a new dimension of optimization: creating content that aligns with how people prompt AI systems.</p>
<p>Consider these differences:</p>
<p><strong>Traditional search query</strong>: &#8220;best accounting software&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>AI prompt</strong>: &#8220;What&#8217;s the best accounting software for a family-owned restaurant with 12 employees that needs to track inventory and has a limited tech budget?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Traditional search query</strong>: &#8220;how to promote small business&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>AI prompt</strong>: &#8220;Can you suggest affordable marketing tactics for a new hair salon in a suburban area, focusing on attracting families and building repeat customers?&#8221;</p>
<p>These longer, more specific prompts require content that addresses nuanced questions and provides contextual information. One-size-fits-all content optimized for short keywords won&#8217;t satisfy these detailed requests.</p>
<p><strong>GEO tip</strong>: Create content that anticipates conversational prompts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research common question patterns in your industry.</li>
<li>Develop content that addresses specific use cases and scenarios.</li>
<li>Include comparisons that help AI differentiate between similar options.</li>
<li>Provide context-specific information (recommendations for different business sizes, industries, etc.).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post">Create content</a> that follows natural conversation flows with logical follow-up points.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to build a GEO strategy that works</h2>
<p>Now that you understand the differences between GEO and traditional SEO, here are tips to build your strategy.</p>
<h3>1. Design content for AI ingestion</h3>
<p>The first step in effective GEO is creating content that&#8217;s easily understood and extracted by AI systems. This goes beyond simple formatting to consider how AI processes and prioritizes information.</p>
<p><strong>Key principles for AI-optimized content</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Front-load critical information</strong>: Place key facts, definitions, and insights in the first few paragraphs.</li>
<li><strong>Use descriptive, keyword-rich headers</strong>: Make a section’s purpose immediately clear.</li>
<li><strong>Create self-contained sections</strong>: Each content block should stand on its own while fitting into the larger piece.</li>
<li><strong>Include clear signals of expertise</strong>: Demonstrate authority through data, expert quotes, and specific experience.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritize factual accuracy</strong>: AI systems increasingly verify information across sources.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Create multi-modal content</h3>
<p>Generative AI is rapidly evolving beyond text to understand and generate responses based on images, video, and audio. This creates opportunities to optimize multiple content types for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-referral-traffic">AI visibility</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies for multi-modal GEO</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimize video content with structured transcripts</strong>: Include timestamps, speaker identification, and clear section markers.</li>
<li><strong>Add descriptive alt text to images</strong>: Help AI understand visual content with detailed descriptions.</li>
<li><strong>Create data visualizations with clear labels</strong>: Make charts and graphs interpretable for AI systems.</li>
<li><strong>Develop content that combines multiple formats</strong>: Publish articles with embedded videos, images, and structured data.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/video-embedded-in-blog-post-ahrefs-example.webp" alt="example of blog post with video summary embedded" width="900" height="855" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93138" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/video-embedded-in-blog-post-ahrefs-example.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/video-embedded-in-blog-post-ahrefs-example-480x456.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This approach ensures that when ChatGPT-4 or Google&#8217;s Gemini analyzes a topic you&#8217;ve covered, you&#8217;ll have a higher likelihood of being referenced.</p>
<h3>3. Use digital PR and thought leadership for AI visibility</h3>
<p>Building <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/topical-authority">authority signals</a> across the digital ecosystem is crucial for GEO success. This requires a strategic approach to digital PR and thought leadership that ensures your brand is recognized as an authoritative source by AI systems.</p>
<p><strong>Effective strategies for building AI-recognizable authority</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Secure mentions in respected industry publications</strong>: Focus on quality over quantity.</li>
<li><strong>Develop signature frameworks or methodologies</strong>: Create distinctive approaches that become associated with your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Participate in industry research reports</strong>: Contribute data or expertise to major studies.</li>
<li><strong>Build personal brand authority for key team members</strong>: Establish individual expertise that reinforces organizational authority.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/expert-webinar-example-susie.webp" alt="webinar expert feature example susie email" width="900" height="595" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93140" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/expert-webinar-example-susie.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/expert-webinar-example-susie-480x317.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create a consistent presence on platforms that feed AI training data</strong>: Regularly publish on high-authority sites.</li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>
<p>This multi-platform approach ensures that when generative AI responds to questions about visual web development or no-code tools, Webflow&#8217;s perspectives are frequently included, even without direct attribution.</p>
<h3>4. Future-proof your content strategy for GEO</h3>
<p>As generative AI evolves, maintaining visibility will require an adaptive, forward-looking strategy that balances traditional SEO with emerging GEO practices.</p>
<p><strong>Key principles for a future-proof content approach</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Balance depth with accessibility</strong>: Content that&#8217;s both comprehensive and easy for AI to parse.</li>
<li><strong>Invest in proprietary data</strong>: Original research that can&#8217;t be synthesized from other sources.</li>
<li><strong>Develop a distinctive brand voice</strong>: Unique perspectives that stand out in AI-generated content.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on expertise areas</strong>: Double down on topics where you have genuine authority.</li>
<li><strong>Create content that answers &#8220;why,&#8221; not just &#8220;what&#8221;:</strong> Provide context and reasoning that AI struggles to synthesize.</li>
</ul>
<div id="how-to-measure-geo-success"></div>
<h2>How to measure GEO success</h2>
<p>Measuring GEO effectiveness requires new metrics beyond traditional <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/27/seo-metrics">SEO KPIs</a> like rankings and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/03/organic-traffic">organic traffic</a>. Different tracking approaches are needed since the goal is to appear in AI-generated responses rather than drive direct website visits.</p>
<h3>Key metrics for GEO success</h3>
<p>Here are the metrics to keep an eye on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brand mention frequency</strong>: How often your brand appears in AI responses to relevant queries.</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy of representation</strong>: Whether AI systems correctly represent your products, services, and perspectives.</li>
<li><strong>Authority positioning</strong>: Whether you&#8217;re positioned as a primary or secondary source.</li>
<li><strong>Attribution rate</strong>: How often your brand receives direct attribution in AI responses.</li>
<li><strong>Competitive presence</strong>: How your mention frequency compares to competitors for similar queries.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tools to measure GEO results</h3>
<p>Several tools are emerging to help track these metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://labs.perplexity.ai/"><strong>Perplexity Labs</strong></a>: Allows monitoring of source attribution in Perplexity responses.</li>
<li><a href="https://contentlab.ai/"><strong>ContentLab AI</strong></a>: Tracks brand mentions across multiple AI platforms.</li>
<li><a href="https://brandmentions.com/"><strong>BrandMentions</strong></a>: Expanded to include AI mention monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Custom prompt testing</strong>: Systematically testing key industry prompts across AI platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re still in the early days of GEO measurement,&#8221; Oskar said. &#8220;But forward-thinking companies are already building systems to track their visibility in AI responses, similar to how we once tracked SERP rankings.&#8221;</p>
<p>A practical approach is to create a &#8220;prompt map&#8221; of the key questions in your industry, then regularly test these prompts across major AI platforms to track:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whether your brand is mentioned</li>
<li>How prominently you&#8217;re featured</li>
<li>Whether information is accurate</li>
<li>If competitors are mentioned more frequently</li>
</ol>
<p>This data can help guide your GEO strategy and measure improvement over time.</p>
<h2>GEO and the new search paradigm</h2>
<p>We&#8217;re witnessing the most significant shift in information discovery since Google&#8217;s inception. Just as some businesses failed to adapt to the move from print to digital, those who ignore the rise of generative AI risk becoming invisible in the new search landscape.</p>
<p>But this shift also creates unprecedented opportunities. Brands that understand how to create AI-optimized content, build recognized authority, and maintain presence across the digital ecosystem will find themselves naturally featured in the AI responses that increasingly shape how people find information.</p>
<p>The future of search is not about choosing between traditional SEO and GEO—it&#8217;s about creating an integrated strategy that ensures visibility regardless of how people seek information.</p>
<p>As you develop your approach, remember that while technology changes rapidly, the fundamentals remain the same: providing genuine value, demonstrating clear expertise, and meeting user needs will always be rewarded, regardless of which algorithms or AI systems stand between you and your audience.</p>
<p>For brands willing to embrace this new paradigm, the opportunities are just beginning to unfold.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the zero-click era that we live in now, it’s not about producing more content. It’s about creating content that&#8217;s strategically structured to demonstrate expertise across an entire topic.</p>
<p>That’s where topical authority comes in. When your site connects the dots, answers the full range of questions, and shows clear ownership of a subject, that’s when trust starts to build.</p>
<p>Topical authority isn’t a growth hack. It’s building compounding interest. The more clearly and completely you cover a topic, the more visible and credible you become across queries, snippets, and even AI-generated summaries.</p>
<p>This guide shares 14 proven strategies for building topical authority, from internal linking to semantic structure. Follow it to turn scattered posts into a focused content system that gets noticed and remembered.</p>

<h2>What is topical authority?</h2>
<p>Topical authority is the deep, organized expertise your site conveys on a specific subject. It <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google">increases your ability to rank</a> for related keywords. It’s not about publishing more content. It’s about covering a topic thoroughly and with intention.</p>
<p>The most effective sites aren’t content mills. They’re structured knowledge hubs. Instead of jumping between unrelated posts, they delve deeply into a core topic, exploring every angle and connecting the pieces through strategic<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/04/internal-linking"> internal linking</a>. Over time, this creates a content ecosystem that’s greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-animal-hospital.webp" alt="Topical authority - blog from an animal hospital." width="937" height="502" class="aligncenter wp-image-92429 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-animal-hospital.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-animal-hospital-480x257.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.animalhospitalofclemmons.com/site/veterinary-pet-care-blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>When you <a href="https://www.animalhospitalofclemmons.com/site/veterinary-pet-care-blog/category/dogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cover a topic completely</a>, like animal health, you prove your authority with algorithms and visitors.</p>
<p>As Stephanie Yoder, Director of Content at <a href="https://www.rebrandly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebrandly</a>, explains, “A content hub has to: 1. Be super important to your audience (otherwise, why invest the effort), 2. Be broad enough to warrant multiple posts that cover different facets of the topic, and 3. Have real SEO value. I typically look for overarching topics with lots of different dimensions. For example, ‘Employee Onboarding,’ which can then be broken down into subtopics like onboarding checklists, best practices, common mistakes, etc.”</p>
<p>When you structure your content this way (around a topic that matters, with clear depth and cohesion), you don’t just look authoritative. You become authoritative. That’s the signal Google is looking for and the kind of resource<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience"> your audience</a> will keep returning to.</p>

<div id="why-does-topical-authority-matter"></div>
<h2>Why does topical authority matter?</h2>
<p>Topical authority isn’t just a best practice. It’s the bedrock of how modern search works.</p>
<p>Since Google launched the <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/08/helpful-content-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helpful Content System</a>, the algorithm favors sites that demonstrate genuine subject-matter expertise. Thin pages or disconnected posts won’t cut it. Search engines are looking for depth, clarity, and cohesion. These are now signals that show you’re not just creating content but answering real<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-intent"> user intent</a>.</p>
<p>That’s where topical authority gives you a strategic advantage. It improves your rankings, increases your relevance across long-tail queries, and builds lasting credibility.</p>
<p>Take Zapier, for example. Instead of publishing isolated tutorials, they built tightly structured guides, app comparisons, and use-case workflows. Each piece reinforces the others around core themes like automation and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-productivity-tools">productivity</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-zapier.webp" alt="Topical authority - Zapier blog." width="937" height="518" class="aligncenter wp-image-92430 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-zapier.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-zapier-480x265.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://zapier.com/resources/guides" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>That interconnected ecosystem now drives thousands of ranking keywords, steady <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2010/04/01/build-amazing-backlinks">backlinks</a>, and a compounding stream of non-branded traffic.</p>
<p>They don’t just rank for their product; they also rank for related products. They also rank for the problems their audience is trying to solve.</p>
<p>Topical authority makes you more visible, more trustworthy, and more useful. In a nutshell, that’s what <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-algorithm-documents-leak">Google is really measuring</a>.</p>
<div id="how-google-evaluates-topical-authority"></div>
<h2>How Google evaluates topical authority</h2>
<p>Google doesn’t publish an exact formula for measuring topical authority, but its behavior makes the framework clear. Here’s what Google is likely assessing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coverage of related subtopics:</strong> Are you answering the full range of questions your audience asks around this topic? Gaps in coverage often signal a lack of expertise.</li>
<li><strong>Internal link structure:</strong> Do your articles connect logically, guiding users and crawlers through a well-structured knowledge graph? Strong clusters show intent and organization.</li>
<li><strong>External validation:</strong> Are you earning links, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-citations">citations</a>, or mentions from other reputable sources? Authority spreads when others in your space acknowledge your work.</li>
<li><strong>Semantic relevance:</strong> Are your topics aligned under a clear thematic umbrella, with consistent terminology and supporting entities? Google&#8217;s semantic systems prioritize coherence over keyword repetition.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a deeper understanding of these signals, refer to<a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/hsw-sqrg.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Google’s documentation on search quality</a> and its alignment with topical breadth, site structure, and credibility.</p>

<div id="14-ways-to-build-topical-authority"></div>
<h2>14 ways to build topical authority</h2>
<p>The good news is that you have considerable control over establishing authority on your website. These 14 strategies will make sure you’ve done it thoroughly.</p>
<h3>Content strategy</h3>
<p>The first four tactics will help you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-plan">develop an authoritative content strategy</a>.</p>
<h4>1. Create comprehensive content hubs</h4>
<p>Use a hub-and-spoke model, also known as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/topic-clusters-for-local-seo">content clusters</a>, to organize your content. In this configuration, a central pillar page links to multiple subtopics, forming a semantic network Google can follow.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-topic-clusters.webp" alt="Topical authority - topic cluster graphic." width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92431 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-topic-clusters.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-topic-clusters-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>“A blog article scratches an itch. A hub cures the whole rash,” says <a href="https://oskarduberg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oskar Duberg</a>, a Content Marketing Consultant. &#8220;If it has subtopics, stages, or variations worth unpacking, it probably needs its own structured home.&#8221;</p>
<h4>2. Cover the entire topic, not just keywords</h4>
<p>Use semantic tools like <a href="https://alsoasked.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AlsoAsked</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/05/chatgpt-seo">ChatGPT</a> to discover subtopics. Your goal is to answer the complete set of user questions, not just high-volume queries.</p>
<p>A great example is <a href="https://www.healthline.com/program/managing-type-2-diabetes-with-food-and-fitness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Healthline&#8217;s diabetes content cluster</a>. Rather than writing one article on &#8220;diabetes symptoms,&#8221; they built a full ecosystem, covering causes, treatment options, diet plans, medication guides, and FAQs. This breadth and depth helped them dominate SERPs for thousands of diabetes-related queries, earning both rankings and trust.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-diabetes.png" alt="Topical authority - Diabetes care blog." width="937" height="548" class="aligncenter wp-image-92423 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-diabetes.png 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-diabetes-480x281.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.healthline.com/program/managing-type-2-diabetes-with-food-and-fitness" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h4>3. Build supporting content around pillars</h4>
<p>Think of your content ecosystem like a city grid: your pillar page is the downtown hub (e.g., “Diabetes: Symptoms, Causes, Treatment”), and the spoke articles are the surrounding neighborhoods that add depth and nuance.</p>
<p>Healthline follows this model masterfully. Their flagship diabetes pillar page includes links to detailed spokes such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Risk Factors &amp; Complications: “<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/kidney-disease/risk-chronic-kidney-disease-diabetes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Risk Factors for Chronic Kidney Disease with Type 2 Diabetes</a>”</li>
<li>Types &amp; Diagnosis: “<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes/is-type-2-diabetes-an-autoimmune-diease" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Is Type 2 Diabetes an Autoimmune Disease?</a>”</li>
<li>Nutrition Guidance: “<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/video/diabetes-nutrition-101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diabetes Nutrition 101</a>” article focuses solely on meal planning and dietary tips.</li>
<li>Mental Health Angle: “<a href="https://www.healthline.com/diabetesmine/becoming-a-diabetes-mental-health-professional" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why I’m Becoming a Diabetes Mental Health Professional</a>” article explores psychosocial aspects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each spoke enriches the overall narrative and reinforces the central pillar. Together, they improve user navigation and signal depth and cohesion to Google.</p>
<h4>4. Refresh and expand old content</h4>
<p>Show Google that your content is actively maintained. Update older pages with new data, improved structure, and refreshed internal links to signal relevance.</p>
<p>HubSpot is a standout example. They’ve been doing this for years. They routinely refresh high-performing posts by adding new stats, clarifying outdated advice, and optimizing for featured snippets.</p>
<p>Refreshing content isn’t just maintenance. It’s leverage. Instead of starting from scratch, you’re building on assets that already have authority, backlinks, and a search history.</p>
<h3>Structural signals</h3>
<p>Once you’ve developed content depth, structure is what helps Google (and users) recognize it. These next tactics are all about creating structure.</p>
<h4>5. Use internal linking strategically</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/04/internal-linking">Internal links</a> are the backbone of any content cluster. They guide users, shape topic relationships, and help search engines understand what belongs together.</p>
<p>The key is intentional linking. Don’t just drop links for convenience. Connect related pages using descriptive<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/anchor-text#:~:text=Anchor%20text%20is%20the%20clickable,and%20underline%20through%20html%20code."> anchor text</a> that accurately reflects the actual subtopics. This helps Google recognize content relationships at scale.</p>
<p>Oskar explains it this way: “Treat your content like a city grid. If you need a spreadsheet to keep track, good—you&#8217;re doing it right.”</p>
<p>Think of your main topic pages as central hubs. Then, use internal links to connect them to relevant spoke pages that go deeper. Tools like Screaming Frog or Link Whisper can help you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/10/content-audit">audit</a> and optimize your structure.</p>
<h4>6. Build clear URL structures around topics</h4>
<p>URL structure matters for both humans and search engines. Clean, keyword-rich URLs make it easier to understand what a page is about and how it fits into a broader content system.</p>
<p><strong>Poor URL structure:</strong><br />
example.com/blog?id=421<br />
(Doesn’t tell you anything about the topic.)</p>
<p><strong>Better URL structure:</strong><br />
example.com/seo/on-page-seo-guide<br />
(Clearly signals the category and specific topic.)</p>
<p>Where possible, group related URLs under consistent folders or subdirectories (e.g., /seo/, /email-marketing/). This reinforces topic clusters and improves crawl efficiency.</p>
<h4>7. Implement topic tags or categories</h4>
<p>Categories and tags aren’t just for organizing your blog. They help Google understand what your content is about and how everything connects.</p>
<p>But here’s the catch: they only work when used strategically. Random or excessive tagging, often called “tag bloat,” can confuse both users and search engines. A well-planned taxonomy reinforces topical authority by making your site easier to crawl, navigate, and group by meaning.</p>
<p>Categories should align with your main content themes—the high-level topics your audience returns to.</p>
<p>Tags should highlight specific subtopics, use cases, or recurring ideas that show up across multiple posts.</p>
<p>Real-world small business examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A local fitness coach&#8217;s blog</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Categories</em>: Strength Training, Nutrition, Mindset</li>
<li><em>Tags</em>: Home Workouts, Protein Intake, Burnout, Meal Prep</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>An ecommerce site selling eco-friendly home goods</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Categories</em>: Kitchen, Bathroom, Cleaning Products</li>
<li><em>Tags</em>: Plastic-Free, Compostable, Low-Waste Tips, DIY Cleaners</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>A digital marketing freelancer’s site</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Categories</em>: SEO, Social Media, Email Marketing</li>
<li><em>Tags</em>: Google Business Profile, Instagram Reels, Lead Magnets, Deliverability</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each tag or category should support a topic cluster. If a piece of content doesn’t clearly belong anywhere, either rework it to align better or reconsider whether it needs to exist at all.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-physical-therapy.webp" alt="Topical authority -physical therapist blog." width="937" height="583" class="aligncenter wp-image-92433 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-physical-therapy.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-physical-therapy-480x299.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.benchmarkpt.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Think of your taxonomy as a topic map for both readers and search engines. The clearer the structure, the stronger the authority signals it sends.</p>
<h4>8. Add a table of contents to long-form posts</h4>
<p>A table of contents (TOC) improves both usability and crawlability. It helps readers navigate longer guides without getting lost while also signaling subtopics to Google.</p>
<p>When each section in your TOC is linked with in-page anchors like the ones in this article (e.g., #what-is-topical-authority, #why-does-topical-authority-matter), you increase the chance of getting site links in SERPs or capturing featured snippet jump links.</p>
<p>On WordPress? Try the<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/luckywp-table-of-contents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> LuckyWP Table of Contents plugin</a> for an easy implementation.</p>
<h4>9. Use schema markup to enhance context</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/15/what-is-schema-markup">Schema markup</a> adds a layer of structured meaning to your content, helping Google understand what type of content it is and how it should appear in search.</p>
<p>Here are a few useful schema types for content clusters:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FAQ and HowTo:</strong> Ideal for practical subtopics or support-style articles.</li>
<li><strong>Article and Breadcrumb:</strong> Help define page structure and improve navigability.</li>
<li><strong>Organization, Author, and WebPage:</strong> Reinforce site credibility and ownership.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use tools like<a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/markup-helper/u/0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Google’s Structured Data Markup Helper</a> or<a href="https://schema.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Schema.org</a> to build valid markup or implement it using your CMS or SEO plugin.</p>
<h3>Authority and trust signals</h3>
<p>These final tips will help you demonstrate that your website has authority in a particular topic and highlight key trust signals to both readers and search engines.</p>
<h4>10. Get backlinks from topic-relevant sites</h4>
<p>Not all <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/10/link-building-secrets">backlinks</a> carry the same weight. A link from a general high-authority domain might boost your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/12/domain-authority">Domain Rating</a> (an estimate of how likely your web pages are to rank in search), but what matters for topical authority is relevance. Google gives more weight to backlinks from sites that operate in the same niche or cover similar subject matter.</p>
<p>That’s because topical links signal endorsement from within your own knowledge space. If you run a financial coaching blog and get linked from a niche investing site, that tells Google your insights are trusted <em>within the topic ecosystem</em>, not just by the internet at large.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Prioritize niche guest posts, podcast features, or digital PR opportunities where your content contextually fits the audience. A link from a niche authority will always outrank a random inclusion on a generalist site.</p>
<h4>11. Publish content written or reviewed by experts</h4>
<p>Google aims to elevate content written by individuals with proven expertise, particularly in sensitive or complex fields such as health, finance, or law. But this applies more broadly to any competitive topic where trust matters.</p>
<p>That means slapping a byline on a post isn’t enough. You need to show credentials, explain your experience, and, in some cases, cite the expert who reviewed the content.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-retirement.webp" alt="Topical authority -how to save for Retirement blog post." width="608" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92434 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-retirement.webp 608w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-retirement-480x474.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 608px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/how-to-save-for-retirement" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>“Publishing content for content’s sake won’t get you far,” Stephanie said. “To dominate a niche, you need to become a one-stop resource.”</p>
<p>Ways to demonstrate expertise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include a short author bio that explains why this person is qualified to write about the topic.</li>
<li>Add a “Reviewed by” section when content is medically, legally, or technically sensitive.</li>
<li>Link to your authors’ LinkedIn profiles, credentials, or previous industry work.</li>
</ul>
<h4>12. Feature original research or insights</h4>
<ol start="12"></ol>
<p>Few things build authority faster than original data.</p>
<p>Whether it’s a small survey, a large-scale study, or even just your own customer insights, publishing proprietary information positions your site as a source, not just a repeater.</p>
<p>It also earns backlinks. A standout example is Backlinko’s <a href="https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO Ranking Factors Study</a>, which analyzed over 11 million search results. That one piece has earned thousands of citations from sites like Forbes, HubSpot, and Search Engine Journal—and continues to surface in AI-generated content summaries years later.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-domain-rating.webp" alt="Topical authority -Backlinko data post." width="604" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92435 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-domain-rating.webp 604w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-domain-rating-480x477.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 604px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>“Original research gets quoted, linked, and resurfaced by AI tools whether you asked for it or not,” Oskar said. “It’s a multiplier, not just a tactic.”</p>
<p>Not sure where to start? Even small data sets, such as the results of a LinkedIn poll or anonymized trends from your customer base, can be effective when presented clearly and tied to a broader narrative.</p>
<h4>13. Engage in thought leadership on the topic</h4>
<p>Google doesn’t just crawl your blog. It also captures off-site trust signals, especially on platforms where authorship and authority are more visible, such as<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/generating-leads-on-linkedin"> LinkedIn</a>, YouTube, or podcasts.</p>
<p>By consistently sharing your thoughts in public, you reinforce both human trust and algorithmic trust in your name, brand, and domain.</p>
<p>Examples of thought leadership channels:</p>
<ul>
<li>LinkedIn articles or long-form posts</li>
<li>Webinars, conference talks, or community events</li>
<li>Guest spots on industry podcasts</li>
<li>Contributed bylines (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/06/21/guest-posting-dos-donts">guest posting</a>) on niche publications</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need to be everywhere. But you do need to show up consistently in at least one or two places where your audience and Google can see that your expertise reaches beyond your own site.</p>
<h4>14. Include expert quotes or collaborators</h4>
<p>Bringing outside voices into your content is one of the easiest ways to boost credibility and often opens the door to natural backlinks or co-promotion.</p>
<p>Featuring an expert quote does three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adds trust and depth to your article</li>
<li>Signals topical authority to Google via co-citation</li>
<li>Makes the contributor more likely to share or link to your piece</li>
</ol>

<p>Tools like <a href="https://helpab2bwriter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Help a B2B Writer</a> and <a href="https://featured.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Featured</a> make it easy to source expert input. But you can also reach out directly to respected voices in your niche.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Treat expert collaboration like content co-creation, not just a last-minute add-on. Build it into your workflow early so your piece can be shaped (and strengthened) by real insights from the start.</p>

<h2>How to track topical authority progress</h2>
<p>Topical authority isn’t a set-it-and-forget-it effort. Like any long-term strategy, it requires regular check-ins to measure progress and identify areas for improvement. Here are four high-signal metrics that tell you whether your efforts are paying off.</p>
<h3>Keyword universe growth</h3>
<p>Don’t just track a few <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2010/07/21/blog-keyword-targeting">target keywords</a>. Track how your universe is expanding. Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/online-seo-tools">SEO tools</a> like Ahrefs, Semrush, or Google Search Console to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;re showing up for more semantically related queries over time.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re capturing more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/long-tail-keywords">long-tail keywords</a> around your core topic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Growth in keyword variety (especially in lower-difficulty terms) shows that Google sees your content as a relevant answer source across the topic spectrum.</p>
<h3>Cluster ranking trends</h3>
<p>Instead of monitoring post-by-post performance, zoom out. Are multiple pages in the same topic cluster moving up in rankings?</p>
<p>When Google starts ranking your ecosystem, not just individual pages, that’s a strong signal of topical authority. It means your internal structure is working, and your content is seen as a comprehensive resource.</p>
<h3>Internal link coverage</h3>
<p>Strong internal linking helps keep your topic clusters cohesive. Use Ahrefs or Screaming Frog to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify orphaned or weakly linked pages.</li>
<li>Visualize internal link pathways between core topics and subtopics.</li>
<li>Check if your most authoritative content is linking out to relevant spokes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is less about quantity and more about semantic logic. Internal links should reinforce how your ideas connect.</p>
<h3>External recognition</h3>
<p>Topical authority isn’t just about what’s on your site. It’s also reflected in how others reference it. Look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mentions or citations in peer blogs, newsletters, or industry publications.</li>
<li>AI engine recognition (e.g., showing up in ChatGPT summaries or SGE panels).</li>
<li>Natural backlinks to your guides, data, or frameworks.</li>
</ul>
<p>When others view your site as the go-to source, Google often follows suit.</p>
<div id="future-proofing-your-topical-authority-strategy"></div>
<h2>Future-proofing your topical authority strategy</h2>
<p>SEO is evolving fast, but the core idea behind topical authority is built to last. Here’s how to stay ahead of the curve as search (and searchers) change:</p>
<h3>Follow helpful content principles</h3>
<p>Google’s Helpful Content System prioritizes content that’s written for people, not just for crawlers. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t publish unless it solves a real problem.</li>
<li>Prioritize clarity, completeness, and trustworthy sourcing.</li>
<li>Cut the filler—depth doesn’t mean word count.</li>
</ul>
<p>Topical authority isn’t about publishing more. It’s about building better answers across a structured topic map.</p>
<h3>Adapt for generative AI</h3>
<p>With <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-overviews-breaking-search">AI Overviews</a> and AI tools like ChatGPT shaping how people discover answers, topic depth matters more than ever.</p>
<p>AI systems summarize what they perceive as the most trustworthy and structured information. Sites that build clean, interconnected content clusters are more likely to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quoted directly in AI answers.</li>
<li>Used as source material for summaries.</li>
<li>Recommended as “further reading” in SGE carousels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Investing in topic modeling and semantic structure now helps you stay visible and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-referral-traffic">drive referral traffic from AI sources</a>, even when search becomes less clickable.</p>
<h3>Conduct quarterly audits</h3>
<p>Topical authority compounds over time, but only if it’s maintained.</p>
<p>Once a quarter, run an audit to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify underperforming or outdated pages.</li>
<li>Add internal links between new and legacy content.</li>
<li>Expand gaps in your clusters (new questions, subtopics, tools, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Build topical authority and own the rankings</h2>
<p>Google has moved from keyword matching to topic modeling. And that’s good news. Why? Because small sites can now compete with giants if they prove they know their stuff.</p>
<p>Start by mapping your core topics. Then, build content clusters around them, audit them quarterly, and keep sharpening the signal.</p>
<p>Topical authority isn’t just about ranking. It’s about earning trust, sustaining traffic, and becoming the site people (and algorithms) rely on.</p>

<h2>SEO statistics for industry growth and market trends</h2>

<h2>SEO and AI statistics</h2>
<p>The specter looming over most SEO-related conversations in 2025 is AI.

<h2>On-page and technical SEO statistics</h2>
<p>Google is notoriously tight-lipped about how, exactly, it <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-algorithm-documents-leak">ranks sites in search</a>. But we’ve long known that technical elements like page load time and mobile friendliness play a role. These statistics shed some light on just how much (or how little) certain <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/06/on-page-seo">on-page</a> and technical elements really impact SEO.</p>
<ul>
<li>An analysis of more than 2,300 websites found that Google rewrote over <a href="https://zyppy.com/seo/title-tags/google-title-rewrite-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">61%</a> of all meta titles. This often happens to address concerns with length (too long or too short), keyword repetition, and missing brand names.</li>
<li>Google also rewrites meta descriptions; a survey of 192,656 web pages found Google rewrote nearly <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/meta-description-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">63%</a> of them.</li>
<li>Google is more likely to rewrite meta-descriptions for long-tail keywords (<a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/meta-description-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">65%</a>) than for broad, high-volume keywords (60%).</li>
<li>A technical SEO campaign, where an agency focuses on technical fixes and optimization, can result in a <a href="https://firstpagesage.com/reports/seo-roi-statistics-fc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">117%</a> ROI.</li>
<li>URLs with words that are similar to the page’s keywords see a <a href="https://backlinko.com/google-ctr-stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">45%</a> higher click-through rate than URLs that contain no keywords.</li>
<li>Nearly <a href="https://www.demandmetric.com/content/content-marketing-infographic?_conv_v=vi%3A1*sc%3A2*cs%3A1742182060*fs%3A1742057850*pv%3A3*seg%3A%7B10031564.1-10034364.1-10034366.1-10034739.1%7D*exp%3A%7B100345302.%7Bv.1003171023-g.%7B%7D%7D%7D*ps%3A1742057850&amp;_conv_s=si%3A2*sh%3A1742182060429-0.5428670957488164*pv%3A2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60%</a> of B2B marketers consider their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post">blogs</a> to be their most valuable channel.</li>
<li>On average, companies with blogs produce <a href="https://www.demandmetric.com/content/content-marketing-infographic?_conv_v=vi%3A1*sc%3A2*cs%3A1742182060*fs%3A1742057850*pv%3A3*seg%3A%7B10031564.1-10034364.1-10034366.1-10034739.1%7D*exp%3A%7B100345302.%7Bv.1003171023-g.%7B%7D%7D%7D*ps%3A1742057850&amp;_conv_s=si%3A2*sh%3A1742182060429-0.5428670957488164*pv%3A2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">67%</a> more leads per month than those without blogs.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More searches than ever are ending without a click. Instead of directing users to websites, Google is delivering answers directly on the results page through featured snippets, knowledge panels, and other SERP features.</p>
<p>In 2024, <a href="https://www.briskon.com/blog/zero-click-searches/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 65%</a> of global Google searches didn’t result in a click, and on mobile, that number was even higher (over 75%). With AI-powered search evolving fast, this trend is expected to grow even more in 2025.</p>
<p>So, what does this mean for businesses? While fewer clicks can mean less traffic, visibility is now just as valuable. If you can secure a spot in these high-visibility SERP features, you can still stay in front of your audience and build brand authority.</p>
<p>Here’s how to make zero-click searches work for you.</p>

<h2>What are zero-click searches?</h2>
<p>Zero-click searches happen when users get their answers directly from Google’s search results page without the need to visit any specific website. These answers come in the form of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Featured Snippets</strong>: Quick, direct answers pulled from web pages.</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge Panels</strong>: Information from authoritative sources like Wikipedia, government domains, and more.</li>

<p>Even though these are great solutions for users, it’s less thrilling for businesses, for a simple reason: <strong>When Google provides the answer upfront, fewer people will visit websites</strong>.</p>
<p>Some industries are feeling the shift more than others. Local businesses benefit from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/08/what-is-google-my-business">Google Business Profiles</a>, while news sites lose traffic as Google pulls headlines into search results. Ecommerce brands compete with AI-generated product summaries, and B2B/SaaS companies struggle to drive clicks from informational searches. Even health and finance sites see Google favor big-name sources over independent ones.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/19/google-search-generative-experience">AI-driven search (SGE)</a> expanding, it’s safe to claim that zero-click searches are here to stay. Featured snippets are getting smarter, PAA boxes are growing, and local search features are becoming stronger than ever, all designed to keep users on Google longer.</p>
<p>But zero-click doesn’t have to mean zero opportunity.</p>

<h2>SEO in the age of zero-click searches: How it impacts businesses</h2>
<p>For years, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO</a> was all about ranking high and getting clicks, but now, even those ranking #1 for relevant keywords are no longer guaranteed engagement. Businesses that rely on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/organic-search">organic search</a> to drive leads, sales, or ad revenue are seeing fewer clicks, forcing a major shift in strategy.</p>
<p>“Ignoring zero-click searches means risking visibility. If competitors secure featured snippets, knowledge panels, or PAA spots, they become the go-to source while your brand fades into the background. This is especially critical in competitive industries where <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">brand awareness</a> is just as important as website visits,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-yoder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stephanie Yoder</a>, Director of Content at <a href="https://www.rebrandly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebrandly</a>.</p>

<p>At the same time, this shift presents an opportunity to rethink <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/13/content-marketing-strategy">content strategy</a>. “Market shifts like this always come with pros and cons, but one potential upside is a renewed focus on quality, value, and accessibility,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikiya" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikiya Griffith</a>, Head of Content Marketing at <a href="https://www.teamohana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TeamOhana</a>. “With declining click-through rates, brands need to make sure their websites meet accessibility standards, are optimized for screen readers, and deliver a seamless user experience for the visitors they do get.”</p>
<p>Diversification is also key. “You’re more likely to appear in featured snippets and rich results if you go beyond traditional articles. High-quality videos and other engaging formats can help ensure your content reaches its audience in new ways,” Griffith adds.</p>

<h2>4 proven strategies to thrive in a zero-click world</h2>
<p>So how can you continue seeing success despite zero-click searches? Here are some strategies to try.</p>
<h3>1. Optimize for featured snippets and knowledge panels</h3>
<p>Google favors clear, structured content that directly answers user queries, so optimizing for these features is all about making your information easy to extract and display.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/10/13/google-answer-box">Featured snippets</a> often take the form of paragraphs, lists, tables, steps, definitions, and comparisons, depending on the type of query.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paragraph snippets</strong> work best for definitions and direct answers. Aim for 40-60 words, as <a href="https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/featured-snippets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Backlinko’s research</a> suggests this is the optimal length for snippet selection.</li>
<li><strong>List snippets</strong> (bulleted or numbered) are ideal for step-by-step guides, ranking-based content, or &#8220;best of&#8221; lists.</li>
<li><strong>Table snippets</strong> help organize data for easy comparison, making them great for pricing, feature breakdowns, and statistical content.</li>
<li><strong>Comparison snippets</strong> perform well when contrasting two or more products, services, or concepts in a structured way.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/featured-snippet-example-dog-brushing-png.webp" alt="featured snippet example for how often to brush dogs teeth query" width="1758" height="728" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90176" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/featured-snippet-example-dog-brushing-png.webp 1758w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/featured-snippet-example-dog-brushing-1280x530.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/featured-snippet-example-dog-brushing-980x406.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/featured-snippet-example-dog-brushing-480x199.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1758px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>By structuring your content with these formats in mind (and placing the most relevant information early in a section), you increase the likelihood of being featured in search results and capturing valuable visibility.</p>
<h3>2. Focus on good content structuring and sound technical SEO techniques</h3>
<p>By combining structured content with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/28/technical-seo">strong technical SEO</a>, you can increase your likelihood of being featured in zero-click searches and staying visible. Here are some tips to keep in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create question-based content</strong>: Google often pulls snippet content from answers to common user questions. Structuring content around “what,” “how,” and “why” questions improves your chances of ranking in these prime SERP spots.</li>
<li><strong>Implement structured data: </strong>Implementing structured data with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/15/what-is-schema-markup">schema markup</a> (such as FAQ, HowTo, and Article schema) helps Google better understand and categorize your content, increasing the chances of appearing in SERP features like rich snippets, knowledge panels, and carousels.</li>
<li><strong>Format for maximum visibility</strong>: Clear headings, bullet points, tables, and concise paragraphs make it easier for Google to extract information for featured snippets. A direct, well-structured answer at the start of a section improves your chances of ranking.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Optimize for mobile</strong>: Since most zero-click searches happen on mobile, ensuring fast load times, responsive design, and easy navigation improves search performance.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritize page speed and user experience</strong>: A slow site can hurt rankings and visibility. Optimizing images, reducing unnecessary scripts, and improving <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/02/improve-core-web-vitals">Core Web Vitals</a> ensure your content is more likely to appear in high-ranking search features.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Leverage PPC</h3>
<p>If Google’s keeping more traffic for itself, businesses may have to pay to play. While zero-click searches make it harder to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/get-found-beyond-organic-search/">drive organic traffic</a>, <strong>PPC ads can help you stay visible and capture those lost opportunities.</strong> Whether you’re promoting content or bidding on high-intent keywords, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/preparing-for-ppc-success-in-cookieless-world">smart ad strategies can keep your business front and center</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/google-ads-example-pet-grooming-png.webp" alt="google ads example for pet groomers search" width="1366" height="1424" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90180" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/google-ads-example-pet-grooming-png.webp 1366w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/google-ads-example-pet-grooming-1280x1334.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/google-ads-example-pet-grooming-980x1022.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/google-ads-example-pet-grooming-480x500.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1366px, 100vw" /></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Strategically select keywords</strong>: Focus on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/ppc-keyword">keywords</a> that still drive clicks. Informational queries might be tough, but commercial and transactional searches are where you can win. Test targeting long-tail keywords that show clear buying intent.</li>
<li><strong>Optimize ad placement</strong>: Don’t just aim for the top spot. Try to experiment with different placements, like shopping ads, video ads, and even discovery ads to reach your audience where they’re most engaged.</li>
<li><strong>Follow budget allocation best practices</strong>: Balance your spending between branded and non-branded keywords, and use remarketing to stay in front of users who interacted with your content but didn’t convert right away.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Diversify traffic sources</h3>
<p>“If Google is sending you less traffic, it’s time to <strong>stop relying on one source and build a more resilient strategy.</strong> Expanding your reach through other channels helps reduce dependency on organic search,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vovafeldman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vova Feldman</a>, CEO of <a href="https://freemius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freemius</a>.</p>
<p>To future-proof your traffic and stay in control of your audience, consider these approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Experiment with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-media-strategy">social media strategies</a></strong>: Platforms like LinkedIn, X, and YouTube aren’t just for engagement; they can be powerful search engines in their own right. Repurpose blog content into bite-sized, shareable posts to drive awareness and clicks.</li>
<li><strong>Make email marketing a priority</strong>: Don’t wait for people to find you. Bring your content straight to them. Regular newsletters, exclusive insights, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/personalized-marketing">personalized recommendations</a> keep your audience engaged without depending on search traffic.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-sms-marketing-1.webp" alt="Personalized marketing - SMS text example." width="1999" height="626" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90151" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-sms-marketing-1.webp 1999w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-sms-marketing-1-1280x401.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-sms-marketing-1-980x307.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/personalized-marketing-wordstream-sms-marketing-1-480x150.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1999px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expand content distribution</strong>: Explore syndication, guest posting, and partnerships to get your content in front of new audiences. Platforms like Reddit and niche forums can drive highly targeted traffic outside of Google’s grip.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the day, <strong>Google doesn’t own your audience—you do.</strong> By leveraging PPC and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-marketing-pros-drive-traffic">diversifying traffic sources</a>, you can stay visible, build brand equity, and keep driving results, regardless of where <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-trends-2025">search trends</a> go.</p>

<h2>How to measure success in a zero-click environment</h2>
<p>With fewer clicks to track, traditional <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/27/seo-metrics">SEO metrics</a> no longer tell the full story. But that doesn’t mean you’re flying blind. You just need to rethink how to measure success. Instead of focusing purely on traffic, <strong>focus on brand visibility, engagement, and impact.</strong></p>
<p>But how do you measure success when the old metrics don’t tell the full story? Let’s break it down step by step.</p>
<h3>Key performance indicators</h3>
<p>Here are the metrics that are important to keep track of.</p>
<h4>Brand visibility metrics</h4>
<p>Even if people aren’t clicking, they still see your brand in search. Here’s how you can measure that exposure:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Track your impressions in Google Search Console</strong>
<ul>
<li>Go to <strong>Search Console → Performance → Search Results</strong></li>
<li>Look at <strong>&#8220;Total Impressions&#8221; and &#8220;Average Position&#8221;</strong></li>
<li>Filter for your <strong>brand name</strong> to see how often people search for you specifically.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Monitor your presence in SERP features</strong>
<ul>
<li>Use a tool like <a href="https://ahrefs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ahrefs</a> or <a href="https://www.semrush.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semrush</a> to track if you’re appearing in:
<ul>
<li>Featured snippets</li>
<li>Knowledge panels</li>
<li>People Also Ask (PAA) boxes</li>
<li>AI Overviews</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you’re ranking for a featured snippet but not getting clicks, the snippet from your content might be answering the question fully, which still builds brand awareness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ai-overview-result-in-ahrefs-png.webp" alt="ai overview result in ahrefs" width="2048" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90181" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ai-overview-result-in-ahrefs-png.webp 2048w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ai-overview-result-in-ahrefs-1280x188.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ai-overview-result-in-ahrefs-980x144.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ai-overview-result-in-ahrefs-480x70.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 2048px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This site can see that its showing in the AI Overview for this keyword.</em></p>
<h4>Alternative success measurements</h4>
<p>Beyond clicks, here’s how to measure whether your search visibility is actually making an impact:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check if direct traffic is increasing</strong>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>GA4</strong>, go to <strong>Reports → Acquisition → Traffic Acquisition</strong></li>
<li>Look at <strong>Direct traffic</strong>—this includes visitors who typed your URL or clicked a saved bookmark.</li>
<li>If <strong>Direct traffic rises while Organic Search stays flat</strong>, people may have seen you in search and visited later.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Look for traffic spikes from search features</strong>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>GA4</strong>, go to <strong>Reports → Acquisition → Referral Traffic</strong></li>
<li>Look for sudden spikes from Google Search; these often correlate with featured snippets or knowledge panels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Return on investment</h4>
<p>To connect your search visibility efforts to real business outcomes, track:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How many conversions start with search</strong>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>GA4</strong>, go to <strong>Reports → Advertising → Attribution → Conversion Paths</strong></li>
<li>Filter by <strong>&#8220;Organic Search&#8221;</strong> to see <strong>assisted conversions</strong> (cases where search played a role, even if it wasn’t the last-click source).</li>
<li>If search appears early in the conversion journey, it’s driving awareness—even if clicks aren’t immediate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The impact of brand searches on conversions</strong>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>GA4</strong>, go to <strong>Reports → Acquisition → Traffic Acquisition</strong></li>
<li>Compare <strong>Direct traffic conversions</strong> vs. <strong>Organic Search conversions</strong>.</li>
<li>If <strong>Direct conversions increase after an SEO push</strong>, it suggests search helped <strong>plant the seed</strong>, and users came back later to convert.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Analytics and tracking</h3>
<p>Now that you know what to track, let’s talk about how to track it.</p>
<h4>Set up custom reporting</h4>
<p>Setting up reports that focus on <strong>visibility, engagement, and business impact</strong> instead of just traffic will give you a clearer picture of success:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Search Console Dashboard (Looker Studio)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Open <strong>Looker Studio (formerly Data Studio)</strong></li>
<li>Connect <strong>Google Search Console</strong></li>
<li>Add <strong>Impressions, Clicks, and Average Position</strong> to track visibility over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Custom GA4 Reports for Zero-Click Tracking</strong>
<ul>
<li>Track <strong>Direct traffic trends</strong> to see if search visibility is translating into brand awareness.</li>
<li>Set up <strong>Attribution reports</strong> to measure <strong>assisted conversions from search visibility.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Use the right tracking tools</h4>
<p>Use these tools to track performance in a zero-click environment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Search Console:</strong> Measures impressions and search presence.</li>
<li><strong>Google Analytics (GA4):</strong> Tracks <strong>Direct traffic growth, assisted conversions, and referral traffic spikes.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ahrefs/Semrush:</strong> Monitors <strong>SERP features like featured snippets and knowledge panels</strong> where your brand appears.</li>
<li><strong>Brand monitoring tools (e.g., Brandwatch, Mention):</strong> Helps track mentions and visibility beyond search clicks.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Look at performance benchmarks</h4>
<p>To determine if your zero-click SEO efforts are paying off, compare:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before-and-after metrics for SERP visibility:</strong> Are impressions increasing even if clicks aren’t?</li>
<li><strong>Direct traffic growth over time:</strong> Is there an uptick in visitors who type your URL after seeing your brand in search?</li>
<li><strong>Conversion rate changes: </strong>Are more users starting their journey through search and converting later via direct visits?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Future-proof your digital strategy by optimizing for zero-click searches</h2>
<p>Zero-click searches aren’t going away. They’re becoming the norm. To stay ahead, you need to adapt early and diversify your approach to avoid relying too much on organic clicks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot gets written about topic clusters when it comes to SEO-focused content in ecommerce or B2B, but much less so when it comes to local SEO.</p>
<p>Do locally focused businesses even need to think about topic clusters? What types of clusters could you build for a roofing company or plumbing company?</p>
<p>While internal linking and site structure is different for local SEO, it’s still critically important.</p>
<p>In this article, I’ll walk through the key types of topic clusters you should be thinking about for local SEO and how to implement and interlink them.</p>

<h2>What are topic clusters?</h2>
<p>Topic clusters are related pages that are interlinked, typically for SEO benefit.</p>
<p>More specifically, topic clusters have a “hub and spoke” set up with a hub or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/11/pillar-pages">pillar page</a> and spoke or cluster pages. Here is a visual representation of the basic concept:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topic-clusters-png.webp" alt="topic clusters how they work" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89790" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topic-clusters-png.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topic-clusters-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Typically, as part of your topic clusters strategy, you’ll want:</p>
<ol>
<li>The hub/pillar page to link to all of the spoke/cluster pages.</li>
<li>The spoke/cluster pages to all link back up to the pillar page.</li>
<li>The spoke/cluster pages to link to and have links from at least two spoke/cluster pages.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that you know what topic clusters are, let’s talk about how they can benefit your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/12/local-seo">local SEO strategy</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/first-page-of-google?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_10WaysFirstPageGoogle_Download">10 Tangible &amp; Free Ways to Get on the First Page of Google</a></p>

<h2>Why create topic clusters? What are the benefits?</h2>
<p>Creating topic clusters for local SEO has a few core benefits.</p>
<h3>Increases your chances for ranking in search results</h3>
<p>When you build a topic cluster around a core topic and page you increase the likelihood that the core page will rank. For instance, if you created a series of pages about Orlando roofing costs, Orlando roofing materials, related services, and surrounding towns and had all of those pages link back to your Orlando roofing page, that page will perform better for terms like “Orlando roofing” because you’re indicating to Google that your site is a comprehensive resource on the subject, and those pages can all convey to Google that the Orlando roofing page is about that topic (more on this later).</p>
<h3>Attracts more potential local customers</h3>
<p>Additionally, you can attract more potential customers by creating specific content related to a core topic that you wouldn’t have otherwise. Often those searchers are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/30/commercial-intent-keywords">higher intent</a> as well because their search terms are more specific, and the terms are within a cluster of terms that are relevant to your business.</p>
<h3>Improves the user experience</h3>
<p>Finally, creating content clusters and interlinking them strategically improves the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/03/29/ux-conversion-rates">user experience for your site’s visitors</a> as you are able to answer more of their related questions (by covering the topic more thoroughly) and giving them the option to dive deeper on a core topic by offering links to related content.</p>
<p>When implemented correctly, all of this leads to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more traffic</a>, leads, and revenue from local SEO.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Search ads can also help you attract more local searchers.</strong> Want to learn more about search engine marketing on Google?

<h2>Types of topic clusters for local SEO (+examples)</h2>
<p>The concept of topic clusters is relatively simple, but if you’re a locally focused business, what types of pages should you be “clustering” and how should you fit those pages into clusters? Let’s walk through some examples of topic clusters in local SEO.</p>
<h3>Service and area topic clusters</h3>
<p>If you’re providing any type of local service—from roofers to chiropractors—you’ll want to build out <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/multi-location-seo/#:~:text=1.-,Create%20a%20web%20page%20for%20each%20location,-(with%20a%20unique" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local service pages</a> targeting your service areas with town page + service. If you offer one service to a tight geography, this may be pretty straightforward with a structure like:</p>
<p>Service Areas</p>
<ul>
<li>Windemere roofing</li>
<li>Winter Garden roofing</li>
<li>College Park roofing</li>
<li>Lake Nona roofing</li>
<li>Oviedo roofing</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topic-clusters-service-service-area-png.webp" alt="topic cluster example for local roofing company service and service areas" width="1026" height="601" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89791" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topic-clusters-service-service-area-png.webp 1026w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topic-clusters-service-service-area-980x574.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topic-clusters-service-service-area-480x281.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1026px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you have a larger service area, you can cluster pages by geography, with batches of 10 or so towns.</p>
<p>What if you have a situation like the image above where there are several services across multiple service areas?</p>
<p>First, you need to determine how many pages you actually need. Unfortunately, to do this, you need to do some leg work and look at the actual search results in your area. Let’s look at a few of the services offered in this region by the company above. First, roofing company:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/orlando-roofing-serp-png.webp" alt="search results for orlando roofing company on google" width="913" height="1812" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89792" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/orlando-roofing-serp-png.webp 913w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/orlando-roofing-serp-480x953.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 913px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And here is the SERP for Orlando leak detection:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/orlando-roof-leak-detection-serp-png.webp" alt="search results for orlando leak detection on google" width="787" height="1976" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89793" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/orlando-roof-leak-detection-serp-png.webp 787w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/orlando-roof-leak-detection-serp-480x1205.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 787px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>All of these results are service pages or entire sites specifically dedicated to leak detection, so if we want to rank, we’ll need to create a new services page (and not just a sub-section on our roofing page).</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you look at “roof repair Orlando” the results aren’t exactly the same as “Orlando roofing company,” but there are a number of the same sites, and virtually every page is a general roofing page (not specific to repairs):</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/roof-repair-orlando-serp-png.webp" alt="search results for orlando roof repair on google" width="728" height="1976" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89794" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/roof-repair-orlando-serp-png.webp 728w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/roof-repair-orlando-serp-480x1303.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 728px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>So that term can likely be addressed on the roofing page.</p>
<p>For sites that have a mix of multiple services and multiple service areas, the structure might look something like this:</p>
<p>Service Areas</p>
<ul>
<li>Windemere roofing
<ul>
<li>Windemere roof leak detection</li>
<li>Windemere commercial roofing</li>
<li>Windemere tile roof repair</li>
<li>Windemere solar panels</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Winter Garden roofing
<ul>
<li>Winter Garden roof leak detection</li>
<li>Winter Garden commercial roofing</li>
<li>Winter Garden tile roof repair</li>
<li>Winter Garden solar panels</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>College Park roofing
<ul>
<li>College Park roof leak detection</li>
<li>College Park commercial roofing</li>
<li>College Park tile roof repair</li>
<li>College Park solar panels</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lake Nona roofing
<ul>
<li>Lake Nona roof leak detection</li>
<li>Lake Nona commercial roofing</li>
<li>Lake Nona tile roof repair</li>
<li>Lake Nona solar panels</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Oviedo roofing
<ul>
<li>Oviedo roof leak detection</li>
<li>Oviedo commercial roofing</li>
<li>Oviedo tile roof repair</li>
<li>Oviedo solar panels</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So the Windemere roofing page would link down to its “spoke” pages, those pages would link back up and across to each other, and the Windemere page would have at least two links to and from the other location roofing “spoke” pages.</p>
<h4>What to keep in mind when creating this type of topic cluster</h4>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that your most important services and most important service areas are covered (look at the SERPs to determine if you need a new page).</li>
<li>Structure content in hub-and-spoke format with the main service pages linking to location-specific pages.</li>
<li>Ensure each location page links back to the main service page and at least two other location pages.</li>
<li>Group locations geographically when dealing with large service areas.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cost and cost calculator topic clusters</h3>
<p>Many services will have search volume around town/city + service + cost as well:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/local-keyword-research-results-roofing-cost-png.webp" alt="wordstream free keyword tool results for roofing costs" width="1176" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89795" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/local-keyword-research-results-roofing-cost-png.webp 1176w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/local-keyword-research-results-roofing-cost-980x498.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/local-keyword-research-results-roofing-cost-480x244.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1176px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>These are national results from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">the Free Keyword Tool</a> but many of these modifiers will show up for localized searches.</p>
<p>Cost pages—particularly if you can invest in building simple cost calculators and in-depth data for specific areas—can also get passive links from other sources as well.</p>
<p>These can be linked to and from both within service + service area pages, and a broader “{service} costs” or “state {service} costs” page that acts as a hub page and links down to the service area pages.</p>
<h4>Tips for creating this type of topic cluster:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create area-specific <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/08/landing-page-examples">cost pages</a> for services with significant search volume.</li>
<li>Develop interactive calculators to provide value and attract links.</li>
<li>Link cost pages to relevant service area pages.</li>
<li>Consider building a state-level cost hub page if you’re building out a cluster of these pages.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Measurement and materials topic clusters</h3>
<p>This is a cluster that depends on the service you’re offering, but there are a lot of locally focused services where measurements and material estimates play a role. A potential customer may want to estimate things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The size of a roof, room, exterior of their house, etc. to help them understand the price of a service.</li>
<li>The amount of materials (shingles, exterior lights, floor panels, etc.) they’ll need for their specific job.</li>
</ul>
<p>Providing tools and frameworks for customers to conduct these estimations can help build credibility and authority around a topic. Plus, if you build something like a free tool for your visitors, you can get links from other sites to help with your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google">ranking</a> as well.</p>
<h3>Frequency and maintenance topic clusters</h3>
<p>If you have a recurring service, there are likely a lot of questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How often do I need to replace my windows?</li>
<li>How often should a cleaner come?</li>
<li>How often do you need to {perform specific maintenance activity}?</li>
</ul>
<p>As with measurement terms, you want to get in front of these customers as they’re researching whether they need something replaced or how often they need a recurring service:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/local-keyword-research-results-roofing-png.webp" alt="wordstream free keyword tool results for roof replacement query" width="1200" height="606" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89796" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/local-keyword-research-results-roofing-png.webp 1200w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/local-keyword-research-results-roofing-980x495.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/local-keyword-research-results-roofing-480x242.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>An underrated fact here is that these queries are often <strong>personalized based on location</strong>. You may think a search query like this will reach everyone across the country—and if you rank well for the term it may—but Google will also <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">personalize these results</a> based on search history and location. Here is the search result for this phrase according to keyword tools:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/roof-replacement-query-results-png.webp" alt="roof replacement query results in ahrefs" width="561" height="627" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89797" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/roof-replacement-query-results-png.webp 561w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/roof-replacement-query-results-480x536.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 561px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is the result I see in Massachusetts:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/local-informational-content-roofing-example-png.webp" alt="informational query for roofing result on google" width="908" height="604" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89798" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/local-informational-content-roofing-example-png.webp 908w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/local-informational-content-roofing-example-480x319.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 908px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The Nova Home Improvement site doesn’t show up at all in the generalized search results, but for a local searcher, it’s getting a featured snippet! Again this is a great opportunity to get in front of your potential customers.</p>
<p>The fundamental structure of these kinds of clusters would be the same&#8211;you don’t need to build a separate page for each service area you have, just a cluster of related terms around replacement, maintenance, and frequency terms with the same hub and spoke approach.</p>
<h4>Tips for creating these topic clusters</h4>
<ul>
<li>Focus on location-specific maintenance schedules and requirements.</li>
<li>Include tools for measuring materials and estimating project scope.</li>
<li>Create content addressing “frequency of {service}” questions.</li>
<li>Link maintenance content to relevant service pages.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Informational and blog topic clusters</h3>
<p>Not every local site needs a lot of informational content. If you’re servicing an area that’s low competition, and/or you offer a service that’s lower competition, you may want to focus on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-seo-in-2024">local SEO best practices</a> like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-citations">building local citations</a>, links, and service area pages rather than informational content.</p>
<p>But the screenshot in the section above gives you an indication of how informational content helps you reach prospects. You can then <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/17/retargeting-campaign-tips">remarket</a> to those folks, have them see your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/03/organic-traffic">organic result</a>s or ads, and get more business down the line from these activities. More informational content also has a couple of additional advantages for local businesses:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/topical-authority"><strong>Topical authority</strong></a>: Building out “how to” content (e.g., if you’re a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/cleaning-services-advertising-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cleaning business</a>, a series of posts about how to clean various surfaces, rooms in the house, etc.) helps indicate to Google that your site is an authority on a topic. If you can localize this content, that’s even better as it indicates to Google that you’re an authority on both the topic and the area you service.</li>
<li><strong>Passive links</strong>: If you start to rank for informational terms, you often get people doing research through Google who will then link to your resource. Those links are extremely valuable for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/12/domain-authority">improving the authority of your sit</a>e and having it rank better for queries in Google.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, these could be on a variety of topics, using the same hub and spoke model with the same linking recommendations outlined above. Some examples of informational content that could work for your locally focused site include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How to:</strong> How to perform specific maintenance tasks, DIY certain aspects of your service, etc. For a window replacement company, this may be tips for winterizing your windows or maintaining them (again particularly if those tips are specific to your service region).</li>
<li><strong>Best tools/products</strong>: For a salon, this may be hair care products, for someone offering golf lessons the best equipment for a variety of different golf-related tasks, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Pain points/FAQs</strong>: Answering specific questions or <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-pain-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pain points</a> your customers may have is another great way to build informational topical clusters. If you’re a dentist, you can create a series of posts answering questions related to teeth whitening that people may be searching for.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Tips for creating these types of topic clusters</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create how-to content specific to your service area.</li>
<li>Develop best tools and product recommendations.</li>
<li>Address common customer pain points and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/24/faq-page">FAQs</a>.</li>
<li>Focus on locally relevant topics that build authority.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Competitor comparison topic clusters</h3>
<p>A lot of businesses don’t want to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/competitive-insights">talk about competitors</a>, but it’s often the case that your prospects already know about your competitors, and being willing to mention them can be a way to get in front of more potential customers who are close to paying for your service.</p>
<p>Just as with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/12/paid-search-conquesting">Google Ads “conquesting” campaigns</a> that target competitor names, you can potentially rank for some search terms related to your competitors by being willing to mention them and highlight where you’re different.</p>
<p>First, you can create a list of the businesses in your area. Again: this is a bit scary and something a lot of businesses want to stay away from, but it can be a great way to rank for terms that you couldn’t otherwise. When a searcher looks for “roofing companies in Nashville” they want a list, not just the site of a specific company.</p>
<p>This organic result is mostly third-party sites like Yelp or the BBB, but the third organic result here is an individual roofing company that was willing to list competitors:</p>

<p>From there, you could go a step further and actually link to a page with your competitor’s name, and do a comparison of what your strengths are versus the competitor. Obviously, you have to be careful not to say anything false or libelous about the competitor, but you can often rank well with these pages for search terms like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Competitor name + competitors</li>
<li>Competitor name + alternatives</li>
<li>Competitor name + reviews</li>
<li>Competitor name + costs</li>
<li>Competitor name + pricing</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a fairly common practice in other industries but not well used with locally focused businesses.</p>
<p>In terms of structure, you would use the &#8220;best of&#8221; list as the hub, and the competitor pages would each function as a spoke.</p>
<h4>Tips for creating these topic clusters</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create comprehensive <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/01/business-directory-listings">local business listings</a>.</li>
<li>Develop alternative/comparison pages for major competitors.</li>
<li>Address competitor-specific searches like reviews and pricing.</li>
<li>Maintain professional, factual comparisons.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to think about topic clusters for local SEO</h2>
<p>Ultimately the most important “topic cluster” for local SEO is making sure that you have coverage around service pages to target your core services and service areas.</p>
<p>If you have additional resources and/or are in a competitive market, a lot of these additional content types and topic clusters can both help you drive incremental traffic and leads and can help solidify your rankings on your core services and service areas.</p>
<p>Here are the key takeaways to help you get better <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-statistics">SEO results</a> using topic clusters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement a hub-and-spoke model with a clear <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/04/internal-linking">internal linking structure</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/competitive-analysis">Assess competition levels</a> before investing in informational content.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“SEO is dead.”</p>
<p>That’s an easy conclusion to come to after the last few years. Turbulent rankings, increased zero-click searches, and AI-fueled SEO heists feel like the final nails in the search coffin.</p>
<p>The truth is, what actually died is the 2015 version of SEO. It’s no longer just about climbing a list of little blue links on Google. New technology, user behavior, and regulations changed that.</p>
<p>Billions of people still use the internet to search for answers—it just happens in new places and in new ways. SEOs who recalibrate their strategy to meet these opportunities will find plenty of new customers from search.</p>
<p>We’ve reviewed recent data, read through Reddit and LinkedIn, and spoken to SEO experts to bring you the most important SEO trends for 2025. Use them to drive growth from search this year.</p>

<h2>The top SEO trends of 2025</h2>
<p>Search engines and practices are evolving quickly. But SEO continues to be <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/popular-marketing-resources-2025">a top place people go to learn</a>. These are the top <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/campaigns/marketing-solutions?cid=Paid_GGL_Search_LiQMarketingSolutions_Branded_Demo&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=PPC&amp;utm_campaign=paid_demo&amp;utm_content=rsa&amp;utm_term=wordstream&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAvvO7BhC-ARIsAGFyToVS0Rvkwx0MQd92QlqEBVAY4lylEtGnkclVxIr4M1h5TjK-Tu7_laYaAjIFEALw_wcB">SEO</a> trends you should be aware of for 2025.</p>
<div id="AI-in-search-expands"></div>
<h3>1. AI in search results will continue to expand</h3>
<p>After about a year of optional experimentation, Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/generative-ai-google-search-may-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unleashed its AI Overviews</a> (AIO) on US results pages in May 2024. The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-overviews">reactions and results</a>—both positive and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-overviews-breaking-search">negative</a>—rolled in rapidly. This year, expect Google to expand its use of AIOs and other generative AI features to more queries.</p>
<p>The appearance of AI Overviews is increasing. In June last year, they showed up in about <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-ai-overviews-visibility-new-low-444048" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7%</a> of searches. By November, that number jumped to nearly <a href="https://seranking.com/blog/ai-overviews-2024-recap-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20%</a>. For some informational-intent heavy industries, like business and technology, over a third of SERPs had an AIO.</p>
<p>Google is also testing other <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-mode">applications for AI</a> on SERPs. SERP analyst <a href="https://x.com/SachuPatel53124/status/1871482182382039345" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sachin Patel showed</a> AI-generated answers he found in the Things to Know feature.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-things-to-know.webp" alt="SEO trends - screenshot of Things to Know feature." width="863" height="486" class="aligncenter wp-image-88087 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-things-to-know.webp 863w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-things-to-know-480x270.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 863px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://x.com/SachuPatel53124/status/1871482182382039345" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Sachin also <a href="https://x.com/SachuPatel53124/status/1874054633951580491" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted about an experimental</a> “Get an Explanation” button that pops up when you highlight text in a SERP. Click it, and you’ll get an AI-generated answer in the sidebar.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-AIO-schwartz.webp" alt="SEO trends - AIO screenshot." width="879" height="531" class="aligncenter wp-image-88088 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-AIO-schwartz.webp 879w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-AIO-schwartz-480x290.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 879px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://x.com/SachuPatel53124/status/1874054633951580491" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></p>
<p>While more AI answers in SERPs will lead to more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/zero-click-searches">zero-click searches</a> (we’ll cover that in a bit), they could also have a couple of benefits for SEOs.</p>
<p>First off, Google seems to be reacting to content creators’ pushback by adding more citation links in its AIOs. SEO expert <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lily-ray-44755615_seo-activity-7269046589665538048-K70c?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lily Ray pointed that out</a> recently.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-google-lily-ray-new.webp" alt="SEO trends - screenshot of AI Overview. " width="768" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88110 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-google-lily-ray-new.webp 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-google-lily-ray-new-480x375.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 768px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lily-ray-44755615_seo-activity-7269046589665538048-K70c?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Second, AIOs may present smaller websites a chance at <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google">SERP placement</a> they didn’t have before. <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/ai-overviews-study/?msockid=3f728bc05ac16b232a869f475ba36a8e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semrush’s study</a> found that while the average AIO had 11 citation links, there was only a 20% to 26% overlap between AIO citations and links in the top 10 SERP spots for that query.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-AIO-circle-graph.webp" alt="SEO trends - Graph of AIOs in search results." width="548" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88090 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-AIO-circle-graph.webp 548w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-AIO-circle-graph-480x526.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 548px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/ai-overviews-study/?msockid=3f728bc05ac16b232a869f475ba36a8e" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>This opens up opportunities for websites that may not have a lot of traffic or backlinks to find different placements on the SERP.</p>
<p>Any website hoping to snag an AIO citation still needs <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post#:~:text=Some%20posts%20will%20feel%20like,when%20they%27re%20reading%20it.">excellent, authoritative, and novel content</a> that answers specific questions to do it—which we’ll see infused in several other SEO trends for 2025 (see more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-marketing-trends-2025">AI marketing trends</a> here).</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Keyword research still matters in 2025.</strong> Use our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">Free Keyword Tool</a> to find the terms that matter to your business.</p>
<div id="answer-engines-become-referral-source"></div>
<h3>2. Answer engines may become top non-Google traffic sources</h3>
<p>We’ve already talked about how AIOs are expanding. But other big AI players are also growing in the search answer engine space, and they’re attracting more search users along the way. That’s driving an uptick in non-Google search <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/11/29/referral-traffic#:~:text=Referral%20traffic%20refers%20to%20traffic,site%20that%27s%20not%20your%20own.">referral traffic</a> that will accelerate in 2025.</p>
<p>OpenAI launched <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/chatgpt-searchnoopener">ChatGPT search</a> at the end of 2024. It’s already estimated that the AI behemoth will garner <a href="https://searchengineland.com/chatgpt-search-market-share-1-percent-449378" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1%</a> of the search market this year. That may be a small slice, but it’s from a <em>very</em> large pie.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Perplexity, one of the first true answer engines to use up-to-date online information, has amassed over <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/perplexity-ai-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15 million</a> users. While that pales in comparison to Google’s roughly three billion regular users, it does show a significant quarterly growth trend.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-perplexity.webp" alt="SEO trends - Perplexity result." width="691" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88091 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-perplexity.webp 691w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-perplexity-480x417.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 691px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Perplexity places citations prominently at the top of the page, driving its growth in referral traffic.</em></p>
<p>The big news here is the swift acceleration of referral traffic coming from these two new answer engines. Overall, referral traffic is up 44% from ChatGPT and 71% from Perplexity. One review of a diverse set of websites showed a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marktraphagen_145x-thats-how-much-referral-traffic-from-activity-7257423918498541568-LTrv?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">145x</a> increase in referral traffic from ChatGPT just since June.</p>
<p>With the carrot of new traffic sources will come the rise of AEO (answer engine optimization). Marketers looking to capitalize will need to know which parts of traditional SEO cross over and which new tactics are required to land a citation in AI-generated answers.</p>

<div id="community-search-results-here-to-stay"></div>
<h3>3. Community search results are an ongoing SEO trend</h3>
<p>Heman Patel, senior SEO analyst at LocaliQ, sees online communities as a big focus area for SEOs in 2025. “Community search results are here to stay,” he said. “Google will continue to show search results from forums and communities like Reddit and Quora. Businesses should engage with communities where their customers hang out.”</p>
<p>We saw forums, especially <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/drive-traffic-from-reddit">Reddit</a>, get a huge lift from the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/august-2024-google-core-update">August core update</a>. That’s when Google really began prioritizing forum content in SERPs. That made Reddit the <a href="https://www.webpronews.com/reddits-seo-surge-the-unintended-consequences-of-googles-august-2024-core-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third most visible website</a> in results pages, quadrupling the traffic it got from Google.</p>
<p>Quora and Reddit results seem to be more prevalent for specific question queries, which makes sense since many of the discussions on those forums answer direct questions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-reddit-results.webp" alt="SEO trends - Reddit in search results." width="844" height="373" class="aligncenter wp-image-88092 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-reddit-results.webp 844w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-reddit-results-480x212.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 844px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>On top of the push from Google, there’s a pull force for forum popularity on SERPs. Google users are<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1c1c9kj/google_on_why_it_shows_reddit_forum_threads_in/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> appending “Reddit” to their queries</a>. Their goal is to find more genuine, contextual answers from experts.</p>
<p>As a result, marketers have already begun looking for ways to capitalize on the increase of forum content SERP placements.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-holben.webp" alt="SEO trends - linkedIn post from Jim Holben." width="788" height="258" class="aligncenter wp-image-88093 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-holben.webp 788w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-holben-480x157.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 788px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jim-holben_ai-marketing-activity-7278739696992616448-uWj7?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>In 2025, more users will look to forums for answers, especially if they’re put off by AI-generated replies. In turn, expect more marketers to look for ways to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reddit-marketing">attract customers from places like Reddit</a> and Quora. That may be through direct engagement in those forums or by optimizing content and publishing it there.</p>
<div id="optimizing-for-sales-in-seo"></div>
<h3>4. Optimizing for sales becomes more important</h3>
<p>Another interesting SEO trend started to emerge towards the end of 2024. SEOs and marketers began talking a lot more about how to optimize down-funnel content for search. So, instead of hyper-focusing on high-level informational content, there is a new push to distribute mid and bottom-of-the-funnel content through search engines.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samdunning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam Dunning</a>, founder of the <a href="https://www.breakingb2b.com/b2b-seo-agency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">B2B SEO agency</a> Breaking B2B and host of the <a href="https://www.breakingb2b.com/blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Breaking B2B podcast</a>, sees this as a big opportunity in the coming year. “Optimising for search and sales so content enables your sales team by leveraging customer research, questions, and objections from sales calls is important. That way, it not only ranks but also resonates, builds trust, and converts clients.”</p>
<p>A study of 50 brands from <a href="https://www.seoworks.co.uk/how-brand-impacts-seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seoworks</a> suggests that Google may actually favor websites with a high percentage of branded content.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-performers-chart.webp" alt="SEO trends - Seoworks graph of search results." width="859" height="431" class="aligncenter wp-image-88094 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-performers-chart.webp 859w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-performers-chart-480x241.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 859px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.seoworks.co.uk/how-brand-impacts-seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>So, there doesn’t seem to be a negative to adding a little product or brand promotion to your SEO content. “You’ll want to weave in ‘a-ha’ moments of product into articles that you hope to drive leads and revenue from,” Sam said. “For example, add video, gifs, and demos so content can sell for you.”</p>
<p>Sam also mentioned that brands driving the most pipeline revenue from SEO are the ones who “quickly identify and approve money bottom-funnel keywords.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-holland-seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrew Holland</a>, director of SEO at JBH, wrote about why “SEO content needs a business-first mindset.”</p>
<p>That means, “When you create content for SEO, it must always be linked to business goals. Because sadly, there is way too much content in SEO that was created for traffic as a vanity metric,” Andrew said.</p>
<p>We’re seeing more pros share how they use SEO to convert customers, not just attract them. For example, this <a href="https://moz.com/blog/emotion-driven-seo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article by copywriter Tasmin Lofthouse</a> on the Moz blog explains how to use “Emotional SEO” to increase your sales.</p>
<p>While marketers may be on edge about a potential drop in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/03/organic-traffic">organic search traffic</a>, it’s clear they’re thinking about how to shorten the journey buyers take from SERPs to purchase. If these early trials net more customers faster, you can bet we’ll see more sales copy find its way into SEO content.</p>

<h3>5. First-hand experience becomes a critical SEO trend in 2025</h3>
<p>For years, Google has called out the need to bake first-hand experience and expertise into SEO content. But the prevalence of AI-generated content and users’ search for authenticity have made those qualities critical for anyone trying to rank content in 2025 and beyond.</p>
<p>Google claimed that experience, expertise, authority, and trust (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/14/google-e-e-a-t">E-E-A-T</a>) were at the center of its quality rater guidelines—the rules its human reviewers use to qualify good content. The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-algorithm-documents-leak">Google API leak</a> that circulated in 2024 referenced “OriginalContentScore” as a ranking factor. This means Google does indeed consider how novel the information on a webpage is before deciding where to place it in the SERPs.</p>
<p>Like we mentioned before, users are also turning to forums for more original content filled with personal experiences and expert input. Marketers who attempt to flood SERPs with AI-only content won’t rank in the long term. It’s brands that can mine their internal data, expert network, and user surveys for new ideas that will rise in the rankings in 2025.</p>
<p>What does this elevated experiential content look like? Here’s how <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/timsoulo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Soulo</a>, CMO at Ahrefs, describes “Great content” in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/timsoulo_i-hate-the-word-content-it-has-ruined-activity-7275032638048911360-h9xv?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn post</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-soulo.webp" alt="SEO trends - Image from Tim Soulo's linkedin post." width="785" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88095 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-soulo.webp 785w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-soulo-480x367.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 785px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/timsoulo_i-hate-the-word-content-it-has-ruined-activity-7275032638048911360-h9xv?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Tim actually suggests dropping the word “content” altogether and focusing on the ways you generate information that no other source can provide.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brooklin-nash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brooklin Nash</a>, co-founder of Beam Content, also<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brooklin-nash_plenty-of-b2b-brands-want-their-content-to-activity-7274486793813520384-_ZNC?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> wrote about the need</a> to refocus on the value of subject-matter expert interviews. He said, &#8220;Nothing in content marketing beats 45 minutes with an SME (except for maybe original benchmark data).”</p>
<p>If brands want to stand out in 2025, Brooklin said they need to start laying the groundwork with SMEs now. He added that your SMEs can come from your internal pool of experts, your C-suite, customers, and external influencers, to name a few.</p>
<p>No matter how it’s done, look for experiential content to be a growing SEO trend in 2025.</p>
<div id="shift-to-user-centric-seo"></div>
<h3>6. The shift to user-centric SEO crystalizes</h3>
<p>Another important SEO trend for 2025 is the shift from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide">keyword-focused optimization</a> to user-focused optimization. In other words, we’ll need to address<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-intent"> intent</a> and answer the granular questions users now ask instead of highly optimizing for one specific keyword.</p>
<p>Consider this: Only<a href="https://surferseo.com/blog/ai-overviews-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 5.4%</a> of Google AIOs contained an exact query match in one large-scale study. That’s not a surprise since one of AI’s superpowers is understanding the context of natural language. But since AIOs are a bellwether for search as a whole, it’s a point of proof that, more than ever, SEO needs to focus on user intent over exact phrase matching.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-google-visit-thailand-result.webp" alt="SEO trends - Example of a AIO without matching keyword." width="809" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88096 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-google-visit-thailand-result.webp 809w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-google-visit-thailand-result-480x356.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 809px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://surferseo.com/blog/ai-overviews-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Surferseo</em></a><em> used this example to show that intent, not keyword matching, matters more now.</em></p>
<p>The Google API leak and what we learned from the<a href="https://searchengineland.com/former-googler-google-using-clicks-in-rankings-432401" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Google antitrust trial</a> backed this up. Specifically, we saw that Google’s Navboost system considers not just click count but a variety of click types, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>badClicks</li>
<li>goodClicks</li>
<li>lastLongestClicks</li>
<li>unsquashedClicks</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-google-api-leak.webp" alt="SEO trends - Google API leak screenshot." width="730" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88097 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-google-api-leak.webp 730w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-google-api-leak-480x395.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 730px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/an-anonymous-source-shared-thousands-of-leaked-google-search-api-documents-with-me-everyone-in-seo-should-see-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>This means Google cares about how its users engage with your content, not just if they click into it, which brings us back to meeting the real intent of a search, not just matching a keyword.</p>
<p>Now, consider how AI chatbots and answer engines provide information. They’re like Google’s featured snippet on steroids. You&#8217;ll need to provide more concise answers to granular questions to get cited in Google’s AIOs (and other answer engines).</p>
<p>Bernard Huang <a href="https://www.clearscope.io/blog/ranch-style-seo-content-strategy#reason-1-shift-from-keyword-centric-to-topic-centric-seo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> an interesting perspective here. He suggests that “Ranch Style” SEO content is the replacement of the old skyscraper post. Instead of creating one giant asset that ticks all the keyword boxes, SEOs should produce several shorter, more focused pieces that interlink.</p>
<p>Bernard said each of those pieces should include some experience and information others don’t.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-ranch-seo.webp" alt="SEO trends - Ranch style SEO graph." width="879" height="534" class="aligncenter wp-image-88098 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-ranch-seo.webp 879w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-ranch-seo-480x292.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 879px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.clearscope.io/blog/ranch-style-seo-content-strategy#reason-1-shift-from-keyword-centric-to-topic-centric-seo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>As we move deeper into 2025, we’ll learn even more about which types of content are successful for both SEO and AEO. But the trends suggest that over-focusing on keywords is out while user and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-intent">intent focuses</a> are in.</p>
<div id="need-to-address-zero-click-searches"></div>
<h3>7. We’ll need to address zero-click searches</h3>
<p>The threat of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/03/23/google-zero-search-results">zero-click searches</a> has loomed large since Google first rolled out featured snippets. We’ll likely see them become a bigger portion of searches this year. Marketers who currently rely on search traffic for growth will need to account for this new reality in their 2025 strategy.</p>
<p>In July of 2024, Rand Fishkin <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/2024-zero-click-search-study-for-every-1000-us-google-searches-only-374-clicks-go-to-the-open-web-in-the-eu-its-360/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviewed clickstream data</a> for Google users. He found that just over 41% of US searches ended up in a click. However, once you remove clicks going to Google-owned properties (e.g., Google Flights), only 360 of every 1,000 searches resulted in a click to open the web.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-google-traffic-fishkin.webp" alt="SEO trends - Fishkin's Google results graphic." width="755" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88099 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-google-traffic-fishkin.webp 755w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-google-traffic-fishkin-480x381.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 755px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/2024-zero-click-search-study-for-every-1000-us-google-searches-only-374-clicks-go-to-the-open-web-in-the-eu-its-360/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>It’s important to note that this data confirms an upward trend. A <a href="https://searchengineland.com/zero-click-study-semrush-389067" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 study</a> showed that zero-click results made up just a quarter of all searches.</p>
<p>Could this be the effect of AIOs? Probably not, since AIOs weren’t showing up in a ton of searches in July. But that doesn’t mean they won’t have an effect in the future.<a href="https://searchengineland.com/generative-ai-impact-website-rankings-traffic-443624" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Search Engine Land speculated</a> an increase in overall searches but a decrease in referral traffic due to AIOs. The jury’s still out, but if AIOs have any effect, it’ll be to increase zero-click searches, not decrease them.</p>
<p>The growth of answer engines and the increasing use of social media sites as search platforms add to the zero-click trend. Perplexity, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc., work hard to keep users from clicking away from their platforms.</p>
<p>There are still plenty of organic clicks to be had (even 30% of billions of searches is a lot). But we are also finally at a place where we can’t ignore zero-click searches. That means in 2025, we’ll all need some zero-click search strategies in our marketing plan.</p>
<div id="saying-seo-is-dead-dies"></div>
<h3>8. Saying “SEO is dead” finally dies</h3>
<p>For years, we’ve heard the chorus that adaptations like zero-click searches and evolving algorithms would be the death of SEO. The data proves otherwise, and the tune is finally changing. Leading voices point out that search is thriving—it just looks different and is happening in other places.</p>
<p>Neil Patel Digital recently <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/neilkpatel_despite-what-everyone-thought-when-google-activity-7274822699070148608-Soz2?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran a test</a> on 30,000 websites. The results? Organic traffic increased despite the prevalence of AI Overviews.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-Patel.webp" alt="SEO trends - Patel Linkedin post." width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88100 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-Patel.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seo-trends-wordstream-Patel-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>

<p>To be fair, many solid websites have lost a chunk of their organic search traffic, so it’s a trend we can’t ignore. But even if that continues, search offers other benefits—like brand awareness and traffic from other sources—that will continue to make it a viable marketing strategy.</p>
<p>Here’s how <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robinlmay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rob May</a>, Senior SEO Manager at DNSnetworks, put it in a recent <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7278060392503758848?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28ugcPost%3A7278060392503758848%2C7278461282918248451%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287278461282918248451%2Curn%3Ali%3AugcPost%3A7278060392503758848%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn comment</a>.</p>

<p>In 2025, We’ll see SEOs recalibrating to take advantage of these opportunities. That’ll include some of the tactics we’ve covered, like AEO, as well as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/articles/keyword-research-for-social-media-guide">social media SEO</a> and new measurements around awareness and conversions instead of just traffic.</p>
<h2>Stay on top of SEO trends in 2025</h2>
<p>You can’t have growth without change. So as <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/seo-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search evolves</a> into its full multi-channel, AI-powered reality, we’ll need to adjust our goals and strategies to meet it…or miss out on the opportunities <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-trends-and-predictions-rest-of-2025">2025’s version of SEO</a> offers.</p>

<h2>7 ways SEO changed in 2024 (and not always for the better!)</h2>
<p>Here are the top seven ways SEO changed in 2024.</p>
<div id="ai-overviews-shook-up-serps"></div>
<h3>1. AI Overviews shook up Google SERPs</h3>
<p>If you’ve run informational searches on Google recently, you’ve likely seen something like this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ai-overview-example.webp" alt="example of ai overviews on google" width="870" height="469" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87687" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ai-overview-example.webp 870w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ai-overview-example-480x259.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 870px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>These are AI Overviews, AI-generated responses to queries created by Google. Three things are currently true about AI Overviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>In some niches for some sites, they’ve already had a massive impact.</li>
<li>In some niches and for some sites, they’ve had precisely zero impact.</li>
<li>Their impact is expanding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at the history of AI Overviews:</p>
<ol>
<li>Google tested AI Overviews (then called <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/19/google-search-generative-experience">Search Generative Experience or SGE</a>) from 2023 to 2024.</li>
<li>On May 14, 2024, Google officially rolled out these overviews, calling them <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-overviews">AI Overviews</a>.</li>
<li>Many of these results were pretty bad, even <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-ai-overview-fails-442575" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dangerous</a>, and Google got a lot of blowback in the press for the quality of AI overviews.</li>
<li>Third parties have <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-ai-overviews-visibility-new-low-444048" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> that the number of search queries impacted by AI overviews was between 7-15% in the summer of 2024.</li>
<li>Those numbers continue to <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-ai-overviews-volatility-continues-rise-fall-repeat-445177" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fluctuate</a>, and Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/ai-overviews-search-october-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded the reach of AI Overviews to over 100 countries at the end of October 2024</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Percentages like 7-15% don’t sound like a lot, but for a certain set of queries that might mean more like 80% of searches. Or your site might get 60-70% of its traffic from 25-50 pages, and those pages might be disproportionally impacted.</p>
<p>If you’re a cybersecurity software company, you may be seeing results like this one (only with ads overlaid over the AI Overview) in all of the search results where you rank in organic results:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cybersecurity-ai-overview-example.webp" alt="ai overview example from cybersecurity query" width="856" height="429" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87688" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cybersecurity-ai-overview-example.webp 856w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cybersecurity-ai-overview-example-480x241.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 856px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you’re a local business trying to rank for plumbing in Sioux Falls, you likely don’t have an AI Overview within miles of your SERPs:</p>

<p>The results here are still <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/11/google-local-service-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Local Services Ads</a>, Google Maps, and standard organic search. Through all of the shake ups the SERP displays, the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-seo-in-2024">best practices for local SEO stay relatively consistent</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How does this impact sites? </strong>For sites that have AI Overviews in a lot of their search results, there are a variety of impacts, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less traffic: Your page could be pushed down in search results, which would lead to less traffic.</li>
<li>More traffic: Getting featured in AI Overviews may <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drive more traffic to your site</a>.</li>
<li>Inaccurate tracking results: Rank tracking tools are showing a page that is featured in AI Overviews (even if it’s well below the “load more” button and many searchers may not be seeing it) as ranking “#1.”</li>
</ul>

<div id="ai-generated-content-creation"></div>
<h3>2. AI-generated content was created en masse</h3>
<p>The ability to push a button and—for very low costs—generate content of reasonable quality is another thing that’s had a major impact on SEO in 2024.</p>
<p>Originality AI <a href="https://originality.ai/ai-content-in-google-search-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimates</a> that the percentage of AI content ranking in the top 20 Google results has more than doubled in 2024.</p>
<p>Entire industries have been built around the growth of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/25/ai-content-generators">generative AI content</a>, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://searchengineland.com/ai-chatgpt-content-detectors-395957" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI content detectors</a></li>
<li>AI writing tools</li>
<li>AI content editing services</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course, many more are likely to pop up over time.</p>
<div id="google-responded-to-ai-generated-content"></div>
<h3>3. Google responded to AI-generated content</h3>
<p>During the pandemic, people flocked to online sources to do comparison shopping. Many affiliates had quietly been ranking for all kinds of “best X” and “best X for Y” searches. With all of the new search volume around these terms, additional attention (in the form of media and users noticing) was paid to this fact.</p>
<p>Subsequent updates meant that these smaller affiliates were replaced with large, authoritative sites (more on this shortly).</p>
<p>This is a common trend in Google search results over the years. It’s happened with <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/jason-calacanis-revenge-google-matt-cutts-18794.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">larger publishers cranking out thin content</a>, with <a href="https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2014/03/19/google-penalizes-myblogguest-a-guest-blog-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guest blog marketplaces</a>, with <a href="https://retrododo.com/google-is-killing-retro-dodo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">niche sites</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/seo-heist-aftermath-how-burn-your-organic-traffic-nick-malekos-yjqgf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s already happened with AI</a>. The basic cycle goes something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>{Thing} starts to work for ranking in Google.</li>
<li>Attention starts to swirl around the fact that {thing} is working, there is an article in the tech press somewhere.</li>
<li>Google takes some kind of action (sometimes manual, sometimes algorithmic).</li>
<li>{Thing} may still work to some extent or with some specific adjustments, but it doesn’t work as easily or for the same people (particularly those who had been highlighted in the press).</li>
</ol>

<h3>4. Search results shifted to focus on forum and tools content</h3>
<p>As Google responded to AI content, one of the biggest shifts in 2024 (a continuation of Google updates over the last couple of years) has been how aggressively “UGC” or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/28/user-generated-content">user-generated content</a> from forums and Q&amp;A sites has been.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/03/organic-traffic">organic traffic</a> to Reddit:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/organic-traffic-to-reddit.webp" alt="organic traffic to reddit" width="829" height="355" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87690" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/organic-traffic-to-reddit.webp 829w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/organic-traffic-to-reddit-480x206.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 829px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here’s organic traffic to a niche forum focused on stargazing (many niches will have a forum or two with the same graph):</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/niche-forum-stargazing-example.webp" alt="traffic to niche forum on stargazing" width="827" height="352" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87691" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/niche-forum-stargazing-example.webp 827w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/niche-forum-stargazing-example-480x204.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 827px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And here’s the traffic graph for Omnicalculator, a large site with calculators around topics like calculating a dog’s weight, calculating steps to calories, etc.:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/omnicalculator-traffic.webp" alt="traffic to omnicalculator" width="829" height="351" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87692" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/omnicalculator-traffic.webp 829w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/omnicalculator-traffic-480x203.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 829px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Looking at where Omnicalculator has gained traffic in the last year is particularly instructive here. Some of the terms are calculator terms where they displaced other calculators or traditional articles, but here are some terms in the top 10 traffic gainers for them:</p>
<ul>
<li>calorie deficit</li>
<li>slope</li>
<li>diameter of a circle</li>
<li>how to find the p value</li>
</ul>
<div id="search-results-shifted-to-favor-forum-tools-content"></div>
<h3>5. Affiliates and niche sites were hit hard by updates</h3>
<p>Google’s Helpful Content Update impacted a lot of “niche sites” or small independent publishing sites focused on a specific area (frequently focused around and dependent upon Google for traffic, which was then monetized via ads or affiliate marketing).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/august-2024-google-core-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some sites have seen recoveries</a>, some have seen partial recoveries, and many have abandoned any effort to recover or rank in Google at all.</p>
<p>Helpful content updates have been the subject of a ton of speculation, misinformation, and agitation for those impacted. Speculation about the focus of these updates includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://moz.com/blog/helpful-content-update-not-what-you-think" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focus on brand strength</a>.</li>
<li>The wrong combination of not having a strong domain and <a href="https://x.com/GrindstoneSEO/status/1851858039432974381" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having the wrong anchor text mix</a>.</li>
<li>“Over-optimization” or an overly aggressive (particularly for smaller sites with fewer/lower quality link domains pointed to their site) <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/outdated-seo-tactics">SEO tactics</a> (title tags, headers, content, and links all using targeted keywords aggressively).</li>
</ul>
<div id="parasite-seo-gained-traction"></div>
<h3>6. Parasite SEO gained traction</h3>
<p>Every Google action leads to an equal and sometimes opposite reaction from SEOs.</p>
<p>An interesting picture is starting to form here:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI content is getting better and is widely and cheaply available.</li>
<li>Google has aggressively favored UGC or forum content and content hosted on big brand sites like Forbes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enter: Parasite SEO and “Site Reputation Abuse.”</p>
<p>While <a href="https://x.com/Charles_SEO/status/1848335859608957257" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parasite SEO didn’t start in 2024</a>, it has become a more talked about and more heavily utilized tactic.</p>
<p>This manifests in a few ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reddit spam:</strong> Many people have found ways to game <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-smart-bidding">Reddit</a> so that their recommendations float to the top of Reddit posts and threads that are ranking in high-traffic search results.</li>
<li><strong>Contributed articles:</strong> Marketers would pay to have an article placed on an authoritative site with their own affiliate links in the article. Often these marketers will also use low-quality (and cheap) link sources to get the articles to rank (this can work on authoritative sites, even if it frequently may not on smaller sites, and of course there’s little risk for the poster because the site getting risky and spammy links pointed to it is not their site).</li>
<li><strong>Brands doing affiliate marketing:</strong> Large brands like <a href="https://larslofgren.com/forbes-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cnet-published-ai-generated-stories-then-its-staff-pushed-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNET</a> cranked out AI-generated articles and/or product roundup posts and generated affiliate income from that content.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, of course, as this practice got more and more press and attention, Google responded with a “site reputation abuse” policy and <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2024/11/site-reputation-abuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a> this year.</p>
<p>Outlook India, which had become a popular parasite SEO host, has seen surges and drops in the way of all of this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/outlook-india-parasite-seo.webp" alt="traffic to outlook india parasite seo site" width="830" height="353" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87693" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/outlook-india-parasite-seo.webp 830w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/outlook-india-parasite-seo-480x204.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 830px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And <a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/cnn-forbes-lose-millions-google-seo-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes and CNN</a> saw hits as well:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/forbes-cnn-traffic.webp" alt="traffic loss for forbes and cnn" width="829" height="358" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87694" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/forbes-cnn-traffic.webp 829w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/forbes-cnn-traffic-480x207.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 829px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>More and more stories <a href="https://recleudo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">along these lines</a> continue to surface, and as they get pushed into the press and Google responds, what works and doesn’t will likely continue to change.</p>
<div id="google-recognized-as-monopoly"></div>
<h3>7. Google was recognized as a monopoly (and it had consequences!)</h3>
<p>Google is no stranger to accusations of being a search monopoly, and it seems like <a href="https://searchengineland.com/googles-quality-rating-guide-leaked-version-five-196619" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their search quality rater guidelines get leaked every year</a>, but there were some developments that were specific to 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google had a <a href="https://searchengineland.com/unpacking-googles-massive-search-documentation-leak-442716" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search documentation leak</a>.</li>
<li>An endpoint exploit <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-algorithm-documents-leak">exposed more information about the algorithm</a>.</li>
<li>This summer Google was officially <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24155520/judge-rules-on-us-doj-v-google-antitrust-search-suit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruled a search monopoly in court</a>, and next year the Department of Justice may force Google to take any number of actions, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24300617/doj-google-search-antitrust-chrome-breakup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spinning off and selling Chrome</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While this may not have had a visible impact on many sites trying to rank in search results in 2024, there could be any number of implications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes to the algorithm as Google has less behavioral data.</li>
<li>Changes to Google’s behavior in general as they’re under the watchful eye of the US government and have officially been labeled a monopoly.</li>
<li>Impacts on things like search result layouts, search syndication, etc, as yet unforeseen consequences of the ruling that force Google in other directions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Google also had a creator summit&#8211;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq77Xjbx_mQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recapped</a> by various <a href="https://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/tech/google-creators-event.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attendees</a>&#8211;where they <a href="https://mike-hardaker.com/f/i-drank-the-kool-aid-at-the-2024-google-web-creator-summit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted</a> that in some HCU traffic drops, content was not the issue.</p>

<h2>The future of SEO: Tips and takeaways for small businesses in 2025</h2>
<p>Even if you’re a small, locally-focused business, any and all of these changes, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-trends-2025">trends</a>, and events in 2024 <em>could </em>impact you at <em>some </em>point.</p>
<p>But what can you actually do about any of them right now?</p>
<h3>Tips for 2025 SEO success</h3>
<p>There are a few things that you (or the person in charge of your SEO) can do right away to address these trends:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on user-generated content and placement on large sites:</strong> If forums are showing up in relevant search results and contributed posts on larger sites are showing up prominently in search results, you’d be doing yourself a disservice if you didn’t explore how you can get your customers to comment on prominently featured forum threads or how you can get a contributed post on a publication well-positioned to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google">rank for your targeted terms</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Invest in tools and calculators:</strong> Even a local home services company can build cost calculators or tools to help plan out a home renovation, and these types of utilities are exactly what Google’s currently ranking for lots of relevant search terms.</li>
<li><strong>Have a strategy around AI content:</strong> Google <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/02/google-search-and-ai-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has said</a> they don’t explicitly penalize AI content, but AI content without any editing or guardrails can certainly get sites into trouble. You can drive highly qualified search traffic that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-generation-ideas">increases leads</a> and sales without using AI content at all, and you can incorporate carefully edited AI content into your strategy as well. Make sure you know which one your company or your agency are executing, and that you understand the risks and rewards around each.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Looking for more ways to drive people to your site?</strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website</a></p>
<h3>Key takeaways to inform your 2025 SEO strategy</h3>
<p>Additionally, there are a few things you can keep in mind as 2025 progresses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monitor placements in AI Overviews and AI search results:</strong> Currently, showing up in AI search results is unlikely to have a significant impact on local business search traffic. And again: You may not have a single AI Overview in your “dentists in Dover” search results currently. That said, it’s important to start to understand <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-overviews-breaking-search">how AI Overviews work</a>, and what you’ll want to do to rank for them as they do get introduced.</li>
<li><strong>Keep up with Google’s PR offensive and upcoming court appearance:</strong> Keeping an eye on what happens in search results, what happens with Google in the press, and anticipating the likely implications is all part of a responsible search strategy. Whoever is overseeing your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/05/seo-strategy">SEO strategy</a> should be aware of these kinds of updates, and how they’re (actually) impacting your business&#8217;s search results (again sometimes the answer to this question will be “not at all”).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Get prepared for better SEO in 2025</h2>
<p>Ultimately the main thing to keep in mind as you enter 2025 is to try to understand how your search results (both the rankings and the search features included in them) have changed, are changing, and may change in the future so that you can continue to generate as many leads, sales, and profits as you can from SEO in 2025.</p>
