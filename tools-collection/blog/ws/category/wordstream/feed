<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/12/12/top-marketing-tips">The Top 20 Tips From Our Blog This Year: Nuances &#038; Tricks Too Good to Miss</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We publish a LOT of content. And if you’ve been following us for any amount of time, you’ll know that we strive to provide tips and insights that you don’t find in just any old blog.</p>
<p>Two problems though:</p>
<ol>
<li>Google is designed to surface information that people know to look for, and</li>
<li>People are designed to skim.</li>
</ol>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/skimming-meme.jpg" alt="skimming meme" width="332" height="172" class=" wp-image-68713 aligncenter" /></p>
<p>The result? A lot of our truly best tips—the small nuances, side notes, and pro pointers that make a big difference—fall under the radar. So we’ve compiled our best tips of the year that you may have missed, but simply can&#8217;t afford to if you want to succeed in 2023. They just may be game-changers for your business!</p>

<h2>Our premium PPC pointers</h2>
<p>These pointers are primarily focused on search and social, with some video and remarketing campaign gems sprinkled in there too.<br />
<a id="google"></a></p>
<h3>Google Ads</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>To target your competitor audiences without breaking the bank,</strong> we shared some great lower-cost alternatives to competitor keyword targeting on search, including Quora ads by topic or interest, Linkedin Member Groups, Twitter follower lookalikes, Reddit communities, and YouTube search results. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/14/competitor-targeting">Go to post.</a></li>
<li><strong>To save money in Google ads</strong>, stick with city/neighborhood targeting. Zip codes are great in theory, but ad platforms can sometimes have a hard time determining them. The former can give you a better reach. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/21/how-to-save-money-google-ads">Go to post.</a></li>
<li><strong>Break-even or no-profit Google Ads campaigns could still be worth it </strong>if your goal is to move product, if it’s a competitor conquesting campaign, it’s a sale with a high LTV customer, or it’s a local brand awareness campaign. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/11/is-google-ads-worth-it">Go to post.</a><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/is-google-ads-worth-it-break-even-no-profit-worth-it.png" alt="break-even and no-profit situations where google ads can be worth it" width="580" height="416" class="wp-image-62697 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/is-google-ads-worth-it-break-even-no-profit-worth-it.png 580w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/is-google-ads-worth-it-break-even-no-profit-worth-it-480x344.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 580px, 100vw" /></li>
<li><strong>Responsive search ads are not a replacement for ad copy testing.</strong> You should still be routinely testing your ad copy with 2-4 active variants in each ad group. Each month, pause the underperforming one and replace it with a new variant. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/07/google-ads-mistakes">Go to post.</a></li>
<li><strong>Watch out for duplicate imagery in PMax!</strong> If you connect your Google Merchant Center feed to a Performance Max campaign, then you don&#8217;t need to add product images as separate image assets. Instead, add lifestyle images of real people using/wearing the product. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/05/performance-max-tips">Go to post.</a></li>

<p><a id="facebook"></a></p>
<h3>Facebook ads</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Consolidating your Facebook conversion actions can save you a ton of time.</strong> Not for the sake of Aggregated Event Measurement, but because this can allow you to get conversion counts in the campaign-level view and make account-wide decisions much faster. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/13/facebook-advertising-tips">Go to post.</a><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/facebook-ad-campaign-view.png" alt="facebook ad campaign level view" width="720" height="59" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-68270" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/facebook-ad-campaign-view.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/facebook-ad-campaign-view-480x39.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></li>
<li><strong>Super creative Facebook targeting hack:</strong> Bummed out by the restrictions on targeting based on employment, real estate, and finance targeting? Use in-market audiences on Google, which still offer this kind of targeting, to get traffic to your site that you can use as a source audience for a Facebook lookalike campaign. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/31/facebook-audience-targeting">Go to post.</a></li>
<li><strong>The most reliable and efficient way to scale your Facebook ad budget</strong> is through cost per result goal bidding (formerly cost cap). Try out several bids with CBO (Campaign Budget Optimization) turned on and a minimum spend on each ad set. Facebook will automatically test various bids across different ranges, so you’ll be able to easily identify and scale up your most successful tactics. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/12/06/facebook-advertising-trends">Go to post.</a></li>
<li><strong>Be smart with your lookalike audiences. </strong>The pixel can&#8217;t track all of your website visitors, so a customer or email subscriber list as a seed list is your best bet. If you do use a website page, use a high-intent page like</li>
</ol>
<h3>More PPC</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>The one CTA per landing page may not be the best practice for your business.</strong> Don’t discount secondary conversion actions on some of your high intent landing pages—like an email signup, or a calculator tool. They may not be the conversion goal you want, but they may capture users you can retarget. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/21/how-to-save-money-google-ads">Go to post.</a></li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t prematurely pause your remarketing campaigns.</strong> Yes, your audience needs to be at least 1000 people, but if you’re using a customer list as a seed for a Lookalike or Similar Audience, it can take up to 48 hours to process and you’ll get a “too small to serve” until it fully renders. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/17/retargeting-campaign-tips">Go to post.</a></li>
<li><strong>Video campaigns have some fine print you need to be aware of.</strong> For example, if you’re researching GDN websites to place your Video campaign on, know that Google will show you every site in the GDN, not just the ones with video ad placements. So check those sites before adding them to avoid wasted spend. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/29/google-ads-video-campaign-settings">Go to post.</a></li>
</ol>
<ol></ol>
<p><a id="copywriting"></a></p>
<h2>The cream of our copywriting crop</h2>
<p>Our template and example posts are always big hits, but you may have missed some of these finer details when browsing:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>There are more than seven power words.</strong> Yes, words like “you,” “free,” and “because” are the classic power words but don’t discount the power of using alternatives to “ultimate,” “boost,” and “innovative.” Try out these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/22/power-words">350 interesting words and phrases</a> that will make you stand out.</li>
<li><strong>Use Google Trends to capture nuances in your ad copy.</strong> Take &#8220;marketing tools&#8221; vs &#8220;marketing software,&#8221; for example. In Wisconsin there is more of a disposition toward tools, while in Alabama it&#8217;s software. This can make a world of difference in your click-through rates and campaigns. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/17/retargeting-campaign-tips">Go to post.</a><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/google-trends-nuances.png" alt="google trends nuances" width="720" height="312" class="size-full wp-image-68697 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/google-trends-nuances.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/google-trends-nuances-480x208.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></li>
<li><strong>To keep your blog readers hooked</strong>, use bucket brigades throughout your posts. This is a fancy term for conversational bridge phrases between paragraphs like “truth is…” “Here’s what I mean:” and “But that’s not all.” Just don&#8217;t overdo it and remember that your post should still be skimmable. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/05/conversational-tone">Go to post.</a></li>
<li><strong>Avoid obvious or framing questions</strong> at the start of your business and social profile descriptions, blurbs, and other elevator pitch material—like “Are you looking to get more customers?” or “Need an all-in-one platform that will help you manage subscription invoicing? Be creative. Your goal is to capture attention here, not sneak in features or benefits. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/16/elevator-pitch-examples-templates">Go to post.</a></li>
<li><strong>Know the 3 Rs with your PPC ad copy:</strong> Reiterate and reinforce but don’t be redundant. Yes, relevance to keyword is important for Quality Score. But once in your headline, display path, and/or description is enough. Use the rest of the space for features, benefits, or related keywords. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/03/how-to-write-exceptional-ppc-ad-copy">Go to post.</a><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-repetition-redundant-reinforce.png" alt="ppc ad copy tips - example of google ads that are repetitive, redundant, and reinforcing" width="720" height="501" class="size-full wp-image-65056 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-repetition-redundant-reinforce.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-repetition-redundant-reinforce-480x334.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></li>

<h2>Our best website &amp; SEO savvy</h2>
<p>We&#8217;re always working on our own SEO as we help you to improve yours. Here are some tidbits you may have missed:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You have to be a little boring sometimes</strong> <strong>to rank higher on Google</strong>. This means using clear titles and headings over creative ones. This especially helps Google to build custom meta descriptions that improve your click appeal in the SERP. But don’t worry, you can use more fun wording when you repurpose those posts into guides and social posts. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google">Go to the post.</a><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/unclear-vs-clear-headings-for-seo.png" alt="clear vs unclear headings" width="549" height="275" class=" wp-image-68725 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/unclear-vs-clear-headings-for-seo.png 549w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/unclear-vs-clear-headings-for-seo-480x252.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 549px, 100vw" /></li>
<li><strong>Compressed images could still drag down page speed</strong> if they&#8217;re unnecessarily wide. If you use sidebars in your blog layout, find out the maximum width of the content section and make sure your images don’t exceed that. You can save a few trips to the server and improve your on-page SEO. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/06/on-page-seo">Go to post.</a></li>
<li><strong>Your target audience for content shouldn&#8217;t just be potential customers. </strong>You need to add potential amplifiers as a persona. These include industry publications and influencers who will share your content with their audiences on social and link to it in their blog posts. This is key to getting a meaningful lift in relevant (potential customer!) traffic to your site, especially for niche content that may not be as keyword-targeted. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">Go to post.</a></li>
<li><strong>To improve your SEO through internal link building</strong>, strive to make any page on your site no more than three clicks away from your homepage. Make sure that in addition to anchor text, you’re optimizing your navigation menus, footers, sidebars, and pillar pages. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/04/internal-linking">Go to post.</a></li>
<li><strong>Prioritizing accessibility will also help with your SEO and CRO, </strong>so make sure it&#8217;s a part of your website audit. Check for HTML tags, clear and descriptive anchor text, image alt text, and easy-to-use forms. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/24/website-audit-checklist">Go to post.</a></li>

<p>On each episode of this season of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/goal-talk?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_content=">Goal Talk podcast,</a> I interview a marketing or management expert to bring small business owners and marketers the information they need to successfully <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/growth-academy">grow</a> their businesses.</p>
<p>So far on the podcast, we’ve talked through many <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/07/best-marketing-strategies">marketing tactics</a> with our in-house experts, ranging from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/18/goal-talk-podcast">creating your website</a> and getting your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/03/goal-talk-episode-4">personas created</a> to specifics in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/24/goal-talk-episode-7">paid ad auctions</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/28/goal-talk-episode-12">ad copywriting</a>, and many more in-between. So far, the majority of our conversations about search engine marketing have been about paid advertising tactics. And while <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/ppc">paid search marketing</a> is an extremely important part of a business’s marketing mix, we would be remiss if we didn’t spend some time discussing the organic side with search engine optimization.</p>

<p>Search engine optimization helps pages on your website rank well on search engines like Google and Bing so you can increase both the quality and quantity of your website traffic. SEO is a largely free tactic that will allow Google’s algorithm to intake your website content and rank it for a search query, based on the information on your website and the search itself. While in PPC you pay to have your link and headline show up at the top of the first page of the SERP, SEO is what powers the organic listings below the ads at the top of the page. So how do you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/30/seo-basics">get started</a> in optimizing your website for SEO?</p>
<p>In this episode, WordStream&#8217;s in-house SEO manager <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/gordon-donnelly-2472">Gordon Donnelly</a> breaks down:</p>
<ul>
<li>The essential elements of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/23/seo-for-startups">starting out in SEO</a>.</li>
<li>Tips for optimizing your site.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo-software">Tools</a> for keyword research.</li>
<li>Resources to help keep you up to date with changes.</li>
</ul>

<p>On each episode of this season of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/goal-talk?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_content=">Goal Talk podcast</a>, I interview a marketing or management expert to bring small business owners and marketers the information they need to successfully <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/growth-academy">grow</a> their businesses.</p>
<p>It’s been two full weeks since we’ve had an episode of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/goal-talk?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_content=">Goal Talk podcast</a>, and while we’re embracing our updated bi-weekly episode release schedule, we missed releasing an episode last week! So it only felt right to bring a guest <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/21/goal-talk-episode-11">back onto the podcast</a> this week to bring an update on the state of digital marketing during COVID-19 for advertisers.</p>
<h2>This week: Current updates on COVID-19 marketing tips, performance data, and account reactivation</h2>
<p>Last time we had <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/mark-irvine-42">Mark</a> on the podcast, we discussed the preliminary data around how the social effects of social distancing and mandatory business practice modifications have impacted digital marketing for advertisers. That <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/21/goal-talk-episode-11">episode</a> was released about a month ago as we were navigating the first few weeks of the majority of the effects of the pandemic worldwide. In the episode, we discussed how search trends and patterns are shifting, some options for small business assistance from the government, and the data around how the mandated changes have impacted the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/18/covid-19-google-ads-data">PPC results</a> for multiple industries.</p>

</div>
<p>This week, we have more information—including more data—about how the long-term effects of COVID-19 are playing out for a variety of advertisers. With strong signals of a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/05/04/ppc-rebound-covid-19-data">rebound</a> in the PPC results for advertisers in many industries, this episode discusses the options advertisers have for reading their own data and working towards <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/05/06/google-ads-account-recovery">reactivating their accounts</a> for continued success.</p>
<p>In today’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/goal-talk?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_content=">episode</a>, we discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updates on the current state of search.</li>

<li>Tips for marketers during their reactivation efforts.</li>
<li>Signals for advertisers to look for in their accounts.</li>

<p>On each episode of this season of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/goal-talk?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_creative=">Goal Talk podcast</a>, I interview a marketing or management expert to bring small business owners and marketers the information they need to successfully <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/growth-academy">grow</a> their businesses.</p>
<p>Last week, we dove deep into another highly visible and incredibly important aspect of your digital marketing campaigns—landing pages. For last week’s episode, I interviewed a long-tenured WordStream marketing expert who currently runs our in-house agency team, Zina Kayyali, to discuss the essential elements of effective landing pages for advertisers across industries. Among other things, we walked through the importance of having highly relevant and specific landing pages for your offers. If you haven’t heard that episode yet you can<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/goal-talk?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_creative="> find it here.</a></p>
<h2>This week’s topic: Finding a work-life balance in a small business</h2>
<p>Though we’ve discussed many aspects of both digital marketing and small business management, we’ve devoted the last few episodes on advertising topics that are essential to master. This week, I interview another tenured WordStream marketer, Greg Herrmann, our in-house learning and development program manager, to discuss the importance of creating a culture that promotes a healthy balance between work and personal life.</p>

</div>
<p>Throughout this episode, we discuss why providing an environment of trust and balance is important, as well as some examples we have both experienced in our time in the workforce. We provide examples of companies doing this really well, as well as some ways to provide a great and manageable balance to employees.</p>
<p>In this week’s episode, we discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>What a work-life balance is and why it’s so important for employees.</li>
<li>Examples of ways to better your culture to promote a work-life balance.</li>
<li>Examples of companies doing it really well.</li>
<li>How companies that are just starting out can prioritize balance while maintaining high growth goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>And more!</p>
<p><strong>An important note about the episode:</strong> This interview with Greg was recorded before we’ve felt the majority of the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. These insights are mainly focused on examples and tactics available within the traditional business environment where employees come into the office but can also be useful for companies during the pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On each episode of this season of the Goal Talk podcast, I interview a marketing or management expert to bring small business owners and marketers the information they need to successfully <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/growth-academy">grow</a> their businesses.</p>
<p>Last week, Mark Irvine and I sat down for a very special episode of the Goal Talk Podcast, where we dove into marketing during COVID-19. From search trend changes to specific data we’re seeing in multiple industries in response to social distancing effects of the coronavirus pandemic, we break down the essential information marketers should know, as well as resources marketers can use to make effective decisions for their businesses. If you haven’t heard that episode, we definitely recommend giving it a listen! <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/goal-talk?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_creative=">Find it here.</a></p>
<h2>This week’s topic: The ins and outs of ad copy</h2>
<p>Let’s get right to it: Ad copy is arguably the most important aspect of your search marketing campaigns. Often the most visible component of an ad, the copy is the hook, line, and sinker to reel in your target audience. While many other aspects we discuss are also very important in the success of your campaigns, ad copy is how people will experience your company and how you will encourage those clicks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="align-center" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Goal-Talk-Ep11-Square_0.png" alt="Goal Talk podcast season 1 episode 12 artwork." data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="49d32ff6-2d0a-4fb2-9170-1e8b804b1598" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this episode, I interview Customer Success Program Manager Jeff Stevens on how to effectively write ad copy that inspires clicks for any industry.</p>
<p>Throughout the episode, we discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to approach writing compelling ad copy.</li>
<li>How to meet Google’s set of conditions for a high quality score.</li>
<li>How to organize your headlines and descriptions.</li>
<li>Different formats and extensions to utilize.</li>
<li>How to use keywords for relevancy and extensions.</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>An important note about the episode: </strong>This interview with Jeff was recorded before we’ve felt the majority of the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. These insights are mainly focused on tactics available within the traditional marketing landscape, so some options will not be available to you or your business at the moment. Regardless, these insights to writing ad copy will benefit you in adjusting existing copy and for writing new ads.</p>

<p>Last week, I interviewed <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/scott-mesite-3692">Scott Mesite</a>, one of WordStream’s resident digital marketing experts to discuss everything Facebook Ads. Just like our episode about the Google Ads auction with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/kristina-simonson-3721">Kirstina Simonson</a>, this episode was centered around how Facebook chooses each ad and how advertisers can target their audience in the most effective way. We also tackle the high-level differences between the advertising on social media versus advertising on search, as well as the changes that need to be made within an account to optimize for both. If you haven’t heard last week’s episode with Scott yet, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/goal-talk?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_creative=">you can listen here</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>This week’s topic: Keeping your customers happy with customer marketing</strong></h2>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes we see made by companies, both B2B and B2C, is stopping their marketing efforts after the sale. While of course marketing is pivotal to earn customers for your business and get the word out about your offer, it’s equally as important to continue to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/19/customer-marketing-strategies">build a relationship with customers </a>after you have completed the sale. Whether your product is something that can be repeatedly purchased by your customer or is a one-time buy, these insights are valuable for all marketers as they help with improving retention, bettering your product to fit more customers’ <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points">needs</a>, and helping your business earn <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/06/referral-marketing">referrals</a>.</p>

<p>This week, I sat down with WordStream’s resident customer marketing champion <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/kim-castings-3985">Kim Castings</a> to discuss exactly what customer marketing means and how you can build a truly customer-first business. Throughout the episode, you’ll learn:</p>

<li>Some examples of companies that do customer marketing really well, plus what we can learn from them.</li>
<li>Differences between how B2B and B2C companies can approach <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/19/customer-marketing-strategies">being customer-led.</a></li>
<li>The most effective ways of staying in touch with a customer after a sale.</li>
<li>Types of data companies should be collecting to be successful in customer marketing.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll cover all this and more.</p>

These insights are mainly focused on tactics available within the traditional marketing landscape, so some options will not be available to you or your business at the moment. Regardless, customer marketing is a really important aspect of making a successful business any time, and it will make all of the difference in retention and gaining new customers.</p>

<p>On each episode of this season of the Goal Talk podcast, I interview a marketing or management expert to bring small business owners and marketers the information they need to successfully <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/growth-academy">grow</a> their businesses.</p>
<p>Last week, we started in on our digital marketing deep-dive by getting into detail about how the Google Ads auction works. And who better to take me through it than WordStream’s in-house Google Ads account manager, Kristina Simonson. Throughout the episode, we went through everything from how Google determines which ad to show, how Google determines how much you’re going to spend, which metrics are the most important to track, and more. If you’re just venturing into the world of advertising online, this preliminary Google Ads episode is a great one to listen to. If you haven’t heard that episode yet, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/goal-talk?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_creative=">you can listen here</a>.</p>
<h2>This week’s topic: How to identify and foster high-potential employees</h2>
<p>As a manager or a business owner, you likely have a team of individuals reporting to you. Sometimes, you’re able to identify those who are highly engaged, high producing, and express the drive to do more than what their job currently entails. Those individuals can be <a href="https://www.pmg.com/blog/strategies-for-managing-high-potential-employees/">classified as high-potential</a>, and require a specific type of guidance for the relationship to work for both them and your business. So how do you identify and empower your employees that may be high potential?</p>

<p>In this next management focused episode of the Goal Talk podcast, we dive more deeply into the specifics around being an effective manager for your employees, and how you can realistically approach fostering a high potential employee to be as successful as possible.</p>
<p>In this week’s episode, I sit down with Lucy Lemons, WordStream’s VP of People Success to discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>What it means to be a high potential employee.</li>
<li>How to identify a high-potential employee on your team.</li>
<li>Tips for employees to “manage up” if they’re not feeling supported.</li>
<li>How managers can find a balance between challenging and supporting employees.</li>
<li>How WordStream approaches high potential employees.</li>
