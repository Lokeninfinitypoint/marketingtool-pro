<h2>10 biggest takeaways from Google Marketing Live 2025</h2>
<p>GML 2025 was a fast-paced presentation of the newest features in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/24/google-ads-examples">Google Ads</a>. Here are the biggest announcements from the event.</p>
<div id="expanded-ads-in-aios-and-ai-mode"></div>
<h3>1. Expanded ads in AIOs and AI Mode</h3>
<p>Several announcements highlighted Google’s push for AI-powered discovery. As the GML speakers put it, the goal is to turn non-commercial intent into “ads that don’t interrupt but help your customers discover you.”</p>
<p>Along that theme, users will soon begin to see expanded ads in their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-overviews">AI Overviews</a> that align with the educational nature of the result. This is something we&#8217;ve anticipated since the announcement of AI Overviews.</p>
<p>Here’s how it’ll work. Say someone searches for “how to bring small dogs on flights,” they’ll see an AIO with helpful tips and an ad for dog carriers.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-first.webp-1.webp" alt="Google Marketing Live 2025 - AIO ads." width="793" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-91743 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-first.webp-1.webp 793w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-first.webp-1-480x363.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 793px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Likewise, users of Google Search&#8217;s newly released<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-mode"> AI Mode</a> will see ads that pull a commercial intent from an educational query and serve an ad to match it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-ai-mode-mobile.webp" alt="Google Marketing Live 2025 -AI Mode ad on mobile." width="337" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-91744 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-ai-mode-mobile.webp 337w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-ai-mode-mobile-169x300.webp 169w" sizes="(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px" /></p>
<p>These new ad placements may be a big boon for advertisers hoping to engage customers as they use more complex search methods. But some PPC pros noted a glaring gap in the announcement: How will these new ads be tracked?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-anu.webp" alt="Google Marketing Live 2025 -Tweet screenshot." width="601" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-91745 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-anu.webp 601w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-anu-480x479.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 601px, 100vw" /></p>

<div id="power-pair-becomes-power-pack"></div>
<h3>2. Power Pair becomes Power Pack</h3>
<p>Google announced the<a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/14835145?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Power Pair</a>—the combo of AI-powered search campaigns and Performance Max—at GML 2024. This year, Google introduced its replacement, the Power Pack, which includes the trio of an upgraded<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/05/performance-max-tips"> Performance Max</a>, AI Max for Search campaigns, and Demand Gen.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-power-pack.webp" alt="Google Marketing Live 2025 - Power Pack image." width="936" height="444" class="aligncenter wp-image-91746 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-power-pack.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-power-pack-480x228.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>A few of the new capabilities included in the Power Pack include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Channel performance reporting and higher granularity reporting in Performance Max (we’ll cover this a little later).</li>
<li>New targeting and creative enhancements in AI Max for Search campaigns (detailed next!).</li>
<li>Upgraded <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/22/demand-gen-campaigns">Demand Gen campaigns</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sentiment among marketers on the new Power Pack was pretty positive. Several mentioned how useful its cross-platform integration will be. Overall, there seems to be a general acceptance that AI and Google Ads are inseparable.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gml-2025-powerpack-ppcchat-tweet.webp" alt="Google Marketing Live 2025 -Tweet screenshot about power pack" width="900" height="693" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91737" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gml-2025-powerpack-ppcchat-tweet.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gml-2025-powerpack-ppcchat-tweet-480x370.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://x.com/JordanBanaf/status/1925230917385404620" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>However, to be fair, not every marketer is enamored with AI’s omnipresence.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-heather.webp" alt="Google Marketing Live 2025 - Tweet screenshot about AI rollouts" width="841" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-91747 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-heather.webp 841w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-heather-480x342.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 841px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://x.com/HeatherMonahan_/status/1925236153592013061" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<div id="ai-max-for-search-campaigns"></div>
<h3>3. AI Max for Search campaigns</h3>
<p>AI Max for Search campaigns is a collection of<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-audience-targeting"> targeting</a> and creative tools designed to help you address the more complex ways people search for things online. You’ll engage all AI Max tools with a single toggle.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-new-campaign.webp" alt="Google Marketing Live 2025 - screenshot of Ad Manager." width="790" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-91748 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-new-campaign.webp 790w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-new-campaign-480x365.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 790px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>AI Max has two main feature sets to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset optimization:</strong> AI Max for Search will use text from your existing ads, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">landing page</a> copy, and assets to adapt your headlines and descriptions on the fly and better meet the intent of a user’s query.</li>
<li><strong>Search term matching:</strong> Google AI learns from your current keywords, creatives, and URLs, then uses <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/broad-match">broad match</a> and keywordless technology to find higher-performing queries.</li>
</ul>
<p>AI Max for Search campaigns is due to roll out to all advertisers globally in beta by the end of May.</p>
<div id="channel-reporting-in-pmax"></div>
<h3>4. Channel reporting in PMax</h3>
<p>You’ll soon see channel-level performance in your Performance Max campaigns.</p>
<p>Open your Channel performance page, and you’ll see a new data visualization that illustrates which channels your customers are engaging on and how that’s affecting your conversion goals.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-channel.webp" alt="Google Marketing Live 2025 - PMax channel chart." width="936" height="533" class="aligncenter wp-image-91749 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-channel.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-channel-480x273.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Improving attribution was a common theme during this year&#8217;s GML, which is a good step in that direction. The open beta for channel reporting in PMax will be available soon.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4b8.png" alt="💸" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Are you wasting money in Google Ads?</strong> Find out with our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Free Google Ads Performance Grader</a></p>
<div id="smart-bidding-exploration-available-globally"></div>
<h3>5. Smart Bidding Exploration available globally</h3>
<p>Smart Bidding Exploration, which is now available globally in beta, gives you a way to access some potentially lucrative<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/12/10/three-types-of-search-queries"> search queries</a> you may have missed out on before. It works by using machine learning to analyze a variety of signals and predicts how likely a conversion is for each<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/articles/what-is-google-adwords"> Google Ads auction</a>. It’ll automatically adjust bids that may exceed ROAS targets but that are still within a targeted range.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-bidding.webp" alt="Google Marketing Live 2025 - bidding screen." width="936" height="527" class="aligncenter wp-image-91750 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-bidding.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-bidding-480x270.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The flexibility of Smart Bidding Exploration offers less-rigid ROAS targets, which opens the door to new opportunities within existing campaigns.</p>
<div id="ai-agentic-tools-in-google-ads-and-google-analytics"></div>
<h3>6. AI agentic tools in Google Ads and Google Analytics</h3>
<p>Conversational AI is coming to your Google Ads and Google Analytics experience. These new AI agents will act like expert marketing guides that suggest and implement ways to optimize your campaigns. They’ll learn from your performance and business data to generate reports, surface insights, and proactively find and fix<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/07/google-ads-mistakes"> problems in your Google Ads account</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-analytics.png" alt="Google Marketing Live 2025 -Analytics AI." width="936" height="527" class="aligncenter wp-image-91720 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-analytics.png 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-analytics-480x270.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is one of the biggest leaps forward in how marketers learn from and manage their Google Ads campaigns. They’ll make setup and execution much faster and improve ad targeting and performance if Google is right.</p>
<p>There were plenty of announcements about AI being used to create ads, too (like turning a static image into a full-on video). Some marketers noted the landmines that these tools lay out for compliance teams.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-kegan.webp" alt="Google Marketing Live 2025 - Tweet screenshot." width="936" height="228" class="aligncenter wp-image-91752 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-kegan.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-kegan-480x117.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://x.com/JonKagan/status/1925235396545331569" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<div id="new-and-upgraded-measurement-tools"></div>
<h3>7. New and upgraded measurement tools</h3>
<p>Marketers constantly request more clarity for their ads, and Google answered at GML with several new and expanded analytics features.</p>
<p>The main measurement announcements at GML 2025 include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Data Manager tools:</strong> Collect <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/12/first-party-data">first-party data</a> from more sources (like Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.), safely store it, and use it more effectively from a “one-stop data shop.”</li>
<li><strong>Expanded incrementality testing:</strong> One of the biggest reactions from the live audience came when Google announced it had lowered the spend threshold on its incrementality testing to $5,000. That comes with an improved testing methodology for better outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-channel measurement enhancements:</strong> Google said deeper cross-channel insights are coming to Google Analytics, including impressions, across Google and other platforms like Reddit and Pinterest.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-data-manager.webp" alt="Google Marketing Live 2025 - Data Manager." width="910" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-91753 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-data-manager.webp 910w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-data-manager-480x316.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 910px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It’s no surprise that these updates took up a lot of the online chat oxygen after they were announced. The feedback was mostly cautiously optimistic, with an appreciation for new data sources but a call out for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/08/attribution-models">attribution</a> from social platforms.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gml-2025-tweet-view-through-data-ga4.webp" alt="Google Marketing Live 2025 - Tweet screenshot about view-through social data in GA4" width="900" height="282" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91739" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gml-2025-tweet-view-through-data-ga4.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gml-2025-tweet-view-through-data-ga4-480x150.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://x.com/SPoulton/status/1925297814189613435" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<div id="youtube-updates-for-ads-creators-and-conversions"></div>
<h3>8. YouTube updates for ads, creators, and conversions</h3>
<p>It seems video continues to be a bigger deal at Google. This year,<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/03/how-to-advertise-on-youtube"> YouTube advertising</a> took up much more space than in past GML events.</p>
<p>Three of the most significant YouTube announcements included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shoppable masthead:</strong> YouTube’s most prominent ad position is now open for interactive, shoppable ads on mobile.</li>
<li><strong>Accelerated checkout for Demand Gen YouTube ads:</strong> Redirect shoppers directly from in-stream ads to their cart or a checkout page on your website.</li>
<li><strong>YouTube creator partnership:</strong> Meet new creator partners, manage those relationships, and quickly integrate existing branded creator content into your ads.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-influencer.webp" alt="Google Marketing Live 2025 - creator partnership screen." width="805" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-91754 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-influencer.webp 805w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-influencer-480x358.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 805px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There was also an announcement about new ads on <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/youtube-shorts-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube Shorts</a>, which is a great addition for advertisers since Google says that 45% of Shorts users are not on TikTok. Put it all together, and it leads us to believe that video will be an even more important player in the upcoming year.</p>
<div id="ai-mode-shopping-experiences"></div>
<div id="ai-mode-shopping-experiences"></div>
<h3>9. AI Mode shopping experiences</h3>
<p>Beyond simply serving ads, Google announced that it’s pairing the power of Gemini with the vast collection of products in Shopping Graph to improve the online shopping experience in several ways.</p>
<p>First up, the presenters showed how <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-ai-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI Mode can <strong>aid in product discovery</strong></a>. Say you have a light gray couch and search for a rug to pull the room together. AI Mode runs a bunch of simulated searches for you to learn which features fit your needs, then shows a panel of images and product listings. If you add new criteria, such as the rug needing to be water-resistant and durable, it’ll dynamically update as you add those characteristics.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-ai-mode.webp" alt="Google Marketing Live 2025 - AI mode shopping." width="828" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-91755 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-ai-mode.webp 828w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-ai-mode-480x348.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 828px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There’s also a <strong>new price tracking feature</strong> in AI Mode. Once you’ve picked the perfect rug, tap “track price” and set a buy price. The AI will notify you of price drops it finds, and when it hits your desired price, you can tap “buy for me,” and it’ll complete the purchase using your Google Wallet.</p>
<p>Finally, AI Mode lets you virtually <strong>try on an outfit</strong>. Remember Cher’s closet app from Clueless? It’s like that. Upload a photo of yourself, and Google’s AI will generate a custom image of you wearing your new fit, even in different poses.</p>

<p>GML tends to go heavy on innovations for physical product marketers. These new agentic shopping experiences will be particularly helpful to them.</p>

<h3>10. Marketing Advisor coming to Chrome browsers</h3>
<p>GML closed out with a live demo of an upcoming AI agent called Marketing Advisor that’ll live right in your Chrome browser. The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-agents">AI agent</a> will help advertisers manage all sorts of marketing tasks.</p>
<p>For example, Marketing Advisor may suggest product promotions based on seasonality. It can review your website and troubleshoot a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/30/google-ads-conversion-tracking"> conversion tracking</a> problem. It could also assist with a big, multi-site tagging job, identifying where tags are needed and even adding them with permission.</p>
<p>Once rolled out, Google Advisor will appear as a Chrome browser side panel and operate like other familiar<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/chatbots"> conversational AI tools</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-summer-voyage.webp" alt="Google Marketing Live 2025 -Marketing Advisor screenshot." width="936" height="566" class="aligncenter wp-image-91757 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-summer-voyage.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-marketing-live-2025-wordstream-summer-voyage-480x290.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>Google Marketing Live 2025 covered a lot of ground</h2>
<p>GML 2025 lasted about 80 minutes. Take out the banter and video montages, and you’re left with less than an hour of actual product presentations. Still, the presenters crammed in a ton of announcements that’ll affect every aspect of managing your Google Ads accounts.</p>
<p>As expected, the focus was squarely on AI and all the ways Google continues to integrate it in different ways to make managing, measuring, and tracking campaigns easier. Of course, time will tell if they actually move the needle for most advertisers.</p>
<p>There’s a LOT more to unpack from this year’s Google Marketing Live. We’ll have advertising experts dig into several of the most impactful announcements and be here to help you understand what they mean for your business.</p>

<div id="popular-marketing-resources"></div>
<h2>What are the five most popular marketing resources in 2025?</h2>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at the top five most popular places people go for marketing information, news, and insights.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4da.png" alt="📚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Looking for a reliable resource to learn how to market your business year-round?</strong> Download our free, complete guide to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/always-on-marketing?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_alwaysonmarketing_Download&amp;itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener">always-on marketing</a>!</p>
<h3>1. Websites, blogs, industry publications, and forums</h3>
<p>The most popular resources for marketing news, education, and more, were online publications, such as online forums, like PPCChat, and industry news sites, like Social Media Examiner.</p>
<p>Respondents also mentioned specific marketing blogs like LocaliQ (which we were thrilled to see!) and HubSpot. Websites, blogs, and publications found online for marketing education are likely so popular because, not only are they free, but they tend to be more reliable and credible. Many authors behind online publications, for example, are PPC or SEO practitioners themselves.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-resources-example.webp" alt="example marketing resource - online publication" width="900" height="457" class="aligncenter wp-image-89555 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-resources-example.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-resources-example-480x244.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>An example</em></a><em> of an online marketing industry publication. </em></p>
<h3>2. Search engines (like Google)</h3>
<p>Search was the second-most popular resource for marketing information, with nearly half of respondents using search calling out Google specifically. When you search for marketing answers on platforms like Google, you get a variety of informative formats right from the search engine results page, like images, videos, and more.</p>
<p>Looking up answers to your marketing needs this way can quickly provide a high-level overview (including help from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-overviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI Overviews</a> themselves) to get a general idea of what you are looking for.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-resources-search.webp" alt="marketing resources - search example" width="813" height="372" class="aligncenter wp-image-89552 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-resources-search.webp 813w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-resources-search-480x220.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 813px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>3. Social media</h3>
<p>Next to online publications, websites, forums, and search, social media was the third most popular spot for marketing resources.</p>
<p>The top platform called out was <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/19/linkedin-company-page-features-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a> with about half of those who use social media for marketing resources naming LinkedIn as their go-to. LinkedIn was followed by X, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ads-benchmarks-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a>, TikTok, and Instagram as other social media hubs for marketing expertise and insights.</p>
<p>These <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media platforms</a> are likely favored by businesses looking to learn more about marketing because they provide consistent and authentic information on marketing trends, news, and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-resources-social-media.webp" alt="marketing resources - social media " width="394" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-89554 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-resources-social-media.webp 394w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-resources-social-media-197x300.webp 197w" sizes="(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/canva_explore-the-visual-economy-report-2024-activity-7257935706319138816-dOLu?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAB-ca78B25iHsjZ3_182VZCylMwB9QWNnaA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<h3>4. Online courses and webinars</h3>
<p>12% of businesses use online courses and webinars as marketing resources when they’re looking to inform their marketing strategy. However, courses were slightly more popular than webinars with 7% of businesses mentioning them as a go-to marketing resource versus webinars at 5%.</p>
<p>That said, both can be equally effective in relaying key marketing information and educational materials. For example, if you don’t have a ton of <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing budget</a> to put towards training and education, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/18/best-webinar-platforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free webinars</a> could be a great solution. On the other hand, an online course subscription could provide your team with ongoing education for the long term.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-resources-online-course.webp" alt="marketing resources - online courses" width="821" height="599" class="aligncenter wp-image-89553 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-resources-online-course.webp 821w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-resources-online-course-480x350.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 821px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>While many online courses come with a cost, there are also free, self-guided classes online that can help businesses in a pinch, like </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/courses" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>the examples</em></a><em> above. </em></p>
<h3>5. Video</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/video-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Video marketing</a> is a core strategy for many businesses looking to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/17/increase-online-presence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build their online presence</a>, but did you know it’s also a key source for marketing tips, insights, and more? 11% of businesses surveyed reported using video as an avenue for finding marketing resources.</p>
<p>Video content is known to be easy to digest. For example, busy business owners can have an educational marketing video running on one screen while they multitask other business management projects on the other screen.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-resources-video.webp" alt="marketing resources - video" width="773" height="553" class="aligncenter wp-image-89550 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-resources-video.webp 773w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-resources-video-480x343.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 773px, 100vw" /></p>

<div id="types-of-marketing-resources"></div>
<h2>What other types of marketing resources are popular?</h2>
<p>Other top sources for marketing education and insights included associations and colleagues (8%), podcasts (4%), books (3%), email (4%), and AI (3%).</p>
<p>It’s interesting to see that many business owners and marketers rely on their networks and frequent industry conferences to stay up to date with marketing trends. It seems the classic route of reading books for marketing resource material is still a tried-and-true method, too.</p>
<p>In contrast, it’s no surprise email remains a go-to source for marketing intel, as there are plenty of marketing newsletters available for subscription from industry brands such as MarketingProfs, Social Media Today, DigiMarCon, and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-resources-newsletter.webp" alt="marketing resources - newesletter" width="605" height="377" class="aligncenter wp-image-89551 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-resources-newsletter.webp 605w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/marketing-resources-newsletter-480x299.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 605px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="importance-for-marketers"></div>
<h2>What this means for marketers looking for resources (and brands looking to reach them!)</h2>
<p>The first step in making informed marketing decisions is knowing where to find marketing insights you can trust. This ranking of popular routes for marketing resources can help you know where to go when you need to quickly brainstorm your campaign strategy, content ideas, and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s been hard to dodge Google in the news this past year. Stories covering the Google antitrust trial have been continuously circulating—and for good reason. A recent development from the ongoing DOJ vs. Google trial decided that Google has been monopolizing the search industry.</p>
<p>To remedy this, the DOJ has put before the judge a list of proposals—including, most notably, the potential sale of Google Chrome.</p>
<p>Chrome is a major vehicle for connecting searchers with businesses online, so any possible change in ownership of the platform could reshape the industry—not to mention your SEO and PPC strategies. While there aren’t any definite plans for this sale to happen just yet (there won’t be any final decision rulings until mid-2025), here is everything you need to know to prepare.</p>

<h2>What’s happening?</h2>
<p>The Department of Justice has proposed that Google sell Chrome in an effort to restructure its market approach. As a <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-is-a-monopoly-fed-rules-37850.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">result of Google’s antitrust trial</a>, the DOJ says Google needs to sell Chrome to break up its monopoly of the search space.</p>
<p>The key proposals from the DOJ include Google <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/11/20/google-monopoly-justice-department-proposal/76465402007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">divesting the Chrome browser</a>, ending its partnership with Apple, and sharing proprietary search data. Lastly, a ban would be put in place to stop Google from implementing new browser and search investments for 5 to 10 years.</p>

<h3>Why did the DOJ propose that Google divest Chrome?</h3>
<p>Currently, Chrome dominates the search space—it owns nearly <a href="https://searchengineland.com/doj-google-chrome-sale-industry-debate-448524?mkt_tok=NzI3LVpRRS0wNDQAAAGW8kpwdOb1JhbPisRO-GgnLkhaWoZgoI_WVMlLxxzizcAwV5uNEZwyoj0aqk4FWpYQybDwbxVU_UJVc-Esv5dWsVktSQpIUO_9-cX4hkpZ7_vINA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">67%</a> of the global browser market share—and Google has been paying billions to Apple to secure Chrome as the default browser to power Safari. This gives Google an unfair market advantage because the majority of searches end up happening on Chrome by default.</p>
<div id="chrome-sale-google-response"></div>
<h3>How has Google responded to the proposed Chrome sale?</h3>
<p>In response, Google <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/doj-search-remedies-nov-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a blog post</a> on November 21, 2024, that claimed the DOJ’s proposals would compromise the quality of the Google Chrome product, endanger user privacy, limit AI advancements, and overall negatively impact leaders of the tech industry.</p>
<p>“Google is positioning itself as a defender of innovation and consumer experience against government intervention,” writes Anu Adegbola, Paid Media News Editor at Search Engine Land, in <a href="https://searchengineland.com/doj-google-chrome-sale-industry-debate-448524?mkt_tok=NzI3LVpRRS0wNDQAAAGW8kpwdOb1JhbPisRO-GgnLkhaWoZgoI_WVMlLxxzizcAwV5uNEZwyoj0aqk4FWpYQybDwbxVU_UJVc-Esv5dWsVktSQpIUO_9-cX4hkpZ7_vINA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this recent recap</a>.</p>

<h3>When would Google divest Chrome?</h3>
<p>While this news signals possible upheaval of the paid and organic search industries (whether for better or for worse is unknown—more on this next), it’s important to remember that these proposals were among many presented to the judge.</p>
<p>The final decision ruling for any of the potential remedies presented by the DOJ won’t be announced until spring or summer of 2025. Plus, there is always potential for appeals processes that could take years to follow.</p>

<h2>What the marketing and advertising community is saying: 5 key takeaways</h2>
<p>If this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2024-google-ads-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google news</a> feels like a lot to digest, you’re not alone. Consider these takeaways from experts in the marketing and advertising community.</p>
<div id="google-chrome-sale-root-problem"></div>
<h3>1. Selling Chrome might not solve the root problem</h3>
<p>The impact of the proposed changes is uncertain. Selling Chrome may not necessarily cause a major decrease in Chrome’s market share or Google’s monopoly.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m not sure to what extent selling Chrome would break up Google&#8217;s monopoly. It would have some impact, for sure, but Google still has a number of free products (Gmail, Search, Maps, YouTube, etc.) all of which keep users in its garden. Users might still end up using Chrome to access Google&#8217;s services even if the browser is owned by someone else,” said Ajdin Perco, Head of Content at <a href="http://animalz.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Animalz</a>.</p>
<div id="google-chrome-sale-credibility"></div>
<h3>2. Whether this would help (or hurt) Chrome’s credibility is unclear</h3>
<p>The general sentiment around the potential Chrome sale from the SEO and PPC communities has been mixed. On one hand, Google’s monopoly of the search market needs to change. On the other, questions have been raised about what other type of organization would be large enough to acquire Chrome for the billion dollars (or more) it would sell for.</p>
<p>“If Chrome were to be purchased it seems that only a company comparable to Google would be able to afford it. If it is purchased, how are we to trust them with our data and security any more than we do with Google?” said Cliff Sizemore, Senior Growth Marketing Manager at LocaliQ.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/navahhopkins_we-need-to-talk-about-the-doj-pushing-for-activity-7264665431758532608-NWHk?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This LinkedIn post</a> from Navah Hopkins, PPC evangelist at Optmyzr, outlines the two sides of the coin. She acknowledges Chrome’s currently massive market share but goes on to say that the wrong owner could end up manipulating approved, ranking content.</p>
<p>“If the browser suddenly played favorites with processing power or UI choices, there is a real risk content that isn&#8217;t flattering to the owner will be pushed down, while content that may or may not be accurate is given preferential treatment because it&#8217;s positive&#8230; If bad actors manipulate Chrome in such a way that only approved content renders fast enough to be consumed (if at all), there&#8217;s a real risk there,” said Navah.</p>
<p>The other alternative of the government one day stepping in to claim Chrome as a public utility, isn’t ideal, either.</p>
<p>“Aside from the existing tech giants, there really isn&#8217;t anyone large enough to come up with the multi-billion dollars (if not more) needed to acquire Chrome. Should the government step in and seize it as a public utility, that puts us in a China-adjacent environment,” said Navah.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/google-chrome-sale-navah-tweet.webp" alt="google chrome sale - navah linkedin post" width="592" height="291" class="aligncenter wp-image-87848 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/google-chrome-sale-navah-tweet.webp 592w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/google-chrome-sale-navah-tweet-480x236.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 592px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="google-chrome-sale-ad-targeting"></div>
<h3>3. The outlook for Google’s ad targeting capabilities could be negative</h3>
<p>Chrome is a major user data source for Google. Selling Chrome could cause the platform to have less effective ad targeting options.</p>
<p>“Of the numerous potential ripple effects of a Chrome sell-off, small businesses need to be wary of how the separation of key user intent data from Google&#8217;s ad products will ultimately impact advertising effectiveness,” said Jake Cox, Product Manager, Media Products, at LocaliQ.</p>
<p>“When leveraging <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-smart-bidding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google&#8217;s Smart Bidding</a> automated strategies, you’re tapping into a massive volume of user intent signals to identify when to deliver the most impactful ad at the most opportune time to drive some form of action. If those intent signals are severed, or at the very least, diminished, how will Google backfill those key insights to still drive comparable campaign performance?” said Jake.</p>
<p>In addition to Google Ads and its machine learning, this change might impact other related Google platforms as well, such as GA4.</p>
<p>“If Google doesn&#8217;t have sufficient user data that they have historically leveraged through Chrome, then how are we to trust reporting via GA4 or decisions made through something like Smart Bidding? On the surface it may seem simple but there are far-reaching negative effects and that&#8217;s my concern,” said Cliff.</p>
<div id="google-chrome-sale-competition"></div>
<h3>4. Increased search market competition could benefit users and advertisers</h3>
<p>Some marketers and advertisers see the potential change as a net positive.</p>
<p>“I think introducing more competition in the search market is much needed. It would benefit end users by forcing companies to innovate faster and deliver more value. We&#8217;re seeing how companies innovate rapidly in the AI space where there&#8217;s still no clear winner. I hope a similar level and pace of innovation happens in search as well,” said Ajdin.</p>
<p>“Google has been relying on user data to improve their algorithm for a long time to reinforce their position in the market. The proposed break-up would take away this advantage and be a huge win for both their competitors as well as privacy advocates,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/geoff-meakin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoff Meakin</a>, <a href="https://healthcare-seo.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthcare SEO consultant</a>.</p>
<div id="google-chrome-sale-impact"></div>
<h3>5. The sale of Chrome would be noticeable to both users and advertisers</h3>
<p>There’s no question when it comes to the gravity of the DOJ’s proposals.</p>
<p>“It’s a bold move. Google’s dominance, especially through Chrome, has become such a huge part of how we experience the internet that splitting it off sounds almost unthinkable. But I get where the DOJ is coming from. Chrome isn’t just a browser; it’s the front door to Google’s entire empire—ads, search, and a ton of user data. Breaking that link could shake things up and open the door for more competition, which isn’t a bad thing,” said Goran Mirkovic, Chief Marketing Officer at <a href="http://Freemius.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freemius</a>.</p>
<p>“That said, I think this kind of move needs to be handled with care. If it’s not done right, it could create headaches for users—think compatibility issues or slower innovation. It’s like trying to fix one problem but potentially creating others along the way. So while the idea of breaking up the monopoly is intriguing, the devil’s in the details,” said Goran.</p>
<div id="google-chrome-sale-tips"></div>
<h2>What this could mean for businesses—and how to prepare</h2>
<p>While we don’t know exactly what will happen yet, you don’t just have to wait and wonder. Here is how to prepare for the continuation of the Google antitrust trial as these potential changes develop.</p>
<div id="google-chrome-sale-cross-channel"></div>
<h3>1. Implement a cross-channel marketing strategy</h3>
<p>While search marketing will continue to be a key lever for businesses looking to grow, it’s important to incorporate other <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/26/marketing-channels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing channels</a> into your strategy for a full-funnel, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/always-on-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">always-on</a> approach.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, I think the downstream impact of this could result in more parity across the paid search landscape. Whether we see traditional search engines like <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/replicate-google-ads-on-bing/">Microsoft&#8217;s Bing</a> steal market share or if other next-gen challengers (TikTok, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/chatgpt-search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SearchGPT</a>) take a dramatic leap forward, it will be very interesting to monitor over the next couple of years,” said Jake.</p>
<p>“For advertisers, it will be important to take a more platform-diverse approach in the near future to ensure that they are actively testing multiple channels and optimizing toward what&#8217;s driving the value,” said Jake.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/marketing-channel-mix-wordstream-1024x791.webp" alt="marketing channel mix" width="1024" height="791" class="aligncenter wp-image-85428 size-large" /></p>
<div id="google-chrome-sale-online-presence"></div>
<h3>2. Build out your online presence</h3>
<p>As Chrome evolves, you’ll want to prepare for all other ways users might find your business. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/17/increase-online-presence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Increasing your overall online presence</a> will help you show up in searches—no matter what tool people use to find you. For example, having a high-quality website could make it easier for AI tools to pull in information about your business.</p>
<p>“If Google loses the insights it currently gets from Chrome, then that can only weaken its position in the market and lead to a faster uptake of alternative search products. Proactive small businesses are already considering how best to optimize for AI search and the large language models (LLMs) that are poised to take market share from Google,” said Geoff.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Uncover all the best ways you can market your business on Google and beyond</strong> with our free guide to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/online-marketing-tips?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_130marketingtips_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">130+ of the best online marketing tips</a>!</p>
<div id="google-chrome-sale-strategy"></div>
<h3>3. Consider other tools to supplement your strategy</h3>
<p>It’s more important than ever for businesses to rely on resources they have on hand, like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/12/first-party-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first-party data</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI PPC tools</a>, to get ahead of ad campaign targeting and optimization.</p>
<p>“On the bright side, more competition might mean more advertising options, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2024-google-ads-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potentially better pricing</a>, and less reliance on Google for everything. That could be a big win, especially for small businesses with tight budgets. Having a more level playing field sounds great,” said Goran.</p>
<p>“But here’s the catch: a breakup could also make life more complicated, at least in the short term. A lot of small businesses rely on Google’s ecosystem because it’s so seamless—ads, analytics, search, everything works together. If that ecosystem gets fragmented, businesses might need to juggle new tools and platforms, which could cost more time and money,” said Goran.</p>
<p>This means relying on your own data and campaign optimization tools can save you from headaches during any major transition.</p>
<p>“So, while the long-term impact might be positive, there’s likely to be some turbulence along the way. It really depends on how this all plays out and whether the new landscape makes things easier or harder for smaller businesses,” Goran.</p>
<h2>Will Google divest Chrome? Stay tuned</h2>
<p>It’s important to remember that nothing is set in stone yet. Your best bet right now is to stay in the loop on the latest news as it evolves as much as you can.</p>
<p>Plus, these developments can be a lesson in themselves to stay ahead of any potential upsets on one platform by implementing a holistic marketing strategy that covers all your bases across all platforms.</p>
<p>While managing your search strategy on top of tons of other channels can seem like a challenge, you don’t have to do it all alone.

<h2>What is SearchGPT?</h2>
<p>SearchGPT is an AI-powered search engine that turns answers to ChatGPT user queries into conversational responses based on real-time information from across the web—similar to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-overviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s AI Overviews</a>. Currently, only ChatGPT Plus and Team users can opt to try ChatGPT search, but there is a Chrome extension also available, and it will eventually roll out to all users.</p>

<h2>What’s the big deal? Pros and cons of SearchGPT</h2>
<p>Should you try using SearchGPT (when you get the chance)? Here are some of its pros and cons.</p>
<h3>Pros of SearchGPT</h3>
<p>SearchGPT can offer direct, concise, and relevant answers to questions rather than just providing a list of links like the traditional search experience. However, it also displays a sidebar with links to the original sources used to generate responses for fact-checking, and users can ask additional follow-up questions for a more interactive search experience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/chatgpt-search-searchgpt-sources-example.webp" alt="chatgpt search - example of sources from searchgpt" width="859" height="501" class="aligncenter wp-image-87134 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/chatgpt-search-searchgpt-sources-example.webp 859w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/chatgpt-search-searchgpt-sources-example-480x280.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 859px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>Cons of SearchGPT</h3>
<p>We know that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/28/ai-for-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI isn’t perfect</a>, and SearchGPT is no different. For example, the quality of SearchGPT responses is still going to depend on the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-prompts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI prompt</a> that the user inputs. So far, SearchGPT answers tend to be lengthy, so this solution may not make the cut for a quick, one-sentence answer to a question. Plus, like with any AI-powered output, you still need to fact-check the answers and sources provided to be absolutely sure you’re getting the right information.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f50d.png" alt="🔍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Want ideas for new conversational queries your customers may be searching for?</strong> Try our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free Keyword Tool</a>!</p>
<div id="chatgpt-search-comparison"></div>
<h2>How does SearchGPT compare to other search engines?</h2>
<p>If you’re wondering how SearchGPT differs from the typical search experience, here is how it compares to top search platforms such as Google and Microsoft.</p>
<div id="chatgpt-search-versus-google"></div>
<h3>SearchGPT versus Google</h3>
<p>So far, the <a href="https://searchengineland.com/searchgpt-what-you-need-to-know-446455" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search marketing and advertising community</a> has predicted that SearchGPT will <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-overviews-breaking-search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outperform AI Overviews (AIO) on Google</a>. To start, SearchGPT is naturally much more conversational than AIO. It’s also more transparent in the sources it cites with the full sidebar display rather than the link icons <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-mode">Google uses in AIO</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/chatgpt-search-searchgpt-versus-google.webp" alt="chatgpt search - searchgpt versus google ai overviews example" width="818" height="375" class="aligncenter wp-image-87135 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/chatgpt-search-searchgpt-versus-google.webp 818w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/chatgpt-search-searchgpt-versus-google-480x220.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 818px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>When it comes to the traditional search experience, it&#8217;s too early to tell how SearchGPT can compare, especially when searching for local businesses or running ads. For now, we know that ChatGPT search currently has a somewhat <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/chatgpt-search-vs-google-and-bing/531573/?user_id=%20&amp;utm_campaign=daily_newsletter_11_05_2024&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--YCY_CakIqri7PIxeIVA-T9Rl3mQjLEzvXRTvFggUb4PbHnCqXiO2CYfSz7-w8zcURg2nDLTYKeg_FNqpe2XJPQgl5AOCtMyiucgcYCx7DNPB3WLk&amp;_hsmi=332439008&amp;utm_source=sejtoday#placement_loop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited local search experience</a>, and it will actually direct you to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-maps-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Maps</a> if you explicitly ask it for a result on a map.</p>
<div id="chatgpt-search-versus-bing"></div>
<h3>SearchGPT versus Bing</h3>
<p>Bing also has a conversational <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-agents">AI solution</a>, <a href="https://adoption.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Copilot</a>, which integrates with Bing search. One of the main differences is that Copilot does include some shopping features and capabilities, so unlike SearchGPT, users could make purchases directly from Bing’s AI search solution.</p>

<div id="how-to-prepare-for-chatgpt-search"></div>
<h2>How to prepare for SearchGPT</h2>
<p>As more options for browsing the web, like SearchGPT, arise, be open to opportunities for your business to reach customers beyond traditional Google or Microsoft Bing searches. You may want to consider what types of key topics and questions your target market has, rather than solely focusing on transactional keywords.</p>
<p>As for ChatGPT search and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/ppc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PPC</a>, it&#8217;s too soon to know how it will treat ads or how SearchGPT will determine which content to display. <span data-teams="true"><span class="ui-provider a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z ab ac ae af ag ah ai aj ak" dir="ltr">OpenAI<a aria-label="Link has suggested" id="menurgu2" href="https://trueinteractive.com/blog/how-searchgpt-could-change-search-advertising/#:~:text=Though%20SearchGPT%20has%20not%20yet,traditional%20banners%20and%20sponsored%20links." rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="fui-Link ___1q1shib f2hkw1w f3rmtva f1ewtqcl fyind8e f1k6fduh f1w7gpdv fk6fouc fjoy568 figsok6 f1s184ao f1mk8lai fnbmjn9 f1o700av f13mvf36 f1cmlufx f9n3di6 f1ids18y f1tx3yz7 f1deo86v f1eh06m1 f1iescvh fhgqx19 f1olyrje f1p93eir f1nev41a f1h8hb77 f1lqvz6u f10aw75t fsle3fq f17ae5zn" title="https://trueinteractive.com/blog/how-searchgpt-could-change-search-advertising/#:~:text=though%20searchgpt%20has%20not%20yet,traditional%20banners%20and%20sponsored%20links."> has suggested</a> that ads could become a part of the platform in the future, but instead of traditional text ads,<a aria-label="Link some sources expect" id="menurgu4" href="https://growthiqdigital.com/blog/searchgpt-ads-what-you-need-to-know/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="fui-Link ___1q1shib f2hkw1w f3rmtva f1ewtqcl fyind8e f1k6fduh f1w7gpdv fk6fouc fjoy568 figsok6 f1s184ao f1mk8lai fnbmjn9 f1o700av f13mvf36 f1cmlufx f9n3di6 f1ids18y f1tx3yz7 f1deo86v f1eh06m1 f1iescvh fhgqx19 f1olyrje f1p93eir f1nev41a f1h8hb77 f1lqvz6u f10aw75t fsle3fq f17ae5zn" title="https://growthiqdigital.com/blog/searchgpt-ads-what-you-need-to-know/"> some sources expect</a> there to be multimedia and conversational ads tailored to the user&#8217;s search journey. </span></span></p>
<p>However, prioritizing user-friendly, helpful content and following best practices will likely set you up for success in the long term. SearchGPT seems to favor relevant, up-to-date, authoritative content that includes a variety of media beyond just text, like images and videos.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, no matter the platform, your website’s high-quality, engaging, and media-rich content will be at the top of your potential customer’s results.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-05/google-loses-doj-antitrust-suit-over-search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the judge in the Google antitrust trial ruled</a> that the company has illegally monopolized web search. Legal and tech experts are calling it a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/05/google-antitrust-lawsuit-00172678">historic win</a> for the Department of Justice and a sign of even bigger upheavals to come for <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/08/05/google-loses-antitrust-case/74680072007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/technology/google-microsoft-antitrust-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big tech</a>.</p>
<p>But what does the ruling portend for those of us at ground level—the marketers and small business owners who rely on Google to connect us with the customers who support our businesses?</p>
<p>Today, we’ll explain how we got to this point, what comes next, and share what a few experts believe will be the most likely effects this case will have on small businesses and search advertisers.</p>

<h2>A brief background of the Google antitrust case</h2>
<p>In 2020, the US Justice Department, along with several US states, filed an antitrust case against Google, alleging that it illegally monopolized online search and advertising.</p>
<p>At the heart of the suit are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/27/23934961/google-antitrust-trial-defaults-search-deal-26-3-billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreements Google entered</a> with companies like Apple and Samsung to make its search engine the default on various mobile devices and internet browsers. Those agreements, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-monopolist-google-violating-antitrust-laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said the DOJ in its complaint</a>, helped Google become “a monopoly gatekeeper for the internet, and one of the wealthiest companies on the planet.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/google-antitrust-case-icon.webp" alt="Google antitrust ruling - Google icon on an iphone." width="788" height="590" class="aligncenter wp-image-85039 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/google-antitrust-case-icon.webp 788w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/google-antitrust-case-icon-480x359.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 788px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The 10-week trial kicked off in September of 2023 and included testimonies from Google, Microsoft, and Apple, among many others. US District Judge Amit Mehta delivered his ruling on August 5.</p>
<div id="the-ruling-and-its-potential-impacts"></div>
<h2>The ruling and its potential impacts</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-describes-how-google-built-defended-illegal-search-monopoly-2024-08-05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Judge Mehta ruled</a> that Google’s default agreements created a monopoly on online search and advertising—which have, in turn, blocked competition and throttled innovation. “The distribution agreements have caused a third key anticompetitive effect: They have reduced the incentive to invest and innovate in search,” he said in his ruling.</p>
<p>In 2022, for example, Google paid Apple <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/google-s-payments-to-apple-reached-20-billion-in-2022-cue-says?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$20 billion</a> to maintain its spot as the default search engine for iOS devices. “Sure, users can access Google&#8217;s rivals by switching the default search access point or by downloading a rival search app or browser. But the market reality is that users rarely do so,” <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-describes-how-google-built-defended-illegal-search-monopoly-2024-08-05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Judge Mehta</a> concluded.</p>
<p>The ruling in this trial is step one. Next up is a September 6 hearing to decide what changes and penalties to impose. Those penalties could include <a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/whats-next-for-google-after-federal-judges-monopolization-ruling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restricting Google’s agreements</a> with Apple and other device or browser makers to allow other search engines to compete for those prime placements. Or Judge Mehta could decide to break Google up in some way, siloing pieces of the business into smaller entities.</p>
<p>Google has the opportunity to appeal the decision, which <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/google-says-it-will-appeal-antitrust-ruling-what-that-could-mean-for-big-tech-8690883" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it says</a> it plans to do. A potentially lengthy appeals process means it could be a while before we know the final outcome. “At this time, the full impacts on search are unknown, and it could take a few years to fully see changes. But experts are predicting the ruling ‘could change how we use the internet and search for information,’” <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/08/05/google-loses-antitrust-case/74680072007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USA Today reported</a>.</p>
<div id="what-does-this-mean-for-small-businesses"></div>
<h2>What does this mean for small businesses?</h2>
<p>It could be years before we know the full impact of the ruling. But early reactions from industry experts suggest that it’s positive news for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-marketing-planning">small businesses</a> and search engine users.</p>
<h3>Users and advertisers will have more search engine options</h3>
<p>One of the more likely outcomes is that smartphones and web browsers will need to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2023/10/15/google-antitrust-trial-impact-search/71195279007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offer a range of search engines</a> to users—especially when those systems are first initiated. That could lead to more overall investment in improving search and make way for new upstarts to join the search engine market.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Google-antitrust-ruling-choice-screen.webp" alt="Google antitrust ruling - Search engine choice screen as seen on European phones." width="292" height="552" class="aligncenter wp-image-85040 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Google-antitrust-ruling-choice-screen.webp 292w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Google-antitrust-ruling-choice-screen-159x300.webp 159w" sizes="(max-width: 292px) 100vw, 292px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>US Android users could see a search engine choice screen on device startup, similar to <a href="https://www.android.com/choicescreen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the screen shown</a> to European Android users.</em></p>
<p>“I do think it will open the door for more search platforms to have a fighting chance in more places, like on Apple devices, for example,” said Tony Testaverde, VP of Marketing Growth and Analytics at LocaliQ. “And it may open the door for more companies to invest in their own search engine.” Apple, for example, has toyed with the idea of building a search product to compete with Google, much the way it did with Apple Maps.</p>
<p>That last part is key since Judge Mehta specifically called out the reduced “incentive to invest and innovate in search.” And while even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24214574/google-antitrust-search-apple-microsoft-bing-ruling-breakdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple believes Google is the best search engine</a> currently, the carrot of greater access may prove to be the push Microsoft and others need to spend on innovation.</p>
<p>Brett McHale, a paid media marketing expert and the founder of Empiric Marketing, said the market is ready for more competitors and a more competitive search engine from Google. “Many people both within and outside of the industry have seen a deterioration in the quality of the search engine over the past few years,” he said. “Google has rolled out so many SEO updates that it has become nearly impossible for smaller domains to rank effectively while simultaneously trying not to get penalized for once-accepted practices.”</p>
<p>The ruling cracked an opening in the search engine market, creating an opportunity for new players to compete against Google’s core product, said Katia Hausman, Vice President of Product Management at LocaliQ. “The full impact of the court&#8217;s decision on the search industry remains to be seen. However, it&#8217;s likely to stimulate innovation beyond vertical search, where Google is already facing competition from Amazon and AI services. We could witness the emergence of new general search engines, leading to a more competitive market.”</p>
<p>McHale also believes that loosening the competitive constraints could help AI-powered search flourish. “Companies like OpenAI and Meta have made great strides in that domain [AI-powered search] while Google has attempted to play catch-up with underwhelming results. We may see more competitors as a result, perhaps on the search engine side but I would anticipate more hybrid AI/search-related products to enter the space.”</p>
<h3>Lower advertising costs</h3>
<p>During testimony, a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/19/23880275/google-search-ads-competition-auction-prices-doj-trial-antitrust" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google ad executive admitted</a> that Google manipulated its ad auction process in a way that potentially increased prices by 5% for the typical advertiser and as much as 10% for some queries. While the search engine giant’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2024-google-ads-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average cost per click has increased</a>, other advertising platforms like Facebook have seen <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ads-benchmarks-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ad costs go down or stay flat</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Google-antitrust-ruling-ad-costs.webp" alt="Google antitrust ruling - screenshot of search ads costs from the WordStream Google ads benchmark report." width="855" height="508" class="aligncenter wp-image-85041 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Google-antitrust-ruling-ad-costs.webp 855w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Google-antitrust-ruling-ad-costs-480x285.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 855px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Google ads costs continue to increase, as noted in our 2024 <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2024-google-ads-benchmarks">Google Ads Benchmarks Report</a>.</em></p>
<p>McHale said one of the best outcomes for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/small-business-saturday-marketing">small businesses</a> could be lower ad prices—or at least an end to the trend of ever-increasing costs.“We could see a drop in ad prices, or something similar to what happened to Google Shopping in 2017 in the EU—due to a similar ruling—where third-party comparison shopping services were given a 20% discount on CPCs. In time, the landscape may improve considerably for small businesses with more opportunities and lower costs to advertise.”</p>
<p>Cliff Sizemore, a senior marketing manager at LocaliQ, agreed while noting that this is just one piece of a bigger picture. “I hope it will lower advertising costs and provide opportunities on different platforms, which would be a plus for small businesses,” he said. “There&#8217;s another trial on September 9 that covers Google&#8217;s ad tech, so we will be interested to see what comes of that.”</p>
<p>There could be increased pressure on each search engine to make its offering more attractive to advertisers. “End of the day, advertisers will always go back to where they are getting the highest ROI,” Testaverde said. “Open ad cost competition will give more companies a chance to get their foot in the door. But the platforms and products need to prove profitable to businesses, or the dollars will eventually flow back to Google.”</p>
<h3>Diversifying ad spend becomes more important than ever</h3>
<p>With more search engine options for users comes more viable advertising platforms for small businesses. If more people use Google alternatives to find brands and products, small businesses will need to invest some of their marketing dollars in them to capture those leads.</p>
<p>“Diversifying ad spend across multiple platforms is a wise strategy for small businesses, even without Google&#8217;s monopoly case,” Hausman said. “This approach can yield better results by mitigating risks, lowering costs, and expanding reach. The potential changes in the search landscape due to the antitrust case make this strategy even more critical.”</p>
<p>Look for cross-platform advertising solutions and technology to become more important in the coming months and years as small businesses search for ways to maximize their returns from new advertising networks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google’s been yanking our chain about deprecating cookies for the last four years. They even started their phaseout in January of this year only to reverse their long-held stance and say JK—cookies aren’t going anywhere.</p>
<p>Google <a href="https://privacysandbox.com/intl/en_us/news/privacy-sandbox-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently announced</a> that it will be proposing an “updated approach” to the user experience on Google Chrome instead of deprecating third-party cookies. What exactly is changing and what does that all mean? Today, we’re covering just that!</p>

<h2>What’s happening?</h2>
<p>On July 22, Google <a href="https://privacysandbox.com/intl/en_us/news/privacy-sandbox-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a new path for its <a href="https://privacysandbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Sandbox</a> initiative on the web. This Privacy Sandbox project is the reason Google was originally going to phase out third-party cookies (in favor of first party data) in the second half of 2024.</p>
<p>Moving forward, however, <strong>Google will be keeping third-party cookies</strong>. Instead, the platform will offer “opt in/opt out” options to Google Chrome users so they’re able to make choices and adjustments to their web browsing tracking preferences.</p>
<p>Here’s the main statement from Google:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Instead of deprecating third-party cookies, we would introduce a new experience in Chrome that lets people make an informed choice that applies across their web browsing, and they’d be able to adjust that choice at any time. We&#8217;re discussing this new path with regulators and will engage with the industry as we roll this out.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s break out some of the key terms from this announcement:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Third-party data: </strong>Aggregated customer information collected from third-party sources (cookies) across the web that your business can use but does not own.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/12/first-party-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>First-party data</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Internal information your business collects, owns, and holds.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy Sandbox: </strong>Google initiative that develops and releases privacy-focused APIs, advertiser and publisher tools, cookie updates, and more.</li>
</ul>

<div id="why-was-google-phasing-out-cookies"></div>
<h2>Why was Google phasing out cookies?</h2>
<p>Google was <a href="https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/3pcd/prepare/prepare-for-phaseout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phasing out third-party cookies</a> to move towards a more privacy-first web landscape that addressed concerns from users regarding how they’re being tracked online.</p>
<p>“We continue to invest in features that protect your data and provide more control over how it’s used. This includes taking steps to limit the ability to track your activity across different websites,” <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/privacy-sandbox-tracking-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google said</a> regarding the initial decision to phase out third-party cookies.</p>
<p>The platform had planned to fully retire all third-party cookies by the end of this year, and this process had already started in January 2024—which, so far, only impacted about 1% of Chrome users.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-third-party-cookie-phase-out.webp" alt="google third-party cookie phase out timeline" width="936" height="381" class="aligncenter wp-image-81599 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-third-party-cookie-phase-out.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-third-party-cookie-phase-out-480x195.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="what-is-google-doing-instead-of-phasing-out-cookies"></div>
<h2>What is Google doing instead of phasing out third-party cookies?</h2>
<p>Google hasn’t yet released many details about the plan that will replace the third-party cookie phaseout. However, we do know that, <strong>while businesses still have the ability to track customer data via third-party cookies, Chrome users are going to have the option to “opt out” of this tracking</strong>.</p>
<p>The Privacy Sandbox initiative will remain a priority for Google, and the plan is to continue to develop more privacy-first ways to accurately track and target audiences in Google Ads, GA4, and beyond.</p>
<p>“As this moves forward, it remains important for developers to have privacy-preserving alternatives. We&#8217;ll continue to make the Privacy Sandbox APIs available and invest in them to further improve privacy and utility. We also intend to offer additional privacy controls, so we plan to introduce <a href="https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/protections/ip-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IP Protection</a> into Chrome&#8217;s Incognito mode,” wrote Anthony Chavez, Vice President of Privacy Sandbox at Google, in the announcement article.</p>
<div id="what-this-means"></div>
<h2>What does this mean for your business</h2>
<p>If you’ve shifted your strategy to primarily leverage first-party data, you’re still smart to do so. There are tons of effective, newer <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/preparing-for-ppc-success-in-cookieless-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PPC strategies that rely on first-party data</a>, like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/17/how-to-set-up-google-ads-enhanced-conversions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhanced conversion bidding</a> or customer match audiences.</p>

<p>Plus, beyond Google, other platforms will also continue to push privacy-focused, first-party data driven strategies. For example, Facebook ads Advantage+ audiences can optimize your targeting based on the audience suggestions you provide.</p>

<h2>What industry experts are saying about this change</h2>
<p>For the most part, this change is welcome, as Google even called out in its original announcement article that the deprecation of third-party cookies was putting stress on many advertisers.</p>
<p>“We expect that overall performance using Privacy Sandbox APIs will <a href="https://privacysandbox.com/news/learnings-from-privacy-sandbox-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improve</a> over time as industry adoption increases. At the same time, we recognize this transition requires significant work by many participants and will have an impact on publishers, advertisers, and everyone involved in online advertising,” said Anthony.</p>
<p>And some advertisers agree—anything could be better than the sunset of third-party cookies. For example, <a href="https://x.com/SeoTudent/status/1815492760956493918" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this X post</a> below acknowledges that third-party cookie deprecation would have put a ton of businesses out of business.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-ads-no-longer-deprecating-third-party-cookies-x.webp" alt="google ads privacy sandbox update - third-party cookie deprecation reaction" width="597" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-84580 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-ads-no-longer-deprecating-third-party-cookies-x.webp 597w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-ads-no-longer-deprecating-third-party-cookies-x-480x482.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 597px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But if you feel like you’ve dedicated a lot of work to prepare for a cookie-less future, you’re not alone. Other advertisers, as shown in <a href="https://x.com/robinberjon/status/1815473283271205203" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the following X post</a>, aren’t happy that the time spent preparing (and worrying) about the demise of third-party cookies is now, in some ways, wasted.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-third-party-cookie-plan-x-post.webp" alt="google privacy sandbox change - x post screenshot" width="409" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-84576 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-third-party-cookie-plan-x-post.webp 409w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-third-party-cookie-plan-x-post-205x300.webp 205w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px" /></p>
<p>Plus, the lack of clarity around the new path for Google Chrome isn’t giving advertisers much faith, either.</p>
<p>&#8220;That, based on historical evidence, could end up being a big win for advertisers, as most users simply won’t make any changes to their settings. But then again, if Google starts prompting users with pop-ups, like Apple does with ATT, that could also end up being significantly worse too, and see much less user data flowing through,” writes Andrew Hutchinson, Content and Social Media Manager at Social Media Today, in <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/google-abandons-plan-phase-tracking-cookies/722069/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article</a>.</p>
<p>Ari Paparo, CEO at Marketecture, added his guess on what the Chrome update will look like in the following <a href="https://x.com/aripap/status/1815462762191196614" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X post</a>, where he says:</p>
<p>“My guess is they’re going to slowly move from opt out of third-party cookies, to recommending blocking to users, then eventually to opt in only.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-privacy-sandbox-change-x-post.webp" alt="google privacy sandbox change - chrome update prediction" width="629" height="256" class="aligncenter wp-image-84577 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-privacy-sandbox-change-x-post.webp 629w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-privacy-sandbox-change-x-post-480x195.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 629px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>These sentiments reiterate the fact that your first-party data will continue to be important as less potential customers may opt into third-party tracking in the future.</p>
<p>The update also raises questions around <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/23/google-analytics-4-vs-universal-analytics">Google Analytics 4</a> (GA4), since it was known that one of the main reasons GA4 replaced Universal Analytics was to allow for more first-party tracking capabilities.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-privacy-sandbox-update-ga4.webp" alt="google privacy sandbox update - ga4 mention" width="587" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-84579 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-privacy-sandbox-update-ga4.webp 587w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-privacy-sandbox-update-ga4-480x491.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 587px, 100vw" /></p>

<p>The bottom line? <strong>Advertisers are feeling like this is yet another curveball from Google, and the platform will have to step up its Privacy Sandbox game</strong> to make more first-party data PPC strategies truly worthwhile.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-privacy-sandbox-update-bottom-line.webp" alt="google privacy sandbox announcement - bottom line post screenshot" width="538" height="565" class="aligncenter wp-image-84581 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-privacy-sandbox-update-bottom-line.webp 538w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-privacy-sandbox-update-bottom-line-480x504.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 538px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://x.com/LexGabrees/status/1815750055493562531" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<h2>The Google Privacy Sandbox plot thickens</h2>
<p>Advertisers will have to wait for more information from Google as it begins to roll out Chrome tracking controls to users.</p>
<p>Cookie-less or not, all forms of data can be valuable to your business, so it&#8217;s best to continue your mix of first-party and third-party strategies. Staying informed as Google releases more updates is your best bet right now!</p>

<div id="google-algorithm-api-document-leak-overview"></div>
<h2>The Google algorithm document leak: an overview</h2>
<p>But first, a little backstory on what happened.</p>
<p>Documentation from Google Search’s Content Warehouse API was published by an <a href="https://github.com/yoshi-code-bot/elixir-google-api/commit/d7a637f4391b2174a2cf43ee11e6577a204a161e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automated bot on Github</a>. This documentation included over 2,500 pages of more than 14,000 attributes that Google measures, or can measure, as part of its algorithm.</p>
<p>Rand Fishkin, co-founder and CEO of SparkToro, was approached by a then-anonymous source (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEb8_rbfFVw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he has since come forward</a>) about the content and authenticity of these documents. He shared findings from that conversation as well as his analysis <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/an-anonymous-source-shared-thousands-of-leaked-google-search-api-documents-with-me-everyone-in-seo-should-see-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>After countless publications covered the documentation leak with nary a word from Google, Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167407/google-search-algorithm-documents-leak-confirmation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">verified</a> the documents are real on May 29.</p>
<p>This leak provides never-before-seen access to the inner-workings of Google’s algorithm—the main takeaway being that Google hasn’t been entirely truthful about what’s in the algorithm over the last few years. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span></p>
<p>One important thing to note: While the leak included documentation about metrics that Google either <em>is</em> collecting or <em>has</em> collected in the past, it did not reveal the weight of those metrics or whether or not they’re currently being used as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/09/google-ranking-factors">ranking factors</a>. So while we know that Google has the ability to measure metrics like domain authority and clicks (which we’ll get into later), we don’t know exactly how important those metrics are to rankings from this source alone. And, of course, Google makes changes to its algorithms all the time.</p>
<p>While we’re not going to stake our whole strategy on the findings, it does provide some very interesting insights into how Google works.</p>
<div id="what-google-measures-for-seo"></div>
<h2>7 things Google can measure that might affect your SEO</h2>
<p>There were some surprising metrics Google is measuring, according to the leaked documents. We’re sharing seven that stood out to us and what that means for your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-tactics">SEO strategy</a>.</p>
<div id="domain-authority"></div>
<h3>1. Domain authority</h3>
<p>Previously, Google representatives have said that Google does not measure or consider <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-domain-authority/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">domain authority</a> at all. They claimed that they don’t take the overall quality or authoritativeness of your site into account when ranking individual pages. However, the leaked documentation painted another picture.</p>
<p>“In reality, as part of the Compressed Quality Signals that are stored on a per document basis, Google has a feature they compute called ‘siteAuthority,’” <a href="https://ipullrank.com/google-algo-leak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a> Mike King of iPullRank.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-ranking-factors-api-documents-site-authority-screenshot.webp" alt="google algorithm api documents - screenshot of site authority ranking" width="795" height="217" class="aligncenter wp-image-83378 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-ranking-factors-api-documents-site-authority-screenshot.webp 795w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-ranking-factors-api-documents-site-authority-screenshot-480x131.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 795px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>What this means: </strong>Your domain authority <em>is</em> being measured by Google. Again, we don’t know exactly if or how important it is to ranking, but Google is looking at it in some way. This means you need to have a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/14/website-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-built website</a> with high-quality, authoritative content, plus credible links to your site that prove your content is valuable. Find more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/12/domain-authority" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ways to increase domain authority</a> here.</p>
<div id="clicks"></div>
<h3>2. Clicks and engagement</h3>
<p>Not only does how many clicks you’re getting matter, but also the <em>quality</em> of clicks you’re getting from your organic rankings. Google has <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-ctr-ranking-clickbait-32368.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously said</a> (over and over, in fact) that clicks weren’t a ranking factor, although many SEO experts have long debated whether or not that was true. Recently, <a href="https://searchengineland.com/former-googler-google-using-clicks-in-rankings-432401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information</a> came out during the Google antitrust trial revealing that Google’s Navboost system, based on click quantity and quality, is “one of the important signals” in ranking sites.</p>
<p>So this inclusion isn’t necessarily surprising at this point. But it is interesting to see that Google measures clicks in a variety of ways, including badClicks, goodClicks, lastLongestClicks, and unsquashedClicks, according to the documents.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-algorithm-document-leak.webp" alt="google api documents - screenshot of navboost in google algorithm documents" width="701" height="593" class="aligncenter wp-image-83379 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-algorithm-document-leak.webp 701w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-algorithm-document-leak-480x406.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 701px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/an-anonymous-source-shared-thousands-of-leaked-google-search-api-documents-with-me-everyone-in-seo-should-see-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p><strong>What this means: </strong>Focus on driving more successful clicks by broadening the amount of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/26/intent-marketing">high-intent queries</a> you target, and make sure the content on those pages is truly helpful to users. Useful content and strong UX are the best ways to send healthy engagement signals to Google.</p>
<p>“A focus on driving more qualified traffic to a better user experience will send signals to Google that your page deserves to rank,” writes Mike.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f50d.png" alt="🔍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Find high-intent keywords your content strategy can target with our<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Free Keyword Tool</a>.</p>
<div id="content-freshness"></div>
<h3>3. Content freshness</h3>
<p>Content recency and freshness is another metric Google is measuring as part of its algorithm. There are many references to content publication and update dates within the Google API documents. In fact, Google reviews dates in the byline (bylineDate), URL (syntacticDate), and on-page content (semanticDate).</p>
<p><strong>What this means: </strong>The more recent and relevant your content, the better. To keep your content fresh, it’s necessary to check in regularly on the topics covered on your website to see if there’s any outdated information.</p>
<p>For example, you could use a <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite2024MarketingCalendar.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2024MarketingCalendar_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing planning calendar</a> to take note of any significant dates that may require your content to be updated and plan new content to keep your site fresh. Let’s say your industry is real estate. In that scenario, you’d want to update your site to reflect the latest interest rates.</p>
<div id="change-history"></div>
<h3>4. Change history</h3>
<p>While Google cares about recency, it also would know if you were lying about it. It was found in the documents that Google keeps copies of multiple versions of all indexed pages. Essentially, Google could recall all changes made to a page over time. That said, it will only use <a href="https://ipullrank.com/google-algo-leak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the last 20 changes</a> of a URL when analyzing.</p>
<p><strong>What this means: </strong>The fact that Google is taking your pages’ change history into consideration means you may want to be cautious when considering a series of changes to a given page. Making tiny changes to try to trick Google into thinking your content has been more dramatically updated could actually hinder your performance.</p>
<p>For example, if you were to update a blog post’s publish date when the content is basically the same, that could hurt rather than help your rank. In short, try to keep your content truly fresh and up to date. Quality and accuracy matter more than a date on the page.</p>
<div id="content-originality"></div>
<h3>5. Originality</h3>
<p>“Pages with little content,” as it’s put in the documents, get an OriginalContentScore. This score indicates that the less content you have on a page, the more original and unique it should be.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-algorithim-document-leak-content-score.webp" alt="google algorithm documents - content score screenshot" width="785" height="256" class="aligncenter wp-image-83380 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-algorithim-document-leak-content-score.webp 785w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-algorithim-document-leak-content-score-480x157.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 785px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ipullrank.com/google-algo-leak" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>While there’s no metric that measures character count, it’s clear that Google is looking for any short-form content to have an added dose of authenticity.</p>
<p>“Thin content is not always a function of length,” writes Mike.</p>
<p><strong>What this means: </strong>If your content tends to be shorter, then you’ll want to ensure it’s unique and original. Try not to rely heavily on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/28/ai-for-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generative AI for your content</a>. Also, see what types of content your competitors are putting out to pinpoint ways you can <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-make-your-business-stand-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make your business stand out</a> content-wise.</p>
<div id="site-size-and-age"></div>
<h3>6. Site size and age</h3>
<p>The Google “Sandbox” is an SEO industry term used to describe the phenomenon of newer, smaller sites needing to go through a kind of waiting period before their pages rank. Google <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-sandbox-nope-28082.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has previously denied</a> there being any sort of Sandbox, but there are factors mentioned in the documents that do look at site size, like smallPersonalSite, and age, like hostAge. However, it’s unclear whether this could boost or demote a site.</p>
<p><strong>What this means: </strong>A common <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small business challenge</a> is being able to rank on Google quickly. It can be a long, slow road, so be patient and don’t take shortcuts. Focus on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/19/brand-community" target="_blank" rel="noopener">building your brand</a><span> over time</span>. In the meantime, look for other ways to reach your target audience, such as building an email list, promoting your business on social media, running display ads, and more.</p>
<p>“For small and medium businesses and newer creators/publishers, SEO is likely to show poor returns until you’ve established credibility, navigational demand, and a strong reputation among a sizable audience,” writes Rand.</p>
<div id="chrome-data"></div>
<h3>7. Chrome data</h3>
<p>It’s no secret that Google is able to measure data from its own online browser, Chrome. That data could be impacting your SEO rankings, however, because it was found in the Google API documents that the number of views from Chrome attributed to both individual pages and entire domains are being tracked.</p>
<p>&#8220;My read is that Google likely uses the number of clicks on pages in Chrome browsers and uses that to determine the most popular/important URLs on a site, which go into the calculation of which to include in the sitelinks feature,” writes Rand.</p>
<p><strong>What this means: </strong>The more popular your pages are on Chrome, the better. Chrome owns <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">66%</a> of the global internet browser market share, and it’s by far the most popular browser in the U.S.</p>
<p>Having a site that your users love—even if they find it through other means than search—is likely good for your SEO in general, because Google knows if your site is getting traffic and engagement.</p>
<p>While it may feel tempting to give up on SEO amidst all this recent Google news, a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/17/increase-online-presence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong online presence</a> is as important as it ever was. If you can optimize your pages to be what users from Chrome and other pages really want to click, it can also benefit your overall site rank.</p>
<h2>Staying ahead of the latest Google algorithm ranking factors</h2>
<p>The moral of this latest Google news story? The leaked Google API documents remind us to stay focused on what we always knew to be true: building site content that makes our audiences happy is what will ultimately bring us success. Plus, being mindful that Google doesn’t always tell the truth about what it measures and what works is key.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you feel like you can’t win when it comes to your search engine marketing, you’re not alone.</p>
<p>After months of major algorithm updates that have left many site owners scrambling to understand the new reality and recover lost search traffic, Google this month dropped another huge bomb on the internet.</p>
<p>By now you’ve probably noticed a new section at the top of the Google search engine results page (SERP) showing for many queries, flagged as an <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> AI Overview. This new section, which takes up the majority of prime SERP real estate above the fold, is completely rocking the boat when it comes to SEO and PPC rankings. In fact, you could argue it’s rocking the entire digital ocean.</p>
<p>Today, we’ll look at what’s going on with Google AI Overviews, plus what it all means for businesses who rely on search marketing and advertising to drive traffic, leads, and sales, with perspectives and advice from industry experts.</p>

<h2>What are Google AI Overviews?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-overviews-statistics">Google AI Overviews</a> (AIO) are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-mode">AI-generated answers</a> to search queries that compile and combine results from across the web. After running an earlier version of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/07/agency-profitability-metrics">AI Overviews</a> (known as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/19/google-search-generative-experience">Search Generative Experience, or SGE</a>) as an optional experiment for a year, Google announced it was <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/generative-ai-google-search-may-2024/">launching the new feature more widely</a> on May 14.</p>
<p>According to Google, these AI-powered search results are “designed to improve the search experience by acting as agents that can answer questions and organize results into a personalized feed.” Similar to the results you might get from ChatGPT, “Google AI Overviews use multi-step reasoning to break down searches into parts, answer each part, and then put the answers back together.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ai-overviews-example.webp" alt="google ai overviews - screenshot example of an ai overview" width="826" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-83219 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ai-overviews-example.webp 826w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ai-overviews-example-480x349.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 826px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An example of what a Google AI Overview result looks like on the SERP.  </em></p>
<p>Google compiles these results by sourcing information from across the web, as well as its own Knowledge Graph data.</p>
<p>Google hasn’t disclosed what percentage of queries AI Overviews show for. And because most rank and feature tracking tools currently work in incognito mode (<a href="https://www.demandsphere.com/blog/google-ai-overviews/">which doesn&#8217;t seem to trigger AI overviews</a>), it’s difficult to say just how widespread AI Overviews are right now. But our team has seen them for many search queries over the last two weeks. The lack of clarity around the prevalence of the feature is part of the chaos that this update is causing.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Is your Google strategy already being impacted by Google AI Overviews?

<div id="impact-of-ai-overviews"></div>
<h2>The impacts of Google’s AI Overviews</h2>
<p>Just about everyone has been talking about Google AI Overviews, and for good reason. This affects all of us in the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/seo-vs-sem/">PPC or SEO</a> game, and really anyone with a website. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-02-19-gartner-predicts-search-engine-volume-will-drop-25-percent-by-2026-due-to-ai-chatbots-and-other-virtual-agents">Gartner has predicted organic traffic will fall 25%</a> (more on this later), with some industries already seeing much greater impacts.</p>
<p>A change this massive completely <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/competitive-insights">throws off many of the best practices</a> search marketers and advertisers have come to rely on for years. According to Elisa Gabbert, Director of Content and SEO at WordStream by LocaliQ, this is going to make content marketing much, much harder for all businesses, but smaller businesses in particular.</p>
<p>“The SERP has been getting more competitive and challenging for years, forcing businesses to increase their ad budgets to get people to their sites,” Elisa said. “But AI Overviews are going to reduce clicks to organic links even more dramatically than ad-heavy SERPs did. I’ve seen SERPs where the full screen above the fold was dominated by ads, followed by a full screen of an AI Overview, before you even get to the rest of the results.”</p>
<p>As some early studies have noted, the sites that Google sources for AI Overviews aren’t necessarily the same sites that earned strong organic rankings over the years. In some cases, <a href="https://twitter.com/lilyraynyc/status/1794377305633984724">those sources weren’t even ranking in the top 100 results</a>, but they’re now at the top of the page.</p>
<div id="problems-with-ai-overviews"></div>
<h2>The problem with AI Overviews</h2>
<p>We know that Google has made the world harder for businesses, but that’s not the only issue here. There have been serious problems with the quality of the AI results from a user standpoint, as well.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ai-overviews-coverage.webp" alt="google ai overviews - screenshot of coverage of ai overviews" width="499" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-83220 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ai-overviews-coverage.webp 499w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ai-overviews-coverage-480x577.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 499px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-ai-overview-fails-442575" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>A preview</em></a><em> of the dozens of articles published on the issues surrounding AI Overviews.</em></p>
<p>Google itself acknowledges that the generative AI used in AI Overviews is “experimental and info quality may vary.” However, most businesses have found that to be putting it lightly.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-ai-overview-fails-442575" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these examples</a> of how Google AI Overviews have gone gravely wrong.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ai-overviews-eat-rocks-example.webp" alt="google ai overviews - example of an inaccurate aio result" width="600" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-83217 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ai-overviews-eat-rocks-example.webp 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ai-overviews-eat-rocks-example-480x480.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>

<p>The “AI” (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/neptunemoon_can-we-get-real-for-a-second-about-ai-what-activity-7200870080937684992-UPof" target="_blank" rel="noopener">really machine learning</a>) in AI Overviews obviously can’t read through the context of a search query like a real person would. However, these generated search responses are full of problems and potentially dangerous inaccuracies. For example, Google’s AI doesn’t seem to understand jokes or sarcasm from the sources it pulls, and it’s also been found to cite outdated (<a href="https://x.com/lilyraynyc/status/1795106675600367697" target="_blank" rel="noopener">or even dead</a>) URLs.</p>
<div id="ai-overviews-predictions"></div>
<h2>Life after AI Overviews: 3 predictions for the future of search</h2>
<p>Wondering what happens next now that Google AI Overviews are here to stay? Check out these three predictions for where this might lead.</p>
<h3>1. Google’s reputation and industry dominance are at risk</h3>
<p>As demonstrated by the examples above (and many more going viral on social media under the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GoogEnough&amp;src=hashtag_click">#googenough</a><span> hashtag</span>) Google AI Overviews and Search have a severe quality and reliability issue right now.</p>
<p>“Trust in Google Search is eroding—even if Alphabet is making billions of dollars every quarter. As that trust erodes, people may start searching elsewhere, which will slowly trickle down and hurt performance for advertisers and further reduce organic traffic to websites,&#8221; said Danny Goodwin, Managing Editor at Search Engine Land, in <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-ai-overview-fails-442575">this recent article</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also been speculation that Google is &#8220;panicking&#8221; because of the threat from other AI companies developing products that could challenge or replace Google search as the industry standard.</p>
<h3><span>2. Organic traffic from Google will decline–maybe drastically</span></h3>
<p>There are a few reasons why your organic search traffic will see an impact from AI Overviews and its new <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-mode">AI Mode</a>.</p>
<p>To start, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top-ranking organic results</a> will now be further down the page. Unless your site ends up in the Overview itself, your potential customers will have to scroll further down below the fold to click directly on your organic listing.</p>
<p>Secondly, inaccurate results may also cause a decline in traffic. AI Overviews have proven to be unreliable, so they may not include your site in a response even when they technically should. You could end up missing out on traffic by not being pulled into a relevant Overview.</p>
<p>Further, providing more thorough information directly on the SERP makes clicking off to a specific page less likely. The typical user previously would have clicked into a few pages from the SERP to further research their query. Now, people might feel like they found everything they needed from an Overview without having to click into any of the sources (even though that’s not necessarily recommended).</p>
<p>In fact, it’s been estimated that, for the average business, organic search engine traffic volume will drop as much as <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-02-19-gartner-predicts-search-engine-volume-will-drop-25-percent-by-2026-due-to-ai-chatbots-and-other-virtual-agents">25%</a> by 2026 because of AI chatbots and other virtual agents providing searchers with information instead. What’s arguably even more concerning is, currently, <a href="https://searchengineland.com/search-engine-traffic-2026-prediction-437650">79%</a> of consumers expect to use AI-enhanced search within the next year and 70% had at least some trust in generative AI search results.</p>
<h3>3. SEO best practices will change (quickly!)</h3>
<p>Many of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/05/seo-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried and true SEO tips and tricks</a> from over the years will need to evolve to align with the new AI Overview search experience.</p>
<p>Further complicating matters, <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/an-anonymous-source-shared-thousands-of-leaked-google-search-api-documents-with-me-everyone-in-seo-should-see-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked Google documents</a> have recently come out that appear to contain previously undisclosed information on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/09/google-ranking-factors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s ranking factors</a>. These <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-search-document-leak-ranking-442617" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Google documents</a> are considered to be “one of the biggest stories in the history of SEO and Google Search,” according to Danny Goodwin.</p>
<p>For example, it was found that Google keeps (or at least has the capability to keep) a copy of every indexed page, so it can “remember” past versions of a page and could possibly take change history into account when ranking sites on the SERP.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ai-overviews-leaked-document-linkedin-post.webp" alt="google ai overviews - leaked document linkedin post screenshot" width="523" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-83216 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ai-overviews-leaked-document-linkedin-post.webp 523w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ai-overviews-leaked-document-linkedin-post-480x551.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 523px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kylebyers_this-is-one-of-the-most-exciting-times-for-activity-7201540512678318083-fmX3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>We don’t know for sure what the leaked documents mean or which of the 14,000+ factors found in them really matter most for your rankings, but one thing is certain. Getting your site to rank and <em>stay</em> ranked so you can drive consistent traffic is more complex than ever.</p>
<div id="ai-overview-strategy"></div>
<h2>3 ways to survive the recent Google changes</h2>
<p>So, how can you take action to ensure <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/26/seo-vs-sem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your business’s SEO and PPC</a> are still viable in a post-AI Overviews world? Consider these pieces of advice.</p>
<h3>1. Don’t give up on SEO altogether&#8230;</h3>
<p>It’s not time to throw in the SEO towel just yet. SEO will continue to be a major marketing channel for businesses of all different verticals, but be ready to pivot your SEO strategy according to the new SERP structure.</p>
<p>“In a nutshell, AI overviews represent nothing more than a shift in attention from ranking pages to the SERPs themselves. The focus now turns to the answers served in the AI snippets,” said Goran Mirkovic, CMO at <a href="https://freemius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freemius</a>.</p>
<p>“Yes, it might be harder to attribute results, and a new category of AI optimization may emerge, but we’re still dealing with the same searchers looking for information on the internet. The core rules of the game remain the same—who better serves the demand for information; wins! As long as we can meet this demand, whether through our website, Google&#8217;s search results, or potentially another platform in the future—will continue to generate revenue,&#8221; Goran said.</p>
<h3>2. &#8230;but start exploring other marketing channels</h3>
<p>The fact of the matter is your organic website traffic may start to look a little different than what it was pre-AI Overviews. To make up for any traffic losses, start to consider what other <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/26/marketing-channels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing channels</a> you could lean into to continue to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/02/promote-your-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grow your business online</a>. For example, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/video-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video marketing</a> could be another avenue for quality content that converts.</p>
<p>“As SEOs and content marketers, and businesses as a whole, we typically neglect video,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zacharris36/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zac Harris</a>, an SEO consultant who has worked with brands like SpyFu and Copy.ai.</p>
<p>“Yes, continue to create written content, but think about how to get the maximum amount of value out of that. Can we create video content to go with that?  Can we create <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/youtube-shorts-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shorts</a> and slice up videos for LinkedIn and social?” Zac said.</p>
<p>This is also a good time to rethink your search advertising strategy and budget. As organic traffic dips and content marketing and SEO potentially become less cost-effective, you can increase your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-marketing-live-2024">paid search</a> budget to keep your lead flow strong. And definitely allot some of that budget to search engines other than Google–we’ve found that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2024-google-ads-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">both cost per click and cost per acquisition are significantly lower</a> in Microsoft Ads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-benchmarks-microsoft-versus-google-costs.webp" alt="google ads benchmarks - microsoft versus google ads cost per click comparison chart" width="510" height="369" class="aligncenter wp-image-82736 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-benchmarks-microsoft-versus-google-costs.webp 510w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-benchmarks-microsoft-versus-google-costs-480x347.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 510px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Data from US-based LocaliQ campaigns shows the difference in costs per click between Google and Microsoft. </em></p>
<h3>3. Focus on building your brand</h3>
<p>It’s no secret that the bigger your brand, the bigger your presence will be online. While it’s easier said than done to grow your brand as a small business, it can be well worth the work in the long-term. Try establishing your brand messaging in a cross-channel marketing approach to make your business more visible and recognizable to potential customers across the web.</p>
<p>“If there was one universal piece of advice I had for marketers seeking to broadly improve their organic search rankings and traffic, it would be: ‘Build a notable, popular, well-recognized brand in your space, outside of Google search,&#8217;” said Rand Fishkin, Cofounder of Sparktoro and Snackbar Studio, in <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/an-anonymous-source-shared-thousands-of-leaked-google-search-api-documents-with-me-everyone-in-seo-should-see-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article</a>.</p>

<h2>Google AI Overviews: what’s next</h2>
<p>Google has acknowledged some of the problems with AI Overviews and <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/ai-overviews-update-may-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claims</a> they have made &#8220;more than a dozen technical improvements&#8221; to their systems already, so let&#8217;s hope for the best. We know that Google AI Overviews will continue to adapt to Google’s ever-changing needs, so it’s key to be a step ahead of the game by staying fully informed on all the implications an update like this involves.</p>
<p>While we can’t escape AI Overviews anytime soon, we can be thinking of ways to work around it to still see results—whether that be through different strategies or different channels.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google’s core algorithm updates have always been something SEO experts, marketers, and growing businesses alike have had to adapt to.</p>
<p>Each update evolves how search results are curated for your audience, and some updates are more significant than others. For example, we recently saw two major Google algorithm updates roll out in October 2023 and March 2024, both focused on addressing low-quality or spam content.

<h2>How the latest Google core algorithm updates are impacting businesses</h2>
<p>Here is the verdict on the latest major Google core algorithm updates—according to our expert sources!</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Looking for more SEO tips and insights?

<h3>1. Previously high-ranking content may have lost value</h3>
<p>Taking a deeper dive into the updates, it’s apparent that some content you may have not previously considered to be spam could now fall into this category inadvertently.</p>
<p>“In <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-update-march-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the March update announcement</a>, spam is categorized into three categories: scaled content abuse, expired domain abuse, and site reputation abuse. These types of abuse have become increasingly common in the SEO world over the past two years,” said Goran Mirkovic, Chief Marketing Officer at <a href="https://freemius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freemius</a>.</p>
<p>“Scaled content abuse primarily targets the surge of mass-produced AI-generated content. Google&#8217;s policy explicitly states that it rewards high-quality content, regardless of how it is produced. The problem lies in the misapplication of AI, resulting in generic and low-quality content which is now overflowing the internet in every category,” said Goran.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, expired domain abuse aims to end the misuse of expired <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/12/domain-authority" target="_blank" rel="noopener">domain authority</a> to host irrelevant and low-quality content. Google will penalize domains that are irrelevant when comparing their old content to their new content.</p>
<p>Lastly, site reputation abuse is Google&#8217;s attempt to combat ‘parasite SEO,’ which involves using high-authority websites to rank for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/12/keyword-difficulty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">competitive keywords</a>. You may have noticed many big publishing sites hosting pages with titles like ‘X best products’ in an attempt to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/search-visibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gain visibility</a>,” said Goran.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-algorithm-update-announcement.jpg" alt="google core algorithm updates - announcement screenshot" width="900" height="459" class="aligncenter wp-image-81736 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-algorithm-update-announcement.jpg 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-algorithm-update-announcement-480x245.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Now, you might be thinking at this point that your business doesn’t have content that falls under any of these three spam categories. However, other types of common website pages could still see a hit from these updates.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ve seen some sites begin to struggle with original content that they&#8217;ve copied and minimally altered,” said Mark Irvine, Vice President of Search at <a href="https://searchlabdigital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SearchLab</a>.</p>
<p>“For instance—a client previously wrote a decent page about his services, no issues there. But the client then copied that content and published that same page for over 100 towns that he serviced—only changing the city name for each page. That may have gotten him some small incremental SEO bumps when he first did it, but now we&#8217;re increasingly seeing even the original page get less and less traffic to it,” said Mark.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-algorithm-update-multilocation-business.jpg" alt="google algorithm updates - example of multilocation sites" width="746" height="486" class="aligncenter wp-image-81741 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-algorithm-update-multilocation-business.jpg 746w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-algorithm-update-multilocation-business-480x313.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 746px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>In </em><em>this example</em><em>, individual site pages for each service location could potentially lose SEO value. </em></p>
<h3>2. AI-generated content is seeing the biggest hit</h3>
<p>Aside from unoriginal, expired, or disreputable content, varying AI-generated content is the primary reason we’re seeing these updates from Google. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/05/generative-ai-in-digital-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Generative AI</a> can be great for content ideation, brainstorming, and more. However, there are some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/28/ai-for-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">serious risks involved with using AI</a> to scale your content and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/05/seo-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO strategy</a>.</p>
<p>“The biggest challenge I&#8217;ve seen is with clients who previously benefitted earlier in 2023 with an overabundance of easy (and often unoriginal) content. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/25/ai-content-generators" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI-generated content</a> was a very fast and painless way to speed up filling out blog or site pages. In moderation, with the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/ai-prompt-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">correct AI prompts</a>, AI content can still be helpful,” said Mark.</p>
<p>“But the current large language models (LLMs) that drive <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-copywriting-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popular AI tools</a> borrow from the content and language that&#8217;s already published across the web. It&#8217;s difficult for AI content to contribute a unique or creative perspective that&#8217;s different from other pages across the web. These new updates penalize a lot of content that&#8217;s not very different from original sources,&#8221; said Mark.</p>
<p>Remember, the problem doesn’t lie in AI-generated content itself. It seems Google is looking to strike a balance between the most efficient search results while maintaining that “human touch.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Google&#8217;s core updates always aim to improve the results being served to users. The latest updates are no different. As the internet is flooded with AI-generated content Google&#8217;s task has grown more difficult,” said Milen Vasilev, Director of <a href="https://localiq.com/products/search-engine-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Presence Implementation at LocaliQ</a>.</p>
<p>“They are aiming to keep their results more relevant through more granular weeding and accounting for more unique, quality content in which the ‘human touch’ shows.”</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Get a handle on how to use AI for marketing the right way with our free emergency guide to <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteAIinMarketingGuide.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_AIMarketing_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI in marketing</a>!</p>
<h3>3. Competition has increased for some industries</h3>
<p>How you approach your SEO content is going to depend on your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/niche-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">niche market</a>. It&#8217;s more important than ever to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-make-your-business-stand-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make your business stand out</a> within your specific industry.</p>
<p>“Google isn&#8217;t just targeting AI-generated content. I&#8217;ve unfortunately seen several clients lose a lot of their organic traffic after previously partnering with a respected SEO agency that specializes in one particular vertical (agencies that just do SEO for lawyers, car dealerships, HVAC, etc.).</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s updates strongly prefer original, unique content. Some agencies fall into the trap of writing a great piece of relevant content for one client but reusing it dozens or hundreds of times for their different clients,” said Mark.</p>
<p>“A good oil change page on a car dealership’s site can bring a lot of great SEO value to your first client&#8217;s site—but that same page reused a thousand times over begins to get ignored by Google, particularly after these updates.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d encourage clients to check the originality of their key site content. Open some of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/14/website-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most popular website pages</a>, copy the first sentence, and paste it in quotation marks into the Google search bar. If Google returns hundreds of pages with the same wording, there&#8217;s no way that it&#8217;s going to prefer your page over any others.&#8221;</p>

<h3>4. Some sites are seeing a decrease in traffic&#8230;</h3>
<p>One of the most noticeable impacts of the October 2023 and March 2024 core updates is the dip in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website traffic</a> some businesses have been experiencing.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve seen some dips in organic traffic and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keyword rankings</a>, more so with clients who&#8217;ve previously used AI to produce content at scale (with little human editing),” said Allie Decker, co-founder at <a href="https://beomniscient.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Omniscient Digital</a>.</p>
<p>“By the end of March, most of our clients had rebounded, and those pages that are still recovering have indicated where we need to optimize and update content.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-algorithm-update-traffic-chart.jpg" alt="google algorithm updates - traffic drop chart screenshot" width="785" height="446" class="aligncenter wp-image-81743 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-algorithm-update-traffic-chart.jpg 785w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-algorithm-update-traffic-chart-480x273.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 785px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/thread/263667593/sudden-drop-in-search-ranking-and-traffic-after-google-march-2024-core-update-need-help?hl=en#:~:text=But%2C%20after%20the%20Google%20Core,to%20potentially%20rectify%20the%20situation." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>An example</em></a><em> of a website traffic drop that aligns with the start of the March 2024 update. </em></p>
<h3>5. &#8230;and others have only seen traffic fluctuations</h3>
<p>On the other hand, other websites have only seen fluctuations in traffic and keyword rankings. This might be because the updates are still rolling out. Plus, SEO is a long-term game, so it’ll be crucial to watch your site over the next few months to see how these updates develop results over time.</p>
<p>“Personally, I haven&#8217;t noticed any significant changes just yet,” said Goran. “It&#8217;s still early, and I predict it will take about a month for the update to be fully implemented. However, I expect to see some fluctuations in search results and a noticeable decrease in the visibility of what Google now considers ‘unhelpful’ content.&#8221;</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Get more website traffic fast with our free guide to <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proven strategies for driving more traffic to your website</a>—no matter what updates roll out!</p>
<h3>6. October 2023 and March 2024 updates are more complex than others</h3>
<p>If you’ve been struggling to get a handle on the recent Google core algorithm updates, it’s not just you. Business owners, marketers, and experts have all agreed that changes to the SERP have become more unpredictable.</p>
<p>“The organic landscape as a whole has changed substantially since the more rapid onset of core algorithm updates started in October of 2023,” said Alex Chefalo, Senior Strategist at <a href="https://www.829studios.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">829 Studios</a>.</p>
<p>“This update is more complex than previous ones because it involves changes to multiple core systems, whereas previous updates focused on updating single systems. The main purpose of this update is to combat what Google identifies as ‘spam’ in the search engine results pages (SERPs),” said Goran.</p>
<h3>7. Specific industries may have been impacted more than others</h3>
<p>Updates from Google over the past few months have impacted rankings across the board, but it’s been found that some industries may be feeling the heat more than others.</p>
<p>“We saw the <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/help/helpful-content-faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helpful content update</a> roll out in September through October 2023—this focused on the quality user-centric content and, on the flip, side weeding out AI-generated content,” said Milen.</p>
<p>“We also saw more core updates in October through November 2023 that shook up rankings a bit. In early March 2024, Google rolled out a core and a spam update. We saw the highest volatility in ranking in food and drink, beauty and fitness, and shopping industries (according to Semrush data). Home and garden sites also saw a lot of ranking shifts.”</p>
<p>If you’re in these industries, this doesn’t mean you have to throw in your SEO towel altogether. However, it’s important to know whether your business’s vertical has a higher risk of impact from Google’s updates. That way, you can better prepare and maintain a keen eye over your site’s performance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-algorithm-updates-home-and-garden.jpg" alt="google algorithm updates - home and garden industry serp screenshot" width="635" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-81738 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-algorithm-updates-home-and-garden.jpg 635w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-algorithm-updates-home-and-garden-480x454.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 635px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An example of how search results for the home and garden industry could vary. </em></p>
<h3>8. The updates are impacting PPC, too</h3>
<p>Let’s not forget what shares the SERP with organic results: <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/21/how-to-run-google-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads</a>. While the core algorithm updates apply to organic search rankings, the same <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2024-seo-trends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO trends</a> emerging from these updates have trickled into PPC. When one part of the SERP changes, every part of the SERP changes.</p>
<p>“One of the biggest things I watch for when a core algorithm rolls out is upticks in keyword variant matching,” said Navah Hopkins, Brand Evangelist at <a href="https://www.optmyzr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Optmyzr</a>. “While this is anecdotal, I tend to see a rise in close variant search terms with algorithm updates. Since Google Ads <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/03/broad-match-type" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broad match</a> behavior and organic search share a lot of the same technology, it makes sense they would impact each other.”</p>
<p>“My biggest advice is to keep an eagle eye on those search terms, as well as any rules you might have for negatives,” said Navah.</p>
<p>If you<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/01/11/increase-online-store-sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> sell products</a> via organic search or Google Ads, consider trying <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/18/google-merchant-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Merchant Center</a> (GMC) to secure more SERP placements.</p>
<p>“Starting with the SERPs, Google has been dedicating an increasing amount of space to rich results. If you are in the ecommerce space, making sure that you set up Google Merchant Center and add the relevant schema to your product pages should be a major priority,” said Alex.</p>
<p>“Not only does <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/22/free-google-shopping-listings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GMC offer free listings</a> but they are constantly beta testing new ways to use these rich results. For example, I was looking at running shoes for a client. The SERP was an interactive rich result that allowed me to swipe left and right on styles I liked.</p>
<p>While the end goal is clearly to get you into paid Shopping ads, taking advantage of the free GMC listings can be a great way to gain more value for your own business or (if you’re an agency) your clients’ business.”</p>

<h2>How can you prepare for future Google core algorithm updates?</h2>
<p>While changes coming from Google can sometimes feel unpredictable, one thing you can always count on is more to come. So, how can you be ready for the next major Google core algorithm update? Here are a few expert tips to help you prepare.</p>
<h3>1. Continue to prioritize E-E-A-T&#8230;</h3>
<p>The four themes of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/14/google-e-e-a-t" target="_blank" rel="noopener">E-E-A-T (experience, expertise, authority, trust)</a> are the foundational pillars of any strong SEO strategy. While focusing on E-E-A-T may feel like a given, it’s important to remember how sticking to the fundamentals during tumultuous times on the SERP can pay off.</p>
<p>“The best way to prepare for future updates is simple: create high-quality, human-written content infused with fresh data, first-hand experience, and other E-E-A-T factors,” said Allie. “Optimize for the user—think from first principles and build programs to serve your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/target-market-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">target market</a> (your current or potential customers).</p>
<p>Know what your audience cares about, understand how they utilize and interact with search, and create content to meet them where they are. This is not only effective in the short-term—Google appreciates topical consistency and fresh, quality content—but it also builds long-term resilience in the form of an organic growth program. As a bonus, you won’t have to panic every time there is an algorithm update,&#8221; said Allie.</p>
<p>&#8220;TL;DR: be patient and don&#8217;t try to &#8220;hack&#8221; the system. It never serves you well!”</p>
<p>The hardest part of digital marketing is patience, but with dedication to E-E-A-T, your long-term SEO goals can still pay off.</p>
<p>“The best bet is to start evaluating the quality of your content by ensuring it’s optimized for EEAT,” said Goran. “If you leaned on AI these last two years to get a lot of SEO stuff out, it’s time to think about how to <a href="https://megawattcontent.com/content-creation-with-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elevate the quality of that content</a>.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-algorithm-updates-eeat-infographic.jpg" alt="google algorithm updates - eeat for seo chart" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-81740 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-algorithm-updates-eeat-infographic.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-algorithm-updates-eeat-infographic-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>2. Emphasize your site’s UX and navigation</h3>
<p>Beyond the basics of E-E-A-T, businesses should pay extra attention to how the user interacts with content. Google is putting more and more emphasis on user experience (UX), so you’ll want to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/18/content-optimization">optimize your website content</a> with that in mind.</p>
<p>“The SEO fundamentals are largely the same—what matters most is focusing on quality and execution while creating for users—not for search engines,” said Milen.</p>
<p>“We think of SEO in terms of content, core technical, deep technical, health checks, and off-site. Across all these, the key is to create for users and help them get the answers or services they need.</p>
<p>Write helpful content, structure your site logically and neatly, and fix broken pages (so users do not go to dead ends—nothing is more frustrating!). Last but not least, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/17/increase-online-presence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep a stellar online presence</a> on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/10/create-google-my-business-account" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Business Profile</a>, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media platforms</a>, and everywhere that matters to your business.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-algorithm-updates-table-of-contents-example.jpg" alt="google algorithm updates - example small business blog post with table of contents built in" width="602" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-81737 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-algorithm-updates-table-of-contents-example.jpg 602w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-algorithm-updates-table-of-contents-example-480x478.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 602px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Including </em><em>a table of contents<a href="https://www.petcarerx.com/article/nutrition-for-feeding-a-senior-cat/671" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> like this</a> on your page is one way to help users find answers to their questions quickly and easily. </em></p>
<h3>3. Create question-based content</h3>
<p>As you create and optimize content, you’ll want to think of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/19/customer-journey-map-templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer journey</a> and consider how your potential customers might structure search queries. For example, a lot of Google’s updates are meant to help better answer common question queries. Looking at the “people also ask” and “related searches” portions of the SERP can give you ideas for long-tailed, question-based keywords you could work into your page headers, subheadings, and text.</p>
<p>“Another area of change has been the way that people search,” said Alex.</p>
<p>“Generative AI is shaping the way that people interact and ask questions within search engines. Creating content based on questions or including questions inside of headers isn&#8217;t exactly an earth-shattering revelation, especially for those out there who have been <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/15/voice-search-seo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimizing this way for voice search</a>.</p>
<p>However, it is a good way to target long-tailed keywords with high intent while future-proofing your content as AI integrates more directly with organic search. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/19/google-search-generative-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gemini (formerly known as Bard)</a> is already pulling in results from informational site pages if you ask for product recommendations, so including FAQs in your content, tagging them with the proper schema, and making them as efficient as possible for crawlers to evaluate should help give you a leg up.”</p>

<h3>4. Conduct SEO audits regularly</h3>
<p>This last tip for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/19/google-ads-for-small-businesses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surviving Google</a> algorithm updates could arguably be the most important. To get ahead of Google at its own game, you’ll want to stay on top of your performance tracking. Regularly <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/24/website-audit-checklist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">checking in on your SEO performance</a> with scheduled <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-audit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO audits</a> can help you account for any traffic or keyword ranking changes before they snowball into large-scale issues.</p>
<p>“To survive this update, people need to do some auditing and see if they have something on their sites that falls into these new categories,” said Goran. “If you have bad listicles—delete and redirect them! If you have irrelevant content on the site—delete that too!”</p>

<p>The same goes for digital marketing. You want to know the true reasons <em>why</em> you’re implementing one <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/18/best-marketing-strategies">marketing strategy</a> over another! Our job today is to “show your work” for you, with 165 key digital marketing statistics in five different categories.</p>

<h2>Why are digital marketing statistics important?</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Statistics help you prioritize your efforts.</strong> If you’re implementing a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/10/15/multi-channel-marketing">multi-channel marketing</a> strategy, you’ll want to know how certain platforms will perform compared to others. With statistics to back your choices, you’re able to know what channels might require more resources over others.</li>
<li><strong>Digital marketing statistics help you stay competitive.</strong> With these data points, you’re able to know what others are doing—which can help you jump ahead of your competitors.</li>
<li><strong>Stay on top of trends. </strong>Data reveals patterns and digital marketing trends that can help you to identify strategies and platforms where it might make sense to be an early adopter.</li>
<li><strong>Data can make room for other strategies.</strong> When you’re leveraging digital marketing statistics, you have full confidence in what’s going to work. That way, you can spend less time sweating your strategy and focus on other tasks, like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/24/website-audit-checklist">auditing </a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/24/website-audit-checklist">your website</a>!
