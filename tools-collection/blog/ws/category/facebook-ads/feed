										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s no secret that Facebook continues to be a lucrative platform for brands to reach, engage, and convert customers. Just how lucrative? Well, for starters, it&#8217;s one of the cheapest social media advertising channels and has been proven to deliver the <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/hubspot-blog-marketing-industry-trends-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest ROI</a> for advertisers out of all social ad platforms.</p>
<p>But to officially answer that question, we&#8217;re going to dive into how much Facebook ads cost based on the latest data available, as well as how to keep your costs as low as possible.</p>

<h2>How much do Facebook Ads cost?</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ll be diving into different reports to get specific answers, but here&#8217;s the overview.</p>
<p>The average Meta Ads CPC is about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ads-benchmarks-2025">$1.92 for leads campaigns and $0.70 for traffic campaigns</a>, and the average cost per lead is about $27.66.</p>
<p>Of course, each of the studies above used different data sets. Keep in mind, too, that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-accurate-is-ai-for-ppc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when we&#8217;ve asked AI this same question</a> and very different results came up from each tool tested. Basically, costs vary by industry and campaign objective, which we&#8217;ll get to later.</p>

<h2>Factors that influence the cost of Facebook ads</h2>
<p>Just like <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/08/instagram-ads-cost">Instagram ads costs</a>, Facebook ad costs are influenced by a number of variables.</p>
<h3>1. Campaign objectives</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-objectives">Facebook campaign objectives</a> are a prominent factor in pricing since they relate to the value of the desired goal and where in the funnel your users are.</p>
<p>For example, Awareness or Engagement campaigns will cost less than lower-funnel campaigns like Sales that drive purchases. It’s easier to get someone to engage with an ad than it is to entice them to click through, open up their wallet, and complete a purchase.</p>
<h3>2. Audience size</h3>
<p>Facebook ads targeting larger and broader audiences will generally cost less than for smaller audiences.</p>
<p>You will typically see lower costs in prospecting, upper-funnel, cold-audience campaigns compared to retargeting, lower-funnel, warmer-audience campaigns, because the audiences of the latter tend to be more specific, smaller in size, and therefore more <a href="/blog/ws/2017/04/27/how-to-compete-in-facebook-ads">competitive</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/facebook-ads-trends-audience-size-indicator.jpg" alt="how much does facebook cost - audience size indicator" width="520" height="349" class="aligncenter wp-image-79160 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/facebook-ads-trends-audience-size-indicator.jpg 520w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/facebook-ads-trends-audience-size-indicator-480x322.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 520px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>3. Daily budget</h3>
<p>If your daily budget is on the lower end, it may take longer for Facebook&#8217;s algorithm to exit the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-learning-phase">learning phase</a>. For this reason, costs for new ad sets are often higher upfront while the system understands how your audience behaves with your ads and how to optimize them for the highest engagement. If your ads are well-engaged with, Facebook and Instagram will reward you with lower costs over time.</p>
<h3><span>4. Bidding strategy</span></h3>
<p><span>Similarly, the way you instruct Facebook to spend your ad budget affects how much your ads cost. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/31/facebook-ads-bidding-strategies">Facebook bidding strategies</a> include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span></span><span>Highest volume (formerly lowest cost)</span><span></span></li>
<li>Highest value</li>
<li>Cost per result (formerly cost cap)</li>
<li>ROAS goal (formerly minimum ROAS)</li>
<li>Bid cap</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Click-through rate</h3>
<p>Click-through rate (CTR) can also play a role in your Facebook ad costs. If CTR is low, especially in a website traffic campaign, you may then see higher costs as Facebook understands that there may be some disconnect between your target audience and the <a href="/blog/ws/2016/06/29/best-facebook-ads">messaging in your ads</a>.</p>
<p>A healthy Facebook CTR is about 1-3%. More often than not, the higher your CTR climbs, the lower your CPCs will be.</p>
<h3>6. Industry</h3>
<p>As you saw in our benchmarks above, Facebook costs vary by industry, which also includes varying click-through rates. Your market and industry will play a big role in what to expect in terms of your Meta Ads costs. For instance, the chart below indicates pretty big differences between CTRs across various industries, which could indicate how more or less competitive your vertical may be.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-fb-benchmarks-leads-ctr-846x1024.webp" alt="2025 fb benchmarks - 2025 leads click-through rate" width="846" height="1024" class="aligncenter wp-image-93930 size-large" /></p>
<h3>7. Seasonality</h3>
<p>Historically speaking, in the latter part of Q3 and Q4, costs tend to temporarily increase as the advertising landscape changes for the <a href="/blog/ws/2019/08/08/holiday-marketing-tips">holiday ecommerce season</a>. Competition ramps up as brands increase their budgets and gain more impression share, thus increasing costs for all advertising brands.</p>
<p>Keep seasonality in mind as you budget for the year. If you aren’t in ecommerce or running promotions during the end of the year, you may want to strategize on whether to keep a presence or to scale back.</p>
<div id="lower"></div>
<h2>How to lower Facebook ad costs</h2>
<p>There are a number of ways to lower your Facebook ad costs, but here are some of our favorite strategies.</p>
<h3>1. Create a full-funnel strategy</h3>
<p>To use your budget wisely and set yourself up to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/08/how-to-scale-facebook-ads">scale your Facebook ads</a>, choose funnel-appropriate campaign objectives. In general, Awareness and Consideration campaigns are suited for the top of the funnel; Consideration and Conversion campaigns align with the middle of the funnel, and Conversion campaigns are best for <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/01/bottom-funnel-conversions">bottom-funnel conversions</a>.</p>
<p>In short, begin with upper-funnel campaigns to reach more people in your target audience at a lower cost, and then move your way toward conversion campaigns that optimize for your purchase-driving conversion events.</p>
<p>You can learn how to create a <a href="/blog/ws/2019/02/21/facebook-funnel">full-funnel Facebook advertising strategy here</a>.</p>
<p>Note that some brands can certainly run a Sales campaign targeting upper-funnel audiences with lower-priced products or something that may make for a good impulse buy.</p>
<p>People can and do <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/13/facebook-ecommerce-tips">make purchases</a> upon first interaction with a brand on Facebook, however, most will need more touch points from a brand so you can gain their trust, showcase your benefits, and entice them to convert.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Want more Facebook ads tips like these?</strong> Download our free guide to the top <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLFBFundamentals.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FacebookFundamentals_Download">seven fundamental Facebook advertising tips</a> every advertiser should know.</p>
<h3>2. Broaden your audience</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, audience size impacts how much Facebook ads cost. So while you want to keep your targeting narrow, you should strive to make those targeted audiences as large as possible. This has become trickier as a result of privacy measures, but we&#8217;ve got some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/11/facebook-advertising-strategies">recommended Facebook ad strategies</a> to help you out with that.</p>
<h3>3. Check audience overlap</h3>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s audience overlap tool can be instrumental in saving money. Let’s say you have one ad targeting an audience of people interested in startups and another ad for people interested in entrepreneurship. You have different<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/07/facebook-ad-copy-examples"> Facebook ad copy</a> and creative to appeal to these different audiences. However, the overlap tool shows you that half of the startup audience overlaps with the entrepreneurship audience. Knowing this, you can use exclusions so those ads don’t overlap. Otherwise, you’d lose money bidding against yourself.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ad-costs-audience-overlap-tool.png" alt="" width="800" height="403" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18248" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ad-costs-audience-overlap-tool.png 800w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ad-costs-audience-overlap-tool-480x242.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>4. Use bid caps</h3>
<p>This is the manual bidding <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-tactics">strategy in Facebook ads</a>, where you can set a maximum bid instead of allowing Facebook to dynamically bid based on your goals. But this should be used with caution. It’s for advertisers who have a solid understanding of the conversion rate and profit margin and require regular maintenance. If you set your bid cap too low, Facebook might have a hard time spending all of your budget.</p>
<h3>5. Use the Pixel AND the Facebook Conversions API</h3>
<p>The goal of both of these pieces of technology is for you to track your ad performance. With visibility into what’s working and what’s not, you can allocate budget accordingly. You can also gain insights about the people viewing your ads, which you can use to further optimize your campaigns and maximize your budget.</p>
<p>The Facebook Pixel is still a thing, but it is losing its power since it’s cookie-based and cookies are crumbling. The Facebook Conversions API does not rely on cookies, but it doesn’t pick up the same exact information as the pixel. So, using the two together will ensure you capture the most accurate data. You can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/06/facebook-conversions-api">learn how to use the Facebook Conversions API here</a>.</p>

<h3>6. Run Facebook A/B testing</h3>
<p>You can also help lower your costs at the ad level by <a href="/blog/ws/2021/05/11/facebook-ab-testing">A/B testing</a> variables in your ads—one at a time—to better understand what is and is not working well. Test out the text, <a href="/blog/ws/2018/08/28/facebook-ad-headlines">headline</a>, images and/or videos, landing pages, and more.</p>
<p>Facebook is not the set-it-and-forget type of platform, so it is best to continuously test and aim for better results. Running tests at the ad level can help improve your engagement rates and CTR and stretch your budget further. Check out our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/23/facebook-ad-examples">Facebook ad examples</a> to get ideas and inspiration.</p>
<h3>7. Try Meta Advantage+</h3>
<p>Over the last couple of years, Facebook ads has rolled out <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-plus">Advantage+</a> settings that allow Facebook&#8217;s machine learning to automate campaign audience and placement targeting, ad creative, and more. These settings, which you choose to opt into, are easy to use and can be a timesaver for advertisers looking to scale more quickly. However, just know that there will be a trade-off of manual control with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Advantage Plus</a>, so be sure to keep a close eye on your campaign behavior and any AI-powered assets to maintain consistent performance.</p>

<div id="worth"></div>
<h2>What makes Facebook Ads worth the price?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/02/reasons-to-advertise-on-social-media">Advertising on social media</a> in general has its benefits, but let&#8217;s finish off with some of the money-saving advantages Facebook has over other platforms like Pinterest, LinkedIn, and Instagram.</p>
<h3>Facebook is still the most popular social media platform</h3>
<p>With over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3 billion active users</a> worldwide, Facebook currently ranks as the largest and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">most popular social media platform</a> in the world. This is compared to other front-runners like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok.</p>
<h3>&#8230;and the most widely used</h3>
<p>Facebook has the most even distribution of users compared to other popular social media platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn—which means you can target a larger range of age groups with your ads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/facebook-ads-cost-2021-facebook-even-age-distribution_0.png" alt="age distribution for facebook vs instagram and linkedin" width="720" height="196" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<h3>Precise targeting means higher ROI</h3>
<p>Precise targeting means reduced Facebook ad costs. If you want to target someone in a 15-mile radius of a particular address or zip code, you can do that. If you want to reach parents with children 3-5 years old who love ice cream, you can do that, too. And we haven&#8217;t even touched lookalike and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/27/facebook-custom-audiences">custom audiences</a>.</p>

<p>Though we have faced some targeting limitations as a result of Apple iOS updates, Facebook still remains one of the best PPC channels for targeted advertising. This does require changes, however, so be sure to visit our guide to Facebook ad targeting.</p>
<h3>You have flexibility with budgeting</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="/blog/ws/2019/02/19/facebook-ads-daily-vs-lifetime-budgets">Facebook offers two types of budgeting</a> to accommodate different advertising strategies. Lifetime budgets, which are good if you run ads on a schedule and/or a fixed budget and end date; and daily budgets, which are good for maximizing ongoing campaigns and pacing and planning around a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/stretch-your-marketing-budget">fluctuating budget</a>. You can also use the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/audience-overlap-tool">Audience Overlap Tool</a> to save money.</p>
<h3>It&#8217;s affordable</h3>
<p>Facebook ads are among <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/30/cost-effective-ad-types">the most cost-effective </a>ad types for any business, whether it spends $10 a day or thousands. With testing, <a href="/blog/ws/2018/09/04/facebook-retargeting">retargeting</a>, and reporting capabilities, you have the tools to make the most of every dollar you spend.</p>
<p>For context, the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-google-ads-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> average cost per click in Google Ads</a> is higher than Facebook&#8217;s at $5.26. So, while you still want to hit all<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/26/marketing-channels" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> marketing channels</a>, including search advertising, Facebook ads can help fill any gaps in your strategy at a lower and more stable cost.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Advertising on social media remains a top strategy for businesses looking to thrive despite growing competition. In fact, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-marketing-trends-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our recent small business marketing trends report</a> found that half of small businesses are planning to invest in social ads this year.</p>
<p>Those businesses are seeking advertising opportunities on key social platforms like Meta Ads, which allows them to target users on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and other Meta-owned apps.</p>
<p>So, you know you want to dedicate resources towards Facebook ads to stay competitive and effectively engage your target market. But how much will that cost you? And what can you expect in terms of results?</p>
<p>We’ve got the answers to all these questions and more in this year’s annual Facebook ads benchmarks report, analyzing data from over 1,000 campaigns to provide you with industry-specific KPIs including average cost per click (CPC), click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate (CVR), and cost per lead (CPL) for two core Facebook ads campaign objectives: traffic and leads.</p>

<div id="meta-trends"></div>
<h2>Key trends: The big picture</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-tactics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook ads</a> with a traffic objective saw strong improvement year over year, with both higher CTR and lower CPC <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ads-benchmarks-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compared to 2024</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook leads campaigns saw performance declines, with a 20% increase in CPL. However, CPC and CPL for this ad type are still significantly <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-google-ads-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower than comparable ads on Google</a>. Despite rising advertising costs and economic challenges, Facebook Lead Ads maintain a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-cost#:~:text=The%20average%20starting%20budget%20to,per%20month%20on%20Google%20Ads." target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost advantage over Google Ads</a>. This means that social ads are the perfect complement to your search strategy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook Lead Ads click-through rates increased for 9 out of 15 industries</strong>, with an overall slight increase year over year. This shows that Facebook users are still engaging with ads on the Meta platform.</li>
<li><strong>The cost per click for Facebook leads objective campaigns increased overall</strong>, but 10 out of 15 industries (67%) saw stable or decreased CPCs. Advertising costs are increasing across the board—87% of industries saw increases in CPC for Google Ads, with an overall increase of 12.88%. Lead Ads saw a slower rate of increase—only 2.13% compared to 2024. And CPC is still relatively low for Lead Ads at $1.92, compared to $5.26 in Google Ads.</li>
<li><strong>For Facebook leads campaigns, 12 out of 15 industries (80%) saw a decrease in conversion rate year over year.</strong> This follows an overall increase we saw last year. Many of the industries impacted could be seeing decreases due to the economy. For example, fewer people may be looking for entertainment, taking on home improvement projects, or investing in beauty and personal care—leading to a decrease in CVR for these industries.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook leads campaigns cost per lead increased for 9 out of 15 (60%) industries</strong>, and CPL increased 20.94% overall to $27.66. This, again, could be due to the overall increase in advertising costs we’re seeing across the board due to increased competition, privacy restrictions that impact ad targeting, and inflation. However, Lead Ads CPL is substantially lower than the average CPL of Google Ads at $70.11.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-facebook-benchmarks-yoy-1024x615.webp" alt="2025 facebook benchmarks year over year for leads campaigns" width="1024" height="615" class="aligncenter wp-image-93928 size-large" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-facebook-benchmarks-yoy-980x589.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-facebook-benchmarks-yoy-480x288.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For Facebook traffic campaigns, click-through rates increased YOY for 11 out of 22 industries</strong> (71%) after a year of increases last year as well, with an overall increase of 8.23%. This could speak to better messaging and/or targeting alignment in this category.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook traffic campaign CPCs decreased for 10 out of 21 industries</strong> (48%), with an overall cost per click of only $0.70, which is a 6.67% decrease in CPC YoY as well as much lower than the average CPC of $5.26 in Google Ads. This speaks to the effectiveness of this Facebook ads objective in driving clicks to your website.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, if you’re wondering if Facebook traffic or leads campaigns are right for your business in 2025, this data proves they can be a stable and reliable strategy in light of market fluctuations.</p>
<p>“We are finally starting to see inflation’s impact on campaign metrics. Although CPC, CVR, and CPL have all taken a hit this year, CTR improving in spite of higher costs means that consumers are continuing to engage with advertising, which is a good sign for businesses having to front more marketing dollars behind their campaigns,” said Tyler Mask, Director of Optimization Strategy at<a href="https://localiq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> LocaliQ</a>.</p>

<h2>Facebook ads benchmarks: Traffic campaigns</h2>
<p>Traffic campaigns are a universally popular Facebook ads objective used by small businesses because they effectively prioritize driving clicks. This Facebook objective guides your campaigns to serve your ads to audiences most likely to click.</p>
<p>Traffic to your website, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/social-media-landing-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">landing page</a>, app, or event, is half the battle when securing conversions—so traffic objective campaigns are a go-to for most advertisers on Facebook.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-fb-benchmarks-traffic-916x1024.webp" alt="2025 facebook ads benchmarks - chart of both traffic metrics" width="916" height="1024" class="aligncenter wp-image-93923 size-large" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-fb-benchmarks-traffic-scaled.webp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Click to enlarge</em></a></p>
<p>Note: Since this campaign objective is specifically designed to drive traffic, cost per lead and conversion rate metrics tend to be on the higher side. It’s important to focus on the metrics that matter most for your ad objective, so we’ve omitted those metrics here.</p>
<div id="meta-traffic-ctr"></div>
<h3>Average click-through rate for traffic campaigns</h3>
<p>Click-through rate is a core metric when it comes to traffic campaigns because, after all, they’re optimized for clicks.</p>
<p><strong>The average click-through rate in Facebook ads for traffic campaigns across all industries is 1.71%. </strong>This is higher than last year’s overall average of 1.57%.</p>

<p>The industries with the highest click-through rates were Shopping, Collectibles, and Gifts (4.13%), Travel (2.76%), and Sports and Recreation (2.60%).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the industries with the lowest click-through rates were Automotive—Repair, Services, and Parts (0.80%), Physicians and Surgeons (0.83%), and Finance and Insurance (0.98%).</p>
<p>The industries with the highest CTRs, such as Shopping, Collectibles, and Gifts, or Sports and Recreation, are typically those that offer “anytime treats.” In other words, you don’t need to be in the market to respond to these types of ads as people can be tempted into shopping or recreation anytime.</p>
<p>On the other hand, industries such as Automotive—Repair, Services, and Parts and Finance and Insurance, can’t always rely on compelling visuals to increase their Facebook ad CTRs. It’s harder to get clicks on ads for industries where only some of the audience is going to be in market. These business types need to focus on engaging ads and pairing the right copy and creative with the right audience targeting strategy to maintain competitive CTRs.</p>
<h4>Average click-through rate: YoY</h4>
<p>While the overall CTR for Facebook ads traffic campaigns increased slightly year over year, the industries that saw the biggest decreases in average CTR compared to 2024 were Real Estate (down 36%), Automotive—Repair, Services, and Parts (down 27%), and Restaurants and Food (down 25%).</p>
<p>On the opposite end, the industries that saw the biggest year-over-year increases in average CTR were Shopping, Collectibles, and Gifts (up 146%), Sports and Recreation (up 102%), and Attorneys and Legal Services (up 80%).</p>

<h3>Average cost per click for traffic campaigns</h3>
<p>Cost per click is a critical <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/19/ppc-metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PPC metric</a> for Facebook ad traffic campaigns. If you’re not maintaining a low CPC consistently, an increase in clicks due to the campaign&#8217;s behavior can accelerate your spend.</p>
<p><strong>The average cost per click in Facebook ads for traffic campaigns across all industries is $0.70. </strong>This is lower than last year’s overall CPC average of $0.77.</p>

<h3>Average cost per lead for leads campaigns</h3>

<p>Industries with the highest cost per lead were Dentists and Dental Services ($76.71), Health and Fitness ($52.98), and Beauty and Personal Care ($51.42).</p>
<p>On the other end, industries with the lowest cost per lead were Restaurants and Food ($3.16), Real Estate ($16.61), and Career and Employment ($17.64).</p>
<p>For businesses on the higher end of the CPL spectrum, like Dentists and Dental Services and Health and Fitness, people tend to spend more on these types of services. So, a higher CPL in this case correlates with higher value leads.</p>
<p>“Regardless of the advertising platform, we’re starting to see cost-related metrics rise. CPL is the main metric many businesses look to as a core KPI on Facebook, and it’s gone up by 20% this year. However, just because prices are rising doesn’t mean businesses should necessarily pare down their advertising,” Tyler said.</p>
<p>“In fact, businesses that can afford to remain in the market will become more visible, since a lot of competition tends to pull back on advertising in harsh economic times,” Tyler said.</p>
<h4>Average cost per lead: YoY</h4>
<p>The biggest cost per lead increases year over year were found in industries such as Arts and Entertainment, which increased by 242%, Dentists and Dental Services, which increased by 97%, and Industrial and Commercial, which increased by 62%.</p>

<h3>Use Advantage+ carefully (and sometimes sparingly)</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-vs-manual-settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advantage+ is a suite of AI-powered features</a> advertisers can apply to their campaigns, ad sets, and ads. Advantage+ can help streamline your ad creation and targeting. However, there are some<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> pros and cons to be aware of</a>. Using Advantage+ can sway your Facebook ads results if you’re not 100% confident in the data you feed it to help guide and optimize your campaigns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-ads-benchmarks-advantage-plus.webp" alt="meta ads benchmarks - advantage+ infopage screenshot" width="842" height="327" class="aligncenter wp-image-93946 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-ads-benchmarks-advantage-plus.webp 842w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/meta-ads-benchmarks-advantage-plus-480x186.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 842px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>“You will likely see better metrics in your Meta advertising reports with Advantage+, but who are you actually advertising to? My suggestion is to either use Advantage+ sparingly or have quality control in place to limit the amount of bots that submit forms,” said Brett McHale, founder of<a href="https://empiricmarketing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Empiric Marketing</a>.</p>
<p>For example, you could have your forms block specific email domains or phone numbers to limit lead spam and keep your lead quality high when implementing Advantage+ targeting.</p>

<h3>Focus on lead <em>quality</em> over quantity</h3>
<p>Speaking of lead quality, you’ll want your lead types to be top of mind when building out your Facebook ads campaigns. Consider your ideal audience members and tailor your ads to them specifically, rather than going after the whole crowd.</p>
<p>“The most important metric for success is who you are driving actions from, or in other words, lead quality. You have to be twice as diligent about targeting and campaign settings to ensure you are targeting the highest quality users possible,” Brett said.</p>
<p>While this tip applies across all campaign objectives, this is especially true for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook leads campaigns</a>.</p>
<p>“Traffic campaigns are getting more efficient, which is great to see, but the rise in CPL for Lead Ads shows that getting quality leads is tougher than it used to be.  It’s not just about getting clicks anymore, it’s about making sure those clicks actually convert,” said Cliff Sizemore, Senior Marketing Manager at LocaliQ.</p>
<h3>Keep your goals top of mind</h3>
<p>It can be easy to get lost in the sauce when you’re analyzing specific metrics at a granular level. However, try not to lose sight of your overall Facebook advertising goals. All of the metrics in your account paint a bigger picture of your overall account health when looked at in tandem with one another.</p>
<p>“A single metric does not necessarily determine a campaign&#8217;s success. Your business’s advertising outcomes typically depend on your overall objectives,” said Mat Wendler, Senior Manager of Optimization Strategy and Custom Solutions at LocaliQ.</p>
<p>“For instance, you could have a low cost per lead, but the number of qualified leads may still be insufficient, potentially impacting your business’s advertising results. Each metric provides information about the campaign&#8217;s performance, and it is the responsibility of the advertiser and their marketing partners to interpret their significance,” Mat said.</p>
<p>So, whether or not a specific metric is doing great or in need of improvement, try to think about how it could be related to other performance indicators and your overall account health.</p>
<p>“It’s incredibly rare that a well-tuned campaign meeting or exceeding benchmarks isn’t providing value for a business. That said, given the fact that most metrics are taking a hit this year due to economic headwinds, it’s more important than ever to scrutinize every data point and ensure marketing dollars are producing more than just good metrics,” Tyler said.</p>
<p>It’s also good to remember here that no two Facebook ad accounts are exactly alike—and what might work for one business might not for another.</p>
<p>“The metric that matters most is the one that ties directly to your goals. All others can be helpful indicators, but the one we need to prioritize over all the others is the main goal,” said Michelle Morgan, Co-Founder of <a href="https://www.paidmediapros.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paid Media Pros</a>.</p>
<p>“For those trying to generate more business sales, that ties directly to conversion rate, cost per lead, and return on ad spend. For those trying to attract and engage new audiences, that’s likely more focused on CTR and CPC. It’s all case dependent, but just because a metric is important to another business owner or marketer, doesn’t mean it needs to be a priority for you,” Michelle said.</p>
<h3>Use a mix of campaign objectives</h3>
<p>While the leads and traffic objectives are the pillars of most <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/scale-meta-ads-with-first-party-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta advertising strategies</a>, don’t forget there are a few other campaign objective options. All the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-objectives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">different Facebook ads campaign objectives</a> complement each other, so try to include a variety of campaign types in your account.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/facebook-ad-objectives-e1749239041209.webp" alt="facebook ad objectives" width="419" height="515" class="aligncenter wp-image-84952 size-full" /></p>
<p>“Facebook provides a range of advertising objectives. It is a common misconception that advertisers should focus solely on the objective aligned with their final goal. For instance, if the intended outcome is to generate leads, it may be beneficial to consider running branding and traffic campaigns in addition to a lead campaign,” Mat said.</p>
<p>“Small and medium-sized businesses might not have substantial brand recognition, which can impact their ability to attract leads right off the bat. Facebook&#8217;s platform offers tools to support both branding and lead generation within a single source,” Mat said.</p>
<p>Testing a mix of campaign objectives and ad types in your strategy also helps you balance out any performance gaps.</p>
<p>“All of these metrics play together, and you have to balance them out for your own goals. The most common misalignment I hear is expecting a high CTR and high CVR, especially for lead generation companies. You’re likely going to see decreasing CTRs (and increasing CPCs) as you focus in on your audience and improve your CVR. This is just part of the lead quality game that we all play,” Michelle said.</p>
<p>“When you’re ad copy testing and looking to drive high-quality leads, don’t be discouraged by lower CTRs. Keep things in a manageable range but be flexible with where your CTR ends up. Be willing to sacrifice a few points here and there to make it up on the back end and in your bank account,” Michelle said.</p>
<h3>Prioritize your unique value proposition in ad copy and creative</h3>
<p>You want to take users on a journey through your sales funnel when they view and interact with your ads. Focus on engaging and enriching ads that will convey your brand messaging in a unique way.</p>
<p>“It’s better to tell a good story than a perfect one. Consumer demand for authenticity is at an all-time high. As AI becomes more prevalent, it’s important to leverage it in ways to make more meaningful connections with customers. Do not use it just for the sake of using it. Consumers aren’t looking for businesses to cut corners, they are looking for value,” Tyler said.</p>
<h2>What these 2025 Facebook ads benchmarks mean for your strategy</h2>
<p>Use this industry data as a guideline to inform your strategy. These benchmarks can help you understand how your campaign performance might be pacing against your average competitor. This can be helpful when you want to make confident, data-backed marketing and advertising decisions this year and beyond.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lead generation ads are one of my favorite formats across all paid media channels. I’ve been using them ever since they launched and have seen great results for all kinds of businesses.</p>
<p>A common struggle I hear is that people can set up and launch Facebook lead generation campaigns, but they’re unsure how to optimize them afterward. While every business is different, you likely fit into one of two categories when trying to optimize your Facebook lead ads. You either want more leads or higher lead quality.</p>
<p>In this article, I’ll talk about strategies that can help you achieve whatever you’re interested in, as well as some best practices for everyone to pay attention to.</p>

<h2>How to optimize Facebook lead ads</h2>
<p>Use these five<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/24/facebook-lead-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Facebook lead ad optimization strategies</a> to help your business source more high-quality leads from<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-advertise-on-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the Meta Ads platform</a>.</p>
<div id="how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-ad-text-creative"></div>
<h3>1. Focus on your ad text and creative</h3>
<p>Before we get to the form itself, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/24/facebook-lead-ad-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your Facebook lead ad copy and creative</a> are an important starting place. This is the impression you’re going to make on your audience, and it needs to align with your optimization goal.</p>
<h4>Facebook lead ad copy and creative tips for everyone</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use highly engaging visuals</strong>: This could be for static images, carousels, or video. Make sure you’re standing out from the crowd.</li>
<li><strong>Make the most of your copy</strong>: Use emojis or numbers in text to stand out.</li>
<li><strong>Test different text lengths</strong>: All industries and customer personas are different. Some want longer copy, others want something more succinct. Test different permutations and see what works best for your folks.</li>
<li><strong>Use vibrant, contrasting colors</strong>: More often than not, the ads I see work best have some sort of high contrast in the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/website-color-scheme" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> color scheme</a>. This creates a harsh experience that can often get users to stop scrolling and see what your ad is about.</li>
<li><strong>Format creatives for each placement size</strong>: There are lots of different placements on the Meta network, and they let you upload custom creatives for each. There’s no reason you should deal with dead space around the top and bottom, or sides of your visual assets. Try <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-image-prompts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using AI to create and upload images or videos</a> that fit each dimension for each placement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Use the power of AI to optimize your Facebook lead ads</strong> with our free guide on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/ai-advertising?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_AIAdvertising_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener">key ways to use AI in Google and Facebook Ads</a>!</p>
<h4>How to adjust your Facebook assets for higher lead volume</h4>
<p>To get more form fills, you need more people clicking on your ads. To <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/14/improve-google-ads-click-through-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improve click-through rate</a>, try some of these tactics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make your ads broadly appealing</strong>: Try to strike a tone of “all are welcome.”</li>
<li><strong>Change your offer</strong>: Test different things to give away. What does your audience want the most that you’re willing to “give away”? If you’re not seeing the volume you want, you might need to have something more appealing.</li>
<li><strong>Play on your audience&#8217;s emotions</strong>: If someone is going to work with you, are they happy, sad, fearful? While I would suggest you use some level of discretion so as not to be manipulative, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using emotion</a> in ads can get users to engage and convert more.</li>
<li><strong>Use social proof or industry awards:</strong> Showcase yourself through either reviews from your customers or awards you’ve won for your business. These help you differentiate yourselves from your competition and show that others think your products or services are high value.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How to optimize your Facebook ad copy and creative for better lead quality</h4>
<p>For <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-quality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher-quality leads</a>, our tactics need to be a bit different. We still want highly attractive and engaging creatives, but there are some tweaks on the theme to attract only the right users. The biggest thing to remember with tactics to improve lead quality is that you’ll almost always see less overall lead volume, but your percentage of high-quality leads should be better, bringing up your batting average.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tell your audience who you’re a good fit for:</strong> Speak only to the users you want to engage with. If your product only works for certain groups of people, call that out. Have a minimum spend on our site that lower budget folks can’t afford? Make that known.</li>
<li><strong>Incorporate your ideal persona in creatives</strong>: Don&#8217;t stop at ad text. If you’re able to visually showcase your actual target audience, do that in the imagery.</li>
<li><strong>Change your offer to fit a narrower one</strong>: Move away from the “everyone is welcome” offer and promote something only a serious buyer would want.</li>
</ul>
<div id="how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-type"></div>
<h3>2. Choose the right form type</h3>
<p>Whenever you build a new lead gen form on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/scale-meta-ads-with-first-party-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Ads</a>, the first choice you have is what type of form you want to use. There are two choices for this: <strong>more volume</strong> and <strong>higher intent</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-type.webp" alt="how to optimize facebook lead ads - form type screenshot" width="849" height="267" class="aligncenter wp-image-92265 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-type.webp 849w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-type-480x151.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 849px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>More volume Facebook lead ad forms</h4>
<p>The “more volume” option is going to align perfectly with anyone trying to get a higher number of lead-gen forms submitted to their campaigns. This form, as Meta says, is quick to fill out and submit on a mobile device.</p>
<p>There are almost no breakpoints with these forms (the only exception would be with your question strategy, which we’ll get to in a minute). These should be free-flowing and easy to zip right through.</p>
<h4>Higher quality Facebook lead ad forms</h4>
<p>While the options for this form are almost identical to the more volume option, a &#8220;higher Intent&#8221; form adds a step in the form submission process that acts as a speed bump for the user.</p>
<p>During this review step, the user can see their information based on the answers they provided to the questions and is reminded that the information they see is going to be submitted to your business. Additionally, the user has to slide the submit arrow rather than simply clicking a Submit button. A subtle change, but a meaningful one.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form.webp" alt="optimize facebook lead ads - user answer review options" width="850" height="409" class="aligncenter wp-image-92271 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form.webp 850w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-480x231.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 850px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This review step, while fairly basic, does a good job of reminding the user what this form is for and scaring off users who are less serious about engaging with a company. Just like I warned above, you’ll likely see fewer form fills with a higher intent form type, but the users who do submit should be higher quality since they were given the option to back out and didn’t.</p>
<div id="how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-intro"></div>
<h3>3. Create a form intro section that pops</h3>
<p>The intro of a lead gen form gives even more text space for you to set the stage for your potential customers. Think of this greeting in much the same way you thought about the ad copy and creative itself.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </strong><strong>Looking for more ways to improve your Facebook lead ads?</strong> Start with an instant account report using our free <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-advertising?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FBGrader_FBGrader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Ads Grader</a>!</p>
<h4>Facebook lead ad form greeting tips for everyone</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using the ad image is fine: </strong>If you have the design capabilities and bandwidth and want to design new images for the forms, that’s great. They likely will perform really well. But I’ve been using the same image from the ads for a long time and haven’t seen any slowdown in performance because of it. We talk a lot about making sure your ads look their best in all placements, and this is one of them, but this is likely one of the few scenarios that you can let it slide.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-.webp" alt="how to optimize facebook lead ads - background image for form intro" width="711" height="361" class="aligncenter wp-image-92266 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-.webp 711w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads--480x244.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 711px, 100vw" /></li>
<li><strong>Set the stage in the greeting</strong>: Let the user know who they’re engaging with and what they’ll receive in return once they fill out the form. This should be a continuation of the messaging in your ad creative, but you get more of an opportunity to talk to your prospective customers.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ad-tips.webp" alt="how to optimize facebook lead ads - form greeting" width="705" height="501" class="aligncenter wp-image-92267 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ad-tips.webp 705w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ad-tips-480x341.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 705px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>How to make your Facebook lead ad form intro appeal to more people</h4>
<p>If you’re aiming for more volume, the best thing you can do in this section is to echo the same “all are welcome” message you used in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/03/ad-copy-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ad copy</a>.</p>
<p>That said, if you’re really trying to limit the friction in your lead gen forms, you could test not using the greeting text at all and sticking only with the image. There’s a blue toggle in the upper right of the greeting where you can turn it off, and users will go straight from the image to the form fields.</p>
<h4>How to make your form greeting attract more high-quality leads</h4>
<p>To improve lead quality, I suggest you use the greeting every time and use it to further prequalify your customers. Keep adding information that will help weed out the users who are less serious and focus only on those with higher intent.</p>
<div id="how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-question-strategy"></div>
<h3>4. Add the right questions to your form</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve got the form type down, the biggest differentiator in optimizing your Facebook lead ads is going to be the questions you add to your forms. Everything matters in this section, from the types of questions you ask to the substance of them. Note: Only ask for relevant information! No matter your end goal, keep your questions focused on data points that are most important for you to know or helpful to your sales teams. Don’t get distracted.</p>
<h4>Optimize your Facebook lead ad form questions for increased lead volume</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on the prefill questions:</strong> All questions in this section will be auto-filled by Meta if it knows the information based on someone’s profile information. By using these questions, you’ll limit the work your audience has to do to fill out the form since there’s a higher likelihood of the information populating for them in the form.</li>
<li><strong>Ask fewer questions:</strong> The fewer questions you ask (or the less amount of information you ask for), the better chance you’ll see an increase in volume. Depending on your business, you might be able to get away with only a first name and phone number or a name and email. Even a form with two fields can be valuable if you have the right follow-up in place.</li>
<li><strong>Keep the information high level:</strong> Using prefill questions can help, but the less invasive you are in the form, the more likely you are to get users to fill it out. If your sales team is willing and able to get the other needed information out of the customers on the phone, then keep it simple here and let them do their thing.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ads-contact-form.webp" alt="optimize facebook leads - contact field option" width="733" height="666" class="aligncenter wp-image-92264 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ads-contact-form.webp 733w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ads-contact-form-480x436.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 733px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Try question strategies to get higher-quality leads</h4>
<p>We’re gonna take pretty much everything from the “more volume” section here and turn it on its head.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leverage the custom questions:</strong> Make the user think about their answer and type something in, or make a choice. Everything in the questions section is going to require you to craft the question and provide the space for the answers. Or, in the case of multiple choice, you get to select the possible answers too.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ads-question-logic.webp" alt="optimize facebook lead ads - conditional logic" width="803" height="367" class="aligncenter wp-image-92268 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ads-question-logic.webp 803w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ads-question-logic-480x219.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 803px, 100vw" /></li>
<li><strong>Ask more questions:</strong> Follow the best practice of keeping all questions relevant, but ask for more in the form. Users who are less serious won’t want to take the time to answer five or more questions.</li>
<li><strong>Get the details in the form:</strong> Do the job of a salesperson. Ask about the budget, timeline, and other important details right in the form. The serious buyer knows this information is necessary for you to do your job, so they’re willing to share it.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage conditional logic:</strong> In the first image of this section, you can see there’s a toggle in the upper right for conditional logic. With this activated, you can choose how the form will react based on how the user interacts with it. You can either send them a follow-up question, complete and submit the form, or send the user to an end page and not submit the form. This lets you create an entire experience directly in the form and allows them to choose the next step.</li>
<li><strong>Give the user an out:</strong> While it might seem strange to let people opt out of submitting the form, it’s actually in your best interest. Many times, forms get opened by accident, and the user isn’t sure how they got there. In your questions, specifically multiple choice, give the option (or something similar to) “I’m not interested,” then send the user to an end screen. They’re let off the hook in a nice way, and your sales team isn’t reaching out to folks who don’t want to talk to them.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-logic.webp" alt="optimize facebook lead ads - conditional logic option" width="837" height="406" class="aligncenter wp-image-92270 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-logic.webp 837w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-logic-480x233.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 837px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="master-lead-follow-up-strategy"></div>
<h3>5. Master your lead follow up</h3>
<p>Your job isn’t finished once you receive someone’s form. It’s on<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/11/03/lead-nurturing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> your nurture sequences</a> and sales team to close the leads that are coming through from your campaigns. For this stage, we don’t really have any different strategies for volume or quality plays, but here are some overall best practices that you should be doing when you generate leads through Meta Ads.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Offer a timely follow-up:</strong> As crazy as it sounds, if you’re not following up with your lead gen form submissions within about 24-48 hours, they’re likely going to forget they interacted with you in the first place. Be sure to reach out as soon as possible to keep the user engaged with your company, whether it’s through an email nurture sequence or a sales call follow-up.</li>
<li><strong>Make the next step logical and meaningful</strong>: Speaking of that next step, make sure it’s the right fit for your initial call to action. Someone who downloaded an infographic likely doesn’t want to talk to a salesperson right away. On the flip side, someone who opted for a demo likely doesn’t want to get tons of content from you right away. Use your follow-up to further the conversation with the potential customer in a logical way; don’t jump around the funnel too much.</li>
<li><strong>Remove users after a period of time</strong>: Regardless of how interested they were when they filled out the form, there are going to be people who simply don’t want to engage anymore for one reason or another. Set up safeguards to remove people from sales call sheets and email nurtures after a certain amount of time with no activity. It’ll save your team&#8217;s time and not leave a bad taste in the potential customer’s mouth.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Optimizing your Facebook lead ads can be easier than you think</h2>
<p>No matter what your goals are, there are plenty of strategies you can use to improve the performance of your lead generation campaigns on Meta Ads. Start with the creative and work your way through the form stages to make sure you’re setting your campaigns up for success to drive more volume or higher-quality leads.

<h2>Why advertise on Facebook?</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re reading this post, chances are you&#8217;ve already made up your mind as to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/10/14/advertising-on-facebook">whether you should advertise on Facebook</a>. But in case you&#8217;re still on the fence, here are some reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build brand awareness.</strong> Unlike Google Ads, which are all text, Facebook ads allow you to use images and video, which can support your branding. And while purchase intent is not as high on Facebook as on Google, imagery gives you the power to stand out in users&#8217; feeds through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/01/13/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing">emotional marketing</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Cost-effective. </strong>Because Facebook ads offer such specific targeting, you can rest assured that you&#8217;re making the most of your ad budget.</li>
<li><strong>Versatility. </strong>Between the wide range of ad formats and the different objectives available, you can use Facebook ads to target users at every stage of your marketing funnel.</li>
<li><strong>Gain audience insights.</strong> People spend a lot of time on Facebook and use it for a number of reasons in their day-to-day lives. The data you collect through Facebook ads provides invaluable <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/17/customer-insights">customer insights</a> you can use to inform your strategy elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
<p>And if that&#8217;s not enough, here are some numbers for ya:</p>

<li>Nearly <a href="https://www.sender.net/blog/advertising-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90%</a> of businesses use Facebook advertising.</li>
<li>The average Facebook user clicks on <a href="https://adespresso.com/blog/facebook-statistics/#FacebookAdsStatistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11</a> ads per month.</li>

<h2>Facebook ad account overview</h2>
<p>When you<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/21/how-to-run-google-ads"> run Google Ads</a>, you set up a Google Ads account and then off you go, but with the Meta Business Suite, there are several different properties involved. If you&#8217;re new to Facebook advertising or Meta Business Suite in general, you&#8217;re highly susceptible to falling into a black hole of confusion surrounding which accounts you need.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the breakdown (and don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m going to walk you through setting up all of these):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meta Business Suite</strong> (formerly Facebook Business Suite) is the umbrella account that encompasses everything. It&#8217;s a free account where you can manage your Facebook and Instagram pages in one place. You can create and schedule posts, reply to messages, get insights and notifications, and more.
<ul>
<li><strong>Business Manager </strong>is now one and the same with Business Suite. It used to be the backend where you manage permissions, payments, pixels, and more things that don&#8217;t begin with a P. All of these functions are now part of Meta Business Suite, but if you really want to perform them outside of the old Business Manager interface, you can click the help button and select Switch to Business Manager.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ads Manager.</strong> This is where your ad account(s) live. If you&#8217;re an agency, you will have multiple ad accounts in one Ads Manager account. If you&#8217;re the only one managing your properties, you don&#8217;t need a Meta Business Suites/Business Manager account to use Ads Manager, but it is recommended (and it&#8217;s free, so it can&#8217;t hurt).</li>
<li><strong>Ad account. </strong>This is what you create within Ads Manager. You should only have one ad account per business (or per Facebook business Page)</li>
<li><strong>Facebook Page</strong>. You need a Facebook Page in order to advertise on Facebook, but you don&#8217;t need to be advertising on Facebook in order to create a Page. In fact, this is a staple in any organic <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">social media marketing strategy</a>. You can create a Page entirely separate from all of the above, right from your Facebook profile. Or you can create one out of Business Suite.</li>
<li><strong>Ad campaign.</strong> This is where you choose an objective. You can (and should) have multiple campaign types within one ad account.</li>
<li><strong>Ad set.</strong> This is where you determine your ad budget/<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/31/facebook-ads-bidding-strategies">bidding</a>, schedule, and audience targeting, such as by demographics, interests, age, and more. You can have multiple ad sets in one campaign.</li>
<li><strong>Ad.</strong> This is your actual copy and creative. You&#8217;ll want to have at least two ads per ad set. We&#8217;ll talk more about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/30/facebook-ads-account-structure">Facebook ad account structure</a> later on.</li>

<h2><span>How to advertise on Facebook</span></h2>
<p><span>Alright, now that we have the visual map to an actual Facebook ad, grab your charger and buckle up because it&#8217;s time for us to hit the road. Here are the steps that we&#8217;ll be covering:</span></p>

</ol>
<div id="suite"></div>
<h3><span>1. C<span>reate a Business Suite account</span></span></h3>
<p><span>To create an account, go to <a href="https://business.facebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business.facebook.com</a> and click “Create account” on the upper right. </span></p>
<p><span> <img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-meta-business-suite-account-creation.png" alt="how to advertise on facebook - meta business suite account creation" width="720" height="427" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60428" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-meta-business-suite-account-creation.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-meta-business-suite-account-creation-480x285.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></span></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll be asked to add your business name, your name, and then your business email. Upon confirming your email, your account will be set up.</p>
<p>Here is where you&#8217;ll be brought to the Meta Business Suite interface.</p>
<div id="page"></div>
<h3>2. Connect or create your Facebook Page</h3>
<p>Head down to the bottom left and click on Settings.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-suite-settings.png" alt="how to advertise on facebook - business settings" width="720" height="465" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60741" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-suite-settings.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-suite-settings-480x310.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul></ul>
<p>From there, click the second gear you see, or you might see a prompt to go to Business Settings. Both take you to the same place. Business settings is basically the legacy Business Manager.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-business-account-settings.png" alt="how to advertise on facebook - business settings" width="720" height="466" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60742" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-business-account-settings.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-business-account-settings-480x311.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You need a Facebook Page in order to advertise. On the left window, select Pages and then click Add. Here you can either add an existing Page, create a new Page, or request access to a Page (such as if you&#8217;re running ads for another business).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-add-page.png" alt="how to advertise on facebook - add facebook page" width="720" height="479" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60743" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-add-page.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-add-page-480x319.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>While you can supply the bare minimum just to get your page created, it&#8217;s best to build it out fully before you start advertising since users can navigate to your Page from your ad. Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/16/facebook-business-page">our guide to creating a Facebook Business Page</a> to set your page up in full and optimize it for marketing purposes.</p>
<div id="account"></div>
<h3>3. Create your ad account</h3>
<p>Okay, now navigate back to Ad accounts in that left-hand pane. You&#8217;ll see an option on the right to create a new ad account.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-ad-account.png" alt="how to advertise on facebook - create ad account" width="720" height="478" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60744" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-ad-account.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-ad-account-480x319.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Provide your Ad account name, time zone, and currency, then click Next. Facebook will then ask you whether the ad account is going to be used to manage ads for the business account through which you&#8217;ve created this ad account or for another business or client.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-run-facebook-ads-who-this-ad-account.png" alt="how to advertise on facebook - select account" width="303" height="355" class="aligncenter wp-image-60745" /></p>
<p>Next, you&#8217;ll be asked to add people and permissions. Select your name and give yourself full control over everything.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-full-control.png" alt="how to advertise on facebook - user permissions" width="720" height="561" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60746" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-full-control.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-full-control-480x374.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Click Assign and then click Add Payment Info. Now you have an ad account set up.</p>
<div id="pixel"></div>
<h3>4. Add the pixel to your website</h3>
<p>You don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to do this step now, but you&#8217;re going to have to do it eventually, so you may as well get it over with! The pixel is a little snippet of code that will tell you what your ad viewers do once they land on your website. Insights from the pixel help you to further optimize your ads as well as create <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/04/facebook-retargeting">Facebook retargeting audiences</a> that tend to perform well.</p>
<p><strong>Note! </strong>For a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/scale-meta-ads-with-first-party-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> strong first-party data strategy in Meta</a>, it&#8217;s highly recommended you set up the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/06/facebook-conversions-api"> Facebook Conversions API</a> as well, as this is the best way to get the most complete picture of your data possible.</p>
<p>To set up the pixel, go to Data Sources, select Pixels, and on the right, click Add.</p>

<p>Facebook will ask you whether you want to install it manually or use a partner integration.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-install-facebook-pixel-choose-method.png" alt="facebook pixel installation methods" width="720" height="457" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60437" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-install-facebook-pixel-choose-method.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-install-facebook-pixel-choose-method-480x305.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The partner integration methods are designed to make the process easier without using code, so I&#8217;d encourage you to go that route first. Current partners include:</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress</li>
<li>WooCommerce</li>
<li>Tealium</li>
<li>Shopify</li>
<li>Makeshop</li>
<li>Magento</li>
<li>Google Tag Manager</li>
<li>Conversions API Gateway</li>
<li>Cafe24</li>
<li>Zapier</li>
<li>Segment</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/facebook-conversions-api-integrations.png" alt="facebook conversions api integrations" width="720" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60439" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/facebook-conversions-api-integrations.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/facebook-conversions-api-integrations-480x313.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If the partner integration method doesn&#8217;t work or you don&#8217;t use any of those platforms, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ynTNs5FAUm8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video tutorial on setting up the Facebook pixel manually</a> from <a href="https://ivanmana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ivan Mana </a>is super helpful.</p>
<h4>Set up your web events</h4>
<p>As part of the pixel setup process, you&#8217;ll have to verify your domain and configure your web events (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/20/facebook-aggregated-event-measurement">Aggregated Event Measurement</a>). Paid Media Pros offers an <a href="https://youtu.be/6ldKyiVkT4U" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easy tutorial video for configuring your web events</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-web-event-configuration.png" alt="how to advertise on facebook - configure web events" width="720" height="529" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60452" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-web-event-configuration.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-web-event-configuration-480x353.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Note that you can always revisit the domain verification process by going to Brand Safety &gt; Domains, and revisit the event setup process by going to Events Manager.</p>

<div id="campaign"></div>
<h3>5. Create your Facebook ad campaign</h3>
<p>Now, click the hamburger menu at the top left (All tools) and select Ads Manager.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-run-facebook-ads-ads-manager.png" alt="how to advertise on facebook - ads manager" width="720" height="552" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60748" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-run-facebook-ads-ads-manager.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-run-facebook-ads-ads-manager-480x368.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>On the left, select &#8220;Create.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-create-ad.png" alt="facebook ad manager - create ad" width="720" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60454" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-create-ad.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-create-ad-480x300.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Choose your campaign objective</h3>
<p>Facebook offers six ad objectives: awareness, traffic, engagement, leads, app promotion, and sales.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/facebook-ad-objectives-e1749239041209.webp" alt="facebook ad objectives" width="419" height="515" class="aligncenter wp-image-84952 size-full" /></p>
<p>In terms of which objective to choose, it will depend on what your offer is and who you&#8217;re targeting. Ultimately, you want to have a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/21/facebook-funnel">full-funnel Facebook ad strategy</a> where you create different campaigns for each stage of your funnel.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/facebook-ad-objective-chart.webp" alt="how to advertise on facebook - facebook ad objective chart" width="708" height="270" class="aligncenter wp-image-91936 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/facebook-ad-objective-chart.webp 708w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/facebook-ad-objective-chart-480x183.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 708px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Campaign settings</h4>
<p>Next, depending on the objective you choose, you may be prompted to choose your setup type. You can either go for an automated, &#8220;recommended settings&#8221; route or a manual setup route. We break down all the differences between the two<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-vs-manual-settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Facebook ad setup options</a> here.</p>
<p>Facebook ad campaigns built using recommended settings rely on the Meta Advantage+ suite, which is a set of AI-powered ad functions that behave similarly to Smart campaigns in Google Ads.</p>
<p>There is no right or wrong answer here, as you might want to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> try an Advantage+ campaign</a> if you&#8217;re not sure where to start. Or, Advantage+ can be helpful if you&#8217;re tight on bandwidth and can&#8217;t optimize and manage your campaigns to the fullest capacity.</p>
<p>On the opposite end, you may want more manual control over specific settings, placements, and audiences, as you test and scale your strategy. It all comes down to you and your team&#8217;s preferences and goals, so don&#8217;t be afraid to try both to see what works best.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-advantage-plus.webp" alt="how to advertise on facebook - facebook ad setup" width="652" height="434" class="aligncenter wp-image-91937 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-advantage-plus.webp 652w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-advantage-plus-480x320.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 652px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you opt for manual setup, you&#8217;ll see a panel of options like this:</p>

<li><strong>Campaign details:</strong> Here you can change your objective if you need to. Under &#8220;Show more options&#8221; you can also set a campaign spending limit.</li>
<li><strong>Advantage+ Campaign Budget:</strong> With this setting turned on, instead of choosing your budget separately for each ad set within a campaign, Meta Advantage+ machine learning will decide which ad sets should<span> receive a higher percentage of the spend based on performance.</span></li>
<li><strong>A/B test: </strong>We&#8217;re going to skip this for now, but you can learn more in our guide to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/11/facebook-ab-testing">Facebook A/B testing</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Special Ad Categories:</strong> If you fall into any of those special categories, declare that here so you can take care of any further documentation you may need to provide, depending on Facebook advertising policies.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Create your Facebook ad set</h3>
<p>Now we&#8217;re in the ad set stage. There are more features and settings here, too, but here&#8217;s what matters.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance goal:</strong> Choosing a performance goal helps Meta&#8217;s algorithms know how to best serve your ad according to your desired results. This may look different for different objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Cost per result goal</strong>: If you&#8217;re familiar with search ads, think of this like a maximum CPC bid target. You&#8217;re telling Meta your desired cost per result to help it deliver your ads according to your budget goals. However, know that way over- or under-shooting here could throw off the algorithm.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Frequency control:</strong> Depending on your campaign setup, you could set a cap or target for the number of times a user sees your ad.</li>
<li><strong>Delivery.</strong> Under &#8220;more options&#8221; you may be able to edit your ad set&#8217;s delivery settings depending on your overall campaign settings. This i<span>s where you tell the algorithm what you see as success for your ad set so that Facebook can further refine who it shows your ads to.</span></li>

</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-run-facebook-ads-dynamic-ad-creative.webp" alt="how to advertise on facebook - facebook dynamic ads creative" width="648" height="154" class="aligncenter wp-image-91938 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-run-facebook-ads-dynamic-ad-creative.webp 648w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-run-facebook-ads-dynamic-ad-creative-480x114.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 648px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>Scrolling further, there are a few more settings to set at the ad set level you&#8217;ll have to select before moving on. Again, the options here will vary depending on your campaign objective, but here is a quick guide on how to choose: </span></p>
<h4>Budget &amp; schedule</h4>
<p>Here is where you choose a daily budget or a lifetime budget. You can learn about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/19/facebook-ads-daily-vs-lifetime-budgets">daily vs. lifetime budgets here</a>, but in general</p>
<p>Choose<span> <strong>daily budgets</strong><span> when:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Your campaign will be evergreen</li>
<li>You want to maximize strong performance</li>
<li>You expect to change your budget regularly</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose<span> <strong>lifetime budgets</strong><span> when:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>You need to run your ads on a schedule</li>
<li>Your campaign has a set budget and end date</li>
</ul>
<p>If you go with a daily budget, it&#8217;s best to start with something like $5-10 a day. If you set it too low, your ad may not compete as well, meaning it will show less and not collect enough data for Facebook to further optimize for the best results. More on that in this list of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/05/facebook-ad-mistakes">Facebook advertising mistakes</a>.</p>
<p>You also have the option here to set up your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/13/how-to-set-up-ad-scheduling">ad scheduling</a>, which is fairly easy on Facebook. You can tell Facebook to only run your ads when it makes sense for your business (such as only during your operating hours) or audience (such as only running your breakfast cafe ads in the morning).</p>
<h4>Audience controls</h4>
<p>In this step, you select exactly <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-targeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who you want to reach with your Facebook ad</a>, which you can define based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Interests and behaviors</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/facebook-ad-audience-settings.png" alt="facebook ad audience settings" width="600" height="890" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60751" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/facebook-ad-audience-settings.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/facebook-ad-audience-settings-480x712.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You can check out our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/13/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-world">full guide to Facebook ad targeting</a>, but here&#8217;s a quick crash course:</p>
<p>Though it has taken a bit of a hit due to privacy changes, Facebook&#8217;s targeting is still among the most powerful out there since users provide such detailed information about themselves on this platform—their age, marital status, job, interests, and more. There are four types of audiences you can target in Facebook ads.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core audiences:</strong> target users based on their demographics, interests, and behaviors.</li>
<li><strong>Custom audiences:</strong> target and retarget customers and leads. These are pixel-based.</li>
<li><strong>Lookalike audiences:</strong> target people similar to your existing customers and leads.</li>
<li><strong>Advantage+ audiences:</strong> target people who fit your chosen &#8220;audience themes&#8221; using AI.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-advantage-plus-audience-suggestions-e1749241307119.webp" alt="facebook ad targeting - advantage plus audience suggestion example" width="713" height="593" class="aligncenter wp-image-87464 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-advantage-plus-audience-suggestions-e1749241307119-713x551.webp 713w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-advantage-plus-audience-suggestions-e1749241307119-480x270.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 713px) 713px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li>For <strong>detailed targeting</strong>, you can create rules so that the ad targets users with one OR another or one AND another interest. Either way, it&#8217;s best to stick to just one or two interests or demographics per ad set. Otherwise, you won&#8217;t know what audiences are working for you. If you have more interests to target, you can always create new ad sets.</li>
<li>On the right, <strong>Audience definition</strong> will tell you how large or small your audience will be based on the criteria chosen, and <strong>Estimated daily results</strong> will tell you how many people you&#8217;re estimated to reach based on your daily spend. Keep in mind that these are just estimates and aren&#8217;t always 100% reliable, so take them with a grain of salt.</li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>

<h4>Choose your placements</h4>
<p>Now you&#8217;ll choose your placements. Placements refer to where your Facebook ad will appear on the Facebook network. Between mobile and desktop, Instagram and Facebook, there are a number of placements to choose from.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/b2b-facebook-ad-placement-priority-selection-1.png" alt="" width="650" height="377" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18759" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/b2b-facebook-ad-placement-priority-selection-1.png 650w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/b2b-facebook-ad-placement-priority-selection-1-480x278.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll have three options here: automatic, manual, or Advantage+ placements. You may be tempted to manually choose which placements you want, but if you&#8217;re just starting out, it&#8217;s best to leave it on the default, automatic placements, or choose Advantage+, and let your ad show on every possible placement to start. Then, after a week or two, you can look at which placements are performing best, switch to manual, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/08/facebook-ad-placement-optimization">optimize your placements</a> from there.</p>

<h3>7. Create your ad</h3>
<p>Now the fun part—creating your ad! The possibilities here are endless, but if you need a little inspiration, check out these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/23/facebook-ad-examples">Facebook ad examples</a>.</p>
<h4>Create your ad creative</h4>
<p>The creative refers to the visual part of your ad, and this should be the focal point of the ad. Facebook supports three ad formats: single image and video ads, carousel ads, and collection ads, and you have three creation options: use an existing post, a Creative hub mockup, or upload your own design.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/facebook-ad-setup.png" alt="facebook ad setup" width="413" height="586" class="aligncenter wp-image-60760" /></p>

<h4>Write your copy</h4>
<p>Next, it&#8217;s time for your ad copy, which consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary text:</strong> above the ad creative; only the first 125 characters show.</li>
<li><strong>Headline:</strong> just below the creative, 40 characters or less.<span> </span></li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong><span> just below the headline, 30 characters or less.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/facebook-ad-copy-ad-components.png" alt="facebook ad copy components" width="500" height="665" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55402" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/facebook-ad-copy-ad-components.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/facebook-ad-copy-ad-components-480x638.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>According to a study by <a href="https://adespresso.com/blog/we-analyzed-37259-facebook-ads-and-heres-what-we-learned/#:~:text=The%20median%20length%20for%20a,to%20the%20point%20each%20time." target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdEspresso</a>, The perfect Facebook ad headline length is five words. In terms of sentiment, split test both positive and negative <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotions</a> in your headlines. By using the same targeting, but switching up the ad copy, you’ll be able to see which emotional appeal resonates best with your audience.</p>

<h4>Choose your call to action</h4>
<p>Once you enter your ad copy, enter your website URL and choose the call to action that makes the most sense for your offer. You can always A/B test this later!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/facebook-ad-call-to-action-list.png" alt="facebook ad creation - call to action list" width="434" height="368" class="aligncenter wp-image-60761" /></p>
<h4>Confirm your tracking</h4>
<p>Last but definitely not least, make sure your website event tracking is set up (if you skipped it earlier). You&#8217;ll have the option to set up app and offline events if applicable, as well as set a unique URL parameter so you can identify visitors to your website from this ad.</p>

<div id="publish"></div>
<h3>8. Publish!</h3>
<p>That green button on the bottom right of your screen never looked so beautiful. Once you hit publish, an algorithm (and sometimes a person) will review for any <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/16/facebook-ad-not-approved">Facebook Ad disapprovals</a>, so your ad can take 24 hours (sometimes more) to get approved. Once it&#8217;s up and running, your ad will go through a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/13/learning-period">learning period</a> during which Facebook will gather the performance data it needs to optimize who it delivers the ad to and when.</p>

<h3>How does the Facebook ad auction work?</h3>
<p>The Facebook ad auction works differently from the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/14/how-does-google-ads-work">Google Ads auction</a>. The key factors involved in determining who wins the Facebook Ads auction include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your bid</li>
<li>Your ad quality and relevance</li>
<li>Your estimated action rates</li>
</ul>
<p>These qualities ultimately determine your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/14/facebook-advertising-cost"></a>Facebook cost per click, which goes a long way in determining Facebook metrics that are tied more closely to revenue, like cost per action and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/18/facebook-ads-cost-per-lead"></a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/18/facebook-ads-cost-per-lead">cost per lead</a>.</p>
<p>In order to make your ads as relevant as possible, make sure your audience is meticulously crafted, your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/best-facebook-ads"></a>Facebook ad creative and messaging resonate with said audience, and you’re rotating new ads in and out of your campaign periodically.</p>
<h3>How much do Facebook ads cost?</h3>
<p>Depending on industry, campaign objective, and other factors, the average Facebook cost per click can range anywhere from a quarter to $5. For a deeper dive, refer to our post on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/12/facebook-ads-cost">Facebook ad costs</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-advertising?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FBGrader_FBGrader"><strong><em>Use our free Facebook Ads Grader to make sure you&#8217;re not wasting any spend in your account.</em></strong></a></p>
<h3>How does Facebook remarketing work?<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/11/16/facebook-remarketing"></a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/11/16/facebook-remarketing">Facebook remarketing </a>(or retargeting) allows you to advertise to users who have already engaged with your business, such as on your website, app, Facebook Page, other Facebook ads, or even offline. You can upload lists of leads or customers to target, or the pixel and Conversions API can also help identify these users. You can even layer audiences by combining retargeting with detailed targeting.</p>
<p>However, as pixel data is less reliable due to privacy, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/06/facebook-ads-on-platform-engagement">retargeting users based on their engagement with your business on Facebook</a> itself is the way to go.</p>
<h3>How should I structure my account?</h3>
<p>For <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/13/facebook-advertising-tips">effective Facebook advertising</a>, your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/30/facebook-ads-account-structure"></a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/30/facebook-ads-account-structure">Facebook Ads account structure</a> should resemble a typical marketing funnel, with upper funnel campaigns devoted to prospecting, mid-funnel campaigns devoted to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-lookalike-audiences"></a>Facebook lookalike audiences and other audiences with mid-tier granularity, and lower-funnel campaigns devoted to highly refined Facebook remarketing audiences.</p>
<p>If you have the volume, you can also add broader Facebook lookalike audiences to your upper-funnel ad sets. And don’t forget to adjust your campaign objective based on the goal of each campaign. Your upper funnel campaigns should be geared toward driving awareness, getting clicks, and swelling your remarketing audiences, while your mid-and-lower-funnel audiences should be geared toward conversions (purchases, form fills, etc.). <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/26/how-to-optimize-facebook-ads">Head here for more Facebook ad optimization tips</a>.</p>
<h3>Why aren&#8217;t my Facebook ads working?</h3>

<li>Your targeting is too broad.</li>
<li>Your relevance score is too low.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook ads (or Meta, if you prefer) is a great platform to find your target audience, introduce them to your brand, nurture them through the funnel, and eventually make a sale. The full funnel options for this channel make it a common starting point (typically alongside Google) for many advertisers, but they also make it rife for seeing overlapping audiences and, in turn, overspending.</p>
<p>Luckily, Facebook has provided a tool within the platform to help avoid those overlapping audiences and keep our campaigns mutually exclusive. It’s not perfect. There are limitations. But it’s better than just about every other platform out there in providing insights into how your audience makeups compare</p>
<p>In this article, I’ll show you where the Facebook ads audience overlap tool lives, how it works, and give you some examples for audiences to check to make sure you’re not overspending in your account.</p>

<h2>Where to find the audience overlap tool in Facebook ads</h2>
<p>The audience overlap tool isn’t found in the regular campaign manager.</p>
<p>Instead, we need to head to the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-advertise-on-facebook">Facebook Ads</a> Audience Manager. Depending on how recently you’ve visited this page, it’ll either show up in the short list on the left, or you can find it in the larger list in the far right column.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/audience-overlap-tool-facebook-ads-png.avif" alt="how to find the facebook ads audience overlap tool" width="932" height="538" class="aligncenter wp-image-91079 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/audience-overlap-tool-facebook-ads-png.avif 932w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/audience-overlap-tool-facebook-ads-300x173.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/audience-overlap-tool-facebook-ads-768x443.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/audience-overlap-tool-facebook-ads-480x277.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 932px) 100vw, 932px" /></p>
<p>Once you’re there, the overlap tool is a little hidden.</p>
<p>First, you need to check the box next to the audiences you want to compare. Then, a series of buttons will show at the top. If you click on the three dots icon, a drop-down will show up with the<strong> show audience overlap</strong>.</p>

<h2>How to read your Facebook ads audience overlap report</h2>
<p>When you’ve selected two audiences, the overlap report will look like this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/audience-overlap-tool-audience-selection-png.avif" alt="audience overlap tool - example facebook ads audience overlap report" width="858" height="433" class="aligncenter wp-image-91082 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/audience-overlap-tool-audience-selection-png.avif 858w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/audience-overlap-tool-audience-selection-300x151.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/audience-overlap-tool-audience-selection-768x388.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/audience-overlap-tool-audience-selection-480x242.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 858px) 100vw, 858px" /></p>
<p>The first audience you checked the box next to will be called your selected audience and will be found in the top box. There, you’ll see the audience size, and there will always be a complete circle as the audience isn’t overlapping with anything.</p>
<p>The second audience you selected will be in the comparison audiences box. You’ll be able to see the original size of the audience below the audience name, then off to the right, you’ll see a Venn Diagram of how that audience and your selected audience overlap. Lastly, there’s the number of users in the overlapping portion, meaning those that show up in both audiences, as well as a percentage of the selected audience that is also found in the comparison audience.</p>
<p>For the example above, about 7.9M users from the comparison audience are also in the selected audience, for a 12% overlap of the comparison audience.</p>
<p>While that might not sound like too much by itself, if we flip the audiences and put the smaller audience in the selected audience position, we now have a 99% overlap rate since 7.9M users are nearly all of the 8M users from the smaller audience.</p>

<div id="audience-overlap-tool-problem-scenarios"></div>
<h2>When audience overlap in Facebook ads can be a problem</h2>
<p>Audience overlap isn’t inherently bad. If you’re trying to hone in on a group of users because they’re the right fit for your company and you’re trying to reach them in multiple different ways, you’re likely going to have at least a little overlap.</p>
<p>The problem comes in when you’re using these audiences for targeting and not accommodating the overlap.</p>
<p>If you have audiences with overlapping users added to multiple different ad sets or campaigns, those users could be served ads from each of those places where they’re targeted. Since the budget controls live at either the ad set or campaign level in Facebook, depending on which you’re using, that means you could be spending ad funds on the same users just in different ad sets or campaigns.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Is audience overlap stopping you from getting ahead of competitors?</strong> Find out how your account performance compares to averages in your industry using our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/facebook-benchmarks?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_FBAdsBenchmarks2024_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free Facebook Ads Benchmarks Report</a>!</p>
<div id="audience-overlap-tool-avoid-overspending"></div>
<h2>3 ways to use the audience overlap tool to avoid overspending</h2>
<p>In the example above, nearly all of the users from the smaller audience are also in the larger audience. So if you targeted both audiences and didn’t have any exclusions in place, you would be targeting that smaller audience in both ad sets or campaigns that it was running in, meaning you would be spending money on it in two different places.</p>
<p>To avoid this, there are a couple of things you could do to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/scale-meta-ads-with-first-party-data"> optimize your Facebook ads targeting strategy</a>.</p>
<h3>1. Don’t target the smaller audience</h3>
<p>The first option is simply not to target the smaller audience. If you’re willing to sacrifice the 96,000 users in the smaller list and leave them untargeted, then we solve the problem of overlap.</p>
<h3>2. Try targeting both audiences together in the same ad set</h3>
<p>If you target both audiences in the same ad set, then the budget allocated to those users comes from the same pool. Each time your account is eligible for one of those users in the auction, the spend will only come from this one ad set, meaning you’re not going to be spending on those users in more than one place, which avoids the main issue.</p>
<h3>3. Create meaningful exclusions</h3>
<p>The last strategy is to use exclusion audiences to help shape your targeting.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/audience-overlap-tool-custom-audiences-png.avif" alt="facebook ads audience overlap tool - example of excluding facebook ads audiences" width="971" height="297" class="aligncenter wp-image-91080 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/audience-overlap-tool-custom-audiences-png.avif 971w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/audience-overlap-tool-custom-audiences-300x92.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/audience-overlap-tool-custom-audiences-768x235.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/audience-overlap-tool-custom-audiences-480x147.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 971px) 100vw, 971px" /></p>
<p>For this strategy, you have to be careful of how you use your exclusions and only exclude one way to make sure you don’t end up negating the overlapping portion.</p>
<p>For this group, I would target the large audience in an ad set and exclude the smaller audience from it. This means the large audience will target its original 66.9M users and<em> not</em> the 7.9M users who were in the overlapping section.</p>
<p>The second ad set would target only the smaller audience and not have any exclusions since there would now be no overlap with the larger audience.</p>
<p>The group of users found in both audiences would only show in the smaller audience ad set and would be excluded from the larger group, meaning it would only be targeted in one of the ad sets.</p>
<div id="audience-overlap-tool-limitations"></div>
<h2>Audience overlap tool limitations to be aware of</h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, this tool isn’t perfect and does have some limitations.</p>
<p>While you can use the audience overlap tool for any type of audience you create (meaning lookalikes, customer lists, and saved audiences are all up for grabs), you can only see the overlap for audiences with at least 10,000 Accounts Center accounts.</p>
<p>If your audiences are too small, you’ll see a message in the report that looks like this.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/audience-overlap-tool-limitations-png.avif" alt="audience overlap tool limitations in facebook ads" width="757" height="400" class="aligncenter wp-image-91078 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/audience-overlap-tool-limitations-png.avif 757w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/audience-overlap-tool-limitations-300x159.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/audience-overlap-tool-limitations-480x254.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 757px) 100vw, 757px" /></p>
<p>This message also gives a little further limitation. For privacy considerations, if the overlap between two audiences is lower than 1,000, even if the audiences have 10,000 matched Accounts Center accounts, you won’t be able to see the overlap.</p>
<p>If your audiences are on the larger side, this likely won’t be an issue.</p>
<p>For advertisers trying to be very specific with their targeting and using smaller audiences, this can be frustrating. Without the insights into overlap, you won’t know for sure how many users are in both of your audiences.</p>
<p>Looking on the bright side, though, the tactics for targeting to avoid overlap listed above will still apply. You won’t know the true overlap portion, but the exclusions will still help narrow your groups as needed.</p>
<h2>Make informed targeting decisions with the Facebook ads audience overlap tool</h2>
<p>The Facebook audience overlap tool can be a great tool to see where you’re potentially spending double funds to reach the same users and wisely create mutually exclusive targets, but it does have some limitations. Next time you’re<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-advertise-on-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> building out your campaigns</a>, be sure to check and see where you could be multi-targeting your users and create a strategy to ensure you’re not overspending on the same users.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We can all agree that Meta advertising isn’t what it used to be. Sure, things seemed better in 2024 than in 2023, but I wouldn’t say we’re running at 100%.</p>
<p>Privacy regulations like GDPR, iOS updates, and the slow dissolution of third-party cookies really threw a wrench into ad tracking. The Facebook Pixel doesn’t deliver nearly the same results as it once did and honestly, some days it feels like Meta is just shooting itself in the foot. Heck, there was an <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2024/12/11/instagram-facebook-whatsapp-down-outage/76923908007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outage</a> at the busiest time of the year!</p>
<p>We also have to add that Meta isn’t the blue ocean it once was. With millions of advertisers now on the platform, costs <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ads-benchmarks-2024">have surged </a>to 20-year highs and every click and conversion eats into your budget way more than it used to. It’s no wonder we see platforms like Applovin and TikTok Shops becoming the new ‘it’ things.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/tiktok-shops-growth-png.webp" alt="tiktok social commerce growth from 2020-2026" width="950" height="912" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89904" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/tiktok-shops-growth-png.webp 950w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/tiktok-shops-growth-480x461.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 950px, 100vw" /></p>

<p>All that being said (and you might be surprised at this) <strong>I still believe Meta is the place to be for ecommerce advertisers</strong>.</p>
<p>Why? Because the people are there, they are buying, and with the right targeting, you can still reach them in a cost-effective way.</p>
<p>But you have to go beyond what Meta is offering.</p>
<p>You have to invest in first-party data and visitor identification. This data will help you build smarter audiences, lower your ad costs, and get back to the results you once had. In this article, I&#8217;ll walk through how to do just that.</p>

<h2>What is visitor identification? (And why you’re probably not using it)</h2>
<p>Let’s get into it, starting with the concept of visitor identification.</p>
<p>If you’re like most advertisers, <a href="https://customers.ai/website-visitor-identification" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visitor identification</a> might not sound familiar (or like something only enterprise brands have figured out). You also may not realize that it’s everywhere. In all likelihood, you’ve seen it without even knowing!</p>
<p>To break it down, visitor identification is exactly what it sounds like: Someone visits your website, and you identify them. We’re talking names, emails, job titles, addresses, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s how it works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A website identity pixel identifies your anonymous visitors and matches them to a profile in a database.</li>
<li>The visitor contact data is enriched with personal information and the pixel starts tracking visitor behavior (think customer journey tracking).</li>
<li>This data is then sent to platforms like Meta, Google, and/or Klaviyo, giving you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/12/first-party-data">first-party data</a> to fuel your CRM, ad audiences, and email flows.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/how-visitor-identification-works-png.webp" alt="how visitor identification works in meta ads" width="936" height="718" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89886" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/how-visitor-identification-works-png.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/how-visitor-identification-works-480x368.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>

<div id="why-does-visitor-id-work-for-meta-ads"></div>
<h2>Why does visitor identification matter for Meta ads?</h2>
<p>For starters, these are people who visit your site but don’t make a purchase, fill out a form, or even click a button. These are the 98% of <a href="https://customers.ai/blog/anonymous-website-visitors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anonymous visitors</a> you never would be able to identify otherwise.</p>
<p>With visitor identification, you can. You get first-party, person-level data without pop-ups, cookies, or other invasive tools.</p>
<p>You also get data that allows you to create really targeted and high-intent audiences. <em>This</em> is how you build and scale your Meta ads strategy.</p>
<div id="how-to-use-visitor-id-to-scale-meta-ads"></div>
<h2>How to use visitor identification to scale your Meta ads</h2>
<p>Scaling Meta ads can be downright frustrating. As soon as you increase your ad spend, costs seem to spike even faster. In fact, to increase your reach by 2.5X, you might have to boost your budget by <a href="https://popsixle.com/articles-podcasts/avoiding-costly-mistakes-when-scaling-meta-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five times or more</a>.</p>
<p>Why? Meta’s auction system isn’t exactly forgiving.</p>
<p>When you try to scale, you’re competing harder for the same audience. That means you’re paying more for every click, impression, and conversion.</p>
<p>But what if you didn’t have to compete for your audience? What if you kept building an audience of people who were genuinely interested in what you had to offer? That would scale.</p>
<p>So let’s look at how to scale your Meta Ads with a custom-built first-party audience.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Restore your lost signals</h3>
<p>When we talk about using first-party data to scale Meta ads, we have to start with server-side tracking. And in this case, we have to talk about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/06/facebook-conversions-api">CAPI</a>, or Meta’s Conversion API.</p>
<p>CAPI is essential to Meta Ads as it restores those lost audience signals that used to drive our crazy cheap numbers. You know, the signals it used to get from browser-based tracking.</p>
<p>CAPI sends event data like purchases, page views, add-to-cart actions, and more directly from your website to Meta.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/meta-conversion-api-events-png.webp" alt="meta conversion api events" width="936" height="596" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89887" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/meta-conversion-api-events-png.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/meta-conversion-api-events-480x306.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This data is then used to determine your <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/765081237991954" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Event Match Quality (EMQ) score</a>, a number that many advertisers haven’t even heard of.</p>
<p>The problem with that? Your EMQ score actually impacts costs!</p>
<p>The better your EMQ, the better rates you get. The lower your EMQ? Well, we like to call it the Meta tax.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/improved-event-match-quality-png.webp" alt="benefits of improved event match quality" width="936" height="466" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89889" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/improved-event-match-quality-png.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/improved-event-match-quality-480x239.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>By sending your first-party data through CAPI, you give Meta the data it needs to understand who your audience is, what they want, and you can avoid the Meta tax.</p>
<p>Check this out.</p>
<p>DV8 Offroad, an off-road parts retailer, was previously relying on the standard Facebook tools to run their campaigns.</p>
<p>What happened when they started sending Meta the first-party data they identified through visitor identification? They added an additional 23K visitors to their Meta ad audiences and decreased CPAs by 30%.</p>
<p><em>That</em> is how you scale your ads.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f3af.png" alt="🎯" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Need targeting help?</strong> Get the guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteFBAdTargeting.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_FacebookAdTargetingStrategiesForPrivacy_Download">10 Facebook Ad Targeting Strategies That Work In a Privacy-First World</a></p>
<h3>Step 2: Segment smarter with first-party data</h3>
<p>Alright, so you’ve restored your signals with server-side tracking. Step 1 down.</p>
<p>Now what?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to kick things up a notch by using your first-party data to segment and build strong audiences.</p>
<p>I think we can all agree that generic targeting is so last decade. If you want to see real results, you need to get personal and that means more granular <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/04/customer-segmentation-models" target="_blank" rel="noopener">audience segmentation</a>.</p>
<p>It means going beyond basic demographics and building custom audiences based on real behaviors and interests.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/meta-custom-audiences-example-png.webp" alt="meta ads custom audiences example" width="936" height="494" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89890" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/meta-custom-audiences-example-png.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/meta-custom-audiences-example-480x253.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It also means using your visitor identification data.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the deal:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Collect behavioral data:</strong> With your website identity pixel in place, you can see exactly what your visitors are up to—what pages they&#8217;re browsing, which products they&#8217;re eyeing, how long they&#8217;re sticking around, etc.</li>
<li><strong> Enrich that data:</strong> Don&#8217;t just stop at top-funnel-level info like name, email, address, page views, etc. Match this visitor data with profiles in your CRM to get a fuller picture. Think past purchases, browsing habits, and even specific interests.</li>
<li><strong> Build custom audiences:</strong> Now, take all that juicy data and feed it back into Meta. Create hyper-targeted audiences like:
<ul>
<li>Folks who visited a particular product page but didn&#8217;t add anything to the cart.</li>
<li>Customers who bought one item and might be interested in something complementary.</li>
<li>Visitors who lingered on your pricing page but didn&#8217;t take the plunge.</li>
<li>People who live in a specific region and have an income over $250K.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/04/facebook-retargeting">retargeting</a> gold!</p>
<p>These types of custom audiences allow you to scale because you’re not wasting spend on broad, low-intent targeting.</p>
<p>Instead, you’re giving Meta a list of people who are most likely to convert. As a result, your ads are more relevant, engagement goes up, and your cost per conversion goes down.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<h3>Step 3: Use BOFU-powered TOFU campaigns</h3>
<p>There are several types of ad objectives you can choose from on Meta and each comes with its own price tag. Some are downright pricey, while others are far more budget-friendly.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick rundown of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-objectives">common campaign types</a>, ranked from most expensive to least expensive:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Conversions:</strong> The holy grail for advertisers but also the priciest. You’re asking Meta to find people most likely to take a specific action, like purchasing.</li>
<li><strong>Leads:</strong> Slightly cheaper than conversions but still costly since you’re targeting users ready to share their info.</li>
<li><strong>App installs:</strong> Costs vary but they’re often in the mid-range depending on the audience and app.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement:</strong> These campaigns are focused on likes, shares, and comments, and come in at a lower price point.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic:</strong> The least expensive by far. These campaigns drive clicks and page visits without requiring high-intent actions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, advertisers have traditionally had to weigh their objective options carefully. Do you sink your budget into high-cost conversion campaigns or spread it across cheaper objectives, knowing that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/04/facebook-traffic-ads">traffic campaigns</a> alone don’t guarantee sales?</p>
<p>Honestly, it’s one of the most challenging parts of running Meta Ads.</p>
<p>It’s also where visitor identification comes in and changes the whole game.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s how it works:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Run traffic-focused campaigns to attract a large volume of visitors at a lower cost.</li>
<li>Use your website identity pixel to track those visitors and collect first-party data.</li>
<li>Segment the audience based on behavior (e.g., product page viewers, cart abandoners, or blog readers).</li>
<li>Retarget them with high-intent BOFU (bottom-of-funnel) campaigns designed to convert.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s the beauty of this approach: You can put more of your budget into general traffic campaigns (you know, the cheapest option) because now, you’re able to identify those visitors after they land on your site.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/benefits-of-traffic-campaigns-with-visitor-identification-png.webp" alt="benefits of traffic campaigns with visitor identification" width="936" height="522" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89891" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/benefits-of-traffic-campaigns-with-visitor-identification-png.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/benefits-of-traffic-campaigns-with-visitor-identification-480x268.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And instead of paying extra to target high-intent users upfront, you’re leveraging affordable TOFU (top-of-funnel) traffic and converting them later through retargeting.</p>
<p>By shifting more of your budget to low-cost objectives like traffic campaigns, you can bring in a massive volume of potential customers, identify who they are, and re-engage them with targeted BOFU ads that drive actual conversions.</p>
<p>It’s efficient, it’s effective, and you won’t blow through your budget. It’s how you scale without breaking the bank.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>What results can you expect from Facebook Ads?</strong> Download our latest <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-advertising?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FBGrader_FBGrader">Facebook Ads Benchmarks</a> to find out!</p>

<h2>Practical tips to start scaling your Facebook ads with visitor identification</h2>
<p>Ready to scale your Meta ads with visitor identification and first-party data? Awesome.</p>
<p>Let’s break it down step by step so you can get rolling without overcomplicating things.</p>
<h3>1. Implement a website identity pixel</h3>
<p>First things first, you need to install a website identity pixel. This tiny piece of code is the foundation of your visitor identification strategy.</p>
<p>It tracks who’s visiting your site, what they’re doing, and feeds that data back to you in real-time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure it’s installed on every page of your site for maximum coverage.</li>
<li>Use <a href="http://customers.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a tool</a> that matches and enriches visitor data to actual profiles, including names, emails, and more.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Set up server-side tracking with CAPI</h3>
<p>We talked about this earlier but it’s worth repeating: Server-side tracking (CAPI) is a must if you want to scale. It restores your lost tracking signals and ensures Meta can optimize your campaigns effectively.</p>
<ul>
<li>Work with your web team or a developer to configure CAPI correctly.</li>
<li>Test your setup thoroughly to ensure data is flowing smoothly to Meta.</li>
<li>Monitor the results in Ads Manager to confirm better attribution and performance.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Use first-party data to build high-intent audiences in Meta</h3>
<p>Leverage your first-party data to build audiences that actually convert.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Segment your visitors:</strong> Use behavior-based data to create audiences like:
<ul>
<li>Product page viewers who didn’t add to cart.</li>
<li>Cart abandoners who didn’t complete checkout.</li>
<li>Returning visitors who haven’t purchased yet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sync your data:</strong> Feed your enriched audience data into Meta’s custom audiences to create campaigns tailored to specific behaviors and interests.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on intent:</strong> Use this data to build retargeting campaigns that speak directly to high-intent visitors, offering the right incentives to push them toward conversion.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Run test campaigns to validate the results</h3>
<p>Before you try and scale to the moon, start small. Run test campaigns to see how your new first-party data strategies perform.</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch traffic-focused campaigns and monitor how many visitors you can identify.</li>
<li>Use retargeting flows to measure conversion rates and adjust as needed.</li>
<li>Analyze the cost per result compared to traditional targeting methods.</li>
</ul>
<p>We suggest actually running your campaigns at the same time.</p>
<p>For example, run the same exact campaign&#8211;one with your traditional audience and the other with your custom-built first-party audience. This will give you a much clearer picture of if your new audience is working.</p>
<p>Here’s a sneak peek of what we saw when testing the Facebook audience against our custom audience:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/facebook-audience-vs-custom-audience-performance-png.webp" alt="facebook audience vs custom audience performance comparison" width="936" height="430" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89892" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/facebook-audience-vs-custom-audience-performance-png.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/facebook-audience-vs-custom-audience-performance-480x221.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>Reach the right audience on Meta with these tips</h2>
<p>At the end of the day, if you want to scale your Meta ads and retarget like it’s 2019 again, visitor identification and first-party data are what you need.</p>
<p>So take a step back and audit your current setup. Are you collecting the right data? Are you using that data? Do you have the ability to scale?</p>
<p>If not, now’s the time to make changes.</p>
<p>With visitor ID and first-party data, you can build campaigns that reach the right people, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/why-google-ad-costs-are-rising-in-2025">lower your costs</a>, and scale just like the old days. So good luck and cheers to a scalable future!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can’t say that I expect 2025 to be a paradigm shift for advertising on Meta (Facebook and Instagram), but I do think there are lots of things advertisers will need to pay attention to and test if they want to see success and stay ahead of the competition.</p>
<p>While there are plenty of long-lived strategies that will still do well this year, holding onto legacy tactics without expanding into new ones will likely cause pain in the future as Meta moves into a more fully automated platform. So with that said, here are the main Facebook advertising trends I think you need to prepare for in 2025.</p>

<h2>Facebook ad trends for 2025 every business should know</h2>
<p>Here are this year&#8217;s top<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2024-facebook-ads-trends" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Facebook ad trends</a> and how you can act on them in your account.</p>
<div id="facebook-ad-trends-creative"></div>
<h3>1. Highly optimized ad creative will be a must</h3>
<p>Facebook and Instagram are extremely visual platforms. Whether it’s a static image or short-form video, the quality of your ad creative is going to matter more and more as time goes on. Users are more savvy than ever and expect a level of quality that’s continuously increasing.</p>
<p>So what does that mean for you?</p>
<p>While this is still one of the heaviest lifts in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/18/social-media-advertising" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media advertising</a>, there are tons of tools out there ready and eager to help you make beautiful creative with much less time and, maybe more importantly, less design talent.</p>
<p>Facebook already offers many <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1295976920753603" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tools to optimize your creatives for each placement</a> across the network as well as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/Introducing-Enhanced-Gen-AI-Features-and-Other-Tools-to-Help-Build-Your-Business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generative AI features to create new images</a> for you based on your existing assets. It can even write your ad copy text for you based on some simple inputs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/facebook-ad-trends-image-generation.webp" alt="facebook ad trends - creative generation options" width="785" height="360" class="aligncenter wp-image-88836 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/facebook-ad-trends-image-generation.webp 785w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/facebook-ad-trends-image-generation-480x220.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 785px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There are also plenty of<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/24/design-facebook-ads-free" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> creative tools outside of the Meta ecosystem</a> designed to make ad creation extremely simple.</p>
<p>Personally, I love <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-use-canva/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canva</a>. The platform is extremely user-friendly and operates in a drag-and-drop fashion, so no high-level technical know-how is needed.

<h3>2. Businesses will prioritize expanding and diversifying their ad creative formats</h3>
<p>With some of the tools I mentioned above, it’s incredibly easy to develop new image ads for Facebook and Instagram campaigns, but moving into 2025, it’s becoming more and more important for businesses to expand into other types of creatives. For example, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/08/facebook-video-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook video ads</a> should be a priority for your business this year.</p>
<p>Video assets have been a hot topic for the last few years with the rise of TikTok and shorter-form videos. (Sorry Vine, you were just too early.) That type of content is also great to leverage in your marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>Here are a few stats about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/08/video-marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video marketing from our post</a> at the beginning of 2024 that I think are still highly relevant today:</p>
<ul>
<li>People watch an average of 16 hours of online video per week, which is a<a href="https://cxl.com/blog/optimize-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 52%</a> increase in the last two years.</li>
<li><a href="https://cxl.com/blog/optimize-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">86%</a> of people would like to see more videos from brands.</li>
<li><a href="http://tubularinsights.com/sponsored-content-q2-2017-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">64%</a> of consumers make a purchase after watching branded social videos.</li>
<li><a href="https://designshack.net/articles/trends/video-marketing-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">68%</a> of consumers prefer watching videos to learn about new products or services compared to articles, infographics, ebooks, and presentations.</li>
<li>Facebook video ad conversion rates are highest for videos <a href="https://www.falcon.io/insights-hub/topics/social-media-strategy/facebook-video-ads-best-practices-for-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">16-20 seconds</a> in duration.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Users will be looking for an experience when interacting with Facebook ads</h3>
<p>Facebook has many ad formats that let brands customize the experience so much that sending the user to their landing page is almost unnecessary. These ad formats can contain an entire brand experience, customizable to your brand guidelines, and create a seamless experience for the customer.</p>
<h4>Lead generation forms</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-generation-ideas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lead gen forms</a> are continuing to get more sophisticated. You can now leverage the conditional logic setting and map out entire intake flows with potential customers.</p>
<p>In the image below, you can see a multiple-choice question that has two separate answers: yes or no. Based on the answer the user gives, the Logic column dictates what happens. For yes, the person is sent to the lead thank you page, and the information is submitted to the company. For no, the user is taken to a Non-Lead Page and the information is not submitted.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/facebook-ad-trends-conditional-logic.webp" alt="facebook ad trends - lead ad form buildout example" width="754" height="524" class="aligncenter wp-image-88839 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/facebook-ad-trends-conditional-logic.webp 754w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/facebook-ad-trends-conditional-logic-480x334.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 754px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But you could go one step further. The Logic setting for each answer lets you send a user to a final page, either submitting or not submitting your information, or there’s an option for follow-up questions. Depending on how your sales team normally does customer intake, you could use lead generation forms to gather that information before they even submit their form.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/facebook-ad-trends-forms.webp" alt="facebook ad trends - conditional logic" width="726" height="289" class="aligncenter wp-image-88840 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/facebook-ad-trends-forms.webp 726w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/facebook-ad-trends-forms-480x191.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 726px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Instant Experience</h4>
<p>If your website is slow or if you’re not seeing strong conversion rates on the landing page, you could try Instant Experiences to curate a pseudo-mini site to engage with potential customers.</p>
<p>You can select a template or create your own Instant Experience ad from scratch.</p>

<p>From there, you get to add text, images, videos, calls to action, and more to customize the experience. You can even tie this into a product catalog and let users shop directly on Facebook.</p>

<p><strong>Takeaways for 2025:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prioritize creating short, engaging videos that capture attention in the first few seconds.<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/22/instagram-reels-ideas-for-businesses" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Reels</a> and Stories are ideal formats for this type of content.</li>
<li>Utilize vertical video formats that are optimized for mobile viewing, ensuring a seamless and immersive user experience.</li>
<li>Incorporate <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">strong calls-to-action</a> (CTAs) early in videos to drive conversions.</li>
<li>Leverage Facebook native ad formats like Instant Experiences, lead gen forms, Messenger, and WhatsApp to create customized experiences.</li>
<li>Create ads that encourage direct interaction—whether that’s answering questions, booking appointments, or offering personalized product recommendations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. More data becoming available to advertisers could increase campaign performance</h3>
<p>With increasingly more machine learning making its way into Facebook ads, it’s important to remember a simple principle: good data in, good data out.</p>
<p>The language might not be a 100% perfect match, but the theory holds when trying to get the most from a machine. The better inputs you give, the better outputs you’ll get.</p>
<p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-advertise-on-facebook">Facebook ads</a>, the main way I see this impacting advertisers is by not having enough conversion data in place to see good results.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-learning-phase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learning phase</a> is the period of time between when an ad creative was launched and when it has gathered enough conversion actions to be fully optimized. Many times, I see accounts stuck in the learning phase because they simply can’t gain enough conversion actions to see success.</p>
<p>For a general rule, I like to stick with 30 conversions in 30 days, or averaging 1 conversion per day to exit the learning phase and give Meta’s algorithms enough to go on, but in some instances, as you see above, that still might not be enough.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaways for 2025:</strong></p>
<p>If you’re stuck in the learning phase or you’re not gaining enough conversions for the action you want, here are some things to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Test using a conversion action a little further up the funnel. Not getting enough sales? Test Add to Cart. Not getting enough Lead Forms submitted, test using on-page engagement stats instead.</li>
<li>Expand your audience to reach a wider group of people. We’ll cover more on audience soon, but this can be a limiting factor in getting enough conversion volume. I cover all the latest <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-targeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook ad targeting options</a> you could try here.</li>
<li>Think about increasing your budget. I know, I hate this advice too, but if you don’t have at least enough ad spend to support two-to-three conversions per day, you’re likely not going to have enough volume to see efficient ad service. You can estimate realistic <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/12/facebook-ads-cost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook ad costs for your industry</a> using our latest <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ads-benchmarks-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook ads benchmarks report</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div id="facebook-ad-trends-advantage-audience"></div>
<h3>5. Audience intelligence will be embraced</h3>
<p>Whether we like it or not, Facebook is getting pretty good at knowing who our audience is without us needing to tell them too much. This insight can really take your advertising to the next level if you, again, feed the machine properly.</p>
<p>For those of you holding on tightly to the old way of targeting psychographics, it might be time to make a change.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaways for 2025:</strong></p>
<p>In 2025, I think we’re best served by leveraging the machines and advertiser inputs for the best results.</p>
<p>Here are a handful of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/scale-meta-ads-with-first-party-data">targeting tactics</a> I suggest you test out in 2025:</p>
<h4>Advantage+ audience with audience suggestion</h4>
<p>When you use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Advantage+ audiences</a>, Facebook gives you the option to add a suggested audience to target. This will open the same builder it would for you when you create your audience manually.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/facebook-ads-trends-advantage-audience-suggestion.webp" alt="facebook ads trends - advantage audience" width="804" height="350" class="aligncenter wp-image-88834 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/facebook-ads-trends-advantage-audience-suggestion.webp 804w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/facebook-ads-trends-advantage-audience-suggestion-480x209.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 804px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The algorithm will then start to target your suggested audience first, then reach out beyond once it sees decent results or has exhausted your list. Personally, this is the tactic I use for accounts with a low-to-medium amount of conversion volume as my inputs help Facebook figure out who we should be reaching, then give them the option to reach beyond that as needed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/facebook-ads-trends-advantage-audience-expansion.webp" alt="facebook ad trends - suggested audience example" width="803" height="416" class="aligncenter wp-image-88837 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/facebook-ads-trends-advantage-audience-expansion.webp 803w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/facebook-ads-trends-advantage-audience-expansion-480x249.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 803px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Super-lookalike audiences</h4>
<p>Lookalike audiences have always been a great targeting option on Facebook, but the account strategy we used to use where each lookalike audience is assigned to its own ad group is getting less efficient over time.</p>
<p>If you’re seeing diminishing returns from lookalikes, test adding multiple lookalike audiences to the same ad set and see how they do in combination with each other.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/facebook-ads-trends-lookalike-audience.webp" alt="facebook ads trends - lookalike example" width="829" height="547" class="aligncenter wp-image-88835 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/facebook-ads-trends-lookalike-audience.webp 829w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/facebook-ads-trends-lookalike-audience-480x317.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 829px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>The future of Facebook ads in 2025</h2>
<p>Facebook ads has been seeing lots of change over the last few years and won’t slow down in 2025. These Facebook ad trends indicate that to continue to see strong performance from your campaigns, you’ll need to expand your usage of the platform’s automation and test new creative and audience solutions.</p>
<p>As Meta continues to refine its advertising tools and features, businesses that prioritize <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/personalized-marketing">personalization</a>, authenticity, and meaningful engagement will be best positioned for success. If you want help succeeding at just that, see how<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/marketing-services?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Demo_Blog_Demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> our solutions</a> can position your brand ahead of the competition on Facebook and maximize your campaign performance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to Facebook advertising, AI is nothing new. Meta has been using AI for some time now. But with Meta Advantage+, it’s putting more focus on AI-driven campaigns. Meta has been not only encouraging users to adopt these AI features into their advertising strategies but also making it extremely difficult not to use these features and to set up campaigns and ad sets the old-fashioned way.</p>
<p>So the question is, do Advantage+ settings work better than a manually created campaign by a marketing expert? What exactly is this “AI” that we’re being told is the next big thing? In this article, I will answer these questions and more.</p>

<div id="what-is-meta-advantage"></div>
<h2>What is Meta Advantage+?</h2>
<p>The Meta Advantage+ suite is the core of all<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/03/how-to-advertise-on-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Facebook ads</a> AI capabilities. Meta Advantage+ tools and features are AI-powered solutions designed to execute specific Facebook ad campaign strategies and tactics more efficiently. I wrote about the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pros and cons of using Meta Advantage+ here</a>.</p>
<p>The largest takeaway, from my perspective, is that you are handing over the keys to your paid advertising to a machine-learning tool with limited visibility into how that thing really works. The results my clients have experienced from these new AI-driven tools have been less than stellar. Allow me to elaborate in the next section.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Could using Meta Advantage+ help or hurt your business&#8217;s Facebook ad account?</strong> Find out, and see how your current strategy is working with our free <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-advertising?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FBGrader_FBGrader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Ads Grader</a>!</p>
<div id="how-to-use-meta-advantage"></div>
<h2>Using Meta Advantage+: A case study</h2>
<p>I have a client who drives a lot of business through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/15/meta-ads-vs-google-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Ads</a> and is always looking for ways in which we can expand and continue to scale. The option to begin incorporating Advantage+ campaign settings was an obvious next step as the entire platform is actively encouraging you to use these features.</p>
<p>Instead of using the typical <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-targeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook ad targeting options</a> such as lookalike audiences or manually targeted interests and behaviors, we figured perhaps AI could identify users that were just like our customers better than we (or these antiquated methods) could.</p>
<p>First of all, if you are creating a new campaign in Meta Ads and you select this option, you will not be able to edit specific placements.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/meta-advantage-campaign-settings.webp" alt="meta advantage+ - meta advantage recommended campaign settings screenshot" width="900" height="615" class="aligncenter wp-image-87649 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/meta-advantage-campaign-settings.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/meta-advantage-campaign-settings-480x328.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>However, if you do choose this option for a new campaign, you are saddled with all of the shiny Advantage+ features Meta has to offer. My client and I chose this option for the sake of experimentation and to determine if Advantage+ features were responsible for higher unqualified rates. The results? 130 unqualified leads within less than a week.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/meta-advantage-cost-example.webp" alt="meta advantage+ - example of cost per result for facebook ads" width="900" height="232" class="aligncenter wp-image-87648 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/meta-advantage-cost-example.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/meta-advantage-cost-example-480x124.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>But, hey, $8.48 per junk lead is not bad in this economy!</em></p>
<p>In all seriousness, let’s break down this test. We launched this campaign under “recommended” settings and defined our general targeting parameters like we always do: age, gender, location, etc. Now with Advantage+ audiences, you provide inputs to the system that essentially gives the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/28/ai-for-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI (machine learning)</a> guidance on who to target. If you are familiar with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/05/performance-max-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s Performance Max campaign type</a> this works in a very similar way.</p>
<p>We did this test with one audience that contained interest and behavioral audience inputs:</p>
<p>This is the audience that we were able to acquire 130 unqualified leads from. Now we also tried one with custom audience inputs of a customer list. This resulted in another two leads which were unqualified and thrown out. For context, both of these Advantage+ audiences we constructed had a plethora of exclusions to assist the machine learning in identifying who we wanted to go after.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/meta-advantage-audience-parameters.webp" alt="meta advantage+ - example advantage audience settings" width="655" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87647 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/meta-advantage-audience-parameters.webp 655w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/meta-advantage-audience-parameters-480x440.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 655px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>After these initial results, I decided that perhaps the inclusion of the audience network led to the influx of unqualified leads coming through. For the second attempt, I recreated the campaign and made the settings “manual” to remove that placement. From there, I attempted to construct the Advantage+ audience again. We ran this campaign for the remainder of the month, and it drove another 12 leads, two of which had been qualified as sales opportunities. This seemed like progress at first, until we discovered through conversations with the sales team that neither of the two leads showed up to the scheduled demo. Plus, another lead reached out directly saying that he was getting the client’s ads all throughout Facebook and Instagram but that he accidentally submitted and he was not their target audience.</p>
<p>So we gave Meta’s AI several inputs that should have allowed it to find the correct people that are a good fit for the product and services that we are selling. But it didn’t. Not only did it fail to construct an audience comparable to that of just a basic <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-lookalike-audiences">lookalike audience</a>, it wasn’t even close. For whatever reason the “AI” seems to flood our system with fake and junk leads every time we attempt to use Advantage+ settings. But why?</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2753.png" alt="❓" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Not sure how to gauge your manual or Meta Advantage+ campaign performance?</strong> Compare your current metrics, like cost per lead, cost per click, and more to averages in your industry using our latest <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/facebook-benchmarks?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_FBAdsBenchmarks2024_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Ads Benchmarks report</a>!</p>
<div id="meta-advantage"></div>
<h2>Meta Advantage+ vs. manual setup: Which is better?</h2>
<p>Meta’s Advantage+ is essentially a black box. We don’t know how or why it is making decisions, but we do know that it has the goal of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-generation-ideas">driving leads</a> (or clicks, whichever your intended goal is) at the highest volume for the lowest cost.</p>
<p>Now this isn’t entirely different than how automated bidding works in both Google and Meta, however, the difference is that you specified that audience and then the machine learning works within the audience that you created or specified managing the bidding aspect and which people in the audience to serve ads to and when.</p>
<h3>When manual setup is better</h3>
<p>With something like Advantage+, the machine learning is making the decision on <strong>who</strong> to target in all of Meta’s database of users and is using your suggestions to guide it but it doesn’t understand (the way a human would) the subtle nuances that define an audience and make them a qualified lead or customer.</p>
<p>My takeaway is that, on their own, the current state of these Meta Advantage+ products is not ready to be serviceable to businesses with complex marketing and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/sales-funnel-template/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales funnels</a>—unless the user can directly interact with it and give it more prompts like “these leads are unqualified, this is what would make them better, etc.”</p>
<p>As of right now, there is just too much complexity to businesses who have<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/marketing-funnel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> marketing funnels</a> or nuanced products and services for Advantage+ to work as effectively as other methods.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/meta-advantage-audience-options.webp" alt="meta advantage+ - example of opting in or out of advantage audiences" width="900" height="396" class="aligncenter wp-image-87646 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/meta-advantage-audience-options.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/meta-advantage-audience-options-480x211.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>When Meta Advantage+ might be better</h3>
<p>What I have found Advantage+ to be very good at is targeting options for ecommerce businesses. This makes a lot of sense though—sales-oriented businesses are looking for people within a demographic that have particular buying behaviors. The AI can predict this much better than someone who is going to talk to sales after submitting a form. The buying process is much simpler and straightforward.</p>
<div id="meta-advantage-tips"></div>
<h2>Final thoughts: The current state of Meta Advantage+</h2>
<p>I do believe that AI products in marketing will reach a point where they will be the better alternative but it’s just not there yet. This is why it concerns me that companies like Meta and Google are essentially forcing you to use them by making it increasingly difficult to <strong>not</strong> use them. This could be to allow these systems to learn and improve, or it could be due to overconfidence in their effectiveness for everyone.</p>
<p>If their marketing product is the easiest to use and you can just let an AI take over, perhaps they believe more people will advertise.</p>
<p>One thing is for certain though, there is much less visibility into how everything is working even for the most experienced marketer using the platform. This means that Google and Meta (and others) can spend your advertising dollars for you and not really own up to how that is being spent. My advice, for now, is that if you’re a business with any complexity at all to how your marketing or sales funnel is built, switch back to the original audience options and thank me later.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to navigate platform developments like Meta Advantage+ all alone!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook Ads targeting options provide tons of ways for advertisers to reach their potential customers on the platform. For example, you can build audiences based on demographics, interests, behaviors, and engagements. However, it’s not always clear how Meta identifies and defines these traits for each user.</p>
<p>In this article, I want to walk through how Facebook decides who goes in each group and at the same time talk through all the ways you can target your ads on the Meta platform.</p>

<p>These are the most foundational demographic targets on Facebook and are pretty straightforward. You’re able to target users down to the single year digit of their age as well as whether they’re male, female, or all genders.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-age-and-gender.webp" alt="facebook ad targeting -age and gender targeting options screenshot" width="570" height="310" class="aligncenter wp-image-87467 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-age-and-gender.webp 570w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-age-and-gender-480x261.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 570px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This information is provided by the users themselves when they sign up for Facebook, so nothing too mystical going on here, but it’s not really fact-checked either. So, there may be some harmless fudging of ages here and there, but for the most part, this is pretty solid information.</p>
<div id="facebook-ad-targeting-demographics"></div>
<h4>Demographics Facebook ad targeting</h4>
<p>While age and gender are technically demographic information, the following demographics Facebook ad targeting section has the option to take things a step further. In that same &#8220;Detailed targeting&#8221; section, if you click &#8220;browse&#8221; on the right, you’ll then see a dropdown with the main categories of &#8220;Demographics, Interests, and Behaviors&#8221;. We’ll get to the other two shortly, but for now, we’re going to focus on the items below &#8220;Demographics.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ads-targeting-detailed-demographics.webp" alt="facebook ads targeting - demographics overall choices screenshot" width="711" height="476" class="aligncenter wp-image-87476 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ads-targeting-detailed-demographics.webp 711w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ads-targeting-detailed-demographics-480x321.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 711px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There are tons of different options for you to narrow your audience based on who they are: education level, parental status, work details, etc.</p>
<p>Some of this data is provided by the users themselves when they update their profiles, which is pretty straightforward. But a good chunk of it is also interpreted by Facebook.</p>
<p>As Facebook says below, detailed targeting options can be based on several factors. It looks at ads users click on, pages they engage with, and other activities across Meta, along with the demographics users themselves provide and the mobile device and connection speed they’re using.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-detailed-options.webp" alt="facebook ad targeting - detailed targeting definition" width="719" height="326" class="aligncenter wp-image-87465 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-detailed-options.webp 719w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-detailed-options-480x218.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 719px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As you dig further into these targeting options, you’ll find that some of these are pretty robust while others are pretty sparse. For example, the image below is the financial section and it’s only based on the average incomes for zip codes in the US. That means it’s averaged data, which by its nature isn’t accurate to a person and is only available for people targeting users in the United States.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ads-targeting-demographics.webp" alt="facebook ads targeting - demographics dropdown" width="754" height="363" class="aligncenter wp-image-87466 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ads-targeting-demographics.webp 754w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ads-targeting-demographics-480x231.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 754px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="facebook-ad-targeting-interests"></div>
<h4>Interests</h4>
<p>The other two detailed targeting options beyond age, gender, and demographics are interests and behaviors. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/13/facebook-interest-targeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Interest and behavior Facebook audiences</a> are developed in the same way as the demographics listed above, but their options are quite a bit different.</p>
<p><strong>Interests</strong> focus on the topics that users like based on the types of content they’ve engaged with in the past, including events, pages they’ve liked, and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-interests.webp" alt="facebook ad targeting -interests" width="610" height="561" class="aligncenter wp-image-87475 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-interests.webp 610w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-interests-480x441.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 610px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you open the dropdown in the Meta Ads Manager campaign builder, you’ll see there’s a very wide range of interest topics to target and all of these have subcategories as well.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-interest-options.webp" alt="facebook ad targeting - interests drop down" width="714" height="371" class="aligncenter wp-image-87469 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-interest-options.webp 714w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-interest-options-480x249.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 714px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Rather than browsing the dropdowns, you may find it more efficient to simply start typing in things you think your target audience is interested in and see what shows up. For example, if I search for hiking, I can see all the options that come up that match that interest.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-example.webp" alt="facebook ad targeting - interest search example" width="729" height="435" class="aligncenter wp-image-87468 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-example.webp 729w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-example-480x286.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 729px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Additionally, searching can uncover many topics that don’t live in the dropdowns. For example, if I try to find hiking, it doesn’t show up under the sports and outdoors section, which is where it would likely fit.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-example-dropdown.webp" alt="facebook ad targeting - outdoor activity" width="758" height="396" class="aligncenter wp-image-87470 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-example-dropdown.webp 758w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-example-dropdown-480x251.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 758px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="facebook-ad-targeting-behaviors"></div>
<h4>Behaviors</h4>
<p><strong>Behaviors</strong> are the other prong of the detailed targeting section. This Facebook ad targeting option lets advertisers reach potential customers based on past purchasing behaviors, device type, and some intent data signals as well.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-behavior.webp" alt="facebook ad targeting - behaviors definition" width="569" height="522" class="aligncenter wp-image-87471 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-behavior.webp 569w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-behavior-480x440.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 569px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If we open up the dropdown, there are a handful of actions to give you some sense of these, but even I’ll admit that this is the most hodgepodge section of<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/31/facebook-audience-targeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> targeting on Facebook</a>. There’s everything from &#8220;new business users&#8221; to &#8220;gaming activities&#8221; to other traits like preferred Facebook and Instagram shop payment types or travel behaviors. It&#8217;s quite a mix, so just like interests, browse through what’s here in case it sparks some ideas, but don’t be afraid to simply search for the behaviors you think are core to your target audience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ads-targeting-behavior-options.webp" alt="facebook ad targeting - behavior options" width="736" height="381" class="aligncenter wp-image-87472 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ads-targeting-behavior-options.webp 736w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ads-targeting-behavior-options-480x248.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 736px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="facebook-ad-targeting-lookalike-audience"></div>
<h3>2. Facebook ad lookalike audience targeting</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-lookalike-audiences">Lookalike audiences</a> have been the bread and butter of Facebook ad targeting strategies for quite a long time. I think it’s only in recent years that I’ve heard them waning at all for certain advertisers, some of them preferring the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-vs-manual-settings"> Advantage+ Audience</a> (which we’ll talk about shortly), but that doesn’t mean lookalike audiences don’t still work well in many accounts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-advertise-on-facebook">Facebook ads</a> lookalike audiences are pretty straightforward. First, you give Facebook a source audience, and then the platform analyzes that list and creates a persona. After that, Facebook puts together an audience of users whose behaviors and interests &#8220;look like,&#8221; or in other words, are similar to, that persona for you to target with your campaigns.</p>
<p>The source audience is an integral part of seeing success with lookalike audiences. In the image below, you can see all the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/01/facebook-audiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">types of custom audiences advertisers can create on Facebook</a>. Any of these custom audiences can be used as a source for a lookalike audience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-custom-audience.webp" alt="facebook ad targeting - how to create a custom audience" width="701" height="545" class="aligncenter wp-image-87473 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-custom-audience.webp 701w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-custom-audience-480x373.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 701px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>When you’re ready to create a lookalike audience, you get to choose the source audience, and then identify which country of users you want to target. Lastly, you get to select the percentage match you’d like to use. On the small end, you have a 1% match, meaning you’ll target 1% of the population of the location you selected above that looks the most like your source audience. As you choose higher and higher percentages, the size of your audience increases by a factor of that location’s population.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-lookalike-audience.webp" alt="facebook ad targeting - custom audience size" width="707" height="614" class="aligncenter wp-image-87474 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-lookalike-audience.webp 707w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-lookalike-audience-480x417.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 707px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Your source audience must match at least 100 users in a single country, but they recommend an audience between 1,000 to 5,000 users. Anything smaller and it’s a bit hard to determine a strong, meaningful pattern, but anything larger ends up looking like the entire population on Facebook.</p>

<h3>3. Meta Advantage+ Facebook ad targeting</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Advantage+</a> audiences are effectively Facebook’s machine learning taking over and doing your targeting for you. As a reference for any veteran Facebook advertisers, this is the new automated version of “broad targeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>As you can see in the image below, Facebook’s ad technology will automatically find your audience for you and aim to get you the results you’re looking for in that given ad set.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-meta-advantage-plus-audience.webp" alt="facebook ad targeting - advantage plus audience suggestions" width="722" height="315" class="aligncenter wp-image-87462 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-meta-advantage-plus-audience.webp 722w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-meta-advantage-plus-audience-480x209.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 722px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>They do this by using information from past conversion performance, your pixel data, and the interactions those users have had with previous ads. I believe that the last portion is both from your ads as well as other advertiser ads that are on the platform, but don’t quote me on that.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-meta-advantage-plus-sources.webp" alt="facebook ad targeting - meta advantage plus audience" width="732" height="469" class="aligncenter wp-image-87463 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-meta-advantage-plus-sources.webp 732w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-meta-advantage-plus-sources-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 732px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong> Could your account benefit from Advantage+ campaign settings, or are you already outpacing the competition?</strong> Find out with our free <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-advertising?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FBGrader_FBGrader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Ad Grader</a>!</p>
<p>There is a place to add your audience suggestion, but it’s optional. When you click that button, you’re given the same targeting options that we’ve already discussed, but don’t be confused, these are suggestions rather than actual targeting.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-advantage-plus-audience-suggestions.webp" alt="facebook ad targeting - advantage plus audience suggestion example" width="756" height="631" class="aligncenter wp-image-87464 size-full" /></p>
<p>That means that Facebook will likely start off targeting your audience suggestions, then branch out as it sees patterns or if it thinks it will improve performance. If you need or want to retain full control over your targeting, Advantage+ Audience might not be right for you. However, don’t opt out of it simply because it’s an “automated” choice with less control. Don’t forget, Facebook is one of the most widely used platforms in the world and their machine learning is honestly pretty good. It might not hurt you to test out some of it if you’ve been avoidant in the past and are seeing declining results.</p>

<h2>How to know which Facebook ad targeting option is right for your business</h2>

<h2>Facebook ads cost per click by industry</h2>
<p>The latest industry benchmarks we could find on Facebook ad costs were <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ads-benchmarks-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our own</a>, collected in 2024.</p>
<p>Our data showed an average cost per click (CPC) on Facebook Ads of $0.77 for traffic campaigns across all industries. Travel was the cheapest industry in Facebook ads at $0.42, and Attorneys and Legal Services was the most expensive industry at $1.09.</p>

<h2>Factors that influence the cost of Facebook ads</h2>
<p>Just like <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/08/instagram-ads-cost">Instagram ads costs</a>, Facebook ad costs are influenced by a number of variables.</p>
<h3>1. Campaign objectives</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-objectives">Facebook campaign objectives</a> are a prominent factor in pricing since they relate to the value of the desired goal and where in the funnel your users are.</p>
<p>For example, Awareness or Engagement campaigns will cost less than lower-funnel campaigns like Sales that drive purchases. It’s easier to get someone to engage with an ad than it is to entice them to click through, open up their wallet, and complete a purchase.</p>
<h3>2. Audience size</h3>
<p>Facebook ads targeting larger and broader audiences will generally cost less than for smaller audiences.</p>
<p>You will typically see lower costs in prospecting, upper-funnel, cold-audience campaigns compared to retargeting, lower-funnel, warmer-audience campaigns, because the audiences of the latter tend to be more specific, smaller in size, and therefore more <a href="/blog/ws/2017/04/27/how-to-compete-in-facebook-ads">competitive</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/facebook-ads-trends-audience-size-indicator.jpg" alt="how much does facebook cost - audience size indicator" width="520" height="349" class="aligncenter wp-image-79160 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/facebook-ads-trends-audience-size-indicator.jpg 520w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/facebook-ads-trends-audience-size-indicator-480x322.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 520px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>3. Daily budget</h3>
<p>If your daily budget is on the lower end, it may take longer for Facebook&#8217;s algorithm to exit the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-learning-phase">learning phase</a>. For this reason, costs for new ad sets are often higher upfront while the system understands how your audience behaves with your ads and how to optimize them for the highest engagement. If your ads are well engaged with, Facebook and Instagram will reward you with lower costs over time.</p>
<h3><span>4. Bidding strategy</span></h3>
<p><span>Similarly, the way you instruct Facebook to spend your ad budget affects how much your ads cost. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/31/facebook-ads-bidding-strategies">Facebook bidding strategies</a> include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span></span><span>Highest volume (formerly lowest cost)</span><span></span></li>
<li>Highest value</li>
<li>Cost per result (formerly cost cap)</li>
<li>ROAS goal (formerly minimum ROAS)</li>
<li>Bid cap</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Click-through rate</h3>
<p>Click-thru rate (CTR) can also play a role in you Facebook ad costs. If CTR is low, especially in a website traffic campaign, you may then see higher costs as Facebook understands that there may be some disconnect between your target audience and the <a href="/blog/ws/2016/06/29/best-facebook-ads">messaging in your ads</a>.</p>
<p>A healthy Facebook CTR is about 2%. More often than not, the higher your CTR climbs, the lower your CPCs will be.</p>
<h3>6. Industry</h3>
<p>As you saw in our benchmarks above, Facebook costs vary by industry, which also includes varying click-through rates.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-fb-benchmarks-chart-Traffic-CTR-877x1024.webp" alt="facebook ads benchmarks - traffic objective average click-through rates chart" width="877" height="1024" class="aligncenter wp-image-84770 size-large" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also important to look at the ROI by industry. <span>For example, the average CPL for Health and Fitness is $57.40. But if your customer spends $50 and keeps coming back for years to come, you&#8217;re essentially making money off of that ad.</span></p>
<h3>7. Seasonality</h3>
<p>Historically speaking, in the latter part of Q3 and Q4, costs tend to temporarily increase as the advertising landscape changes for the <a href="/blog/ws/2019/08/08/holiday-marketing-tips">holiday ecommerce season</a>. Competition ramps up as brands increase their budgets and gain more impression share, thus, increasing costs for all advertising brands.</p>
<p>Keep seasonality in mind as you budget for the year. If you aren’t in ecommerce or running promotions during the end of the year, you may want to strategize on whether to keep a presence or to scale back.</p>
<div id="lower"></div>
<h2>How to lower Facebook ad costs</h2>
<p>There are a number of ways to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/16/facebook-ad-costs">lower your Facebook ad costs</a>, but here are some of our favorite strategies.</p>
<h3>1. Create a full-funnel strategy</h3>
<p>To use your budget wisely and set yourself up to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/08/how-to-scale-facebook-ads">scale your Facebook ads</a>, choose funnel-appropriate campaign objectives. In general, Awareness and Consideration campaigns are suited for the top of the funnel; Consideration and Conversion campaigns align with the middle of the funnel, and Conversion campaigns are best for <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/01/bottom-funnel-conversions">bottom-funnel conversions</a>.</p>
<p>In short, begin with upper-funnel campaigns to reach more people in your target audience at a lower cost, and then move your way toward conversion campaigns that optimize for your purchase-driving conversion events.</p>
<p>You can learn how to create a <a href="/blog/ws/2019/02/21/facebook-funnel">full-funnel Facebook advertising strategy here</a>.</p>
<p>Note that some brands can certainly run a Sales campaign targeting upper-funnel audiences with lower-priced products or something that may make for a good impulse buy.</p>
<p>People can and do <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/13/facebook-ecommerce-tips">make purchases</a> upon first interaction with a brand on Facebook, however, most will need more touch points from a brand so you can gain their trust, showcase your benefits, and entice them to convert.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Want more Facebook ads tips like these?</strong> Download our free guide to the top <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLFBFundamentals.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FacebookFundamentals_Download">seven fundamental Facebook advertising tips</a> every advertiser should know.</p>
<h3>2. Broaden your audience</h3>
<p>Ad mentioned above, audience size impacts how much Facebook ads cost. So while you want to keep your targeting narrow, you should strive to make those targeted audiences as large as possible. This has become trickier as a result of privacy measures, but we&#8217;ve got some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/11/facebook-advertising-strategies">recommended Facebook ad strategies</a> to help you out with that.</p>
<h3>3. Check audience overlap</h3>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s audience overlap tool can be instrumental in saving money. Let’s say you have one ad targeting an audience of people interested in startups and another ad for people interested in entrepreneurship. You have different<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/07/facebook-ad-copy-examples"> Facebook ad copy</a> and creative to appeal to these different audiences. However, the overlap tool shows you that half of the startup audience overlaps with the entrepreneurship audience. Knowing this, you can use exclusions so those ads don’t overlap. Otherwise, you’d lose money bidding against yourself.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ad-costs-audience-overlap-tool.png" alt="" width="800" height="403" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18248" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ad-costs-audience-overlap-tool.png 800w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ad-costs-audience-overlap-tool-480x242.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>4. Use bid caps</h3>
<p>This is the manual bidding <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-tactics">strategy in Facebook ads</a>, where you can set a maximum bid instead of allowing Facebook to dynamically bid based on your goals. But this should be used with caution. It’s for advertisers who have a solid understanding of the conversion rate and profit margin and requires regular maintenance. If you set your bid cap too low, Facebook might have a hard time spending all of your budget.</p>
<h3>5. Use the Pixel AND the Facebook Conversions API</h3>
<p>The goal of both of these pieces of technology is for you to track your ad performance. With visibility into what’s working and what’s not, you can allocate budget accordingly. You can also gain insights about the people viewing your ads, which you can use to further optimize your campaigns and maximize your budget.</p>
<p>The Facebook Pixel is still a thing, but it is losing its power since it’s cookie-based and cookies are crumbling. The Facebook Conversions API does not rely on cookies, but it doesn’t pick up the same exact information as the pixel. So, using the two together will ensure you capture the most accurate data. You can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/06/facebook-conversions-api">learn how to use the Facebook Conversions API here</a>.</p>

<h3>6. Run Facebook A/B testing</h3>
<p>You can also help lower your costs at the ad level by <a href="/blog/ws/2021/05/11/facebook-ab-testing">A/B testing</a> variables in your ads—one at a time—to better understand what is and is not working well. Test out the text, <a href="/blog/ws/2018/08/28/facebook-ad-headlines">headline</a>, images and/or videos, landing pages, and more.</p>
<p>Facebook is not the set-it-and-forget type of platform, so it is best to continuously test and aim for better results. Running tests at the ad level can help improve your engagement rates and CTR and stretch your budget further. Check out our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/23/facebook-ad-examples">Facebook ad examples</a> to get ideas and inspiration.</p>
<h3>7. Try Meta Advantage+</h3>
<p>Over the last couple years, Facebook ads has rolled out <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-plus">Advantage+</a> settings that allow Facebook&#8217;s machine learning to automate campaign audience and placement targeting, ad creative, and more. These settings, which you choose to opt into, are easy to use and can be a timesaver for advertisers looking to scale more quickly. However, just know that there will be a trade-off of manual control with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Advantage Plus</a>, so be sure to keep a close eye on your campaign behavior and any AI-powered assets to maintain consistent performance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/meta-advantage-plus-screenshot.webp" alt="meta advantage+ - where you can use advantage plus in meta and facebook ads" width="391" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-84702 size-full" /></p>

<h2>What makes Facebook Ads worth the price?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/02/reasons-to-advertise-on-social-media">Advertising on social media</a> in general has its benefits, but let&#8217;s finish off with some of the money-saving advantages Facebook has over other platforms like Pinterest, LinkedIn, and Instagram.</p>
<h3>Facebook is still the most popular social media platform</h3>
<p>With over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3 million active users</a> worldwide, Facebook currently ranks as the largest and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">most popular social media platform</a> in the world. This is compared to other front runners like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/most-popular-social-media-platforms-marketers-11.jpg" alt="" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76885 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/most-popular-social-media-platforms-marketers-11.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/most-popular-social-media-platforms-marketers-11-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>&#8230;and the most widely used</h3>
<p>Facebook has the most even distribution of users compared to other popular social media platforms like Instagram and Linkedin—which means you can target a larger range of age groups with your ads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/facebook-ads-cost-2021-facebook-even-age-distribution_0.png" alt="age distribution for facebook vs instagram and linkedin" width="720" height="196" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<h3>Precise targeting means higher ROI</h3>
<p>Precise targeting means <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/16/facebook-ad-costs">reduced Facebook ad costs. </a>If you want to target someone in a 15-mile radius of a particular address or zip code, you can do that. If you want to reach parents with children 3-5 years old who love ice cream, you can do that too. And we haven&#8217;t even touched lookalike and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/27/facebook-custom-audiences">custom audiences</a>.</p>

This does require changes, however, so be sure to visit our guide to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/13/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-world">Facebook ad targeting</a>.</p>
<h3>You have flexibility with budgeting</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="/blog/ws/2019/02/19/facebook-ads-daily-vs-lifetime-budgets">Facebook offers two types of budgeting</a> to accommodate different advertising strategies. Lifetime budgets, which are good if you run ads on a schedule and/or a fixed budget and end date; and daily budgets, which are good for maximizing ongoing campaigns and pacing and planning around a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/stretch-your-marketing-budget">fluctuating budget</a>. You can also use the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/audience-overlap-tool">Audience Overlap Tool</a> to save money.</p>
<h3>It&#8217;s affordable</h3>
<p>Facebook ads are among <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/30/cost-effective-ad-types">the most cost-effective </a>ad types for any business, whether it spends $10 a day or thousands. With testing, <a href="/blog/ws/2018/09/04/facebook-retargeting">remarketing</a>, and reporting capabilities, you have the tools to make the most of every dollar you spend.</p>
<p>For context, the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2024-google-ads-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> average cost per click in Google Ads</a> is higher than Facebook&#8217;s at $4.66. So, while you still want to hit all<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/26/marketing-channels" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> marketing channels</a> including search advertising, Facebook ads can help fill any gaps in your strategy at a lower and more stable cost.</p>
