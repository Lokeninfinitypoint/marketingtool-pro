<div>
<p><span lang="EN">Broadway theaters in New York are scheduled to resume performances in September 2021—18 months after they shuttered in the early days of the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">It’s one of the clearest signs yet that a “new normal” is on the horizon.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Indeed, with about 110 million Americans fully vaccinated as of May 2021, other pandemic-era restrictions are starting to lift on public spaces like bars, restaurants, gyms, and stadiums across the country.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">Things really are starting to come alive this time around, and your business (and customers) should be too. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re <span lang="EN">covering seven ways to prepare for and leverage the positive changes to come, according to top digital marketing experts across a variety of industries.</span></span></p>
<h2>1. Return to out-of-home advertising and live events</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">One tactic is to return to <a href="/blog/ws/2020/02/26/out-of-home-advertising">out-of-home advertising</a> and live events, which have understandably been neglected in the last year. </span></p>
<p>For his part, Dan Cassidy, CEO of Shopify agency <a href="https://brand-hopper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brand Hopper Digital</a>, is advising ecommerce clients to prepare for a boost in demand for products in categories like apparel and beauty “that will help people feel good and look good as they reenter the public.”</p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Increase your investment in live events</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">“After being cooped up, people are ready to get out into the world and we predict that more people will be traveling, at live events and in public spaces than ever before,” said Krista Neher, CEO of digital marketing and social media training program<span lang="EN"> <a href="http://www.bootcampdigital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boot Camp Digital</a><span lang="EN">. “This is a great time to capitalize on this.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">In fact, she noted Boot Camp Digital plans to increase its investment in live events in order to have a bigger presence when they return.</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e8f5f10a-f2cc-4cb7-8088-1cc8105269b0" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/inspiring-post-covid-marketing-ideas-live-events_2-1.png" alt="inspiring post-covid marketing ideas live event searches increasing" width="800" height="373" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<h3><span lang="EN">Get more out of sponsoring</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">“We expect attendance will be up. However, sponsorship and exhibitor rates aren&#8217;t changing,” Neher added. “This creates a golden opportunity—we can reach more people for the same rates as in the past.”</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Lars Skjold Iversen, search engine explorer at CMS platform<span lang="EN"> <a href="https://umbraco.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Umbraco</a><span lang="EN">, agreed, noting we all have Zoom fatigue by now and will likely opt for in-person events over <a href="/blog/ws/2016/05/03/marketing-webinars">webinars</a> if given the choice. That makes live events “a great place for us to be.”</span></span></span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Try a hybrid approach</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">For his part, <span lang="EN">Chad Burmeister, CEO of virtual assistant platform<span lang="EN"> <a href="https://www.scalex.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ScaleX.ai</a><span lang="EN">, likened Summer 2021 to “the Summer of Love 2.0,” which will “put business professionals back on airplanes … [and] marketers investing once again in trade shows.” However, his prediction is hybrid physical/virtual events will be the new normal.</span></span></span></span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Reclaim your brand presence</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">In a similar vein, industries that have struggled during the pandemic—events included, along with travel—should brace for comebacks.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Per Andrei Vasilescu, CEO of coupon site<span lang="EN"> <a href="http://www.dontpayfull.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DontPayFull</a><span lang="EN">, that means focusing on recall.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">“They have to re-establish their brand existence in the market,” he said. “Businesses must reclaim their <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/01/brand-strategy">brand presence</a> in order to regain their consumers in 2021.”</span></p>
<h2>2. Adjust brand messaging to be more empathetic</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">After a challenging year in many respects, <a href="/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">brand messaging</a> will likely shift in multiple ways to appeal to consumers as they cautiously reemerge from not only a pandemic, but a <a href="/blog/ws/2021/03/19/prepare-for-recession">recession</a>, and face an ongoing climate crisis and racial justice movement.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Naturally, there is no one-size-fits-all guidance here, but there are some overarching themes.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Celebrate the move forward but don’t forget the past</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">For starters, brands should be sensitive to “those financially, emotionally and physically <a href="/blog/ws/2020/03/13/covid-19-response">affected by the pandemic</a>,” said Devin Johnson, CEO of <a href="/blog/ws/2021/04/21/cost-effective-marketing-automation-tools-small-businesses">marketing automation</a> software company<span lang="EN"> <a href="https://kennected.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kennected</a><span lang="EN">.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Juan Pablo Sarmiento, CEO of content network<span lang="EN"> <a href="https://www.bypeople.com/">ByPeople.com</a><span lang="EN">, agreed brand messages must be “softened, more human and less machine-like.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">For Brand Hopper’s Cassidy, it’s striking a balance between “the realization the past year has been difficult for many and some experienced serious loss” and “excitement as we get back to a sense of normalcy.”</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="7a345221-c6c5-44df-bbc6-dde1e6f20848" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/inspiring-post-covid-marketing-ideas-empathetic-messaging-1.png" alt="inspiring post-covid marketing ideas an example of empathetic brand messaging" width="600" height="574" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Planet Fitness has incorporated safety and cleanliness into its brand messaging, even trademarking the term &#8220;Cardio Distancing.&#8221;</em></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Try nostalgia marketing</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Meanwhile, Chris Vaughn<span lang="EN">, <span lang="EN">CEO of<span lang="EN"> <a href="https://pacificconsolidated.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pacific Consolidated Holdings</a><span lang="EN">, a holding company focused on <a href="/blog/ws/2020/03/12/cannabis-marketing">cannabis</a> and other vice industries, <span lang="EN">expects more nostalgia as consumers crave “the simplicity of their youths.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">He added, “Consumers are more likely to develop brand loyalty for a company they feel <a href="/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotionally</a> connected to and nostalgia marketing harnesses the positive, optimistic associations between customer’s good old days and <a href="/blog/ws/2015/05/07/marketing-funnel">funnels</a> them into a brand.”</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Use scarcity tactics sparingly </span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">On the other side of the coin, Catie Fromknecht, digital marketing consultant at consumer behavior research firm <a href="https://www.clicksuasion.com/">Clicksuasion Labs</a><span lang="EN">, noted consumers are more likely to be susceptible to scarcity marketing tactics following a year of substantial losses—but this tactic should be used sparingly. </span></span></p>
<h2>3. Make your brand’s stances clear</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">In addition, brand messaging should adjust to reflect positioning on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/21/how-brands-are-embracing-social-change">social responsibility</a>.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Align with new consumer ethics</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Citing figures from consulting firm Accenture, Arthur Iinuma, <span lang="EN">president of app development firm<span lang="EN"> <a href="https://www.isbx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISBX</a><span lang="EN">, <span lang="EN">noted <span lang="EN">COVID-19 has prompted a shift in consumer consciousness as 45% have adopted more sustainable habits and plan to continue to embrace these choices. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">“Brands must align with the new consumer sentiment and consider how they can promote a more <a href="/blog/ws/2017/09/20/ethical-marketing">ethical</a> model of consumerism,” he added.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Focus on diversity and inclusion.</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">“Many consumers now expect brands to show support in the fight against discrimination and other social issues [or they will] fall victim to the financial and moral consequences,” said <span lang="EN">Eden Cheng, co-founder of invoice platform<span lang="EN"> <a href="https://weinvoice.com/">WeInvoice</a><span lang="EN">.“</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">This has led to us making major commitments in our content marketing strategies that help emphasize our support in the fight against racial discrimination, as well as active participation in lending a hand to the local community through various social causes.”</span></p>

<h2>4. Keep pushing live and standard video</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Live video is a <a href="/blog/ws/2021/01/04/best-marketing-strategies-2021">digital strategy</a> that helped brands connect with consumers from afar during the pandemic—and marketers expect to continue using it after a fundamental shift in behavior during the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">That’s true for <span lang="EN">Derek Devore, founder of luxury real estate touring platform <a href="https://duvora.com/">Duvora</a><span lang="EN">, who said he saw a “massive” uptick in adoption in 2020 as customers used live video in their searches for homes.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">“Going forward, we are investing 90% of our efforts into live video,” he added. “This interaction and ability to reach luxury home buyers in any part of the world instantly has proven to be the best channel for us.”</span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Meanwhile, standard video content remains a solid strategy, too—and that includes digital <a href="/blog/ws/2012/11/27/youtube-advertising">advertising on platforms like YouTube</a> as consumer <a href="/blog/ws/2017/03/08/video-marketing-statistics">appetite for video</a> remains.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Per <span lang="EN">figures from Dustin Porreca, SEO manager at B2B marketing agency <span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.elevatedemand.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elevate Demand</a><span lang="EN">, clients have seen an average 68% increase in video content consumption on YouTube since March 2020 (more <a href="/blog/ws/2021/06/17/post-pandemic-digital-marketing-statistics">post-covid stats here</a>).</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">“YouTube provides an opportunity to explain your products or services in detail and provide the authenticity users are looking for,” <span lang="EN">added John McGhee, owner of digital agency <a href="https://www.webconsuls.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Webconsuls</a><span lang="EN">.</span></span></span></p>
<h2>5. Keep investing in social</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Social media is another trend that isn’t going to go away—although the <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business">specific channels marketers use</a> may shift.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span lang="EN">Continue on your existing channels</span></strong></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Even when the world opens back up again, consumers will continue to use their favorite platforms, which Porreca said justifies continued investment.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">“In any marketing strategy, your goal is meeting your buyers where they&#8217;re going to be at any given time,” he said.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Consider TikTok or Clubhouse</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">In addition to YouTube and Facebook, which a recent study from <span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/04/07/social-media-use-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a><span lang="EN"> shows are the most popular platforms with U.S. consumers overall, brands would be wise to turn their attention to video-sharing platform <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/11/advertising-on-tiktok">TikTok</a>, which<span lang="EN"> reportedly saw usage climb <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/09/14/massive-tiktok-growth-up-75-this-year-now-33x-more-users-than-nearest-competitor/?sh=3fbacd044fe4">75%</a> in 2020,<span lang="EN"> as well as another up-and-comer, audio-based app Clubhouse.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><span lang="EN"><a href="https://blog.shuttlerock.com/complete-guide-to-tiktok-video-ad-formats" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></span></p>
<p><em><span lang="EN">`</span></em><span lang="EN">“A little-known secret is you can get great results in some industries by <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/22/tiktok-ads">advertising on TikTok</a>,” said <span lang="EN">Dennis Consorte, small business consultant at review site <span lang="EN"><a href="http://digital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital.com</a><span lang="EN">. <span lang="EN">“There isn’t much competition, so ad costs are relatively low.”</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<h2>6. Take advantage of lower CPCs</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Speaking of lower costs, while digital platforms remained an important avenue to reach home-bound consumers during the pandemic, Timothy Robinson, CEO of review site <span lang="EN"><a href="https://invpn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">InVPN</a><span lang="EN">, pointed to dropping <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/02/cpc-landing-page-optimization">CPC</a> prices in the coming months. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">This, he said, presents an opportunity to reach customers online at even lower costs—even if brands themselves have faced budget cuts.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">“Other advertisers are likely to go offline at this time, allowing companies to <a href="/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">capture more traffic</a> and conversions,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nealtaparia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neal Taparia</a>—entrepreneur, investor, and co-founder of <a href="https://spider-solitaire-challenge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spider Solitaire Challenge</a>—<span lang="EN">agreed, noting <a href="/blog/ws/2016/10/17/ppc-formulas">PPC advertising</a> is “<span lang="EN">a great way of maintaining additional presence online, as well as reminding your customers that your business is going strong.”</span></span></span></p>
<h2>7. Continue optimizing for local</h2>
<p><span lang="EN"><a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Local marketing</a> has arguably been <a href="/blog/ws/2020/05/08/seo-during-covid-19">more important in the last 12 months than ever before</a>—and that, too, will continue.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Assume continued #shoplocal support</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Per Amy Dixon, digital marketing manager of digital agency<span lang="EN"> <a href="https://www.hydracreative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hydra Creative</a><span lang="EN">, this is because of “a huge positive change in attitudes towards local businesses” during the pandemic, which is expected to continue after lockdown. In the U.K. for example, <a href="https://startupsmagazine.co.uk/article-google-finds-we-are-economy-kindness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">38%</a> of consumers <span lang="EN">reportedly shopped more at small businesses in 2020<span lang="EN">—and 88% say they are more likely to shop locally moving forward.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Run online and offline campaigns</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">As a result, marketers should continue to optimize for “near me” searches and <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">solicit customer reviews</a>. But they should also consider local media like radio ads, which <span lang="EN">Sabrina Beaumont, CMO of house plan site<span lang="EN"> <a href="https://passionplans.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Passion Plans</a><span lang="EN">, said she intends to do to “hopefully allow us to gain some local goodwill” in the markets in which she operates.</span></span></span></span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/06/08/what-is-google-my-business">Google Business Profile</a> is the key to showing up in &#8220;near me&#8221; and Maps searches.</em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Whether or not workers return to offices full-time remains to be seen. In the meantime, <span lang="EN">Solomon Thimothy, co-founder of marketing dashboard<span lang="EN"> <a href="https://www.clickx.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clickx</a><span lang="EN">, agreed marketers should focus on “all things local” as “most people will continue to work from home even when they can already go back to the office.”</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">In a similar vein, Iversen said he stopped sponsoring <a href="/blog/ws/2018/06/05/podcast-advertising">podcasts</a> when commuters stopped going to offices. But that, too, could provide a new opportunity for brands as consumers return to work.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">Use these post-pandemic marketing ideas to come back stronger than ever</span></h2>
<p>And there you have it. Data-based, industry expert-given tips to meet your customers where they&#8217;re at as the world starts to reopen. Let&#8217;s quickly recap:</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>COVID-19 has changed our way of doing things, and even once the pandemic ends, we aren't likely to go back to the way things were. But for four SaaS businesses—digital collaboration platforms, telemedicine, and gaming and media, that's actually good news. Learn the why and how in this post.</p>

<p>At this point, it seems safe to say that the novel coronavirus represents one of the most significant business disruptions in the past several decades. Although a transition to remote work and e-commerce was already in progress, the pandemic moved that shift forward with breakneck speed, forcing it on many businesses that were in no way prepared. Unsurprisingly, many of them have had a great deal of difficulty adapting.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/NMSC/390e0055-2395-4d3b-af60-81b53974430d/UploadedImages/Resource_Center/COVID_19/NMSC57_MSA_COVID19IMAPCTSURVEY_F.pdf"><em>Image Source</em></a></p>
<p>In a survey released in April, insurance agency Main Street America found that <a href="https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/NMSC/390e0055-2395-4d3b-af60-81b53974430d/UploadedImages/Resource_Center/COVID_19/NMSC57_MSA_COVID19IMAPCTSURVEY_F.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two-thirds</a> of small businesses would have to shut their doors if the lockdown had persisted for five months or more. Another 30% of businesses indicated they would be unable to even survive a two-month lockdown.</p>
<p>That isn&#8217;t to say that all industries have suffered from the pandemic, mind you.</p>
<p>Many Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) businesses, in particular, have <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/17/businesses-likely-to-thrive-post-covid">thrived</a> in the new climate created by COVID-19. Even when the pandemic eventually ends, it is likely that many of these organizations will continue along at their current momentum, as both businesses and consumers turn to the digital realm for support and entertainment. Those particular businesses include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Digital collaboration platforms</li>
<li>Telemedicine</li>
<li>Gaming and media</li>
</ol>
<p>With that in mind, here are the details as to why we believe these SaaS companies will perform incredibly well in a <a href="/blog/ws/2021/03/15/google-ads-account-audit-post-covid">post-COVID</a> world.</p>
<p><em>Speaking of post-COVID, with the world opening back up again, check out these <a href="/blog/ws/2021/05/12/inspiring-post-covid-marketing-ideas">inspiring post-COVID marketing ideas</a>!</em></p>
<h2>1. Digital collaboration platforms</h2>
<p>Business to Business (<a href="/blog/ws/2019/10/17/b2b-lead-generation">B2B</a>) software is arguably the biggest <a href="/blog/ws/2020/06/02/new-data-google-ads-benchmarks-during-covid-19">winner of the pandemic</a>, a trend likely to continue as the world gradually returns to some semblance of normalcy.</p>
<p>As mentioned, COVID-19 forced many organizations to move, nearly overnight, from a traditional office to a fully distributed, <a href="/blog/ws/2017/06/16/working-remotely">remote</a> workforce. Most lacked the necessary in-house infrastructure to support this transition. As a result, they turned to <a href="/blog/ws/2020/12/29/remote-collaboration-tools-2021">digital collaboration tools</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/18/best-webinar-platforms">Platforms</a> like Zoom, Slack, Uberconference, Clockify, Notion, Fuze, Quite, Microsoft SharePoint, and Google Drive have experienced a <em>massive </em>surge in usage over the past several months. Zoom, in particular, saw usage up approximately 300 percent in the early days of quarantine, per JP Morgan analyst <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zoom-microsoft-cloud-usage-are-rocketing-during-coronavirus-pandemic-new-data-show-2020-03-30" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sterling Auty</a>. Microsoft, meanwhile, mentioned in a March blog post that it saw a <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/update-2-on-microsoft-cloud-services-continuity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">775% increase</a> in calls and meetings on Microsoft Teams, its business communication platform.</p>
<p>While subscribers and usage will likely decline at least slightly once people begin to return to the office, remote work is nevertheless here to stay.</p>

</div>
<p>Research and consulting firm Global Workplace Analytics, for instance, predicted in a recent survey that by the end of 2021, as many as <a href="https://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/work-at-home-after-covid-19-our-forecast">30%</a> of employees will work from home multiple days a week, while 80 percent of respondents indicated a desire to work from home &#8220;at least some of the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just in the business realm that this software saw increased usage, either. In an effort to cope with the isolation and stress of quarantine, many people began using videoconferencing tools to stay in touch with friends and family. Digital date nights, movie nights, and meetups became common.</p>
<p>It went beyond even this, however, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/our-zoom-future-will-coronavirus-change-friendship-forever-11587182431">as noted by </a><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/our-zoom-future-will-coronavirus-change-friendship-forever-11587182431"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Fitness courses offered via <a href="/blog/ws/2017/07/31/facebook-live-guide">Facebook</a> and <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/30/instagram-live">Instagram live.</a> Trivia games played via smartphone apps. Board games played over video chat. Digital concerts, <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/05/webinar-marketing">webinars</a>, virtual conferences, and online events.</p>
<p>While it is likely that many will return to physical gatherings and events the moment it is safe to do so, some experts have predicted that virtually connecting with people will, for many, become the new normal. Large video chats present a compelling alternative to physical meet-ups between busy adults, many of whom might otherwise be unable to meet and speak with their friends and loved ones. As a result, though usage will likely decline in the consumer space just as in the business space, online social gatherings are here to stay.</p>
<p>And speaking of which, here are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/12/cross-functional-collaboration">nine ways to improve cross-functional collaboration</a> on your team.</p>
<h2>2. Telemedicine</h2>
<p>Telemedicine isn&#8217;t exactly a new field, nor are the underlying technologies particularly revolutionary.  It has, for years, allowed individuals living in remote regions to gain access to medical advice and diagnoses which they might otherwise be unable to receive. With the fears surrounding the spread of COVID-19, however, telemedicine has seen an even sharper upturn in usage than collaboration software.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="4c020e75-4166-4fdb-9a89-346688fec144" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SaaS-Businesses-Likely-to-Thrive-in-a-Post-COVID-World-trustradius-1.png" alt="saas businesses likely to thrive in a post-covid world trustradius" width="800" height="497" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://www.trustradius.com/vendor-blog/covid-19-software-industry-data-and-statistics"><em>Image Source</em></a></p>
<p>In April, for instance, software &amp; services review site <a href="https://www.trustradius.com/vendor-blog/covid-19-software-industry-data-and-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TrustRadius</a> measured the number of impressions each SaaS category had received since the beginning of the pandemic. Telemedicine led the pack by a massive margin, seeing a 613% increase in usage. Although the site acknowledged that this sharp growth had likely already reached its peak, it will remain an incredibly useful tool even <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/18/post-covid-19-customers">post-COVID</a>.</p>
<p>To that end, the <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/digital/after-covid-19-250-billion-care-could-shift-telehealth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Medical Association</a> has predicted that moving forward, virtual healthcare could account for approximately $250 billion of health insurance spending in the United States, up from an estimated $3 billion. For many, telehealth is a matter of significant convenience, allowing us to phone in from the comfort of our own home instead of waiting for several hours in a doctor&#8217;s office. It will also allow mobility-impaired far easier access to physicians and by association the medical care they require.</p>
<p>The AMA also reported that, according to consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company, 57% of healthcare providers view telemedicine in a more favorable light than before the pandemic, whilst 64% indicate that they would be more comfortable using it in their own practice.</p>
<p>As such, although the barrier for entry into the SaaS telemedicine space is relatively high and saddled with myriad regulatory requirements, it nevertheless has incredible <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/28/growth-strategy">potential for growth</a>.</p>
<h2>3. Gaming and media</h2>
<p>We need not tell you how much online gaming and media streaming services increased in usage during the pandemic. You have likely experienced this surge firsthand, at least in part. After all, when one is stuck in their own home, what else is there to do but find solace in digital entertainment?</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="6cbff930-9d6b-4985-b232-82edd246c3f8" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SaaS-Businesses-Likely-to-Thrive-in-a-Post-COVID-World-video-game-streaming-1.png" alt="saas businesses likely to thrive in a post-covid world video game streaming" width="800" height="476" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>A major decline for theaters as streaming platforms grow (</em><em><a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/research/media-consumption">Image Source</a>).</em></p>
<p>Analyst and consulting firm Deloitte <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/be/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/online-media-streaming.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicted early in the pandemic that</a> media streaming services would greatly benefit from the pandemic, noting several significant increases in both viewership and usage. Multinational financial services firm J.P. Morgan, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/research/media-consumption" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted the increasing expansion of the streaming landscape in May</a>, with countless new streaming platforms coming to market. Video games, too, received a mention in the firm&#8217;s analysis, with both increased usage and increased viewership on streaming platforms like Twitch.</p>
<p>It is important to note here that not all game developers and publishers count as SaaS companies.  At the same time, however, SaaS has strong roots in the games industry, from digital distribution platforms like Steam to online games like <em>World of Warcraft</em> and <em>League of Legends</em>. And given that the vast majority of gaming is making the shift from offline and single-player to online and multiplayer, the future of gaming and SaaS are inextricably linked — and gaming is, by association, a fast-growing SaaS sector with a great deal of revenue potential.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="fd1174db-aab3-40a2-b23f-cc923acb9994" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SaaS-Businesses-Likely-to-Thrive-in-a-Post-COVID-World-video-game-streaming-jump-1.png" alt="saas businesses likely to thrive in a post-covid world video game streaming" width="800" height="426" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>A pandemic-fueled jump in video game streaming (</em><em><a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/twitch-sets-audience-record-october-pandemic-continues-fuel-livestreaming-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image Source</a>).</em></p>
<p>Many of the associated apps have uses beyond this space, as well. Apps like Netflix Party and Discord, for example, help people experience movies and media together. And more people are<a href="/blog/ws/2020/11/23/content-marketing-trends"> creating digital content</a> than ever before. Online content creation was already reaching a fever pitch, and COVID-19 has resulted in a surge like never before —meaning there is an opportunity for content hosting here, as well.</p>
<p>Again, once the worst of the pandemic has finally passed, we may see a slight decline in usage for both gaming and streaming media. At the same time, with such considerable surges in users and viewership, the outlook for these two entertainment sectors is highly positive. As we move from 2020 into 2021, expect digital entertainment to continue along its current growth path.</p>
<h2>Adapting to a newly digital world</h2>
<p>The <a href="/blog/ws/2020/03/13/covid-19-response">coronavirus pandemic didn&#8217;t just change the world</a>. It <em>continues </em>to do so. As a direct result of COVID-19, we&#8217;ve seen the rise and fall of multiple industries and sectors, alongside a massive shift in how we both live and work.</p>
<p>These shifts, as are many of the changes that result from periods of great turmoil, are permanent. Just as the recent Great Recession led to the creation of companies like Uber, Airbnb, and Venmo, COVID-19 will see the rise and fall of many new businesses, and lasting changes across many industries. The SaaS businesses described above are the clear <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/28/resilient-digital-agencies-2020">winners in this shift</a>, but they are not the only victors.</p>
<p>SaaS businesses of every category likely have a positive outlook moving forward. As does any organization that can effectively leverage SaaS. This software is, after all, one of the driving factors in digitization, and will continue to support our march towards a virtual future, even once the pandemic is finally behind us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s no question that 2020 has been a big year for the transition towards an online work environment. As a result of COVID-19, business owners have been nudged towards the idea of having their employees collaborate through remote means.</p>

</div>
<p>More and more companies are realizing that being in the same office simply isn’t a must anymore, which is mainly due to the massive advancements in modern day software. That being said, you might still be wondering which tools are actually worth your time and money.</p>
<p>Well, we’ve come up with seven candidates to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ringblaze</li>
<li>Chanty</li>
<li>Zoom</li>
<li>ProofHub</li>
<li>Google Docs</li>
<li>Filestage</li>
<li>Venngage</li>
</ol>
<p>This article will cover over each tool, its purpose, features and benefits, use cases, and pricing so you can decide what&#8217;s best for your business. So without further ado, let’s get into it!</p>
<h2>Top 7 remote collaboration tools—2021 edition</h2>
<p>These seven collaboration tools can help remote teams with a variety of aspects of running a business: customer service, content creation and feedback, infographic creation, meetings, and more. We’re going to cover each tool, its highlights, and pricing to help you decide which tools are right for your business.</p>
<p>(And speaking of collaboration, here are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/12/cross-functional-collaboration">nine ways to improve cross-functional collaboration</a> on your team.)</p>
<h3>1. Ringblaze</h3>
<p>Countless customer service representatives have needed to change things up by going remote to avoid contracting the coronavirus that’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/28/2020-year-in-review-ppc">sent this year for a whirl</a>. Seeing as that’s the case, it’s key to have a robust VoIP solution in place to ensure that everything continues to run smoothly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ringblaze.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ringblaze</a> is an industry favorite for a few reasons. Perhaps the most significant one is just how stress-free it is to implement. You can start taking calls within the first 15 minutes of getting Ringblaze which is blazingly fast (hence the name) compared to competitors.</p>
<p>You don’t even need to download any mobile or desktop apps just to get it working, which further cuts down on the total setup time. Ease-of-use is taken to the next level with Ringblaze’s smart dashboard.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="43dc425f-e83a-43b7-9faf-7e5cc36b9908" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20remote20collaboration20tools20for20202120ringblaze.png" alt="best remote collaboration tools for 2021 ringblaze" width="800" height="425" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Even if your team members are spread out across multiple continents, it will still be a breeze to keep everyone on the same page and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points">ensure that customers get the help they need</a> without having to wait for an eternity.</p>
<p>In essence, duplicate callbacks (which are very annoying on both ends) will be a thing of the past once you make this blazing switch. There are also points in the affordability category that Ringblaze nails right on the head.</p>
<p>You’ll get a 20% discount if you pay annually, 20% if you subscribe within 24 hours of the demo, and did we mention that the demo is 100% free with no strings attached? The icing on the cake is the fact that you can use Ringblaze for internal calls at the low rate of $0.24/minute.</p>
<p>Monthly plans are available for as low as $15/user.</p>
<h3>2. Chanty</h3>
<p>Communicating with your team is one of the most important aspects of remote collaboration. Let’s not kid ourselves, we all have a few anti-social tendencies lurking within us. That’s likely the reason why the majority of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/04/chatbots">online conversations</a> take place through text.</p>
<p>Platforms like <a href="https://www.chanty.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chanty</a> help people work together on group projects by making the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/02/client-communication">communication process easier</a> and far more seamless — almost like you’re in the same room, coordinating your efforts towards a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/15/marketing-objectives">joint goal</a>.</p>
<p>Whether you need to make an announcement in a public channel or have a one-on-one talk with a collaborator via private messages, Chanty lets you do all that and more in an intuitive manner. The platform never makes you jump through hoops just to complete basic tasks.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="84108c18-7696-4e94-a120-34b7784bf631" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20remote20collaboration20tools20for20202120chanty.png" alt="best remote collaboration tools for 2021 chanty" width="800" height="465" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Teams who use Chanty will be able to reap the benefits of the 20GB cloud storage (even for free users.) This prevents situations where you have to hop between multiple websites because all your files are kept on third-party cloud solutions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the developers are always innovating. This is evident with their recent addition of a <a href="https://www.chanty.com/blog/kanban-project-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kanban board</a>, not to mention the ever-growing list of integrations that are compatible with Chanty. You might think that a software suite with so much to offer would be pricey, right?</p>
<p>Actually, no. The platform lets teams of 10 members or less use the free plan without any time limits whatsoever. If you upgrade to the business tier, then it’ll only cost you $3/month for each user and yield some bonuses like <em>even more</em> storage as well as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/18/best-webinar-platforms">video conferencing</a>.</p>
<h3>3. Zoom</h3>
<p>Chanty and Ringblaze are both great communication tools to use when collaborating remotely, but our coverage wouldn’t be complete without the video conferencing platform that’s made headlines with its meteoric stock/revenue/userbase rise this year: Zoom!</p>
<p>Despite suffering from security vulnerabilities (which are reportedly fixed now), the software has been zooming past <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/18/ppc-competitor-analysis">competitors</a> with ease. <a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zoom</a> likes having things both ways in that it’s just as useful for compact teams and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/17/small-business-marketing-tools">small businesses</a> as it is for large corporations.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0c679cbd-3a69-4ed6-9694-4d71a9799b10" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20remote20collaboration20tools20for20202120zoom.png" alt="best remote collaboration tools for 2021 zoom" width="800" height="530" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/27/how-to-scale-an-agency">scalability</a> aspect is a big pro, and features like being able to host 100 participants on the free plan are a testament to the value that Zoom provides. While it’s true that you’ll have a 40-minute cap on group meetings unless you upgrade, that’s still a decent amount of time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there aren’t any limits on how long one-on-one video calls last which is quite generous and handy. If you’re dead set on removing the group conference time limit, then you can always upgrade to the pro plan which costs $15/month.</p>
<p>You can also get the equivalent of two months free by paying for the subscription on a yearly basis rather than at the end of each month. However, we’d recommend you try the platform out for a month or two before committing to a full year in the interest of due diligence.</p>
<p>It’s always wise to be sure a software has everything you need before agreeing to an annual plan, after all. If you do end up upgrading, you’ll get 1GB for cloud recordings which will be extremely useful if you’re the type to archive old <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/07/marketing-meetings">meetings</a> and review them at a later date.</p>
<h3>4. ProofHub</h3>
<p>When it comes to an all-inclusive project management solution, there are few platforms that could come close to the comprehensive performance of <a href="https://www.proofhub.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProofHub</a>. It truly lives up to its title of “all-in-one project planning software.”</p>
<p>One thing that makes ProofHub unique in comparison to other platforms out there is the fact that it charges a flat monthly rate rather than increasing your subscription price as you add more users. That means you could have an unlimited number of team members at the same cost.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="b7c9dc6b-0fc8-4084-8deb-88d3a8a1a2af" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>ProofHub is a platform built around synergy which is why it should come as no surprise that most of its users rarely use any third-party tools. Speaking of ProofHub’s customers, Netflix, Nike, NASA, and Google are just a few of the businesses that rely on its functionality.</p>
<p>What really stood out to us is the flexible white labelling accommodations that ProofHub has implemented (at least on its top subscription tier.) You can set up a branded sign-in page, insert the company logo, then use colors and themes that match your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/07/31/brand-voice">business identity</a>.</p>
<p>Other features that simplify the collaboration process for remote workers include a native time tracker to log billable hours, multilingual support on the user interface, shared notes, and third-party integrations for popular software.</p>
<p>There are two plans to choose from with ProofHub (neither of which have a user limit): essential or ultimate control. The former costs $50/month while the latter will run you $99/month. Both of which also drop in price by 5% if you pay for ProofHub annually.</p>
<h3>5. Google Docs</h3>
<p>Since its launch in 2006, <a href="https://www.google.com/docs/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Docs</a> has slowly but surely revolutionized the way we <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/23/cornerstone-content-guide">create content</a>. It’s turned document writing from a lone wolf activity into a team sport where multiple people can contribute to the final result.</p>
<p>A myriad of subtle features help shape the user experience for all those who count on Google Docs as their primary word processor. For instance, you can add comments with a single click and mark them as resolved just as easily.</p>
<p>While it may seem rather mundane at first glance, this is the type of functionality that really streamlines the editorial process for writers who need feedback on their rough drafts. On the topic of drafts, Google Docs provides file versioning so you can restore changes at any time.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="16857f25-fd06-44be-ad67-f9829c04e756" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20remote20collaboration20tools20for20202120google20docs.png" alt="best remote collaboration tools for 2021 google docs" width="800" height="417" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>It even lets you name the different versions so you don’t have to worry about forgetting which one is which. Beyond that, collaborators can also suggest changes which the writer can then accept or decline with the software automatically implementing the revisions accordingly.</p>
<p>These little conveniences save a lot of time in the long run. At the end of the day, you can’t argue with the value that Google Docs provides; not only because it’s immeasurably useful but also due to the fact that it’s free.</p>
<p>Considering it’s one of G Suite’s core offerings, it’s highly likely that more improvements are yet to come. This word processor has been a major <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/17/local-lead-generation-strategies">lead magnet</a> for Google services and marks its win against Microsoft’s Word so they’re not going to be abandoning support for it anytime soon.</p>
<h3>6. Filestage</h3>
<p>Google Docs has a lot of features that focus on the revision process that many teams go through in order to put out superb content. <a href="https://filestage.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Filestage</a>, however, has built its entire value proposition around the feedback-approval dynamic.</p>
<p>Filestage claims to provide <em>“everything busy marketing and creative teams need to streamline feedback and approval of their work.”</em> If you ask their users, they’d mostly agree that the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">website’s statement</a> is right on the mark.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="fd960e0e-caaf-406c-a42e-9a26ffe8d860" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20remote20collaboration20tools20for20202120filestage.png" alt="best remote collaboration tools for 2021 filestage" width="800" height="330" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>The usual features like commenting on documents are present in Filestage just as you’d expect. Although, things don’t stop there as you can also comment on audio, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/11/at-home-diy-video">video</a>, and images. This multiformat support makes providing feedback convenient regardless of the medium in question.</p>
<p>Capacity isn’t an issue since Filestage lets you upload as many files as you want to your projects, making it ideal for teams working on high-volume projects.</p>
<p>Filestage’s starter plan costs €99/month while the pro tier costs €249/month. Both of these plans let you add up to 10 users but if you need more people on board, then you can reach out to the sales team for an enterprise quote.</p>
<p>In case you’re wondering why all the prices are in euros, it’s because Filestage is a Germany-based company and Europe is its target audience. Still, there are many American businesses that utilize Filestage in their day-to-day operations.</p>
<h3>7. Venngage</h3>
<p>Finally, let’s show some love to the graphic designers who read our articles by going over <a href="https://venngage.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Venngage</a>, a free infographic maker with two paid plans for more advanced users. Creating an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/07/25/infographic-types">infographic</a> can be very time-consuming since there are a lot of small details that go into it.</p>
<p>Venngage speeds the whole process up by letting you create your infographics in three steps: choosing a template, adding charts or visuals, and making customizations to the design that you’ve created.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="87c9e364-3ce3-4e21-b8b2-a53c2bcc56e3" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20remote20collaboration20tools20for20202120venngage.png" alt="best remote collaboration tools for 2021 venngage" width="936" height="478" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>It’s the quickest way to create stunning infographics that get the message across in an instant. Microsoft, Airbnb, and WIRED are some of the names that you’ll find on Venngage’s user list (comprising over 20,000 companies).</p>
<p>The premium plan, priced at $19/month, lets you share your infographics privately instead of posting them with public visibility like free users do. The business plan might seem overpriced at $49/month, but the premium templates, charts, and icons are well worth it.</p>
<p>You’ll also get priority support, personal consultation sessions, and access to live workshops when you upgrade. If you’re using Venngage for educational purposes, then you’ll only have to pay $99/year and will be able to add 35 accounts for either students or teachers.</p>
<p>Overall, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better design platform that provides a wide range of customizability without any hassle to go along with it. It’s worth noting that PDF and PNG are the export formats supported so if you need JPG infographics, you’ll need to convert them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN">For traditional founders and team leaders, the idea of running a completely remote business is fraught with anxiety. Yes, there’s an opportunity to lower overheads and recruit from anywhere, but is it really worth it at the expense of growing a cohesive brand culture under one (literal, physical) roof?</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="align-center" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/remote-startup-management-guide.jpg" alt="how to manage a startup remotely" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="86fba740-0b82-4ce1-8c08-4c582887fe39" /></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Many businesses have had to find out quickly if remote working works for them (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/13/covid-19-response">for obvious 2020 reasons</a>), but lots of successful startups recognized the benefits long before a pandemic forced their hand. Companies like <strong>Buffer</strong>, <strong>Mozilla</strong>, and <strong>Zapier</strong> have blazed a trail when it comes to WFH, while tech giants <strong>Twitter</strong> and <strong>Google</strong> are now offering their staff the opportunity to work remotely forever.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">So, <em>how</em> do they make it work?</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">As we’ll discover in this post, there are few key elements to getting it right, namely in the <strong>hiring</strong>, <strong>growing</strong>, and <strong>managing</strong> stages. And woven throughout are the three non-negotiable core principles of remote working:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Trust</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Communication</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Collaboration</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Without further ado, here are our best tips to grow your startup remotely and build a culture from wherever your people are.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">1. Hiring remotely: Spot and recruit talent quickly</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">The best thing about growing your startup remotely is that you’re not limited to your local talent pool. You can cast your net far and wide to find the best people for your situation, no matter where in the world they’re based.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Yet, while the choice of applicants is undoubtedly larger, the goal of hiring for a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/11/how-to-get-a-remote-job">remote job</a> isn’t all that different from hiring in-person. Ultimately, you’re still being tasked with spotting, vetting, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/05/08/marketing-interview-questions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewing talent</a><span lang="EN"> — you’re just doing it entirely online.</span></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="align-center" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/recruiting-and-hiring-remotely-for-a-startup.jpg" alt="remote hiring tips" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="06c0ccba-a8a0-4a5a-940a-2a673ff2601c" /></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Let’s take a look at how to do this effectively.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">How to Identify Talent for Your Startup </span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">The aim of any recruitment drive (short-term or long-term, online or off) is to <strong>find and hire people you can trust</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">But doing this remotely for a fast-growing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/23/ways-startups-can-stand-out-saturated-market">startup</a> introduces an element of time pressure. You can’t always stick an ad up on social media and wait for an influx of applicants. Sometimes you need to go out there and find the right candidate yourself, fast.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">The good news is, there are a number of digital platforms designed for this. <a href="https://traktion.ai/blog/fiverr-alternatives">Websites like </a><a href="https://traktion.ai/blog/fiverr-alternatives"><strong>Upwork</strong></a><a href="https://traktion.ai/blog/fiverr-alternatives">, </a><a href="https://traktion.ai/blog/fiverr-alternatives"><strong>Fiverr</strong></a><a href="https://traktion.ai/blog/fiverr-alternatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> and others</a><span lang="EN"> are solid options for low-skilled, one-off, or short-term needs. You can usually find a verified freelancer for simple graphic design, data-entry, or copywriting tasks on these sites with very little fuss.</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Hiring remotely for high-skilled, core team roles, on the other hand, requires a slightly different approach. There’s more risk involved when building your team, rather than simply delegating smaller tasks to hourly freelancers. You need to ensure that anyone you’re adding to your payroll has the right mix of skills, personality, and culture fit to hit the ground running – otherwise, you’re back to square one.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Beyond the conventional freelance or contractor hiring sites, new platforms are starting up and changing the game by handling the burden of due diligence and filtering out anyone who doesn’t fit your needs and profile. They’re bringing in things like strict vetting, using technical assessments, video interviews, and reference checks. This reduces the amount of time and energy you spend on assessing the suitability – or credibility – of a candidate, and means that you can hire smarter, quicker. </span></p>

<h2><span lang="EN">2. Growing remotely: Implement the right tools and processes</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Speaking at a <a href="https://twitter.com/pritianka/status/1133931455623524352" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Startups panel</a><span lang="EN">, Sid Sijbrandij, co-founder and CEO of GitLab said that entropy is lower for remote startups. Why? <strong>Because everything is written down</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">“There is less shoulder tapping. Days are more predictable,” according to Sid.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">So, to grow your startup remotely <em>without</em> disruption, you need to nail those processes. Write everything down. And remember, communication is key here.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Repeat: Communication is key</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">As we’ve mentioned, along with trust, communication and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/12/cross-functional-collaboration">cross-functional collaboration</a>  are non-negotiables when it comes to effective remote working. You <em>need</em> transparent communication processes to enable effective collaboration. You also need buy-in from your team; every single one of them must grasp the importance of regular contact with their co-workers.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">It’s, therefore, a good idea to <strong>start each day with a team check-in</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Just as you would have a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/07/marketing-meetings">stand-up meeting or a scrum in the office</a><span lang="EN">, jumping onto a video call first thing gives you a chance to address questions and concerns, ensures that everyone knows what they’re doing, and gives your team the chance to see and speak to one another. This also keeps siloes from forming, or individuals becoming lonely or disenfranchised.</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Over and above this, you should also run regular, company-wide meetings (monthly or quarterly) to keep everyone in the loop regarding overall progress and provide opportunities for internal feedback. </span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Choose and use the right remote management tools</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">To get your remote team up-to-speed and communicating like pros, you need to provide them with the right set of tools.</span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">At a minimum, this should include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Company email for formal communication.</span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Slack</span></strong><span lang="EN"> or <strong>Teams </strong>to power day-to-day internal messaging.</span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Zoom</span></strong><span lang="EN"> or <strong>Google Meet </strong>for quality, reliable video calls.</span></li>

<h2><span lang="EN">3. Managing remotely: You’re learning all the time</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/06/16/working-remotely">Managing a remote team is not without its challenges</a><span lang="EN">. And perhaps the most significant of those is the fact that you don’t get as much in-person face-to-face time with your employees.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Sure, you can hop on a video call, but it can still be difficult to pick up on subtle emotional cues and changes in body language that you might spot if you were sitting in the same room. This means you could miss out on identifying the employees who need your help the most.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="align-center" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-manage-a-remote-team.jpg" alt="remote management tips for startups" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="13cd25bb-f7a9-448f-9555-6b5701110531" /></p>
<p><span lang="EN">To guard against this, you need to ensure that your employees are motivated by meaningful work, that they know that you care about them (professionally and personally), and that they have an avenue through which to express concerns, ask questions, and offer feedback.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Motivation is mission-critical</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Here’s the truth: <a href="https://randsinrepose.com/archives/bored-people-quit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bored People Quit</a><span lang="EN">.</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">It’s up to you to make things non-boring. And the best thing about working in a startup, in general, is that each person has a very specialized, significant role geared towards growth. Everyone can see that what they’re doing is having an impact.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">This has to remain true even when you’re growing your startup remotely. Every single employee should have visibility (and be visible) as you pursue your next growth milestone. They cannot be allowed to work in a silo, wondering if what they’re doing really matters.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Publicly celebrate success</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">A continuation of the last point, to keep your startup team motivated, you can’t let an individual or group win slip under the radar without a bit of fanfare — <em>especially</em> when you’re working remotely.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Something as simple as a public congratulations (with all your favorite Emojis and Gifs) on your general Slack channel will quickly draw attention to good work and those responsible. You could even <a href="https://www.compt.io/hr-articles/why-remote-employees-need-perks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spring for some perks</a><span lang="EN"> to make things extra special.</span></span></p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em>WordStream recognizes and celebrates employees who embody our core values each month at our all-hands meeting</em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Plus, publicly celebrating success shows that you’re paying attention (employees feel valued) and that you truly care. Same goes for highlighting important milestones in your employees’ personal lives. Give shout outs for birthdays, charity work, family events; prove that you’re interested in more than their work performance.   </span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Do regular performance reviews</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Regular performance reviews are a staple of every successful business, but they take on extra significance when you’re growing a remote startup.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Once you’ve set expectations and clarified what success looks like, a remote performance review provides a designated, structured touchpoint for each employee to reflect on their role, their performance, and look ahead to their next period’s goals and objectives. What’s more, performance reviews offer a platform for your employee to share concerns or provide you with honest feedback on how <em>you’re</em> doing.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">This formal one-to-one is conducive to a healthy remote working environment, but it shouldn’t be the only opportunity for dialogue. Try to schedule regular, informal meetings to check-in frequently over a <a href="https://www.jotform.com/blog/virtual-coffee-breaks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(virtual) coffee</a><span lang="EN"> — this will give you the chance to catch any minor issues early before they mushroom into real problems.</span></span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">The bottom line: To succeed remotely, lead by example</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">If you’re going to succeed in growing your startup remotely, you can’t just pay lip service to the core principles of remote working. <strong>You need to eat, sleep and breathe communication, collaboration, and trust – putting them into practice at every opportunity.</strong></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Of course, there’s a balance to be struck. You need to trust that your employees can work autonomously, but you can’t be so hands-off that they feel abandoned. And you need to ensure that lines of communication remain open, but you shouldn’t micromanage and insert yourself into every conversation or collaboration.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">In short, you need to lead by example, showing your employees how it’s done. Remember, trust is earned. “Do as I say, not as I do” simply won’t cut it in the world of remote working.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By now, everyone knows that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/13/covid-19-response" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Covid-19 is decimating small businesses</a> across the country; fewer are aware that the negative impact of the pandemic has fallen disproportionately on Black businesses. If you’re a Black business owner, that might not come as news, but for many, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/18/us/coronavirus-black-owned-small-business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the recent New York Times analysis</a> of the impact of Covid-19 on Black businesses came as a real shock.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="align-center" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/black-owned-businesses-pandmic-impact.png" alt="Everyone knows that Covid-19 is decimating small businesses across the country; fewer are aware that the negative impact of the pandemic has fallen disproportionately on Black businesses." data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="7d2771de-99ad-4e01-9021-fa84ec485d32" /></p>
<p>That analysis also acted as something of a wake-up call. Look just a little deeper than the headline figures, as we&#8217;ll do in this article, and you&#8217;ll see that the analysis reveals some troubling aspects of the way that we in America do business. Specifically, it shows that the kind of community-based commerce that our country was founded on is in danger of disappearing; instead of buying goods from community stores, shoppers now increasingly buy them online, often from giant corporations like Amazon.</p>
<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll take a closer look at why Black-owned businesses have been hit so hard by the pandemic, how they can survive, and what we can do to help. And, if you’re a business owner yourself, we’ll share some resources for how you can bring more attention to your business and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/10/boost-holiday-sales-and-revenue"><u>drive more sales this holiday season</u></a>.</p>
<h2>Unbalanced effects</h2>
<p>First, let&#8217;s take a look at how the pandemic has affected Black business owners. The figures make for sobering reading. In research reported in the NYT, more than 40%of Black business owners reported they weren’t working in April – that is, during the time when businesses were feeling the worst of the pandemic’s economic consequences. Only 17% of white small business owners said the same. These figures come from <a href="https://siepr.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/20-022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an analysis</a> of government data by Robert Fairlie of the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="align-center" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/support20black20owned20businesses.jpg" alt="Black-owned businesses have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus pandemic, making it even more important to support them." data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="59b9a859-0011-4a92-a56a-8b7cbffaa3bb" /></p>
<p>The Times article goes on to sum up the ways in which Covid-19 has disproportionately affected Black businesses, and how this builds on discrimination that these same businesses already face. For example, Black people are <a href="https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than twice as likely</a> as other Americans to die of the coronavirus, and they are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/03/us/minneapolis-police-use-of-force.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much more likely</a> to be victims of police violence.</p>
<p>From the perspective of someone who works in tech, however, there are also some very interesting implications of these data. <a href="https://www.vendasta.com/blog/the-impact-of-covid-19-on-the-digital-advertising-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Look a little deeper</a>, and you&#8217;ll see that the primary way in which struggling Black businesses are seeking to weather this storm is through cutting back on their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">social media marketing</a> and their budgets for other digital marketing efforts. This makes their businesses <strong>less visible</strong> and <strong>less competitive</strong> online.</p>
<h2>The shift to digital retail</h2>
<p>Take even a quick look at the way that people in America shop now, and you&#8217;ll immediately see that technology has transformed the very basis of retail in our country. Voice search accounted for <a href="https://brainstation.io/career-guides/how-to-become-an-seo-specialist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one in five searches</a> as long ago as 2016 according to Google, and most people will visit one of the huge online marketplaces (Amazon, mainly) to look for items to purchase.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="align-center" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/amazon-searches-vs-google-searches.png" alt="Voice search accounted for one in five searches as long ago as 2016 according to Google, and most people will visit one of the huge online marketplaces (Amazon, mainly) to look for items to purchase." data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="4e85fb97-80e0-4b61-be6f-7c6991f1c1ea" /></p>
<p>This means that businesses with less technological expertise or smaller budgets are falling further behind those that can afford to spend big on digital advertising. And this, in turn, means that some Black businesses are falling behind their white-owned counterparts in an environment where consumers are moving all their spending online.</p>
<p>In 2020, white-owned businesses <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/03/facebook-ad-discrimination/518718/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still dominate online advertising</a>, and even in niche areas like payment systems, Black-owned businesses tend to offer fewer options than their white-owned counterparts.</p>
<p>All of these factors affect Black business owners disproportionately. But what is to be done?</p>
<h2>4 ways to support Black-owned businesses (or promote your own)</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s get one thing out of the way first. Many of the recent guides that purport to tell people how they <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-support-black-owned-businesses-according-to-black-entrepreneurs-2020-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can support their local Black-owned businesses</a> start by telling them to look online for Black-owned versions of their favorite stores. In my opinion, this doesn’t go far enough. Which brings me to my first point…</p>
<h3>1. Embrace a radical shift in the way you shop</h3>
<p>The fact is that many Black businesses, and especially the small, community-focused businesses that are most at risk from the current economic storm, do not have websites. This is, in fact, a large part of the reason why they are so vulnerable: <a href="https://hostingcanada.org/best-ecommerce-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research shows that 48% of people</a> start to search for a product on online marketplaces before looking for it on their street.</p>
<p>In practice, this means that supporting your local, Black-owned businesses means a more radical shift than trying to find a Black-owned Amazon. It requires taking responsibility for all of your purchases and viewing each as a political act.</p>
<p>In other words: to keep these businesses solvent, we will have to change the way we shop. Instead of relying on Amazon searches, we&#8217;re going to have to take the time to search for small businesses within our own communities, and consciously choose to make purchases from them instead.</p>
<p><em><strong>Related:</strong> </em>August is <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/support-national-black-business-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Business Month</a>. Make sure to show your support using these ideas!</p>
<h3>2. Set goals and track your purchases from Black-owned stores</h3>
<p>There are plenty of tools that can help you make this shift. The <a href="https://myblackreceipt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My Black Receipt</a> campaign became popular because people were tired of the lack of support for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/where-to-find-black-owned-b2b-business-partners-vendors-contractors-2020-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black-owned businesses</a>. You can use it to keep track of how many of your purchases are made in Black-owned stores.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="align-center" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/my-black-receipt.png" alt="The My Black Receipt campaign became popular because people were tired of the lack of support for Black-owned businesses.

<p>There are also sites that will help you to make a spending commitment: You can check out <a href="https://blog.helloalice.com/black-owned-business-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HelloAlice&#8217;s database of Black-owned businesses</a> across the US or <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=2133" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charity Navigator&#8217;s list of vetted charities and nonprofits</a> dedicated to women&#8217;s health, education, and social services.</p>
<h3>3. Spread the word about your favorite Black-owned brands</h3>
<p>If you are making purchases from these businesses, you should also take a moment to help them out where you can make a difference: Build up their <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/why-good-online-reputation-is-important/"><u>online reputation</u></a> by sharing your experience on social media, leaving a review, and generally drawing people&#8217;s attention to a store that might have little (or no) online presence. Word of mouth will bring them more business and sales and help them <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/17/businesses-likely-to-thrive-post-covid">thrive</a>.</p>
<h3>4. Participate in #BlackOwnedFriday</h3>
<p>In May of 2020, there was a huge surge in search interest for Black-owned businesses, and this interest has remained elevated in the following months.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="align-center" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/black-owned-business-search-volume.png" alt="In May of 2020, there was a huge surge in search interest for Black-owned businesses, and this interest has remained elevated in the following months. " data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="e54f0200-5ffb-4e6c-8bef-62fd63a398f6" /></p>
<p>Google took notice. #BlackOwnedFriday is a Google-led initiative, in partnership with the <a href="https://usblackchambers.org/">US Black Chambers, Inc.</a>, to encourage American consumers to support Black businesses during the 2020 holiday shopping season. Here’s how you can get involved:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you’re a shopper,</strong> check out <a href="https://smallbusiness.withgoogle.com/blackowned#!">these resources from Google</a> and find a new favorite business to support. Tell your friends about these resources and encourage them to get involved. Use the hashtag to promote the effort on your social media accounts.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="align-center" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/support-black-owned-businesses-badge.png" alt="If you're a Black business owner, add Google's Black Business Owner badge to your Google My Business listing and your website." data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="042385a4-0bbd-4b26-8d2b-2cf204ba5f41" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you’re a Black business owner yourself, </strong><a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/black-owned.pdf">f</a><a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/black-owned.pdf">ollow these simple steps to add the Black-owned business badge to your website</a>. Google is also offering <a href="https://smallbusiness.withgoogle.com/holiday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free resources for small businesses</a> who want to improve their <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/digital-marketing/how-to-get-noticed-with-a-stand-out-online-presence/">online presence</a> ahead of the holiday shopping rush.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The bottom line</h2>
<p>If we are all willing to take responsibility for our actions, we might yet save the local, Black-owned community store from destruction. Let’s all do our part this year and commit to changing the way we shop forever. In sum, here are the top four ways you can support the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/22/cause-based-marketing">cause</a> of Black-owned businesses in your community:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shift your mindset when it comes to where and how you buy</li>
<li>Use tools to track your purchases from Black-owned businesses</li>
<li>Support your favorite Black businesses with reviews and word of mouth</li>
<li>Participate in the #BlackOwnedFriday initiative</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the world grapples with COVID-19, it is imperative to take into account what the post-COVID world is going to mean for those of us in the digital marketing realm. The pandemic has accelerated the speed at which we are “going digital” and has given new power to many online industries. Never before have we been so dependent on Amazon or Zoom to simply get through the day, which means that as digital marketers, we want to make decisions that use this new reliance on technology to our advantage.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/marketing20strategies20that20make20the20most20of20covid-19_0.png" alt="marketing strategies that make the most of covid-19" width="500" height="369" /></div>
<p>This article is going to cover six ways to do that. I’m going to discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>The strategies that you can and should put into place to market successfully in a post-pandemic world.</li>
<li>Tools you’ll want to have by your side to increase your efficiency and increase your ROI.</li>
<li>Ways to use your pre-COVID foundation to build a well-run system that works for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s get started.</p>
<p><em>And as the world continues to open back up, don&#8217;t forget to check out these <a href="/blog/ws/2021/05/12/inspiring-post-covid-marketing-ideas">inspiring post-COVID marketing ideas</a>!</em></p>
<h2>1. Focus on the customers you already have</h2>
<p>If you are struggling to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/07/12/get-more-customers"> bring in new customers</a>, try focusing more on the ones you already have or who are still with you <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/24/marketing-during-recession">despite the economic downturn</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to creating services and ad campaigns to target their new needs, you may also want to issue refunds to clients who had prepaid memberships or were on auto-pay during the lockdown period. While this could hurt your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/06/23/managing-cash-flow">cashflow</a> for the short term, the money you give back will most likely come back to you tenfold when the economy restabilizes and your now <a href="/blog/ws/2016/11/10/customer-loyalty">loyal customers</a> are ready to start buying again.</p>
<p>Neil Patel, for example, started to offer his premium <a href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UberSuggest</a> features with the free version. But while he saw a decrease in free trial signups, he did see an outpouring of appreciation from dozens of people within the industry, emailing and thanking him, and some even buying the paid plan as a gesture of their gratitude.</p>
<p>Also, while he did not see more money coming in, he DID see <a href="/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">more traffic</a> coming in.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/digital20strategies20that20make20the20most20of20covid-1920focus20on20existing20clients.png" alt="digital strategies that make the most of covid-19 focus on existing clients" width="800" height="371" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/covid-19-marketing/">Image Source</a></em></p>
<p>The point is, look out for your customers, clients, and coworkers when times are tough and unemployment rates are high. They will thank you for it in some way or another. And you will likely see growth in other areas such as customer loyalty,<a href="/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness"> brand awareness</a>, organic traffic, social media engagement, and maybe even new <a href="/blog/ws/2020/05/27/prospecting-strategies-during-covid-19">prospects</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The point is, look out for your customers, clients, and coworkers when times are tough and unemployment rates are high.</strong></p></blockquote>
<h2>2. Move everything online</h2>
<p>With the lockdowns and travel restrictions of the pandemic, it&#8217;s no surprise that everything is shifting online. Scott Jones, the CEO of 123InternetGroup told <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2020/03/20/why-companies-turn-to-digital-marketing-to-survive-covid-19/#5b18261a2425">Forbes</a> that they have seen a spike in companies who want to create or update websites, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business">create new social media campaigns</a> focused on home-based workers, and focus more on <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/31/2020-ecommerce-marketing-trends">ecommerce trends and channels</a>.</p>
<p>Now is the time to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/reasons-your-web-presence-more-important-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase your online presence</a>. You likely already have some of your business functions online (perhaps you&#8217;re using one of <a href="/blog/ws/2017/03/17/small-business-marketing-tools">these 64 affordable online marketing tools</a>) but the pandemic has shown us just how much more we can do online.</p>
<p>For example, you could <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/01/automated-email-marketing">automate your email communication</a> or even your services. iNECTA, a cloud ERP software for the food industry now allows customers to receive merchandise, track lots, create invoices, and manage their food business all through a tool that is 100% online.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/digital20strategies20that20make20the20most20of20COVID-1920move20everything20online.png" alt="digital strategies that make the most of COVID-19 move everything online" width="800" height="410" /></div>
<p>The same goes for something as basic as <a href="/growth-academy">online classes</a>. Preply, a language learning company, saw a spike in sales after COVID-19 because they were ahead in the game. No matter what industry you are in, there are always more things you can take online, and having those capabilities will help to set you apart from your competitors and stand out to <a href="/blog/ws/2017/04/04/nurture-marketing">potential customers</a>.</p>
<p>A couple of ideas on what this might look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Investing in a good customer relationship management (CRM) software.</li>
<li>Hosting informative <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/18/best-webinar-platforms">webinars</a> to build trust and attract new customers, or even to employees to take their skills up a notch.</li>
<li>Supporting your employees&#8217; <a href="/blog/ws/2017/06/16/working-remotely">work-from-home</a> needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bottom line is, the more processes you can bring online, the more you can stay engaged with your customers and employees, which is crucial for a <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/28/resilient-digital-agencies-2020">business to stay resilient and thrive</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The more processes you can bring online, the more you can stay engaged with your customers and employees, which is crucial for a business to stay resilient and thrive.</strong></p></blockquote>
<h2>3. Invest in Facebook ads</h2>
<p>As more people spend time at home and on social media, the ROI on PPC ads in many industries has skyrocketed. This is a good way to remind people that your business is alive and well and that you aim to be a very significant part of the ‘new normal’.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/digital20strategies20that20make20the20most20of20COVID-1920ad20ROI_0.png" alt="digital strategies that make the most of COVID-19 ad ROI" width="300" height="253" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/covid-19-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/31/low-budget-facebook-ad-campaigns">Facebook ads</a> in particular are quite affordable—<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/08/facebook-local-advertising">even for local businesses</a>—and can help you showcase any changes you have made to your business or any COVID-19-exclusive discounts or <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/13/sales-promotion-examples">promotions</a> you might be offering. Online ads have always been engaging, affordable, and well targeted, but now more than ever before, they offer you the ability to truly<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/05/maximize-agency-profitability"> scale your business</a>.</p>
<p>With <a href="/blog/ws/2015/10/20/facebook-audience">Facebook&#8217;s granular audience targeting capabilities</a>, you can reach customers based on gender, location, hobbies and interest, marital status, profession, and the list goes on.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/digital20marketing20strategies20that20work20during20covid-19.jpg" alt="digital marketing strategies that work during covid-19" width="800" height="725" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>To see all of Facebook&#8217;s ad targeting options, check out our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/27/facebook-ad-targeting-options-infographic">epic infographic here</a>.</em></p>
<p>The pandemic has also lowered the CPM (cost per thousand impressions) on ads since companies do not have a very big marketing budget to play around with. This is a good time to invest in a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/01/30/facebook-advertising-tips">good Facebook ads strategy</a> that can serve as an affordable way to <a href="/blog/ws/2019/10/17/b2b-lead-generation">bring in leads and sales</a> that will help you make more money.</p>
<p>Advertising messages are most effective when they are consistent and repeated. Which is what makes <a href="/blog/ws/2018/09/04/facebook-retargeting">Facebook retargeting</a> another strategy to try during/after the COVID-19 pandemic. With retargeting, you target your ads at people that have already had some form of contact with your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/14/use-branding-to-improve-advertising">brand</a>. Referring to my first point about investing in your existing customers—it really is the same logic.</p>
<h2>4. Run exclusive deals and offers</h2>
<p>As businesses begin to reopen, a good way to get people interested in coming in is by offering exclusive <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/13/sales-promotion-examples">sales promotions</a> or deals. You can announce or even advertise these offers on social media platforms as well as <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/21/promotional-email-examples">promotional emails</a>.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/digital20strategies20that20make20the20most20of20COVID-1920promote20exclusive20deals.png" alt="digital strategies that make the most of COVID-19 promote exclusive deals" width="800" height="359" /></div>
<p>These kinds of offers will help bring in new customers while also getting old ones interested in coming back. This idea can work for multiple industries (theatres, spas, gyms, etc.) but it works particularly well for <a href="/blog/ws/2020/06/02/new-data-google-ads-benchmarks-during-covid-19">industries that have been hit hard by the coronavirus</a>—restaurants and travel, for example.</p>
<p>Discounts, freebies, and similar saving options could be the incentive customers need to invest in you. You could even offer membership deals for customers that choose to invest in you during a certain time period. This will help you earn some money even when times are tough.</p>
<h2>5. Give your communication strategy an overhaul</h2>
<p>As people’s priorities and schedules change, the previous communication strategy you had in action may not be right. It would be wise to rethink the <a href="/blog/ws/2014/09/04/best-time-to-send-email-campaign">newsletters</a> you are sending out, the <a href="/blog/ws/2017/03/15/quality-content-defined">content you are creating</a>, and the general approach you have towards your customers.</p>
<p>This could mean redoing your content calendar altogether or maybe putting some blog posts on the backburner while you focus more on articles that cater to doubts, fears, and questions related to the current situation. This also means that you need to take the time to <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/18/post-covid-19-customers">get to know your post-COVID-19 customers</a>.</p>
<p>One way to do this is to send out an email survey with questions about their current priorities, pain points, and desires. Make them easy to answer (multiple choice or choose a point on a scale), but keep some questions open-ended because this way you might discover a few golden nuggets of information about your customers.</p>
<p>You can then use this information to rethink your communication strategy and serve your customers better.</p>
<p>You may even give your ads, emails, <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/11/at-home-diy-video">videos</a>, <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/05/webinar-marketing">webinars</a>, and podcast episodes an overhaul so you are keeping the current priorities of your customers in mind. (For more help in this area, head to our post on <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/02/marketing-during-covid-19">marketing during COVID-19</a>).</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/digital20strategies20that20make20the20most20of20COVID-1920communication20strategy.png" alt="digital strategies that make the most of COVID-19 communication strategy" width="800" height="482" /></div>
<p>Mediavine, an advertising network geared towards bloggers, did a great job with sending out regular emails both during and after the peak of the pandemic, with helpful resources, updates, and supportive messaging. Taking the time to <a href="/blog/ws/2020/05/21/client-communication-during-covid-19">communicate to your clients</a> that you are there for them right now will have a lasting impact beyond the pandemic.</p>
<h2>6. Focus on a few main paid advertising channels</h2>
<p>As I mentioned above, PPC ads are the way to go right now but focusing on <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/24/google-ads-optimization">Google Ads</a>, <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/29/linkedin-advertising-during-covid-19">LinkedIn ads</a>, Twitter ads, Facebook ads, and Instagram ads all at once is going to you no good. You need to figure out where your target audience is hanging out and then focus most of your PPC efforts on those channels.</p>
<p>So, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are a beauty business, your target audience is likely to be on Instagram.</li>
<li>If you have a more serious business like an <a href="/blog/ws/2020/01/28/ppc-campaigns-addiction-treatment-facilities">addiction treatment facility</a>, you could focus more on Google.</li>
<li>If you have a business-related tool or service like a <a href="/Keywords">keyword research tool</a>, LinkedIn would be your go-to.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Use these strategies to survive and thrive in the age of COVID-19</h2>
<p>Having a few solid digital marketing strategies to depend on while the world settles down can not only <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/17/businesses-likely-to-thrive-post-covid">help your business get back on its feet </a>but also give you a headstart against your competitors. The key piece of advice you should keep in mind is to focus on your customers’ priorities as much as your own.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every year, WordStream puts out a <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/20/state-of-the-internet-marketing-agency-report-2020">State of the Agency</a> report on what makes digital marketing firms tick. The findings help agencies and marketers orient themselves to the bigger picture and identify where and how they can improve.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://prometheanresearch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Promethean Research</a> has conducted a recent survey for digital agencies with regard to COVID-19. Rather than focusing solely on the negative impacts of the pandemic, the goal was to discover agencies or their particular functions that were doing well. The responses revealed that there are agencies out there that are not just surviving, but thriving in 2020; and also that there are patterns among these firms. Everything was compiled into one 72-page report called <u><a href="https://patternreport.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pattern Report</a>.</u></p>

</article>
</div>
<p>Here we have summarized the key takeaways of The Pattern Report. It will provide an overall picture of agency outlooks for the second half of 2020, as well as patterns of resilient firms in three key areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Operations—work environment, tools available, and team structures.</li>
<li>Management—including billing, people, and stress management.</li>
<li>Growth—in terms of offerings, marketing strategies, and capital.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The overall outlook of agencies for the second half of 2020</h2>
<p>Survey respondents skewed slightly towards more positive outlooks for the second half of the year: 36% of firms had an optimistic outlook while 24% had a pessimistic outlook. Almost half of respondents expected business conditions to remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Small firms tended to be more optimistic than large ones. Firms who specialize in real estate, consumer goods, government and <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/10/nonprofit-marketing-tactics">non-profit</a>, and professional services tended towards the most pessimistic outlook. Nearly 76% of respondents have the same or more positive outlook for the second half of 2020 compared to the first half.</p>

</div>
<h2>Patterns of optimistic digital agencies in 2020</h2>
<p>As mentioned, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/01/small-agency-strategies-during-covid-19">smaller firms</a> had more neutral or optimistic outlooks than larger firms. Looking more closely at these optimistic firms, much of their <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing/marketing-during-slow-economy-recession/">downtime</a> during the second quarter was spent reorganizing, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/07/unique-selling-proposition">repositioning</a>, restructuring their internal operations, and raising or intending to raise capital. Many were well-prepared for a distributed working environment and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/11/at-home-diy-video">remote tools</a> and were already starting to see increased client demand in May. Most firms have experienced project cancellations but haven’t renegotiated terms even when the cancellations are in breach of contract.</p>

<p>Firms that offered email marketing, <a href="/blog/ws/2019/12/18/ecommerce-marketing-strategies">ecommerce</a>, and <a href="/blog/ws/2017/04/17/content-marketing-stats">content marketing </a>services tended to have better expectations for the second half of 2020. Firms focusing on B2B services, education, government or public sector, healthcare, financial services, entertainment, or funded startups are more optimistic about the second half of the year. Respondents are stressed, but managers at optimistic firms are absorbing less stress from their team members and experiencing no changes (or an uptick) in <a href="/blog/ws/2015/03/26/productivity-tools">productivity</a>.</p>

<h2>Patterns of pessimistic digital agencies in 2020</h2>
<p>Pessimistic firms surveyed have seen drastic reductions in monthly recurring revenue, uncertainty around <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/13/marketing-agencies-retention-strategies-covid-19">contract renewals</a>, and concern over the destabilizing impact of COVID-19. Impacted verticals like tourism, hospitality, charity/<a href="/blog/ws/2016/02/09/marketing-for-nonprofits">not-for-profit</a>, and real estate are generally more pessimistic about the second half of the year. Firms report issues like uncertainty around the outlook of their industry vertical, slowing pipelines, paused projects, and client budgets being cut. They are having to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/05/21/client-communication-during-covid-19">renegotiate project payment terms</a>, failing to raise capital, and expect to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/16/facebook-ad-costs">cut expenses</a> in the future. Managers at pessimistic firms are more stressed than those at optimistic firms and absorb more stress from their teams.</p>

<p>One agency in the nonprofits, industry organizations, and government speciality category reported that “We went from $250k profit in Q1 to a projected $110k loss in Q2. Haven&#8217;t seen enough change to think Q3 and Q4 will <a href="/blog/ws/2020/05/04/ppc-rebound-covid-19-data">rebound</a> enough to give it anything other than 1/5 (for 2nd half of 2020 forecast).” Here are some additional quotes from the report:</p>

<h2>Growth tactics &amp; trends among resilient digital agencies in 2020</h2>
<p>We looked at how firms were growing their revenue this year and asked about client size and value, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/05/maximize-agency-profitability">profitability</a>, difficulty filling sales pipelines, and closing leads. We also asked managers what tactics they were using to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/17/b2b-lead-generation">improve lead generation and sales</a>. Here’s what respondents reported:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="4ab18d8b-c71b-4f77-8daf-b1ec67186748" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/digital20agency20outlook202020-20ease20of20closing20deals20vs20outlook.png" alt="digital agency outlook 2020- ease of closing deals vs outlook" width="800" height="712" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Even the most optimistic respondents reported having more trouble <a href="/blog/ws/2020/05/27/prospecting-strategies-during-covid-19">keeping their pipelines full </a>but the increase in difficulty is much less for optimistic firms than for pessimistic ones. Pessimistic firms that were considerably less confident in their outlook had the same level of difficulty filling their pipeline before the pandemic, but a much more difficult time filling it this quarter.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of firms were focused on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/30/cross-selling-upselling">upselling current accounts </a>to fill their pipelines, while half were focused on inbound/<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/17/content-marketing-stats">content marketing to drive leads</a>. The remainder are trying things like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/03/cold-email">cold email outreach</a> and advertising to boost leads. While all firms had a similar focus on upselling and inbound marketing, optimistic firms tended to put more of a focus on cold email outreach to generate leads. Pessimistic firms focused more on upselling current accounts to drive leads than other tactics while optimistic firms relied less on this tactic.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>“We want to make sure that digital shops are balancing their revenue channel focus and matching it to how quickly they need revenue. While upselling current accounts is one of the easiest and fastest paths to revenue growth, things like inbound marketing take time to drive meaningful results. From our research, cold outreach is the fastest way to drive business after upselling current accounts.”</em></strong><br />
-Nicholas Petroski, Managing Director at Promethean Research</p></blockquote>
<h2>The state of cash management among digital agencies in 2020</h2>
<p>We asked firms about cash reserves, capital (including type) raised versus intent to raise in the future, and expense reduction. Most firms appear to have enough <a href="/blog/ws/2020/06/23/managing-cash-flow">cash on hand</a>, with a slight skew towards “too little.” Only 11% raised capital in the last few months with only 10% expecting to raise in the next few. Three-quarters of respondents have reduced expenses already and just over half plan to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/20/stop-burning-your-adwords-budget">reduce expenses</a> in the next few months.</p>

</article>
</div>
<h2>How digital agencies are handling payments &amp; cancellations in 2020</h2>
<p>Firms reported on project cancellations, contract renegotiation, slow-paying accounts, and adjusting payment terms. While most firms have experienced project cancellations, only 35% of respondents noted a breach of agreement, and just under half didn’t ask for anything in exchange for the cancellation. Almost two-thirds of firms are experiencing delays in payment and only a fraction of firms are experiencing a client’s refusal to pay. In response, firms are changing their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/15/ppc-agency-pricing">pricing plans</a> to billing more frequently or getting bigger deposits. Firms that have not yet experienced a cancelation had better outlooks than those that saw all or portions of projects canceled.</p>

</article>
</div>
<h2>Operations and project management</h2>
<p>We surveyed firms on their operations and asked about their number of active projects compared to active project managers, whether those projects were on time and on budget, and we asked them about their productivity levels during the pandemic. Optimistic firms appear to have more effective <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/12/12/agency-tools">project management systems</a> and they were more likely to deliver projects on time and within budget than more pessimistic firms. Teams who limited active projects to 3–5 per PM also had a better outlook than firms with project managers who ran more than five projects at once. Most firms were just as or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/03/brainstorming-techniques">more productive</a> during the pandemic than prior to the months leading up to it.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="fe48b0a5-6983-4fc0-bf9f-d8afe8f77b61" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<blockquote><p><em>“When you can systemize your project management and avoid splitting your focus, you have better relationships with clients and can complete projects to a higher standard. Plus you can get them launched on time. This should have a positive impact on profitability, but it also lowers the likelihood that you will have to pump your sales pipeline with a higher number of smaller value projects.”</em><br />
-Rachel Gertz, Digital PM Trainer, Cofounder at <a href="https://louderthanten.com/">Louder Than Ten</a></p></blockquote>
<p>We surveyed respondents about <a href="/blog/ws/2017/06/16/working-remotely">remote work</a> policies, company distribution before and after the start of the pandemic, clarity around <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/07/marketing-meetings">internal communication</a>, and how effectively teams use their tools. Many of our respondents expect to see distributed work environments remain elevated through the first half of 2021. Those with more optimistic outlooks expect a much more significant increase in remote work (54% growth from pre-pandemic levels) than those with pessimistic outlooks (36% increase from pre-pandemic levels).</p>
<h2>Stress management</h2>
<p>We asked firms about their stress levels before and after the pandemic and whether respondents have the support networks they need. Pessimistic firms tended to experience slightly more stress than optimistic ones and we found owners with poor outlooks taking on slightly more stress from their teams. A good stress management tactic is to have a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/tips-to-help-your-business-build-a-sense-of-community/">community to lean on</a> which most of the respondents noted having. Communities like the <a href="https://bureauofdigital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bureau of Digital</a> are perfect options for digital marketing agencies to find support.</p>

<p><span lang="EN">In particular, our first instinct is to start questioning the worth of our marketing budget. However, what we fail to realize is that companies who curtail their marketing efforts during an economic downturn will actually end up jeopardizing their long-term market share. In this post, I&#8217;m going to break down why spending on marketing is oftentimes one of the best tactics you can employ to make your business recession-proof.</span></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>The importance and benefits of marketing during a recession.</li>
<li>Strategies to get more out of your existing budget.</li>
<li>Changes to make to accommodate a lower budget.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ll also provide real examples of businesses that not only came out on top of a recession because they continued marketing, but are still at the top of their industry today.</p>
<h2>Why should you continue marketing during a recession?</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Most of us are surprised to learn that increasing marketing during a recession can lead to growth.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">You see, companies that continue to market themselves during a recession <a href="https://www.microdinc.com/blog/keeping-your-brand-fresh/">stay on the forefront of the minds of consumers</a>, so when consumers gain back the money to spend, they instinctively turn towards these brands.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Also, when you <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing/marketing-during-slow-economy-recession/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue your marketing efforts despite an economic downturn</a>, the message you are putting out there to your audience is one of strength, leadership, and big-picture mindedness—all of which consumers are looking for during such uncertain times.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Even if you are not at your strongest, your clients and prospects will be attracted to whatever amount of stability you can provide.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Cutting down on marketing during a financial downturn, on the other hand, will reduce your online and offline presence, leaving the door wide open for competitors to take advantage and fill in the gaps.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>When consumers do gain back the money to spend, they will instinctively turn towards brands that have stayed top of mind. </strong></p></blockquote>
<h2>Strategies to make the most of your marketing budget during a recession</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">While you may not be able to market to your fullest capacity during a recession, pulling the plug completely just isn’t a viable option. Let&#8217;s talk about some ways to continue marketing while keeping your business well within its budget.</span></p>
<h3>1. Market to existing clients</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Having a <a href="/blog/ws/2016/11/10/customer-loyalty">loyal customer base</a> is your one true asset during a recession. It’s cheaper, simpler, and definitely more effective to market your products to your existing clientele rather than focusing your efforts to win new ones—and when we say cheaper, we mean a discrepancy of about <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5-25 times</a>.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">Let your existing clients know you appreciate them by <a href="/blog/ws/2020/05/21/client-communication-during-covid-19">keeping in touch</a> through appreciative emails, giving exclusive discounts, and so on. After all, they are the ones who make repeat purchases, retain your services, and best of all, recommend you to other <a href="/blog/ws/2020/05/27/prospecting-strategies-during-covid-19">prospects</a>.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong><span lang="EN">A loyal customer base is one of your best assets during a recession. </span></strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>2. Lean on consistent branding</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">There is no doubt that more effort needs to be put in during a recession. <span lang="EN">In the case of marketing, though, you may not actually need less effort, as there&#8217;s less “marketing noise“ for your marketing message to have to break through. </span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">What you do need to do is be consistent with <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/14/use-branding-to-improve-advertising">your branding</a> and keep <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/22/free-marketing-during-covid-19">engaging with your audience</a>. Developing a monthly plan of marketing strategies is essential for this, which may include any combination of blog posts, emails, PR content, newsletters, and advertisements.</span></p>

<h3>3. Empower and encourage your audience</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Your company&#8217;s marketing plan should always be up to date, but more so when the <a href="/blog/ws/2020/03/18/covid-19-google-ads-data">market and economic conditions change</a>.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">A crucial step here is to ensure that your brand is sending a positive message—one that is <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/02/marketing-during-covid-19">fine-tuned to the sensitive mood of your clients </a>and prospects and avoids any resentment. Your messaging should encourage and empower your audience, which wil help to build a strong emotional bond.</span></p>

<h2>What to change when marketing during a recession</h2>
<p>Given that<span lang="EN"> <a href="https://thetokenist.io/financial-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19% of people</a> pre-COVID already reported having more expenses than their income, you can imagine the changes needed as consumer incomes diminish even further. These limited budgets, shifts in priorities, and changes in <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/18/post-covid-19-customers">customer shopping patterns</a> <span lang="EN">require that you not only continue marketing, but that you <span lang="EN">change the way you <a href="https://hbr.org/2009/04/how-to-market-in-a-downturn-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market your business during a recession</a>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">The following are a few techniques to help you adapt to the unique circumstances created by a recession without compromising your marketing quality or market reach:</span></p>
<h3>1. Your offerings</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Recession can have a dual effect. While some businesses suffer, some <a href="https://blog.visitorqueue.com/what-types-of-businesses-do-well-in-a-recession/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can actually thrive</a> in it! The main difference between these two categories is the type of goods or services they deal with.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Businesses that sell necessities will always have takers, irrespective of  <a href="/blog/ws/2020/06/23/managing-cash-flow">their financial situation</a>. So if your company is selling goods or services that aren’t considered “must-haves,&#8221; it will do you well to reconsider your offering and shift to or at least add in essential services.</span></p>
<h3>2. Your online presence</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Make sure all your online profiles make it explicitly clear to customers and prospects that you&#8217;re still open for business. Update your hours, advertise your latest offers, and keep engaging with your consumers. <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/10/covid-19-resources">This guide </a>has some tips on communicating updates and information to your customers during turbulent times.</span></p>
<h3>3. Your budget allocation</h3>
<p>Regardless of whether your marketing and/or advertising budget stays the same or gets reduced during a recession, you may still need to make some changes as to how much money goes where. Pay attention to channels that are performing well and reallocate accordingly.</p>

<h3><span lang="EN">4. Your tone</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">A recession is a period marked by heightened emotions, so you may have to change your tone to attract the audience with whom you want to have <a href="/blog/ws/2019/07/18/loyalty-marketing">continued business and customer loyalty</a>. You can still convey the same brand messaging and core values, but you may need to conduct an audit to make sure anything potentially insensitive or controversial is removed from your website, <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/01/automated-email-marketing">automated emails</a>, and social media profiles.</span></p>
<h3>5. Your KPIs</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Key performance indicators (<a href="/blog/ws/2019/01/23/ecommerce-kpis">KPIs</a>) and marketing analytics can help you determine which campaigns are yielding the best results as opposed to ones that are underperforming.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Then, you can prioritize those that are <a href="/blog/ws/2019/10/17/b2b-lead-generation">generating income or leads</a> and scrap ones that aren’t. Not only will this help you <a href="/blog/ws/2016/08/18/ppc-money-saving-checklist">save money</a>, but also drive sales simultaneously.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">In the case of a recession, you may need to adjust some of your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-plan-goals-objectives-for-small-businesses/">marketing goals and objectives</a>, and therefore the KPIs that measure them.</span></p>
<h3>6. Your customer targeting</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">You always want to be <a href="/blog/ws/2016/02/17/online-audiences">targeting the right audience </a>with your markting and advertising, but during an economic downturn, laser-focused targeting becomes essential for survivival— especially when the marketing budget is tight beacuse it prevents wasted spend on irrelevant clicks on your add. You may need to change your targeting so that you&#8217;re focusing on one particular niche within your audience, or perhaps even a new niche that has emerged. <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/18/post-covid-19-customers">Get a feel for what your customers need right now</a> and make any targeting adjustments from there. You should also segment your email lists based on any new pattern and <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/23/set-up-dynamic-remarketing-ads">retarget your website visitors</a> to attract the right audience and get a higher ROI on your marketing efforts.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN">As the world begins to open back up, there’s no doubt that life, as we know it, has changed. This is doubly true for the consumer. The way we buy, the things we buy, and the mindset in which we buy them have all been altered forever. This means that the way businesses present their products and communicate with their customers also needs to change.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">The changes will look different for every business, and they will continue to evolve as the pandemic situation evolves, which is why I’ve written this post. I’m going to use expert insights, recent data, and marketing fundamentals to help you better familiarize with and more effectively and compassionately market to your post-COVID customers. I will cover:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">How COVID-19 has impacted consumers in general.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">What the post-pandemic consumer is looking for.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Four strategies to better understand your customers in the wake of COVID-19.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Before we begin, we do want to acknowledge the reality that COVID-19 is still an active pandemic that is taking lives daily. The terms “<a href="/blog/ws/2021/03/15/google-ads-account-audit-post-covid">post-COVID</a>” and “post-pandemic” in this post refer to this current time period after the peak of the pandemic in March and April.</span></p>

<h2><span lang="EN">How COVID-19 has impacted consumers </span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">We know that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/02/new-data-google-ads-benchmarks-during-covid-19">COVID-19 has impacted businesses across all industries</a>, but let’s focus on the consumer—or rather, the individual with a family, a job (hopefully), and basic daily needs to support. Much of this is not surprising, but let’s take a look at what is being said among institutions about the impact of COVID-19 on today’s buyer: </span></p>
<h3>Refocused priorities</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">As <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/consumer-goods-services/coronavirus-consumer-behavior-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accenture</a> explains, “Consumer priorities have become centered on the most basic needs, sending demand for hygiene, cleaning and staples products soaring, while non-essential categories slump.” </span></p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em>From our latest <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/02/new-data-google-ads-benchmarks-during-covid-19">COVID-19 benchmarks</a> post.</em></p>
<h3>More online and buy local behavior</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">The factors that influence brand decisions are also changing as a &#8220;<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/08/facebook-local-advertising">buy local</a>&#8221; trend accelerates. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/31/2020-ecommerce-marketing-trends">Digital commerce</a> has also seen a boost as new consumers migrate online for grocery shopping—a rise that is likely to be sustained post-outbreak.” </span></p>
<h3>Weakened mentality</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Consumers and businesses have been through trauma—emotionally, physically, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/23/managing-cash-flow">financially</a>, and more. COVID-19 has left millions of people without jobs, sent billions into isolation, and has forced everyone to come to terms with the fact that we are all inherently vulnerable, as reported by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/27/coronavirus-pandemic-could-inflict-long-lasting-emotional-trauma-ptsd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong><span lang="EN">Let’s focus not just on the consumer, but the individual with a family, a community, and basic daily needs to support. </span></strong></p></blockquote>
<h2><span lang="EN">What is the post COVID-19 consumer looking for? </span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">So we can see that the post COVID-19 consumer is lacking in morale, security, and even the ability to venture out of their local community. But what does this translate to in terms of what they need? What is this new customer looking for? Management firm <a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/the-essential-guide-to-post-covid-19-consumers-video/">Bain &amp; Company</a> recently conducted a survey of 162 people in seven countries, who shared their priorities and their essentials as we move into this new season:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>People want to feel less anxious.</li>
<li>People are seeking a more balanced, healthy lifestyle.</li>
<li>People want to feel more connected.</li>
<li>People are seeking out kindness and purpose.</li>
<li>People are more mindful of their spending, reflecting on what is essential and what is frivolous</li>
</ul>

<p><span lang="EN">Aside from <a href="/blog/ws/2021/01/13/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing">emotional</a> changes, the landscape for businesses has changed physically, too. Consumers are more likely to interact with businesses online, opening up an even wider digital landscape. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong><span lang="EN">Consumers are more likely to interact with businesses online, opening up an even wider digital landscape.</span></strong></p></blockquote>
<h2><span lang="EN">How can you get to know your post-COVID customer? </span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">So it’s clear that <a href="/blog/ws/2020/03/23/covid-19-business-trends">COVID-19 has caused major shifts</a> across all aspects of the consumer’s life—buying behaviors, emotional mindsets, daily challenges, and core desires. So what does that translate into for your customers? How can you<a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/17/businesses-likely-to-thrive-post-covid"> thrive in a post-COVID world</a>? These four expert-recommended strategies will help you to obtain and implement that knowledge.</span></p>
<h3>1. Recreate your personas</h3>
<p><span lang="EN"> It’s clear that you’re no longer serving the customer you were serving 6 months ago. That means it’s time to update <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/23/buyer-personas">your personas</a> so your messaging, outreach, sales, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/14/use-branding-to-improve-advertising">branding</a> are actually attracting customers to you. <a href="https://www.10xdigitalinc.com/how-to-create-a-business-vision-board/">Holly Rollins</a>, President of 10x digital echoes this sentiment in her recent blog post. She says:</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">“Even if you’ve done this exercise before, it’s still a great time to revisit—especially with the drastic shifts that have occurred during this season. A persona should include your target audience’s general demographic/psychographic details, behaviors, industry pain points, and concerns.” </span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">Rollins suggests that your personas should also include details that help you dig deeper into their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/12/17/science-of-emotion-in-marketing-courtney-seiter">emotions</a>, purchasing behaviors, and more, including: </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Motivations</li>
<li>Purchasing habits</li>
<li>Goals and <a href="/blog/ws/2020/06/15/marketing-objectives">objectives</a></li>
<li>Frustrations</li>
<li>Personality type</li>
<li>Roles and responsibilities</li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">One way to get your new persona information is to conduct one-on-one customer and client interviews. Get to know what they want and need right now and build those new customer profiles around their responses.</span></p>
<h3>2. Don’t ignore social media</h3>
<p><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/25/covid-19-facebook-advertising">In a post-pandemic world, social media can no longer be avoided</a>—both for getting to know your customers and for connecting with them. A recent study from <a href="https://cmosurvey.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The_CMO_Survey-Highlights-and_Insights_Report-June-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CMO</a> found that 84% of companies were using social media for brand building and more than 54% have used it for customer retention.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN"> But what does that mean for getting to know your <a href="/blog/ws/2021/06/17/post-pandemic-digital-marketing-statistics">post-COVID custome</a>r? Just as you conducted the one-on-one client check-ins for personas, it’s important to use social media as a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/22/free-marketing-during-covid-19">tool to connect with</a> and get to know your post-COVID customer passively and actively. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Passively take note of consistent questions and comments. What patterns are emerging about the verbiage your customers are using and the topics they’re discussing?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Actively seek out conversations with your customers via comments and DMs, polls, surveys, and other <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/06/instagram-story-highlights">engagement features on social media</a>. With so many <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/04/interactive-content">interactive tools</a> now available through social media, you can intentionally get to know your customer better.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Remember, however, that above all, consumers are looking for authenticity, especially on social media. In fact, a recent <a href="https://stackla.com/resources/reports/bridging-the-gap-consumer-marketing-perspectives-on-content-in-the-digital-age/">Stackla report</a> found that 90 percent of the 1,590 consumers surveyed say authenticity is important in deciding which brands to support.</span></p>

<blockquote><p><strong><span lang="EN">Remember that above all, consumers are looking for authenticity, especially on social media.</span></strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>3. Build customer engagement into your culture</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">In our post-COVID world, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/13/ugc-instagram">customer engagement</a> and development are key. For <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog/customer-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Turnbull</a>, founder of Groove, it’s all about getting your customers on the phone on a regular basis to discuss their pains, their needs, and their challenges.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">While Turnbull likes to have these conversations off-the-cuff, it might help you to prepare a few questions, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>How has your business or life changed since COVID-19?</li>
<li>What would make your life easier?</li>
<li>How can our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">product or service</a> be better suited to your current needs?</li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Remember: this type of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/05/21/client-communication-during-covid-19">customer communication</a> goes beyond one-on-one calls. Build this mentality and curiosity into your company culture so anyone on the phone with a potential or current customer is culling these insights. When everyone is asking the same questions, patterns will emerge, allowing you to get to know this new customer.</span></p>
<h3>4. Track customer sentiment</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Tracking what your customer is saying, feeling, and thinking is a critical right now. In an article for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamcraig/2018/07/10/10-key-principles-for-truly-understanding-your-clients/#35bbe8c06504" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes</a>, contributor and marketing expert William Craig explains:</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">“Track the decision-making process of clients through trends and cyclical patterns gathered through analytics and predictive modeling tools. You can build realistic models of what future patterns look like, and get ahead to impress the client and build your brand.”</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">To get started with tracking your customers’ sentiment, get a few key processes and elements in place:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Set <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/06/google-ads-benchmarks-during-covid-19">benchmarks</a> and quantify wherever possible so you have a constant to compare back to.</li>
<li>Choose and implement your tools, along with processes for tracking and accessing data so everyone is seeing and working with the same data sets.</li>
<li>Consistently check-in and analyze the data. It’s not doing any good if no one is actively tracking it and implementing changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Having this knowledge about your new normal audience is crucial for being able to maintain <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/02/client-communication">effective client communication</a>, strong client relationships, and relevant marketing messaging.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN">If your brick-and-mortar store is closed or you can’t make your product because your supply chain has collapsed, or you can’t fulfill customer orders, your incoming cash plummets, you could be in a state of <strong>negative cash flow</strong> during COVID-19. That means you have more cash leaving your business—whether that’s through paychecks, rent payments, paid marketing campaigns, and other fixed or variable costs—than you have coming in. That’s a problem, but it’s not a unique one. Even in a thriving economy, studies show that <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/187366" target="_blank" rel="noopener">82% of small businesses that fold do so due to cash flow issues</a><span lang="EN">. </span></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">To help you improve your cash flow, we’re going to share three principles to follow when managing your cash flow: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span lang="EN">Reduce costs</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Prioritize generating cash</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Empower your team</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="EN">For each, we’ll talk about how it helps with managing cash flow now, plus we’ll take a look at some examples of what you can do to make a difference for your business today. </span></p>
<h2>1. Reduce costs as much as possible</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">If you’re a small business owner, rethinking your business finances was probably one of the first things you did in March after ensuring your team was safe. If you applied for a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/01/cares-act-paycheck-protection-program">PPP loan</a><span lang="EN">, you’ve recently reviewed your financials in a level of detail that many of us don’t reach outside of tax season. But even if you have, you’ll want to continually re-examine your financials for the time being. And if you haven’t tackled this yet—or you’re taking this on for the first time due to downsizing here are some tasks you’ll want to check off your list right away.</span></span></p>
<h3>List all your fixed and variable costs to start cuts</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">First, in case it’s helpful, let’s review the definitions of <strong>fixed </strong>versus <strong>variable costs</strong>.</span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Depending on your business model and industry, it’s frequently <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-Deloitte/gx-COVID-19-managing-cash-flow-in-crisis.pdf">easier to cut variable costs than it is fixed costs</a><span lang="EN">, so tackle those first. Can you find an alternate, less expensive way to ship your products? Can you temporarily cut your sales personnel’s commission and incentivize them in a different way? But also think through how you can actually change fixed costs into variable ones. When all else fails, try following in the footsteps of one entrepreneur, Brad Emerson, and cut literally anything you don’t need. During the Great Recession, he cut not only maintenance and computer costs, but also <a href="https://thehustle.co/small-business-owners-great-recession-covid19/">air conditioning</a><span lang="EN">. If there’s a time to practice running a lean business, it’s now. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">If this process of reviewing line items and determining where to make cuts is new to you, the <a href="http://sbacomplete.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/SBA-Cash-Flow-Template.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SBA’s free worksheet</a><span lang="EN"> and <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/calculators/breakeven.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Entrepreneur’s break-even calculator</a><span lang="EN"> can help you get started.</span></span></span></p>
<h3>Ask for help—and when you do, be human</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Our economy is an ecosystem; the people and entities that you buy supplies or rent property from depend on your business, so helping to preserve your business solvency is in their best interest. So, for example, if your business is going to have trouble paying rent, have a frank, virtual face-to-face with your landlord as soon as possible. When you do, be sure to be totally honest about what you really need<em> right now </em>versus the assistance you anticipate needing in the future. If you really can afford to pay your rent right now, but anticipate struggling in two months, don’t burn your bridges by asking for a pass on your rent this month. Letting your landlord help other, more immediately needy tenants this month—and saving them a ton of stress—you’ll not only preserve your access to the assistance you need when you <em>do </em>need it, but also your integrity will only benefit your business for years to come. </span></p>
<h3>Research alternate financing</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Between the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/01/cares-act-paycheck-protection-program"> emergency funding provided by the Federal government’s CARES Act</a><span lang="EN">, grants offered by corporations like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/boost/grants">Facebook</a><span lang="EN"> and <a href="https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/google-unveiled-a-massive-stimulus-program-of-its-own-including-340-million-for-small-businesses.html">Google</a><span lang="EN">, and donation-driven funds at the local level, there’s more than likely an available funding option that’s well suited for your business. Using a loan to inject cash into your business may seem like taking drastic steps, but it could mean the difference between having to totally rebuild your business during a recession and preserving a strong foundation to work with for the months ahead. </span></span></span></span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">So explore <a href="https://www.sba.gov/page/coronavirus-covid-19-small-business-guidance-loan-resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the SBA’s catalogue of resources</a><span lang="EN"> and Inc.’s <a href="https://www.inc.com/gabrielle-bienasz/small-business-grants-2020.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helpful list</a><span lang="EN"> of small business loan and grant options to brainstorm what might work for you, and contact your local city government to see what programs it’s launched or have planned. </span></span></span></p>
<h3>Remember that everyone else is in a tight spot, too</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Now’s the time to audit your catalogued invoices for any that are due but remain unpaid—a thankless task when the economy is doing well, but <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-Deloitte/gx-COVID-19-managing-cash-flow-in-crisis.pdf">a thoroughly necessary one now</a><span lang="EN">. If you haven’t yet, contact any customers or partners who owe you money right away and, again, have a human, empathetic, honest conversation with them. Give them the opportunity to be forthright about their own business situation and needs. If they need the help and you can manage it, consider extending their invoice’s due date. If they don’t need the help, take the opportunity to prompt a timely payment—your balance sheet will thank you. </span></span></p>
<h2>2. Prioritize generating cash over turning a profit</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Profit is total sales minus the total cost of producing those goods (your variable costs). <a href="https://www.inc.com/encyclopedia/cashflow.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Profit doesn’t equal positive cash flow</a><span lang="EN"> and, remember, what you need right now is <em>cash</em>. </span></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">Refocusing on generating cash can definitely be a mental shift, but if you’ve already tackled the top-priority tasks to strengthen your cash flow (e.g., cutting variable costs), many of your usual profit-generating actions can be adjusted or reprioritized toward the goal of generating cash. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">For example, you’ve probably seen that many brick-and-mortar businesses are currently marketing their e-gift cards. While gift cards aren’t a new revenue stream for many businesses, they’re not usually something you’d put a lot of marketing effort behind, except perhaps as a “last chance” campaign targeting anyone who’s forgotten the next big holiday. But pivoting to focus on gift cards right now is an easy low-cost, low-effort way to get more cash in the door right away—without having to spend cash on the raw materials and other supplies needed to actually create your product or service (i.e., your variable costs).</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Here are some more ideas to try.</span></p>
<h3>Offer exclusive discounts to existing customers</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Acquiring a net new customer is <a href="https://www.inc.com/encyclopedia/cashflow.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">always more expensive than driving sales from prior or existing customers</a><span lang="EN">. In the current market environment—with millions of Americans unemployed and hesitant to spend money, and millions of others are working from home and desperate for distractions—it’ll be harder than ever to convert new business. But if you’re a consumer brand, your existing customers are likely bursting with pent-up demand. If you offer the right discount at the right time with compelling “exclusive” messaging, you’ll likely boost sales, generate cash, and promote customer loyalty. Also, if you sell a physical product, clearing out some of your inventory could help you cut back on rental or storage costs. </span></span></p>
<h3>Repackage your product or service for a consumer market</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Many products are generally sold to businesses with office space (e.g., office furniture) or that reach consumers via a middleman (e.g., Target)—perhaps yours included! Empower your marketers to whip out their rebranding ideas and pull together a simple landing page to get your product in front of consumers. For example, the team behind <a href="https://home.tryhungry.com/">HUNGRY@Home</a><span lang="EN"> is used to catering corporate events, but these days, they’ve pivoted to cooking and delivering healthy, safe, affordable family-style to people’s homes. </span></span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">HUNGRY@Home’s offering.</span></em></p>
<h3>Pivot your offering for better margins</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">If you can, change your offering to the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/18/post-covid-19-customers">new needs of your post-pandemic customers</a>. Consider offering products or services that offer high profit margins, economies of scale, and tried-and-true ways to collect payment. Whew! That was a lot. Let’s break that down: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">High profit margin: </span></strong><span lang="EN">Focus on producing products or services that you can charge a high price for, but that cost relatively little to produce. Fortunately, a Zoom subscription is pretty low-cost, so if you can leverage your team’s wide-ranging skills to deliver value virtually, do it. My favorite example so far: The local <a href="https://arthurmurray.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dance studio</a><span lang="EN"> my husband and I attend is holding classes online (highly recommend!). But it&#8217;s also doing a virtual “Dance Mixology” class with one of their teachers to promote a sponsorship campaign. Assuming he already owns bartending gear, and keeping the fixed costs of his salary and a Zoom subscription into account, the only added cost to creating this virtual product is the cost of the ingredients. So why not?</span></span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Economies of scale: </span></strong><span lang="EN">I’m seeing lots of restaurants adjusting their menus to focus on family-style meals, similar to HUNGRY@Home, or to a very limited menu. Purchasing supplies or raw materials in bulk is always a great way to save money, so if you can reposition your product offer to accommodate bulk buying of limited supplies, your cash flow will thank you. </span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Tried-and-true ways of collecting payment: </span></strong><span lang="EN">Remember what we discussed earlier about receivables? Especially if you’re launching a new or adjusted product or service, find ways to collect payment that don’t involve submitting and following up on an invoice. Invest in online checkout so that customers can pay immediately with a credit card <em>before </em>you deliver any value, even if the product you’re delivering is digital or virtual. Explore ways to pivot to a subscription model as well; given how cooped up and stressed many of us are these days, chances are that customers who like your product or service will want it again and may appreciate the ease of a subscription. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Find a niche in your neighborhood and fill it</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">As <a href="https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/cash-flow-management-strategies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shopify</a><span lang="EN"> points out, with Amazon prioritizing the delivery of groceries, diapers and infant formula, and personal care items, your local business might find an opportunity to step into that gap by providing faster, contactless delivery for beach reads, summer clothing and gear, home repair equipment, and other non-necessary, but definitely helpful products. </span></span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Experiment with offering these products to existing customers at a discount, offering free or discounted delivery, or other offers to discern how to drive the most ongoing local demand while generating the most cash for your business. </span></p>
<h2>3. Empower your team with transparency</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">We’re all saying it so often these days that it’s already become cliche: “We’re all in this together.” We’re saying it, though, because it’s so widely applicable, whether you’re talking about protecting ask-risk neighbors or preserving your small business. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">As a business leader, now is not the time to hide in your office—or behind your laptop screen at home. It’s time to step up and lead—by empowering your employees to step up as well. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">How? First, <strong>be transparent about your real business metrics and what you need to achieve</strong>. In ordinary times, establishing a business objective that the whole organization can work toward together can generate a shared sense of mission, promote teamwork, and foster individuals’ pride in the business’s accomplishments. It’s natural, though, to hesitate about sharing metrics during a crisis like this, especially if your business goals from the booming start to the year have likely been thrown out the window. But if you <em>are </em>open about what needs to happen to keep the business afloat—and about your cash flow goals, in particular—you communicate how much you respect and trust your employees, and you empower them to work together to address those goals. </span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="9b291d27-4327-4e4c-b8d0-a33a91eac1ce" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/managing-cash-flow-employee-engagement.jpg" alt="Gallup graph of employee engagement" width="552" height="377" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">Being transparent about metrics and open to new ideas can also boost <a href="https://www.vantagecircle.com/employee-engagement-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">employee engagement</a>, which is good for business.</span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">To truly empower your team, you’ll also want to make sure that your employees all understand what the metrics mean. Show your team a P&amp;L and explain how it works. Walk them through a balance sheet. Describe the difference between profit and positive cash flow, and why positive cash flow is the current priority. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">But most importantly, make sure each person on your team <strong>understands where they personally drive business impact</strong>. As a marketer at a small business, my prior employer created a huge chart of where cash came in and went out; we each wrote our tasks on post-its and took turns placing the post-its on the chart to indicate where and when our everyday work impacted the business. Thanks to this incredibly helpful exercise, we all walked away with a far firmer grasp of how we could each make a difference. Try doing something like this virtually, with a Google doc or other tool. Tell your team to raise their hand immediately if they have an idea to improve cash flow, and emphasize that all ideas are good ideas, and <em>everyone</em>’s job is impactful and relevant. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">By taking the time to educate and empower your team, you’ll invest deeply in your team’s resilience and make huge strides toward unleashing their creativity and motivation to address your business’s challenges. Because we really are all in this together. </span></p>
<h2>Managing your cash flow isn’t new<span lang="EN">—and that’s good news</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Whether or not this particular economic crisis is your first rodeo, this is far from the first time that small businesses like yours have faced this level of uncertainty. As it so happens, we experienced one pretty recently—and the lessons learned in 2008, whether about cash flow management or any other business or leadership skill, are still incredibly valid.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">So as you work on improving cash flow with these tips, keep in mind what worked before—and listen to your colleagues or your business partners about their experiences. Reach out to small business owners and entrepreneurs in your network, and ask them what they did in 2008. Read about <a href="https://thehustle.co/small-business-owners-great-recession-covid19/">the experiences of Brad Emerson</a><span lang="EN"> and so many others. Research not just how businesses in your industry responded, but how your partners’ industries and verticals made their way. You can even get your whole team involved: In a shared place, document what you find, both what worked and what didn’t work. Review your findings together, and discuss how they support or undermine your potential path forward. The solution to your cash flow struggles could be unlocked just by asking a fellow small business owner a few questions.</span></span></p>
