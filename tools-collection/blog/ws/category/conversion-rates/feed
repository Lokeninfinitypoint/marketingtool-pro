					<description><![CDATA[<p>What's a good conversion rate? It depends on your industry and where you're advertising, but we've got the data in this complete conversion rate benchmarks breakdown!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Whether you’re in home services, automotive, education, or any vertical in between, managing your business’s online advertising accounts means keeping track of a bunch of different metrics. You use search impression share to judge how well you’re performing in the Google Ads auction. You use engagement rate to see whether your messaging is resonating with your Meta audiences. Across <em>both</em> platforms, you turn to click-through rate to determine how compelling your ad copy really is.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But here’s the thing: If you want to drive substantial returns on your online advertising spend, then achieving <strong>high conversion rates</strong> and <strong>low costs per lead</strong><em> has</em> to stay at the top of your mind.</p>
<p>A key step towards driving high conversion rates and low costs per conversion, of course, is defining what those things look like. What’s a high Google Ads conversion rate? What’s a good Meta Ads cost per lead? And how does conversion rate optimization change depending on what industry you’re in?</p>
<p>These are the questions we’re here to answer. With this guide, our goal is to provide the essential <strong>conversion rate benchmarks</strong> you need to get your conversion rate optimization (CRO) efforts off to the right start.</p>

<h2>Conversion rate benchmarks for Google Ads</h2>
<p><strong>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-google-ads-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average conversion rate across Google Ads</a> is 7.52%. </strong></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>

<p>What&#8217;s interesting is the change in these conversion rate benchmarks over the years. The last time we calculated average Google Ads conversion rates, we found a benchmark of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2024-google-ads-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6.96%</a>. So, Google Ads average CVR across all industries has actually increased by 6.84% year over year.</p>

<h2>How much does a Google Ads conversion cost?</h2>
<p><strong>The average cost per lead across Google Ads is $70.11.</strong></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-GA-Benchmarks-CPL-871x1024.webp" alt="2025 google ads benchmarks - cost per lead" width="871" height="1024" class="aligncenter wp-image-91516 size-large" /></div>
<p>Taking a look at the industries with the highest average costs per lead—Attorneys &amp; Legal Services at $131.63, Furniture at $121.51, and Business Services at $103.54—we see a common theme: A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/01/26/sales-cycle">longer sales cycle</a>. In other words, if you’re marketing a product or service that people typically take a long time to mull over (e.g., a laptop, legal advice, etc.), you can expect to spend more money for each conversion you drive.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, inspiring prospects to take valuable actions isn’t quite as expensive in industries like Restaurants &amp; Food, and Arts &amp; Entertainment, both with a CPL of $30.27, and Animals &amp; Pets with a CPL of $31.82. In the case of Automotive&#8211;Repair, Service &amp; Parts, with an average CPL of $28.50, which you’d typically expect to be one with long sales cycles, the below-average cost per conversion is likely due (in part) to the sense of urgency people feel when it comes to issues with their cars.</p>

<h2>Conversion rate benchmarks for Facebook Ads</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The average conversion rate across Facebook Ad leads campaigns is <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ads-benchmarks-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7.72%</a>. </strong></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>

<p dir="ltr">If you’re responsible for marketing a bakery, bar, catering company, or some other restaurant or food-related business, failing to take advantage of Facebook Ads is a <em>huge</em> mistake. As you can see, the average advertiser in this industry converts clicks into meaningful actions at a rate of over 18%!</p>
<p>Advertisers within the industries of Attorneys and Legal Services, with a CVR of 10.53%, and Education and Instruction, with a CVR of 10.05% are doing great, too. It’s not a coincidence that businesses in each of these industries can benefit from the use of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads">Facebook lead ads</a>—an ad format that enables you to qualify prospects without sending them to an external landing page.</p>
<p>Clearly, however, Facebook lead ads are no silver bullet: Although advertisers in Furniture (3.77%), Physicians and Surgeons (4.51%), and Home and Home Improvement (5.22%) industries can certainly take advantage of this frictionless format, they might struggle to drive conversions nonetheless. For these businesses in particular, remarketing would be a fantastic use of the Facebook platform.</p>

<h2>How much does a Facebook Ads conversion cost?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The average cost per conversion across Facebook Ads is $27.66.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-fb-benchmarks-cpl-leads-866x1024.webp" alt="2025 facebook ads benchmarks - average cost per lead chart" width="866" height="1024" class="aligncenter wp-image-93942 size-large" /></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find that most industries tend to have their Meta Ads CPLs average out lower than their Google Ads CPLs. For example, the average Education advertiser can expect to cough up just over $90 for each conversion on the Google search network. For each Facebook conversion, however, the average cost is under $29! Of course, the conversions you drive with your search ads may tend to be more valuable than the conversions you drive with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-advertise-on-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your Facebook ads</a>. Nonetheless, if you’re in Restaurants and Food ($3.16), Real Estate ($16.61), and Career and Employment ($17.64), make sure you’re taking advantage of your ability to drive cheap high-funnel conversions on Facebook.</p>
<p>It’s not totally surprising that advertisers in the Dentists and Dental Services ($76.71), Health and Fitness ($52.98), and Beauty and Personal Care ($51.42) industries are investing good amounts of money in each Facebook conversion. Typically, when someone needs a dental solution, they’re turning to Google search. Meanwhile, health and fitness, as well as beauty and personal care ads, can be extremely competitive across Meta platforms. To be clear, however, that doesn’t mean you should overlook the value of using Facebook to spread and maintain brand awareness.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A small bump to your conversion rate can have a serious long-term impact on your bottom line. Say you have a conversion rate of 3% that yields $100k per month and you boost it to 3.5%. Assuming you sell the same average value to each customer, that will yield an additional $16.7k—or a revenue boost of nearly 17% on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>Considering this, conversion rate optimization (CRO) is arguably your most important marketing task. It&#8217;ll help you maximize returns on your marketing campaigns, enhance the customer experience, grow lifetime value, and ultimately ensure the long-term sustainability of your business.</p>
<p>But how do you do it? Read a quick-and-dirty recap of conversion rate optimization, then learn 17 high-impact CRO tips real brands use to lift your conversion rate.</p>

<h2>What is conversion rate optimization?</h2>
<p><strong>Conversion rate optimization is the strategic process of increasing the percentage of visitors who take a desired action.</strong> That could be any number of activities that are important to your business, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buying a product</li>
<li>Filling out a lead generation form</li>
<li>Joining an email marketing or SMS list</li>
<li>Sharing on social media</li>
<li>Signing up for an event</li>
<li>Starting a free trial</li>
<li>Requesting a demo</li>
<li>Downloading a resource</li>
</ul>
<p>The key to understanding CRO is to recognize that it&#8217;s about making the most of the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traffic you bring to your site</a>. You do this by evaluating how users navigate your website and what keeps them from converting.</p>
<p>Knowing this information, you can improve your website&#8217;s user experience, content, and design to guide more visitors toward taking the actions you want them to take.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/conversion-rate-optimization">conversion rate optimization</a> is not about tricking users into converting. Instead, it&#8217;s about removing barriers, addressing concerns, and providing value that aligns with user needs and business goals. Effective CRO leads to enhanced visitor experience, making it easier and more enticing for visitors to convert.</p>
<p>Conversion rate optimization consists of five key components:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data collection</strong>: <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/customer-data">Gathering quantitative data</a> through analytics tools and qualitative data through user feedback, surveys, and usability tests</li>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong>: Interpreting the collected data with services like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/17/ga4-features-for-advertisers">Google Analytics 4</a> or conversion optimization tools to identify areas of improvement and opportunities for optimization</li>
<li><strong>Hypothesis formation</strong>: Developing theories about what changes could <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/17/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate">improve conversion rates</a> based on the analysis</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong>: Implementing changes and measuring their impact, often through A/B or split testing</li>
<li><strong>Implementation</strong>: Rolling out successful changes site-wide</li>
</ol>
<p>By sticking to this process, you can prioritize effectively and ensure the CRO techniques you deploy are making a meaningful impact—rather than following generic trends and best practices that may or may not work for your specific business.</p>

<h2>Why is CRO marketing important?</h2>
<p>Conversion rate optimization is essential to any <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/19/digital-marketing-statistics">digital marketing strategy</a> for several compelling reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maximizes return on investment (ROI):</strong> You get more value from your site traffic, so you make better use of the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">money spent on marketing</a> and advertising to attract those site visitors, reducing customer acquisition costs.</li>
<li><strong>Increases customer lifetime value:</strong> Many CRO techniques improve the customer journey, increasing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/brand-loyalty">customer loyalty</a> and lifetime value.</li>
<li><strong>Enhances user experience:</strong> When you optimize for conversions, you often make your site more user-friendly and easier to navigate, which improves visitor experience.</li>
<li><strong>Provides valuable insights:</strong> As you collect and analyze user <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/28/behavioral-segmentation">behavior data</a>, you gather information that can guide other areas of your business, from product development to customer service.</li>
</ul>
<p>By focusing on CRO, you&#8217;re creating a more efficient marketing machine and a better customer experience, which ultimately makes your business more profitable overall and drives sustainable growth.</p>

<h2>CRO marketing tips: 17 ways to optimize your website for conversions</h2>
<p>Now <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/11/increase-conversion-rates">boost your conversion rates</a> with 17 tried-and-true CRO marketing techniques. These tips cover a wide range of optimization techniques, from foundational website improvements to specific tactics for engaging and converting visitors.</p>
<p>But remember: While these tips are generally effective for many businesses, the key to successful CRO is testing and iterating based on your specific audience and business. Use these strategies as inspiration, but always measure their impact on your unique business.</p>
<h3>1. Make your site easy to navigate</h3>
<p>A well-organized, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/27/website-header-examples">intuitive navigation structure</a> keeps visitors engaged and guides them toward conversion. The easier it is for users to find what they need, the more likely they are to convert.</p>
<p>Start by simplifying your menu, using clear and descriptive labels for each category. And implement a logical hierarchy by grouping related items together. This can look different depending on your vertical, so take a peek at other brands in your niche for inspiration.</p>
<p>For example, apparel brand <a href="https://frame-store.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FRAME</a> has a simple top menu highlighting the overarching categories site visitors might be interested in (new arrivals, women, men, and stores):</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-marketing-site-navigation.webp" alt="frame's site navigation" width="798" height="270" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87200" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-marketing-site-navigation.webp 798w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-marketing-site-navigation-480x162.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 798px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://frame-store.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>When a shopper hovers over a category, it expands to reveal subcategories they might be interested in shopping.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://husteads.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Husteads Auto Body</a> focuses its menu on the services it offers, locations, and essential information for car owners:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-site-navigation-example.webp" alt="hubsteads site navigation" width="749" height="207" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87201" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-site-navigation-example.webp 749w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-site-navigation-example-480x133.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 749px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://husteads.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>In addition to an easy-to-navigate menu, include a search function to help users find what they&#8217;re looking for more quickly, and consider using <a href="https://yoast.com/breadcrumbs-seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breadcrumbs</a> to show users their current location within your site structure.</p>
<p>Regularly analyze user behavior data to identify any navigation pain points and make improvements accordingly.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/first-page-of-google?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_10WaysFirstPageGoogle_Download">10 Tangible &amp; Free Ways to Get on the First Page of Google</a></p>
<h3>2. Improve your page load speed</h3>
<p>According to Bidnamic, conversion rate improves by <a href="https://www.bidnamic.com/en-us/resources/how-website-speed-affects-your-conversion-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">17%</a> for every second a website loads faster. Slow-to-load pages frustrate visitors and can lead to high bounce rates. Use a tool like Google PageSpeed Insights to analyze your current load times and identify areas for improvement.</p>
<p>Some basic ways to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-increase-website-speed">speed up load times</a> include <a href="https://mailchimp.com/resources/what-is-lazy-loading/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lazy loading</a> for images and videos below the fold, reducing image file size, enabling caching, and reducing redirects.</p>
<h3>3. Optimize your mobile experience</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/08/28/mobile-websites">smooth mobile experience</a> can boost your conversion rates as more users are navigating the web on their smartphones. In January 2024, mobile devices accounted for almost <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/306528/share-of-mobile-internet-traffic-in-global-regions/">60% of web page views worldwide</a>. So optimizing your website for mobile is no longer optional.</p>
<p>Make sure your site is fully responsive and adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. Focus on creating a thumb-friendly design, placing key elements within easy reach of users&#8217; thumbs. And use large, easy-to-tap buttons and ensure adequate spacing between clickable elements to prevent accidental taps.</p>
<p>Test your site on multiple devices and browsers to ensure consistency.</p>
<h3>4. Keep essential elements above the fold</h3>
<p>Content that&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/above-the-fold" target="_blank" rel="noopener">above the fold</a>&#8221; means it&#8217;s visible without scrolling. It&#8217;s the first thing visitors see and impacts their decision to stay or leave.</p>
<p>Prioritize placing key elements above the fold, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/20/call-to-action-buttons">calls-to-action (CTAs)</a></li>
<li>Key product features or benefits</li>
<li>Navigation menu</li>
</ul>
<p>But don&#8217;t overcrowd this space. Maintain a clean, focused design that guides the user&#8217;s eye to the most important information. Provide enough engaging content that some would be willing to take action without additional information or entice visitors to scroll if they want to learn more.</p>
<h3>5. Make your CTAs stand out</h3>
<p>Your call-to-action (CTA) buttons are critical conversion elements on any webpage or marketing campaign. They should be immediately noticeable and compelling enough to encourage clicks.</p>
<p>To make <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/29/great-cta">click-worthy CTAs</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use contrasting, on-brand colors to make CTAs pop against the background.</li>
<li>Ensure the button size is large enough to be easily clickable, especially on mobile devices.</li>
<li>Use action-oriented, specific language that creates a sense of urgency or clarifies a benefit (e.g., &#8220;Start Your Free Trial&#8221; rather than a generic &#8220;Submit&#8221; button).</li>
<li>Eliminate distraction by sticking to a single CTA—if you need another one for any reason, make it less prominent.</li>
<li>Place your CTA above the fold and again in other strategic locations on the page—such as after you&#8217;ve presented your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">value proposition</a> or at the end of a compelling product description.</li>
</ul>
<p>Home Chef&#8217;s home page has a distraction-free design and a bold, action-oriented CTA that says &#8220;Pick Your Meals.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-marketing-ctas.webp" alt="example of cta from home chef" width="865" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87202" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-marketing-ctas.webp 865w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-marketing-ctas-480x250.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 865px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.homechef.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/11/copywriting-ab-tests">A/B test</a> different CTA designs, placements, and copy on each page to find what drives the highest conversion rates. Fun fact: Rounded CTA buttons receive anywhere from <a href="https://app.sciencesays.com/p/make-cta-buttons-curvy">17 to 55% more clicks</a> than buttons with sharp angles.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4da.png" alt="📚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide download</strong> &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download">The 42 Best Call to Action Phrases Ever (&amp; Why They Work)</a></p>
<h3>6. Personalize your site experience based on visitor data</h3>
<p>According to recent data from Hyken, <a href="https://hyken.com/2020-2021-2022-2023-and-2024-aca-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">81%</a> of customers prefer companies that offer a personalized experience. Personalization boosts conversion rates by making your site more relevant to each visitor. Use data like a customer&#8217;s browsing history, past purchases, geographic location, and referral source to tailor the user experience.</p>
<p>You can implement personalization strategies such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Displaying <a href="https://www.rebuyengine.com/blog/product-recommendation-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product recommendations</a> based on browsing or purchase history.</li>
<li>Showing location-specific content or offers.</li>
<li>Customizing content for returning visitors.</li>
<li>Adapting messaging based on the referral source (e.g., a specific social media influencer).</li>
<li>Using dynamic pricing or promotions based on user behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>These strategies streamline your site visitors&#8217; experience, helping them find a product or service they want faster and increasing the likelihood of conversion.</p>
<h3>7. Create dedicated landing pages for targeted ads</h3>
<p>Many brands direct ads to their regular product or service pages. But this is a mistake. These pages often contain an overload of information and distractions—and are focused on selling right away, which can be a deterrent.</p>
<p><a href="https://workweek.com/discover-newsletters/sharma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DTC marketing expert Nik Sharma</a> explained in his newsletter, &#8220;You also wouldn&#8217;t show up to a date and immediately say, &#8220;Should we just skip all this and go back to my place?&#8221; So, why are you doing that with your potential customers? [&#8230;] Instead, with a landing page, you can curate the information someone sees, depending on the traffic source they are coming from.&#8221;</p>
<p>Product and service pages don&#8217;t let you continue the narrative you established in your ad—for instance if you&#8217;re targeting a specific subset of your audience or are tying your campaign to a current event or seasonal trends. This disconnect can lead to lost opportunities.</p>
<p>Instead of linking to the product page from their Facebook ad, Magic Molecule sends ad clickers to a dedicated <a href="https://www.convertflow.com/campaigns/listicle-landing-pages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listicle landing page</a>:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-marketing-targeted-landing-page.webp" alt="targeted landing page from magic molecule" width="867" height="476" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87203" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-marketing-targeted-landing-page.webp 867w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-marketing-targeted-landing-page-480x264.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 867px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://magicmolecule.com/pages/best-hypochlorous-acid-v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>This landing page design educates customers and succinctly highlights the benefits of their products without all the extra information on the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/06/01/product-pages">product page</a>.</p>
<p>Dedicated landing pages maximize the effectiveness of your paid advertising campaigns by creating a seamless experience for site visitors.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6e0.png" alt="🛠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Get the tools and tips you need to build the perfect landing page in our free guide &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLiQContentDLHowToMakeGreatLandingPages.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_LandingPages_HowToMakeGreatLandingPagesGuide_Download">How to Make Great Landing Pages (with Crazy-High Conversion)</a></p>
<h3>8. Make customer support accessible to support prospects&#8217; purchase journeys</h3>
<p>Questions not answered on your website will undoubtedly come up as people browse your site. Getting quick answers is crucial to removing obstacles and moving the purchase journey along.</p>
<p>Implement multiple support channels to cater to different customer preferences:</p>
<ul>
<li>A robust help center to answer FAQs.</li>
<li>Clearly displayed contact information (phone, email).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/chatbots">Live chat</a> for real-time assistance.</li>
<li>AI-powered chatbots for 24/7 support.</li>
<li>Social media support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider offering proactive support by triggering chat invitations based on customer behavior, such as lingering on a page or showing signs of exit intent. This approach can help address concerns before they lead to abandonment.</p>
<h3>9. Showcase your products and services with high-quality imagery</h3>
<p>High-quality visuals are crucial to online shopping decisions, where customers can&#8217;t physically interact with products. Clear, detailed images can significantly boost conversion rates by giving customers confidence in what they&#8217;re buying.</p>
<p>Consider these strategies for compelling product imagery:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use high-resolution <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/26/product-photography">product photos</a> that show multiple angles.</li>
<li>Include close-up shots and zoom functionality for detailed views.</li>
<li>Showcase products in context or in use.</li>
<li>For clothing, provide images of items on a range of body types.</li>
<li>Consider 360-degree views or short video clips for complex products.</li>
</ul>
<p>For service-based businesses, illustrate the benefits or results of your services, like before-and-after photos, infographics explaining your process, or images of your team in action to build trust.</p>
<h3>10. Leverage social proof</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/01/10/social-proof-guide">Social proof</a> is without a doubt one of the most powerful tools to build trust with potential customers and turn more visitors into customers.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/222698/consumer-trust-in-different-types-of-advertising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nearly 90%</a> of consumers trust word-of-mouth recommendations</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yotpo.com/the-impact-of-user-generated-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80%</a> of consumers will typically read five or more reviews before committing to a purchase</li>
<li><a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/influencer-marketing-report1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">49%</a> of all consumers make daily, weekly, or monthly purchases thanks to influencers</li>
</ul>
<p>Social proof can come from a variety of sources, including your existing customers, industry experts, media outlets, and influencers in your field.</p>
<p>Effective ways to incorporate social proof include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer reviews and ratings</strong>: Display these prominently on product/service pages and highlight a high average rating in other places on your website.</li>
<li><strong>Testimonials</strong>: Feature quotes from particularly satisfied customers in strategic spots on your website, including your product page.</li>
<li><strong>User-generated content</strong>: Showcase photos or videos of customers using your products.</li>
<li><strong>Trust badges</strong>: Display certifications, awards, or security seals you&#8217;ve achieved.</li>
<li><strong>Media mentions</strong>: Highlight any positive coverage from reputable publications.</li>
<li><strong>Expert endorsements</strong>: Feature recommendations from industry experts or influencers.</li>
<li><strong>Usage statistics</strong>: Share how many people your company has helped, like &#8220;10,000+ happy customers.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Certifications:</strong> If your products or services have relevant certifications, such as for organic products, or if your employees have skill certifications, display these on your website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Travel backpack brand Tortuga leverages social proof throughout its website, including on the home page where they advertise that they&#8217;ve earned over 3,000 five-star reviews:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-marketing-social-proof.webp" alt="example of social proof for cro marketing" width="858" height="452" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87204" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-marketing-social-proof.webp 858w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-marketing-social-proof-480x253.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 858px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.tortugabackpacks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>As you gather and display social proof, keep in mind that the more relevant and relatable it is to your target market, the more effective it will be in driving conversions.</p>
<h3>11. Add trust signals</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/27/trust-signals">Trust signals</a> are elements on your website that help build confidence in your brand, products, or services. They reassure potential customers that your business is legitimate, reliable, and secure, which can significantly boost conversion rates. Some of these may overlap with social proof, but they take other forms as well.</p>
<p>Key trust signals to consider beyond social proof include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security badges</strong>: Display <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/09/what-is-an-ssl-certificate">SSL certificates</a> and secure payment icons.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy policy</strong>: Make it easily accessible and clearly explain how you protect customer data.</li>
<li><strong>Money-back guarantee</strong>: Offer and prominently display a satisfaction guarantee.</li>
<li><strong>Contact information</strong>: Customers will feel more comfortable buying from you if they know how to reach your business.</li>
<li><strong>Links to social media profiles</strong>: This is another way to show customers that you&#8217;re reachable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Place these trust signals strategically throughout your site, especially on pages where users are making decisions or entering sensitive information. For example, you can include contact information in your footer and a money-back guarantee on your checkout page.</p>
<h3>12. Highlight shipping and returns policies</h3>
<p>Your shipping and <a href="https://www.loopreturns.com/blog/how-to-write-a-return-policy-the-5-questions-you-need-to-answer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returns policies</a> play a crucial role in a customer&#8217;s purchase decision. Customers want to ensure they know all the costs associated with buying from you—especially if they decide to return the product.</p>
<p>The most conversion-friendly policy is free shipping and returns. But that policy doesn&#8217;t make sense for every business. Consider offering free shipping above a certain order value to make the cost worth it for your business.</p>
<p>Highlight your policies clearly to ensure shoppers don&#8217;t have to dig for this information. Ecommerce brands, in particular, benefit from including this information in the cart and checkout page. Create a dedicated page for shipping and returns information, too, and link to it in your site&#8217;s footer.</p>
<h3>13. Offer multiple payment options</h3>
<p>Allowing customers to use a variety of payment methods can increase your conversion rates by catering to different customer preferences and reducing friction at the checkout stage.</p>
<p>Consider offering options like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Credit/debit cards</strong>: Offer major credit card options (Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express).</li>
<li><strong>Digital wallets</strong>: Include popular options like PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.</li>
<li><strong>Buy Now, Pay Later (</strong><a href="https://stripe.com/guides/buy-now-pay-later" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BNPL</strong></a><strong>)</strong>: Consider offering services like Klarna, Afterpay, or Affirm to enable customers to shop on a budget.</li>
<li><strong>Alternative payment methods</strong>: Depending on your market, consider options like bank transfers, cryptocurrencies, or region-specific payment methods.</li>
</ul>
<h3>14. Use abandonment popups</h3>
<p>Abandonment popups, also known as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/22/increase-average-order-value">exit-intent popups</a>, can be an effective tool for reducing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/17/shopping-cart-abandonment">site abandonment</a> and increasing conversions. These popups are triggered when a user shows signs of leaving your site without purchasing.</p>
<p>Consider these strategies for effective abandonment popups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timing</strong>: Set the popup to appear when the user&#8217;s cursor moves toward the browser&#8217;s close or back button.</li>
<li><strong>Compelling offer</strong>: Provide an incentive to stay, such as a discount code, free shipping, or a bonus product.</li>
<li><strong>Clear value proposition</strong>: Quickly remind the user of your product&#8217;s benefits or unique selling points.</li>
<li><strong>Sense of urgency</strong>: Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/neuromarketing">language that creates FOMO (fear of missing out)</a> or time-limited offers.</li>
<li><strong>Personalization</strong>: Tailor the popup content based on the user&#8217;s browsing history or cart contents.</li>
<li><strong>Social proof:</strong> Add a customer quote or usage statistics to remind site visitors how happy your customers are.</li>
</ul>
<p>Abandonment popups can take different forms depending on the page the shopper is exiting from—whether that&#8217;s a product/service page, shopping cart, checkout, or a general page. So experiment with different messages and offers to find what works best in each scenario.</p>
<p>For example, skincare brand Stratia shows a quiz when shoppers are about to leave their skincare collection page:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-marketing-site-abandonment-popup.webp" alt="site abandonment pop up example" width="865" height="496" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87205" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-marketing-site-abandonment-popup.webp 865w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-marketing-site-abandonment-popup-480x275.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 865px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.stratiaskin.com/collections/all" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>This is a smart choice because shoppers exiting a page with all the products are likely overwhelmed with options. This popup helps them make a choice.</p>
<h3>15. Offer an incentive for first-time customers</h3>
<p>Providing a special offer or incentive for first-time customers can be an effective way to encourage initial purchases and start building customer loyalty. This strategy can help overcome new customers&#8217; hesitation when considering a purchase from an unfamiliar brand.</p>
<p>There are tons of incentives to play with, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discount offers</strong>: Provide a percentage off or a fixed amount discount on the first purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Free shipping</strong>: Offer free shipping for the first order, regardless of the order value.</li>
<li><strong>Gift with purchase</strong>: Include a free product or sample with the first order.</li>
<li><strong>Extended trial period</strong>: For subscription services, offer a longer free trial for new customers.</li>
<li><strong>Bonus points</strong>: If you have a loyalty program, offer extra points on the first purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Bundle deals</strong>: Create special bundles or starter kits for new customers at a discounted rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>These offers are commonly paired with an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/11/email-list-building">email or SMS signup</a>, which enables you to remarket them later. While the initial discount might reduce your margin on the first sale, it&#8217;s your first step to repeat purchases and ongoing value from that customer.</p>
<h3>16. Create urgency</h3>
<p>Fear of missing out (FOMO) can be a powerful motivator for conversions, encouraging visitors to take action rather than delay their decision.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/05/how-to-increase-urgency">create urgency</a> through:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited-time offers</strong>: Highlight deals or discounts that are only available for a short period</li>
<li><strong>Countdown timers</strong>: Use visual timers to show when an offer expires</li>
<li><strong>Low stock warnings</strong>: Display &#8220;Only X left in stock&#8221; messages for products with limited availability</li>
<li><strong>Flash sales</strong>: Run short-term sales events with significant discounts</li>
<li><strong>Seasonal promotions</strong>: Tie offers to holidays or seasons to create natural deadlines</li>
<li><strong>Pre-order opportunities</strong>: Encourage early action for upcoming or out-of-stock products with special deals</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, Obvi adds a &#8220;limited stock&#8221; notice to products that are about to sell out:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-marketing-create-urgency.webp" alt="sense of urgency example for cro marketing" width="665" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87206" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-marketing-create-urgency.webp 665w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-marketing-create-urgency-480x432.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 665px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://myobvi.com/collections/collagen-protein-powder" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>While FOMO marketing is effective, you&#8217;ve got to be careful not to cross a line that will lead to distrust. So be honest—never create false scarcity or misleading deadlines. You don&#8217;t want to make your customer skeptical.</p>
<h3>17. Add a quiz to help shoppers find the right product or service</h3>
<p>Interactive quizzes effectively guide customers toward the most suitable products or services, especially if you offer a wide range of options. This personalized approach improves the customer experience and streamlines their purchase decision, ultimately boosting conversion rates.</p>
<p>For example, Haus Labs&#8217; shade finder helps shoppers key in to their perfect makeup shade in an easy five-question quiz:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-marketing-website-quiz.webp" alt="cro marketing quiz example from haus labs" width="884" height="561" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87207" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-marketing-website-quiz.webp 884w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-marketing-website-quiz-480x305.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 884px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.hauslabs.com/pages/concealer-shade-finder" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Then, customers are presented with the one product that&#8217;s perfect for their skin tone and skincare concerns:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-marketing-website-quiz-results.webp" alt="cro marketing quiz example from haus labs results" width="667" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87208" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-marketing-website-quiz-results.webp 667w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cro-marketing-website-quiz-results-480x432.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 667px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.hauslabs.com/pages/concealer-shade-finder" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>This simplifies the shopping process and increases customer confidence that they&#8217;re making the right choice, ultimately making a purchase conversion more likely.</p>

<h2>How to get started with conversion rate optimization</h2>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve explored these 17 techniques, it&#8217;s time to put them into action. You have a lot of ideas, so here&#8217;s how to prioritize and get started with your conversion rate optimization process:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify drop-off points</strong>: Use analytics tools to pinpoint where most site visitors leave your sales funnel. These are prime areas for optimization efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on high-impact pages</strong>: Begin with the pages directly related to conversion, such as your shopping cart, checkout, pricing page, and product pages. These areas often offer the most significant potential for improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Make one change at a time</strong>: To accurately measure the impact of each change, implement and test modifications individually rather than making multiple changes simultaneously.</li>
<li><strong>A/B test rigorously</strong>: Set up <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/02/26/ab-testing-best-practices">A/B tests</a> to compare your new theory against the original version. This data-driven approach helps ensure that your modifications are truly improving conversion rates.</li>
<li><strong>Collect customer feedback</strong>: Complement your quantitative data with qualitative insights. Use surveys, user testing, and customer interviews to understand the &#8220;why&#8221; behind your visitors&#8217; actions.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Use CRO to make the most out of your marketing investment</h2>
<p>Remember: There&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all approach to conversion optimization. What works for one business may not work for yours. The key is to understand your unique audience, test different strategies, and continuously optimize based on the results. With consistent effort and data-driven decisions, you can significantly improve your website&#8217;s conversion rates and drive business growth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>We hear it all the time as a tenet of paid media marketing: Always be testing. </span><span>But it&#8217;s only helpful to &#8220;always be testing&#8221; when your tests are sure to contribute to more successful campaigns. </span></p>
<p><span>I fall into the camp of “always be testing…when you have a good hypothesis.” If you see something can be improved and you have an idea for how to improve it, by all means, give it a shot. But don’t just throw things at the wall and hope something sticks. It’s important to have a thought-out approach to A/B testing so that if and when that needle moves, you know why and can test and iterate on it again and again. </span></p>
<p><span>In this post, I want to run through my best PPC A/B testing examples and share tips that will help you create the most meaningful and impactful A/B tests for your PPC campaigns.</span></p>

<h2>PPC A/B testing hypotheses examples (+tips)</h2>
<p>Regardless of which <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/15/headline-testing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A/B testing example</a> you find inspires you to do your own test, be sure to focus on your hypothesis throughout your experimentation. Here&#8217;s what I mean:</p>
<p><span>As I mentioned above, I believe you should always start any test with a hypothesis. What are you trying to test and why? But don’t just say “I think a new ad will perform better.&#8221; Try to articulate what you’re going for when <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/06/16/ab-testing-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running your A/B test</a>. In my experience, when you’re more particular during the hypothesis creation, you’ll have a better test and more actionable and transferable results. </span></p>
<p><span>To help illustrate this point, here’s a typical A/B testing example hypothesis: </span><span>“I want to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/19/google-ads-automated-bidding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">test automated bidding</a> to see if it works better.”</span></p>
<p><span>Sure, this might be a good test, but what does “work better” mean? A good, focused hypothesis almost always incorporates some level of detail. In the following steps, we’ll outline what the specifics are, but for this stage, think of it as a statement to the highest boss you have. They likely don’t know the nitty gritty numbers you’re looking at on a day-to-day basis, but they want to know what’s going on.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ppc-ab-testing-examples-hypotheses-checklist.jpg" alt="ppc ab testing examples - checklist of what to include in a ppc test hypothesis" width="936" height="499" class="aligncenter wp-image-80935 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ppc-ab-testing-examples-hypotheses-checklist.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ppc-ab-testing-examples-hypotheses-checklist-480x256.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>This would be a better version:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Hypothesis</span></strong><span>: “Automated bidding will help us achieve lower CPAs on our main conversion action.”</span></p>
<p><span>To get you started, here are some A/B test hypotheses examples for a few different experiments you could run:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><span>“Using cost comparisons in ad copy will help us stand out from our competitors.”</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>“Expanding into a new state will expand our market share at the same cost as our current geotargeted locations.”</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>“A landing page with more supporting content will help create more engaged prospects and we’ll see a higher conversion rate.”</span></li>
</ul>

<div id="ab-testing-examples"></div>
<h2><span>3 A/B testing examples every advertiser should try </span></h2>
<p><span>There are several ways you can test a hypothesis in paid media platforms, like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/21/how-to-run-google-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads</a> and Microsoft Ads. And, depending on what platform you use, there may be some A/B <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/06/24/landing-page-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testing tools</a> available to help. </span></p>
<p><span>There are no real “wrong” ways to test a hypothesis, but there are some pros and cons you should be aware of with each of the following PPC A/B testing examples. </span></p>
<h3><span>1. On/Off, sequential testing</span></h3>
<p><span>This first A/B testing example is likely the easiest for most advertisers. Here you take note of the data from your existing setup, then make the changes that support your hypothesis, run the campaign that way for a while, then compare stats. Easy enough.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ab-testing-examples-sequential-testing-format-example.jpg" alt="ab testing examples - screenshot of sequential ab testing format" width="999" height="124" class="aligncenter wp-image-80887 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ab-testing-examples-sequential-testing-format-example.jpg 999w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ab-testing-examples-sequential-testing-format-example-980x122.jpg 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ab-testing-examples-sequential-testing-format-example-480x60.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 999px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>It may look something like this. You have four weeks&#8217; worth of data with your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/03/get-more-traffic-from-evergreen-content"> evergreen ad copy</a>. You then pause those variants and launch cost-focused copy for four weeks then compare. </span></p>
<p><span>This method of testing can be useful and can yield good results. It’s easy to implement and only requires you to monitor your campaign for large swings in performance.</span></p>
<p><span>The downside is that the variants never overlap with each other. Was there some seasonal effect that took place in the second 4 weeks? Were you short on budget for the month and needed to pull back on spending to hit your levels? Did a news story impact performance for worse (or better) during either period? Did any other aspects of the campaign change during the eight weeks the test was running?</span></p>
<p><span>It’s not perfect, but it can be useful to test sequentially to see results. </span></p>
<h3><span>2. Geolocation testing</span></h3>
<p><span>In a geolocation A/B testing example, you keep the existing campaign set up as it is, then create an experiment variant in a second location. This could be either to an expanded market or a portion of where you&#8217;re currently targeting (i.e., your campaign targets the entire United States, but for this test, you make the changes only effective in a handful of states).</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ab-testing-examples-location-targeting.jpg" alt="ab testing examples - geolocation targeting ab test example screenshot" width="746" height="458" class="aligncenter wp-image-80886 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ab-testing-examples-location-targeting.jpg 746w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ab-testing-examples-location-targeting-480x295.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 746px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>To accomplish this, you need to make sure your control and experiment are mutually exclusive so there’s no overlap. This can be done by setting up new campaigns and excluding locations in your control campaign.  </span></p>
<p><span>Unlike the sequential A/B testing example, Geolocation testing can allow you to run your variants at the same time and compare results. Any head or tailwinds you feel during the run of the test should be equal for both locations. </span></p>
<p><span>The downfalls come when you realize that no two regions are exactly alike. Who&#8217;s to say why a cost-focused message might work better in Oklahoma than in Nebraska? Or why the East Coast performs better with automated bidding than the Mountain time zone?  </span></p>
<h3><span>3. A/B split testing</span></h3>
<p><span>Split tests are likely the best example of A/B testing as it removes some of the cons we see in sequential and geolocation testing. The problem is that true A/B testing is also the hardest to come by.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ab-testing-examples-ad-rotation-optimization-screenshot.jpg" alt="ab testing examples - screenshot of google ads ad rotation optimization options" width="826" height="386" class="aligncenter wp-image-80883 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ab-testing-examples-ad-rotation-optimization-screenshot.jpg 826w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ab-testing-examples-ad-rotation-optimization-screenshot-480x224.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 826px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/15/meta-ads-vs-google-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Platforms like Google Ads and Meta Ads</a> have long done away with rotating variables evenly. For example, both platforms have AI-powered machine learning that will pretty much always favor one ad variant over another based on the desired outcome of the campaign or ad set. The same is true for bid strategies. If you’re testing manual versus auto-bidding, or one CPA target versus another, those two campaigns are likely not going to enter the auction on the same foot. One will be prioritized over the other and you’ll have an unbalanced test.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ab-testing-examples-google-ads-experiment.jpg" alt="ab testing examples - google ads experiment screenshot" width="835" height="459" class="aligncenter wp-image-80885 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ab-testing-examples-google-ads-experiment.jpg 835w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ab-testing-examples-google-ads-experiment-480x264.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 835px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>This is where<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/20/ppc-campaign-testing-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> experiments in Google Ads and split testing in Facebook Ads</a> can come in. </span></p>
<p><span>By using these tools, you can set up tests to focus on single (or multiple) variables and give them each a fair shot in the auction. </span></p>
<p><span>If you’re interested in learning more about these tools, here are a couple of videos that walk you through <a href="https://youtu.be/97F1Voc9tiI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads Experiments</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/viA3RrZUw7Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Ads A/B testing</a>. </span></p>
<div id="measure-ab-test-success"></div>
<h2><span>Measuring success across different PPC A/B testing examples</span></h2>
<p><span>Now that we know how we’re going to test, we need to get more specific on the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/19/ppc-metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PPC metrics</a> we’re going to use to determine success. Unfortunately, I’m not willing to accept “perform better” as a good answer. </span></p>
<p><span>First, we have to decide what our main KPI is. Is it your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/15/google-ads-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads cost per lead</a>? Conversion rate? Click-through rate? <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/07/impression-share">Impression share</a>? This will rely entirely on your hypothesis and which A/B testing example you choose to implement. Pick the stat that will best reflect a success or failure for your test. (Don’t worry, this isn’t the only metric we’d focus on. More on that in a minute.)</span></p>
<p><span>Just like the functionality of the test, there are three common ways to approach this. Let’s say we’re trying to improve the CPA for an account. Here are some ways I could phrase my “success” metric:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><strong><span>Target performance</span></strong><span>: This test is a success if the experiment variable yields a $60 CPA. </span></li>
<li><span> </span><strong><span>Percentage improvement: </span></strong><span>This test is a success if the experiment variable has a 10% lower CPA than the control.</span></li>
<li><span> </span><strong><span>Statistical significance:</span></strong><span> This test is a success if the experiment variable has an 80% confidence level of performing better than the control.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>All of these are valid ways of measurement. Choose the one that works best for your purposes.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4ca.png" alt="📊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Are your key PPC metrics up to industry standards? Find out with our latest<a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteGoogleAdsBenchmarks2023.html?cid=Web_WS_incontent_guide_2023benchmarks_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> search ad benchmarks</a> and new <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteFBBenchmarks.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_FBBenchmarks_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook ads benchmarks</a>!</p>
<h3><span>Set PPC A/B testing limitations and dealbreakers </span></h3>
<p><span>Now let’s get into some of those other metrics I alluded to. While you might be working to optimize your cost per lead, that doesn’t mean that all other metrics are going to stay flat. In fact, I’d venture to bet that many of them will change quite a bit. It’s up to you to decide what is an acceptable level of change on other stats. </span></p>
<p><span>Maybe you don’t care if your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/14/improve-google-ads-click-through-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click-through rate</a> goes down 20% as long as cost per lead goes down to a profitable level. Maybe you don’t mind <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/17/lower-cost-per-click" target="_blank" rel="noopener">if you see a cost per click increase</a> as long as revenue stays stable. But not everyone is alright with other stats moving too much. </span></p>
<p><span>Here’s an A/B testing example including varying metrics: I have a client who wanted to decrease the cost per lead on his branded terms by 20%, but he wasn’t willing to let impression share dip below 80%. While we knew it was going to be tricky to thread the needle, we set up an A/B testing experiment for target CPA bidding to try and lower the CPA. As we got into it, we realized that to hit our CPA metric, Google only showed the ads for about 60% of the impressions we could have had. That was a dealbreaker for him, so we turned the test off and found another way.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ab-testing-examples-experiment-goals.jpg" alt="ab testing examples - google ads experiment goals screenshot" width="920" height="230" class="aligncenter wp-image-80884 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ab-testing-examples-experiment-goals.jpg 920w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ab-testing-examples-experiment-goals-480x120.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 920px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>When you set up experiments in Google, they even ask for two key metrics and what you plan to have happen. You should be doing this for yourself and asking, “Are there any potential deal breakers for metrics that would require me to stop this test before it’s finished?”</span></p>
<h3>Consider your A/B testing timeline</h3>
<p><span>Unfortunately, sometimes A/B tests have to come to an end without a clear winner. These tests can’t go on forever or else you’ll never test anything else. </span></p>
<p><span>But on the flip side, A/B tests need to run for long enough to make sure you have enough data to make decisions on. Only the very largest of accounts could potentially make a decision after a single week of testing, but even then, it would have to be night and day for me to be onboard. </span></p>
<p><span>I usually recommend a minimum of two weeks for a test to run and a maximum of two months. Anything beyond that can be unmanageable and gets into a place where other factors could be causing the test to be invalidated. </span></p>
<p><span>This means that, regardless of which A/B testing example you choose to run, be sure that within two months your test will have enough data to decide, with confidence, if your hypothesis was correct. </span></p>
<h2><span>Putting the right PPC A/B testing examples to work for your business</span></h2>
<p><span>A/B testing is an invaluable tool that all marketers should likely be using in one way, shape, or form in their ad accounts. Be sure you have a clear head going into the test, including a hypothesis, plan of action, and potential deal breakers before you try any A/B testing example. That way, you’ll have set yourself up for success no matter what the outcome. If you want more A/B testing examples and ideas for your business, see how<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/marketing-services?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Demo_Blog_Demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> our solutions</a> can help you maximize your A/B testing success! </span></p>

<h2>What is conversion rate optimization?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/03/improve-conversion-rates">Conversion rate optimization</a> (CRO) is a data-driven approach to increasing the percentage of website visitors that take any desired action on a webpage (like making a purchase or booking an appointment).</p>
<p>The process involves understanding how users interact with a site, identifying barriers to conversion, and then developing hypotheses to overcome these barriers, which are tested for effectiveness.</p>
<div id="why-is-conversion-rate-optimization-important"></div>
<h2>Why is conversion rate optimization important?</h2>
<p>It’s important to recognize that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/02/conversion-rate-statistics">CRO</a> is not another buzzword—it&#8217;s a pivotal <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/12/05/best-online-marketing-strategies">growth strategy</a> that can make or break a business.</p>
<h3>Maximizes marketing spend</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/winter-content-ideas">Conversion rate optimization</a> ensures that the traffic you drive to your website through various marketing efforts isn&#8217;t wasted. By honing the effectiveness of your site, you&#8217;re getting more value from the same number of visitors, which in turn improves your ROI on marketing spend.</p>
<h3>Increases customer lifetime value</h3>
<p>CRO doesn&#8217;t just work to convert one-time buyers; it optimizes the user experience to foster repeat customers, increasing the lifetime value of each customer and reducing the constant need for new acquisition.</p>
<h3>Lowers customer acquisition costs</h3>
<p>By improving conversion rates, you effectively lower the cost of acquiring new customers. Instead of casting wider nets, you&#8217;re making the net you have more efficient at catching and retaining fish.</p>
<h3>Improves user experience</h3>
<p>A core component of CRO is making your site as user-friendly as possible, which naturally enhances the overall user experience. Happy users are more likely to convert, recommend your site, and return in the future.</p>
<h3>Encourages data-driven decisions</h3>
<p>CRO is grounded in analytics and user feedback, promoting a culture of making informed, data-driven decisions rather than relying on intuition or incomplete information.</p>
<h3>Boosts revenue</h3>
<p>Ultimately, the importance of CRO comes down to the bottom line—it directly boosts revenue. By turning more visitors into customers and doing so more efficiently, businesses can see a significant impact on their financial performance.</p>

<h2>19 critical conversion rate optimization stats for 2025</h2>
<p>These CRO stats expose the effects that industry, strategy, and devices have on conversion rates.</p>
<h3>1. The average Google Ads conversion rate is 7.04%</h3>
<p>In our yearly <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/15/google-ads-benchmarks">Google Ads benchmarks</a> report, we analyzed over 17,000 campaigns and found an average conversion rate of 7.04%.</p>
<p>The bad news? That represented a 10% decline from the previous year.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-YoY.webp" alt="conversion rate optimization - Year over year change of conversion rates" width="780" height="564" class="aligncenter wp-image-80066 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-YoY.webp 780w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-YoY-480x347.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 780px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><b><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></b> Improve your search ad campaigns with our 100% free <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Google Ads Grader</a></p>
<h3>2. Apparel and fashion jewelry have the lowest conversion rate</h3>
<p>After breaking our data down by industry, we saw those businesses selling jewelry and apparel had the hardest time converting visitors to customers. Physicians and surgeons, on the other hand, converted over 13% of their visitors.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-benchmarks-industry.webp" alt="conversion rate optimization - Conversion rate by industry" width="655" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-80067 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-benchmarks-industry.webp 655w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-benchmarks-industry-480x440.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 655px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>3. A good conversion rate for ecommerce is 4.8%</h3>
<p>Results from a survey by <a href="https://lp.littledata.io/average/ecommerce-conversion-rate-(all-devices)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LittleData</a> gave us a clear picture of what good looks like for ecommerce businesses. A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/19/conversion-rate-benchmarks">conversion rate</a> above 3.2% means you&#8217;re acing it, comfortably sitting in the top 20% of digital storefronts. And if your numbers are soaring at 4.8% or higher? You&#8217;re the headline act, dominating the scene and turning browsers into buyers like you&#8217;ve got a magic wand for sales.</p>
<p>But if your site&#8217;s conversion rate dips below 0.2%, it&#8217;s like being the DJ who can&#8217;t get the crowd moving. You&#8217;re in the bottom 20%, and it&#8217;s a clear signal to remix your strategy. But remember, if you&#8217;re already a high-flier over 3.2%, pushing for more might hit the point of diminishing returns, where the effort might not quite match the reward.</p>
<h3>4. In-stock notifications are the top conversion boosters for B2B businesses</h3>
<p><strong> </strong>In B2B ecommerce, the ultimate conversion strategy is all about the timely nudge—specifically, alerting customers when a product is back in stock, as hailed by <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1388280/ugc-impacts-conversion-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">67%</a> of surveyed pros.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-instock.webp" alt="conversion rate optimization - Statista chart on conversion rates" width="808" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-80068 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-instock.webp 808w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-instock-480x356.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 808px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1413335/effective-conversion-strategies-b2b-e-commerce-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>This proactive approach is a sales revival tactic, effectively wooing customers back for a satisfying return purchase. Complementing this with razor-sharp site analytics and on-point onsite searches means rolling out the red carpet straight to checkout.</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s not forget the crowd-pleasers: <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">personalized</a> product suggestions, tempting promotions, and the persuasive power of ratings and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/16/get-more-google-reviews">reviews</a> act like the supportive best friends of conversion, turning browsers into buyers by making them feel like the VIPs of your online storefront.</p>
<h3>5. User-generated content is a conversion catalyst</h3>
<p>Analysis of 1,200 websites showed a solid <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1388280/ugc-impacts-conversion-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3.2%</a> conversion rate with the presence of UGC, and that rate jumped by an additional 3.8% when visitors encountered and scrolled through UGC.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-indicator.webp" alt="conversion rate optimization - chart showing indicators of high conversion rate" width="936" height="569" class="aligncenter wp-image-80069 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-indicator.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-indicator-480x292.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1388280/ugc-impacts-conversion-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>The real kicker came when users engaged with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/13/ugc-instagram">UGC</a> (not just viewed it). Doing so doubled their likelihood of making a purchase, catapulting conversion rates by an impressive 102%.</p>
<p>This data underscores a clear message: active interaction with customer reviews, photos, and videos turns shoppers into buyers, making UGC a vital key to unlocking e-commerce success.</p>
<h3>6. Mobile vs. desktop conversion rates: Which converts better?</h3>
<p>Device type significantly influences conversion rates, with desktops hitting a high note at 5.06% while mobile trails at 2.49%, according to <a href="https://marketing.dynamicyield.com/benchmarks/device-usage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dynamic Yield&#8217;s data</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-monthly-cr.webp" alt="conversion rate optimization - monthly conversion rate" width="792" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-80070 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-monthly-cr.webp 792w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-monthly-cr-480x364.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 792px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://marketing.dynamicyield.com/benchmarks/device-usage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>But don&#8217;t be fooled; mobile&#8217;s might isn&#8217;t in conversion percentages but in sheer traffic volume, commanding around 65% compared to desktop&#8217;s 32%.</p>
<p>This stark contrast underscores a critical strategy point: neglecting <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-mobile-advertising">mobile optimization</a> could be costly, risking not just immediate sales but long-term customer allegiance in a market increasingly dominated by mobile browsing. Prioritizing a seamless mobile experience is essential, ensuring you capture the full spectrum of the shopping audience.</p>
<h3>7. Automated SMS campaigns can boost conversion by 21%</h3>
<p>Getting in touch with customers where they hang out is becoming quite the trend, especially through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/09/sms-marketing">SMS</a>, Facebook Messenger, and WhatsApp. Think about it—everyone&#8217;s glued to their phones these days, right? So it makes perfect sense to drop your ads, promos, and those sweet, sweet discounts straight into their messaging apps. It&#8217;s like delivering your pitch into their hands—literally.</p>
<p>The timing couldn&#8217;t be better because when your message pings at the right moment, you&#8217;re much more likely to catch their attention. And here&#8217;s a juicy tidbit: hook up those automated marketing campaigns to SMS, and you could see conversions inflate by <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/hubfs/2023%20State%20of%20Marketing%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">21%</a>.</p>
<h3>8. Conversion rate is the 4th most important metric to marketers</h3>
<p>Nearly a third of marketing pros, 29% to be precise, cast their vote for conversion rate as an indicator of marketing success. (P.S. conversion rate is not <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/07/05/conversion-rate-metric">the most important CRO metric</a>.)</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-content.webp" alt="conversion rate optimization -graph of success indicators for content marketing" width="750" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-80071 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-content.webp 750w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-content-480x384.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.hubspot.com/hubfs/2023%20State%20of%20Marketing%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a significant show of hands, underscoring that while it may not be grabbing the gold medal, conversion rate is still stepping onto the podium as a crucial measure to watch.</p>
<h3>9. The majority of websites maintain a sub-40% bounce rate</h3>
<p>When it comes to keeping visitors hooked, it seems like two-thirds of websites are sticking the landing, boasting an average bounce rate below the <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/web-traffic-analytics-report">40%</a> mark.</p>
<p>On the flip side, only a small fraction, about 11%, find themselves on the higher end of the spectrum, with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/07/reduce-bounce-rate">bounce rates</a> soaring over 60%. This stat highlights that most sites are good at enticing visitors to stick around and explore more than just the landing page.</p>
<h3>10. CRO software market will grow to $5 billion by 2025</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/conversion-rate">conversion rate</a> optimization (CRO) software scene is exploding! From 2019&#8217;s cool USD 3.01 billion, we&#8217;re cruising to a hefty <a href="https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/product/conversion-rate-optimisation-cro-software-market/index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$5.07 billion </a>by 2025.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-market-size.webp" alt="conversion rate optimization - graph of conversion software market size" width="936" height="437" class="aligncenter wp-image-80072 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-market-size.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-market-size-480x224.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/product/conversion-rate-optimisation-cro-software-market/index" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Why? Businesses know CRO tools help boost online sales and keep customers hooked. It&#8217;s not just about looking good online; it&#8217;s about making every visit count, and that&#8217;s where CRO comes in.</p>
<p>Now, sure, these tools come with a price tag, and not everyone knows their way around data analytics. But that&#8217;s just a hurdle, not a stop sign. Companies are tripping over themselves to pour money into the latest <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/15/ai-marketing">AI</a> and machine learning to get ahead in the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/website-conversion">website optimization game</a>, which is the golden ticket in CRO right now.</p>

<h3>11. Generative AI boosts optimization for 55% of marketers</h3>
<p>Marketers are tuning into the frequency of generative AI. Already, 32% are harnessing the power of GenAI, with another 43% lining up to tap into its potential.</p>
<p>The standout feature they&#8217;re all excited about? A hefty 55% leap in the ability to experiment and optimize at the drop of a hat. This is about turning campaigns around at lightning speed and dialing up content personalization to impressive levels.</p>
<p>But diving into <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-copywriting-tools">artificial intelligence</a> isn&#8217;t without its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/28/ai-for-marketing">challenges</a>.

The message is clear: it&#8217;s optimization gold if you&#8217;ve got the map to find it.</p>
<h3>12. B2B websites with 1 second load time have 5x more conversions</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.portent.com/blog/analytics/research-site-speed-hurting-everyones-revenue.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Portent&#8217;s research</a> highlights a straightforward but powerful insight. Faster load times equal better conversion rates.</p>

<p>Stagnancy in improvement is notable, with 82% of sites loading in five seconds or less. That’s unchanged since 2019.</p>
<p>The real eye-opener is the direct correlation between speed and conversions. If your site loads in a brisk one second, your conversion rates could triple compared to a five-second load time. Even more impressive, that same one-second page load can mean conversion rates five times higher than those of a 10-second loader. It&#8217;s clear that when it comes to clinching leads, every second shaved off your load time can make a substantial difference.</p>
<h3>13. B2C sites with 1 second load time see a 2.5x higher conversion</h3>
<p>Similar to B2B sites, recent findings by Portent reveal a crucial link between site speed and sales conversions for B2C websites, too.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-sessions-1.webp" alt="conversion rate optimization - graph showing time to load effect" width="936" height="488" class="aligncenter wp-image-80075 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-sessions-1.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-sessions-1-480x250.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.portent.com/blog/analytics/research-site-speed-hurting-everyones-revenue.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s good news: site speed is on the up, with 86% of pages now loading in under five seconds—a notable increase from 81% back in 2019.</p>
<p>Here’s why that matters. If your pages load in just one second, you&#8217;re looking at ecommerce conversion rates that are a whopping 2.5 times higher than if your site takes a more leisurely five seconds to load.</p>
<p>Bottom line? When it comes to B2C ecommerce, faster is better, and every second really does count.</p>
<h3>14. Product reviews greatly affect conversion rates</h3>
<p>Products flaunting just five reviews are <a href="https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/how-online-reviews-influence-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">270%</a> more likely to be purchased than those with none. Talk about a skyrocket in consumer confidence!</p>
<p>It seems the heftier the price, the heftier the influence of reviews. For more budget-friendly items, showing off reviews can pump up conversion rates by a solid 190%. But for those big-ticket items? A dramatic 380% boost. The graph paints a clear picture: reviews can nearly double conversion rates for low-priced goods and nearly quadruple them for the expensive stuff.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-high-price.webp" alt="conversion rate optimization - graph comparing high and low priced items and conversion rate" width="609" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-80077 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-high-price.webp 609w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-high-price-480x473.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 609px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/how-online-reviews-influence-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Yet, when it comes to star ratings, perfection can raise eyebrows. Shoppers are most likely to hit the buy button for products rated between 4 and 4.7 stars. Hit that pristine 5-star mark, and shoppers start to get skeptical, wondering if it&#8217;s too good to be true.</p>
<h3>15. Personalized CTAs convert 202% better than standard ones</h3>
<p>Personalized <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/20/call-to-action-buttons">call-to-action buttons</a> (CTAs) aren&#8217;t just effective, they&#8217;re like striking conversion oil. <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/personalized-calls-to-action-convert-better-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HubSpot&#8217;s deep dive</a> into over 330,000 CTAs over six months unearthed a sparkling stat: Personalized CTAs have a conversion rate that&#8217;s 202% better than your run-of-the-mill, one-size-fits-all CTAs.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just small potatoes, it&#8217;s a full-on feast of potential. Why? Because personalized CTAs are like having a secret handshake with each customer, offering them something that clicks with their unique journey and interests.</p>
<h3>16. Videos convert more with mid-roll CTAs and clear email asks</h3>
<p>While conventional wisdom placed CTAs and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/22/lead-capture-form">lead capture forms</a> at the beginning or end of videos, <a href="https://wistia.com/about/state-of-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data from Wistia</a> consistently shows that mid-roll placements are the conversion sweet spots.</p>
<p>Despite a decrease in their usage, lead capture forms have seen a doubling in conversion rates—hinting at untapped potential, especially when the forms include the term &#8220;email&#8221; in their copy.</p>
<p>Plus, while allowing viewers to skip giving out their email might seem counterintuitive, it’s proving effective. But the real conversion heroes? The fully gated <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/13/explainer-videos">videos</a>—those that require an email before proceeding—see the highest conversion rates, suggesting that viewers are more willing than ever to exchange their contact information for valuable content.</p>
<h3>17. CTA button color isn&#8217;t the conversion hero</h3>
<p>Think a splash of red or a dash of blue on your CTA button is a game-changer for conversions? Not quite. It&#8217;s less about the hue and more about how the button pops against the page, grabbing attention and guiding users to click.</p>
<p>Take a cue from Bing, who dialed up their revenue by <a href="https://www.shockmarketer.com/call-to-action-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$80 million</a> just by picking the perfect blue—a blue not too different from Google&#8217;s, tapping into users&#8217; web-wired brains that equate blue with links.</p>
<h3>18. Entertainment, games, and travel lead the pack on Apple’s App Store</h3>
<p>In the search ad scene in Apple&#8217;s App Store, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1412216/apple-app-store-ads-conversion-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">travel and entertainment apps</a> were playing to win.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-apps2.webp" alt="conversion rate optimization - graph showing entertainment apps get good conversion" width="674" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-80078 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-apps2.webp 674w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-apps2-480x427.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 674px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1412216/apple-app-store-ads-conversion-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>In the search ad scene in Apple&#8217;s App Store during the latter half of 2022, games and entertainment apps were playing to win.</p>
<p>A staggering 69% of users who spotted an ad for a travel app couldn&#8217;t resist tapping on it. That&#8217;s like two out of every three people deciding to check out the app after seeing an ad.</p>
<p>But hold your horses, because entertainment apps were the ones stealing the spotlight. They hit an eye-popping 79.69% conversion rate, meaning nearly 8 out of 10 people were swiping at those ads like there&#8217;s no tomorrow.</p>
<h3>19. Events and navigation apps had the highest conversion rate in the Google Play Store</h3>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s jump into the Google Play Store&#8217;s world, focusing on the US market. Here, the overall download conversion rate for Android apps was sitting at a comfy <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1405963/gp-store-app-conversion-by-category/">31%</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-apps1.webp" alt="conversion rate optimization - app conversion rates in the Google play store" width="936" height="578" class="aligncenter wp-image-80079 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-apps1.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-apps1-480x296.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1405963/gp-store-app-conversion-by-category/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s jump into the Google Play Store&#8217;s world for the first half of 2023, focusing on the US market. Here, the overall download conversion rate for Android apps was sitting at a comfy 31.3%.</p>
<p>But check this out. Events apps, alongside maps and navigation, were crushing it with an approximate 84% conversion rate. Imagine that—almost every time someone came across one of these apps, they just had to download it. It&#8217;s like these categories had the secret sauce that made nearly everyone hit &#8216;install.&#8217;</p>
<p>On the flip side, card and word gaming apps were hanging out at the other end of the spectrum, struggling to turn those ad views into downloads. It’s a classic case of &#8216;not all apps are created equal&#8217; when convincing users to take the plunge.</p>

<h3>Add call assets to Google Ads</h3>
<p>Adding a <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2453991?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">call asset</a> to your Google Ads ad can significantly enhance your ad&#8217;s effectiveness, especially for businesses that rely on generating calls.

<p>Here&#8217;s a step-by-step guide on how to add a call asset:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sign in to your Google Ads Account: </strong>Go to the Google Ads homepage (<a href="https://ads.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://ads.google.com</a>) and log in to your account.</li>
<li><strong>Click on Ads and Assets:</strong> To add a call asset to your ad, simply hover over the ad you wish to edit and click on the pencil icon.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-call-conversions-call-assets-setup.webp" alt="google ads call conversions - how to set up call assets in google ads" width="936" height="537" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76794" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-call-conversions-call-assets-setup.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-call-conversions-call-assets-setup-480x275.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></li>

<h3>Optimize your ads to drive calls</h3>
<p>Call ads and call assets are great for driving call conversions, but it’s also important to nail the basics when it comes to your Google Ads to see the best results.</p>
<p>Here are four additional <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/21/how-to-run-google-ads">Google Ads strategies</a> you should focus on:</p>

<h4>Craft compelling ad copy</h4>
<p>Your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/21/emotional-ad-copy-examples">ad copy</a> serves as the initial impression potential customers have of your business, so make it impactful. Ensure your ad copy is concise, engaging, and directly addresses the needs of your target audience. Highlight the unique value you offer, whether it&#8217;s quick response times, competitive pricing, or exceptional quality.</p>
<h4>Optimize location targeting</h4>
<p>If your business operates within specific geographic areas, leveraging <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/17/google-ads-location-targeting">location targeting</a> is essential. You can focus your ads on particular cities, regions, or even create a radius around your business location. This ensures that your ads are visible to users in areas where you can provide your services.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-location-report.webp" alt="google ads location report for location targeting" width="936" height="341" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76517" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-location-report.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-location-report-480x175.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Strategize ad scheduling</h4>
<p>Utilize <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/13/how-to-set-up-ad-scheduling">ad scheduling</a> to display your ads during the times when your target audience is most active. If you&#8217;ve observed that calls tend to peak during specific hours, adjust your ad schedule to maximize the opportunity to connect with potential customers during those time frames. This approach improves the likelihood of generating valuable phone calls for your business.</p>
<div id="optimize-google-ads-landing-page-to-drive-calls"></div>
<h3>Optimize your ad landing page (and include a call button)</h3>
<p>Landing page optimization is a critical component of a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/21/how-to-run-google-ads">successful Google Ads campaign</a>, especially when the primary goal is to generate phone calls. Ensuring that your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">landing page</a> is user-friendly, engaging, and prominently displays a clickable phone number on mobile devices can significantly boost the effectiveness of your click-to-call strategy.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a step-by-step guide to optimizing your landing page with a clickable phone number using the tel: HTML code.</p>
<h4>Choose a mobile-friendly design</h4>
<p>Start with a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/11/landing-page-trends">mobile-responsive landing page design</a>. The layout should adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring a positive user experience for visitors using smartphones.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-call-conversions-mobile-landing-page.webp" alt="google ads call conversions - mobile landing page example with call button " width="294" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76798" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-call-conversions-mobile-landing-page.webp 294w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-call-conversions-mobile-landing-page-147x300.webp 147w" sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px" /></p>
<h4>Place the phone number prominently</h4>
<p>Position the phone number prominently on the landing page where it&#8217;s easily visible without scrolling. This placement could be in the header, near the top of the page, or in a prominent <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">call-to-action</a> section.</p>
<h4>Make the phone number clickable</h4>
<p>To make the phone number clickable on mobile devices, you can use the tel: HTML code. This code allows users to initiate a call directly from their mobile device when they tap on the phone number.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the tel: HTML code format:<br />
&lt;a href=&#8221;tel:YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER&#8221;&gt;Click to Call&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>Replace YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER with your actual phone number. For example:<br />
&lt;a href=&#8221;tel:+1234567890&#8243;&gt;Click to Call&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<h4>Use a call to action</h4>
<p>When incorporating the clickable phone number, go beyond the basics by crafting compelling <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/powerful-call-to-action-phrases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">call-to-action phrases</a> that inspire immediate action. Think along the lines of &#8220;Call for a Free Quote&#8221; or &#8220;Connect with an Expert Today.&#8221;</p>
<p>These prompts not only make the phone number enticing but also set clear expectations for the call. It&#8217;s not just about providing a contact number; it&#8217;s about kindling a sense of urgency and showcasing the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/20/product-positioning">unique benefits</a> they&#8217;ll receive by reaching out to your business.</p>
<h4>Show the number</h4>
<p>Don&#8217;t stop at making your phone number clickable. Take it a step further by seamlessly integrating the number directly into your CTA. By incorporating your number in this way, you&#8217;re not just making things easier; you&#8217;re showcasing your readiness to assist, even for those browsing your website on a desktop environment where clicking the button doesn’t function the same as it does on mobile–here they have the option to see it and dial it.</p>

<h2>How to track call conversions in Google Ads</h2>
<p>You have a couple of options to track these actions effectively. One option is to configure them as conversions within <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/23/google-analytics-4-vs-universal-analytics">Google Analytics 4</a> (GA4) and then import the conversions into Google Ads.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can utilize a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/30/google-ads-conversion-tracking">Google Ads conversion tracking tag</a> that triggers when users click on the site elements, such as phone numbers, buttons, or links. It&#8217;s important to note that Google Ads only registers these interactions as clicks, not the actual call or action, essentially measuring the number of individuals who engage with the phone number, button, or link.</p>
<p>Google Ads also allows you to track calls that were made by people who click on your ad and then proceed to make a call. Google Ads places a forward number that gets displayed on your website, and anyone who calls it is registered as a conversion.</p>
<p>Use these steps to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGdAx6-SKek&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">track call conversions</a> in Google Ads:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Tools → Conversions in Google Ads.</li>
<li>Click the plus (+) button to create a call conversion.</li>
<li>Choose &#8220;Track Phone calls.&#8221;</li>
<li>Select &#8220;Calls to a phone number on your website&#8221; and click Continue.</li>
<li>Enter the Conversion name (e.g., &#8220;Lead&#8221;).</li>
<li>Choose &#8220;Don’t use a value&#8221; for tracking call value.</li>
<li>Select &#8220;Every&#8221; for counting conversions per interaction.</li>
<li>Configure optional settings, such as Call Length and Conversion window.</li>
<li>Optionally, enable &#8220;Include in ‘Conversions&#8221; and set the Attribution model.</li>
<li>Create the conversion and continue.</li>
<li>Go to Tag setup and choose &#8220;Use Google Tag Manager.&#8221;</li>
<li>Obtain the Conversion ID and Conversion label.</li>
<li>Enable the Conversion Linker Tag in Google Tag Manager.</li>
<li>Create a new Tag in Google Tag Manager.</li>
<li>Name the Tag (e.g., &#8220;GAds – Call Extension – All Pages&#8221;).</li>
<li>Configure the Tag type as &#8220;Google Ads Calls from Website Conversion.&#8221;</li>
<li>Enter the Displayed Phone Number to Replace.</li>
<li>Paste the Conversion ID and Conversion Label.</li>
<li>Set up the trigger (e.g., &#8220;All Pages&#8221;).</li>
<li>Save the configuration.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Note: Be precise with details like the phone number and the Conversion ID/Label (found in your conversion action), and adjust settings based on your website&#8217;s specifics.</em></p>

<p>Oh, if only that were true. However, now that you’re thinking about the proper way to motivate someone, let’s talk about the mighty call to action (CTA).</p>
<p>A CTA is the most important element in most marketing messages. Whether you want people to place an order, set an appointment, or subscribe to your email, CTAs are the final step in making it happen.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-duedil.jpg" alt="call to action - example CTA from Duedil" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76599 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-duedil.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-duedil-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Look at that blue call-to-action button telling us what to do next.</em></p>
<p>But how do you write a good call to action?</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll show you how to craft the type of CTAs that jump off the screen and get people to do the one thing you really want them to do. Maybe you won’t get a million dollars directly, but with your new CTAs at the ready, you’ll generate a lot more business. And that’s almost as good.</p>

<h2>What is a call to action in marketing?</h2>
<p>In marketing, a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/07/call-to-action-marketing">call to action</a>, or CTA, is a word or phrase that tells your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/09/18/beginners-guide-to-target-markets">target audience</a> what to do next. They can be plain copy, but they’re often clickable links either in text or in a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/20/call-to-action-buttons">CTA button</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-barkbright.jpg" alt="call to action - screenshot of a landing page from brand Bark Bright" width="923" height="348" class="aligncenter wp-image-76600 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-barkbright.jpg 923w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-barkbright-480x181.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 923px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You can use CTAs in just about any type of marketing message. In fact, a customer might see several CTAs as they move from unaware prospect to repeat buyer.</p>
<p>For example, someone might click a “learn more” button on your Facebook ad, then click a “subscribe now” button on your landing page, then click a “buy now” CTA button from your newsletter.</p>

<h2>Benefits of a good call to action</h2>
<p>A call to action is a signpost that leads people down the road of becoming a customer. It helps to keep prospects moving toward that goal so they don’t veer off and get distracted.</p>
<p>These examples show the influence of a great call to action:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emails with a single CTA increased clicks by <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/06/10/digital-marketing-stats">371%</a> and sales by 1617%.</li>
<li>CTAs on a landing page increased clicks by <a href="https://www.bnpengage.com/blog/call-action-cta-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80%</a>.</li>
<li>Adding well-placed CTAs increased revenue from blog posts by <a href="https://www.brafton.com/blog/content-marketing/where-to-place-ctas-for-an-83-increase-in-blog-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">83%</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at how to create these types of irresistible CTAs.</p>
<div id="how-to-write-a-call-to-action"></div>
<h2>How do you write a good call to action?</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-pros-write-calls-to-action">good call to action</a> will attract attention and make it hard to resist taking the next step in ads, emails, landing pages, and more. Read on to learn how to write CTAs that drive conversions no matter where they are (see what we did there?).</p>
<h3>1. Use a strong verb to start your CTA</h3>
<p>You don’t have a ton of space to get your point across. Don’t dilly or dally. Let your audience know exactly what you want them to do by leading each <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/20/call-to-action-buttons">CTA button</a> with an action verb.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-lockin.jpg" alt="call to action - screenshot of a call to action page promoting free gift" width="936" height="571" class="aligncenter wp-image-76601 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-lockin.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-lockin-480x293.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There are different action verbs depending on the type of business you run and what you want your customer to do. Here are a few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For an ecommerce website:</strong> Start your CTA with words like “buy,” “shop,” or “order”</li>
<li><strong>If you’re promoting a newsletter or piece of content:</strong> Start your CTA with words like “download” or “subscribe”</li>
<li><b>For a service-based business:</b> Try CTAs that begin with “call now” or “book your appointment.”</li>
</ul>
<p>What you don’t want is to simply say something exists. “Our newest fashions are available” won’t stir people to action, whereas “click here for the latest trends” feels kinetic and is more likely to improve your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/click-through-rate">click-through rate</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Include words that provoke emotion or enthusiasm</h3>
<p>If you want more clicks and conversions, you need to elicit a strong response from your audience. An enthusiastic CTA that taps into <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotional copywriting</a> is just the thing to get it done.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-donedone.jpg" alt="call to action - screenshot of a landing page from brand Done Done" width="817" height="583" class="aligncenter wp-image-76602 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-donedone.jpg 817w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-donedone-480x343.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 817px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Let’s say someone is looking to book a trip with their family. They come across a CTA like “plan your dream vacation today!” That’ll get them hyped and thinking about what their dream vacation looks like. They’ll eagerly click the link in your ad.</p>
<p>Some other ways your CTAs can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/01/13/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing">tap into emotion include</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reducing risk and insecurity</li>
<li>Building trust</li>
<li>Creating urgency</li>
<li>Communication value</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t forget punctuation. Add an exclamation point to the end of your CTA to max out the excitement. It’ll make your CTA pop and give it a little extra kick.</p>
<h3>3. Give your audience a reason to act</h3>
<p>In other words, tell people what’s in it for them if they click. Will it help them do their jobs better, lose weight, or save money? This will tie in heavily with your value proposition, or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/07/unique-selling-proposition">unique selling point</a> (USP). Your USP is arguably one of the most important pieces of acquiring new leads, so creating a nice USP/CTA mash-up is a great way to increase clicks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-slider.jpg" alt="call to action - screenshot of landing page with CTA from brand slider" width="842" height="589" class="aligncenter wp-image-76603 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-slider.jpg 842w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-slider-480x336.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 842px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>A good <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/13/call-to-action-examples">example of a call to action</a> here would be something like “call us to start saving money today!” Not only have you stated the action you want the user to take (call today), but you have also provided them with a reason why they should take that action (save money).</p>
<h3>4. Take advantage of FOMO</h3>
<p>This is actually one of my favorite tactics when it comes to a successful CTA. Fear of missing out, otherwise known as <a href="http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2011/04/14/fomo-addiction-the-fear-of-missing-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FOMO</a>, is an extremely effective motivator. When people think they might lose out on an opportunity that might not come around again, they’ll be mighty quick to hop on the bandwagon.</p>
<p>One of the best uses of FOMO in your CTA is to mention a sale or promotion that your company is holding, and which won’t last forever.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-curbside-1.jpg" alt="call to action - Screenshot of an ad with CTA for shop now" width="370" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76604 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-curbside-1.jpg 370w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-curbside-1-185x300.jpg 185w" sizes="(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px" /></p>
<p>You probably get emails with this sort of messaging all the time, I know I sure do. I’m talking about messaging like “Shop today! Sale ends on Monday,” perhaps during a three-day weekend. Or even “buy now while supplies last!” during the holiday season. It’s tough to ignore a prompt like that, especially during a time-sensitive, under-the-gun type of situation (e.g. the Christmas season).</p>
<p>Similar to provoking enthusiasm as we discussed earlier, provoking fear of missing out in your CTA is sure to get you some additional clicks.</p>
<h3>5. Match CTA to device type</h3>
<p>Creating a killer call-to-action is important, that’s no secret. But I also urge you to consider customizing your CTA based on the device being used by your audience. Google considers <a href="http://searchengineland.com/the-real-reason-why-google-is-dropping-the-tablet-vs-desktop-distinction-its-the-user-context-stupid-149738" target="_blank" rel="noopener">desktop and tablet as the same device</a>, since the screen sizes are roughly the same. People also use them for search in similar scenarios.</p>
<p>For example, someone sitting on the couch at night sees an ad on TV for a product they’re interested in. It’s common for them to grab their laptop or tablet and search for more information on it. It might be best to lead them with a “learn more” or “shop now” CTA.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/18/mobile-ad-strategies">mobile devices tend to have different user behavior</a> and search intent than desktop/tablets. Since <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/local-seo-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80%</a> of searches for local business on mobile devices convert, it’s prudent to tailor your CTA based on device..</p>
<p>One big difference between desktop and mobile is that on mobile, people have the ability to place a call from the device they’re shopping with. My advice is to create more phone call-centric CTAs that appear on mobile devices, especially for service-based businesses. This lawn care company has a clickable phone number on their landing page.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-landscape.jpg" alt="call to action - screenshot of a landscapers website with clickable phone number" width="356" height="595" class="aligncenter wp-image-76605 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-landscape.jpg 356w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-landscape-179x300.jpg 179w" sizes="(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px" /></p>
<p>Some possible <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/powerful-call-to-action-phrases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CTA phrases</a> to try could be “call now to get started” or “call us today for more information” to guide your target audience to take the action you want them to take.</p>
<h3>6. A/B test your CTAs</h3>
<p>A good, old-fashioned <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/09/25/a-b-testing">A/B test</a> is a great way to identify which CTA’s bring you clicks, and which CTA’s bring you frowns. While your tried and true <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/20/call-to-action-examples">calls-to-action</a> like the ones we’ve already discussed are always good to use, you really never know how they’ll perform in your account until you actually use them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-dewalt.jpg" alt="call to action - Comparision of two ads from Dewalt" width="926" height="384" class="aligncenter wp-image-76606 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-dewalt.jpg 926w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-dewalt-480x199.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 926px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Digital marketing is definitely a game of trial and error (which is why it can be frustrating!), and your calls-to-action are no exception to the rule. Something could look great on paper, or may sound great when a colleague recommends it to you, but the only way you’ll absolutely know for sure if something will work for your account is if you test it out.</p>
<p>Your target audience may not respond well to what could be considered a “surefire CTA,” which is enough to make you pull your hair out. By A/B testing, you can trial some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2010/09/29/unusual-effective-calls-to-action">creative CTAs</a> and compare them to your old standards. If your target audience isn’t responding well to your ads, you might as well try to think outside the box a bit!</p>
<p>Start with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out today’s deals!</li>
<li>Fill out a form to get started</li>
<li>Call today for more information</li>
</ul>
<p>And test against:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tons of deals at your fingertips</li>
<li>A healthier life starts now!</li>
<li>Don’t miss out, call us today!</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Add numbers when possible</h3>
<ol start="7"></ol>
<p>We consumers respond well to seeing numbers such as pricing, discounts, promotions, incentives, etc. It helps us to determine whether or not it’s worth splurging on items we desperately want, but probably aren’t essential to everyday life. So when the opportunity arises, why not appeal to your target audience that way?</p>
<p>I am always a big proponent of including pricing information in your ad copy in general, and that includes your CTA. If a user sees your pricing information in your ad, and decides to click through to your site, then you know they are still interested in the product or service you are offering. Now you know you have yourself a valuable click, and an increased chance at generating a conversion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-luna.jpg" alt="call to action - landing page from brand Luna with subscribe CTA" width="557" height="584" class="wp-image-76607 size-full aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-luna.jpg 557w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-luna-480x503.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 557px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But, if you don’t include your pricing information in your ads, someone may click through to your site, excited about your products/services, but then get scared off by your prices. Now you have yourself a less than desirable situation. This leads to the dreaded wasted spend in your account, and who wants to deal with that?</p>
<p>Try experimenting with your pricing information in your CTA, as well as any other applicable numerical information. A CTA such as “Shop today for TVs under $300!” not only shows a user how little they will pay for a TV, but it also hits on the FOMO element as well (pretty sneaky huh?).</p>
<p>If you run a special promotion for shipping, you could try something like “order by Sunday for 1-day shipping.” Maybe you are an auto body shop looking to incentivize your audience with a discount; your CTA might look something like “Book today! 15% off your next visit.”</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="👋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Want more tips on creating ads that convert?

<h3>8. Be bold in your CTA copy</h3>
<p>This can be a little risqué, but adding a dash of brash to your CTA copy can be pretty effective in catching someone’s eye.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-unspam.jpg" alt="call to action - screenshot of an ad for a conference with a bold CTA" width="789" height="587" class="aligncenter wp-image-76608 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-unspam.jpg 789w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/call-to-action-example-unspam-480x357.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 789px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>One option that can be tough to pull off is using negative words to motivate a person to change something they are self-conscious about. For example, if I was on Google looking to lose weight and saw a call-to-action such as “end your crappy diet today,” I might just want to click. Sure, it’s a bit over-the-top, which is why I recommend using this technique sparingly, but it definitely commands attention.</p>
<p>Here’s another example. Say I want to fix the brown patches in my lawn. I’m perusing Google and see an ad with a CTA like “your yard sucks, let us fix it.” Not only would I probably chuckle, but I would also probably click just to see exactly what that lawn company could do for me. You’re walking a fine line with this technique, but it can pay off.</p>
<h3>Boost conversions with strong calls to action</h3>
<p>Whether it’s on your website, social media ads, search engine listings, or newsletter, a well-written call to action will get more people to take the next step toward making a purchase.</p>
<p>Remember these eight tips to write a good call to action:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use a strong verb to start your CTA</li>
<li>Include words that provoke emotion or enthusiasm</li>
<li>Give your audience a reason to act</li>
<li>Take advantage of FOMO</li>
<li>Match CTA to device type</li>
<li>A/B test your CTAs</li>
<li>Add numbers when possible</li>
<li>Be bold in your CTA</li>
</ol>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For any paid media campaign that’s not running on pure awareness, there’s nearly always some form of goal conversion associated. Whether it’s a purchase of a product, generation of a lead, or engagement with a social profile, there’s an outcome we’re trying to achieve.</p>
<p>For the sake of this article, we’re going to refer to all of those actions as conversions. And the goal of increasing our conversion performance can be greatly impacted by increasing conversion rates.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/average-search-advertising-conversion-rates.jpg" alt="average search advertising conversion rate by industry from wordstream google ads benchmarks report" width="712" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75892" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/average-search-advertising-conversion-rates.jpg 712w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/average-search-advertising-conversion-rates-480x404.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 712px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>These were the average search advertising conversion rates for each industry from our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/15/google-ads-benchmarks">Google Ads benchmarks</a>.</em></p>
<p>In this article, I’ll discuss some of my favorite strategies for increasing conversion rates:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pay attention to page speed</li>
<li>Provide sufficient, easy-to-digest information</li>
<li>Include all types of social proof</li>
<li>Set expectations for the conversion process</li>
<li>Include multiple ways for users to convert</li>
<li>Minimize required fields</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll also provide examples for a few different business types where possible to help make the illustration. Let’s get started.</p>
<h2>1. Pay attention to page speed</h2>
<p>It might not be the sexiest suggestion in this post, but <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/22/google-page-speed">page speed</a> is still a huge factor in getting users to convert. I’m sure you know from your own experience that if a page loads slowly, it’s much more likely that you’re going to leave the page and find another site rather than wait seemingly forever to convert.</p>
<p>If you’re unsure of how fast your pages are loading or not sure what to do to make them run more quickly, you can use <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s PageSpeed Insights</a> tool to get a handle on both of those things.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-pagespeed-insights.jpg" alt="google pagespeeds insights tool output example to increase conversion rates" width="881" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75894" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-pagespeed-insights.jpg 881w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-pagespeed-insights-480x326.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 881px, 100vw" /></p>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>

<h2>2. Provide sufficient, easy-to-digest information</h2>
<p>As business owners, product owners, or agencies who love our customers, we all likely have a passion for whatever we’re trying to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-business-locally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promote online</a>. Put that passion to good use!</p>
<p>Create <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">landing pages</a> with compelling information that gives an overview of your product or service and do so in an easy-to-digest fashion.</p>
<p>That could include any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product highlights and overview</li>
<li>Call out of features</li>
<li>Outline of benefits</li>
<li>Technical specifications</li>
<li>Usage or compatibility requirements</li>
<li>Visualizations or videos</li>
<li>And many more options</li>
</ul>
<p>To give an example of this, I was looking at a single product and found two very different <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/08/landing-page-examples">landing page experiences</a> for it. The Jackery Solar Generator 1500 is a portable generator that can be recharged using portable solar panels. (Pretty darn cool if you ask me.)</p>
<p>When I searched for it, there were two options for purchasing: <a href="https://www.jackery.com/products/jackery-solar-generator-1500-jackery-1500-4-x-solarsaga-100w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jackery’s site</a> and <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Jackery-Solar-Generator-1500-Explorer-1500-Portable-Power-Station-with-4-100W-Solar-Panels-Ideal-for-Home-Backup-Emergency-Outdoor-Camping/2615343591?adsRedirect=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walmart</a>.</p>
<p>On the Walmart site, which is a largely trusted retailer, there’s a handful of product images at the top of the page and then some supporting information below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-walmart-landing-page-example.jpg" alt="increase conversion rates - example of product landing page from walmart" width="593" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75895" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-walmart-landing-page-example.jpg 593w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-walmart-landing-page-example-480x486.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 593px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And that’s…kind of all of it.</p>
<p>But if you visit the main Jackery site, you get quite a bit more information.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-jackery-landing-page-example.jpg" alt="increase conversion rates - example of product landing page from jackery" width="936" height="567" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75896" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-jackery-landing-page-example.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-jackery-landing-page-example-480x291.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In the collection of images above, you can see there’s also a ton of additional information. The Features section on this page is quite long, but it gives an overview right off the top with visuals and stats that are easily read and understood. There’s an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/24/faq-page">FAQ section</a>, a visual Tech Specs area that ties directly to product components in the photo, as well as a Product Comparison section to help you find the product that fits your needs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-jackery-landing-page-features.jpg" alt="increase conversion rates - jackery landing page example features" width="866" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75897" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-jackery-landing-page-features.jpg 866w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-jackery-landing-page-features-480x332.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 866px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Now while I know there’s a big difference between Walmart selling a product for Jackery and Jackery being able to create the landing page of their dreams on their own site, the comparison still exists.</p>
<p>You can see on Walmart, we’re just trying to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/20/product-positioning">sell this product</a>. Here’s the basics, that’s probably enough.</p>
<p>But on the Jackery site, they’re extremely proud of what they’ve built and have to offer that they’re showing it off in every way, shape, and form. They include tons of info to help people make what’s undeniably a large purchase, but do it with confidence that they’ve gotten exactly what they were looking for.</p>

<h2>3. Include all types of social proof</h2>
<p>Whether we want to admit it or not, the social standing of a product or service plays a role in whether someone will want to convert on your site or not. Be sure to include any instances of <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-social-proof/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social proof</a> you can come up with and allow those insights to do some of your promotional work for you. Here are some examples of what those could look like, sticking with the Jackery site to keep the example running.</p>
<h3>Customer reviews</h3>
<p>I honestly believe one of the most impactful selling points of a product or service is the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/16/get-more-google-reviews">reviews</a> of previous customers. People aren’t shy about sharing their opinions online, so when you can have an overwhelmingly positive set of statements from customers, that goes a long way.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-customer-reviews.jpg" alt="increase conversion rates - example of customer reviews on product landing page to help drive conversion rates up" width="700" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75898" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-customer-reviews.jpg 700w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-customer-reviews-480x410.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is just one review from the Jackery site, but they have quite a few that look like this as well. You can visually see the 4.9/5 star rating that shows up and the highlighted bars in the columns in the middle very easily on the site because they’re yellow, which stands apart from the site’s main orange and dark gray theme. And even though when you look closer and see there are only 32 reviews, it’s still pretty compelling that there are no reviews lower than a 4 on this product.</p>
<h3>Major media mentions</h3>
<p>Another good social proof signal is including any major publication or media mentions your company or products have.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for my example, Jackery doesn’t have this option (or the next) on their landing page, but it does live on the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/27/guide-to-about-us-pages">About page</a> on the site.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-media-mentions.jpg" alt="increase conversion rates - include media mentions and major organizational partners" width="936" height="442" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75899" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-media-mentions.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-media-mentions-480x227.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Including these gives credibility by affiliating you with other brands that users likely have heard of before, especially if that publication has lots of clout in a specific area.</p>
<p>For the logos above, as a person interested in green portable solar power, I find the mentions from Outdoor Life and National Forest Foundation to be particularly interesting. I’m also an amateur photographer, so the mention from Digital Camera World is also nice to see. You never know what publications will pique someone’s interest, so be sure to include any potential options on your site.</p>
<h3>Awards, ratings, and certifications</h3>
<p>Also found on the About page of the Jackery site is a quick overview of their certifications and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-promote-business-award/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">awards</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-awards.jpg" alt="increase conversion rates - include awards and certifications - example from jackery" width="936" height="386" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75900" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-awards.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-awards-480x198.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Just like the media outlet mentions, these can be compelling for folks who are familiar with the field and help give your business credibility. Extra points if your competition doesn’t have similar awards for comparison.</p>
<h2>4. Set expectations for the conversion process</h2>
<p>Many customers will feel more comfortable taking a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/03/improve-conversion-rates">conversion action</a> if they know what’s coming next. If they’ve never worked with your company before, this can help put them at least and, potentially, help prevent them from contacting your customer support prematurely or unnecessarily.</p>
<p>For an ecommerce account, this might seem a little strange. Add a product to cart, check out, it shows up at your door, right? Not quite.</p>
<p>How long will it take for you to package the product and get it in the mail? How long will it take once it’s there? Do you need to have someone ready to sign for the product or can it be dropped off at a door?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-communicate-conversion-path.jpg" alt="increase conversion rates - communicate conversion path - example from zok" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75902" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-communicate-conversion-path.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-communicate-conversion-path-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://zokrelief.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/12/how-to-generate-leads">lead generation</a>, this is even more important. Once a prospect fills out a form, how long will it be before they hear from you? In what format will they hear from you: phone call, email, calendar invite? Do they need to have anything prepped for that point of contact and what are the steps after that touch point?</p>
<p>When customers know what to expect, it’s easier for them to visualize working with you, making it more likely for them to convert.</p>
<h2>5. Include multiple ways for users to convert</h2>
<p>The conversion action you use will have a great impact on your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/19/conversion-rate-benchmarks">conversion rates</a>.</p>
<p>A very common “best practice” with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/conversion-rate-optimization">conversion rate optimization</a> is to include only one call to action on your landing page. This is intended to help avoid confusion and provide only one way forward (or backward) for the user to go. In some instances, this can help folks who want more information to convert but don’t have another path to take.</p>
<p>Personally, I’m a little allergic to that approach. While I certainly agree you can have a single call to action as the primary focus of a page, I don’t know if I agree with the fact that you should only ever have one action per page and never add a second.</p>
<p>All potential customers are different. Some like to conduct all their actions online. Others want to have a phone call. Some prefer to make a purchase in person. None of these people are “wrong,” they just have their ways of doing business.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.midtowndentistrydallas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This dentist</a> provides a phone number, a &#8220;request an appointment&#8221; button, or an option to request an appointment via chat.</em></p>
<p>If you choose to include only one form of conversion on the page, say a form fill for example, you’re alienating the users who would rather chat on the phone or come directly to your store.</p>
<p>If possible, I suggest always having a few different ways for users to get in touch with you, even if they’re found on other pages of the site, and simply <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/08/google-ads-conversion-tracking-mistakes">track all of those actions</a>.</p>
<p>For Ecommerce, this might seem like a miss, but I think this applies to online sales as well.</p>
<p>Again, some people are fine adding their credit card information to any site, but others are more weary of individual businesses having that data. They’d prefer to use a brand they trust like PayPal or Apple Pay. For retailers, I always suggest accepting multiple different forms of payment (assuming fees aren’t too daunting) to capture all of your potential market.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-forms-of-conversions.jpg" alt="increase conversion rates - examples of payment methods accepted on product landing page" width="891" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75901" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-forms-of-conversions.jpg 891w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-forms-of-conversions-480x323.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 891px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>6. Minimize required fields</h2>
<p>My last suggestion for increasing conversion rates is to think about what information you really need to call someone a conversion. Do you need their name, email, and phone number? Do you need their job title and the company they work for? Do you need their home address, city, state, and zip code?</p>
<p>Now stop and think, to follow up with someone, do you <em>really need </em>all of that information, or would it just be nice to have?</p>
<p>Asking for some of those “nice to have” pieces is great, but if you go overboard with too long of a form, you risk irritating someone and asking too much of them.</p>
<p>The example that drives me the most nuts is city, state, and zip code. If you have someone’s zip code, you can easily find their city and state. There are tools that do that automatically. Stop asking for all three fields when one will suffice.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-limited-form-fields.jpg" alt="increase conversion rates - limited form field example" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75908" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-limited-form-fields.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-limited-form-fields-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Limit your forms to only the information you actually <em>need</em> to follow up with someone and leave the “nice to haves” for future sales conversations.</p>
<h2>Increase conversion rates with these simple tweaks</h2>
<p>There’s no singular tactic that is guaranteed to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/winter-content-ideas">increase your conversion rates</a>. You’ll even notice that some of my suggestions here might seem to be contradictory. Put lots of useful information on the page, but also make sure it’s concise and loads quickly. Provide lots of ways for people to convert but also limit what you ask them for in that conversion process. Add and take away. Each of these is a tactic that I’ve seen work in the past. Now it’s up to you to test and find out which will work for your company.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve taken over a lot of Google Ads accounts in my day and one of the biggest problems I find is that the account isn’t tracking conversions correctly, or at all, making it nearly impossible to know what is and isn’t working.</p>
<p>What I’d like to do is walk you through the most common issues I see with conversion tracking in Google Ads and give suggestions for how you can fix it.</p>
<h2>6 common Google Ads conversion tracking mistakes to avoid</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve got a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/30/google-ads-conversion-tracking">handy guide on Google Ads conversion tracking here</a>, and even a post on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/24/google-ads-conversion-tracking">conversion tracking hangups</a> that can get in the way of getting set up properly. What we&#8217;re covering below is more along the lines of <a href="https://www.link-assistant.com/news/top-search-engines.html">mistakes</a> advertisers make once they <em>are</em> set up. These are hard to detect because they don&#8217;t come with error messages. But lucky for you we&#8217;ve got you covered so you can avoid inaccurate reporting and misleading data.</p>
<h3>1. No conversion tracking</h3>
<p>Yes, yes, I know. I’m kind of cheating with this one.</p>
<p>Clearly, this one is pretty obvious. If you haven’t set up any conversion tracking, it’s a no-brainer that it’s going to be a problem.</p>
<p>The fix for this one is also pretty darn simple: <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/30/google-ads-conversion-tracking">go set up conversion tracking</a>.</p>
<p>But maybe finish reading this post before you do. Hopefully I’ll be able to head off a number of the problems you might have caused for yourself.</p>
<h3>2. Not tracking all conversion actions</h3>
<p>Despite best practices suggesting that you should only have one conversion action on each page, I often see <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">landing pages</a> with multiple different conversion points provided.</p>
<p>This could be any number of actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demo request form</li>
<li>Contact us form</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/18/gated-content">Gated whitepaper/</a>content download</li>
<li>Purchase</li>
<li>Engage with a chatbot</li>
<li>Schedule an appointment</li>
<li>Request a call back</li>
<li>Call</li>
</ul>
<p>No matter what you ask for on the landing page, users can often find their way to your main website as well. Think of all the different <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/13/call-to-action-examples">calls to action</a> throughout your website. Are you tracking them all?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/conversion-tracking-mistakes-add-page-load.png" alt="google ads conversion tracking - add page load" width="283" height="518" class=" wp-image-70056 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/conversion-tracking-mistakes-add-page-load.png 400w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/conversion-tracking-mistakes-add-page-load-164x300.png 164w" sizes="(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px" /></p>
<p>When you create a new conversion action in Google Ads, you can choose a category that it resides in. Let these categories act as prompts for you to think of all the ways users can engage with you on your site and then be sure that you’re tracking them all.</p>
<p>While you might want someone to eventually make a purchase or request a demo, it would be shortsighted to not count any of those other actions listed above as conversions given the potential user intent behind each.</p>
<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'>Speaking of calls to action <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f3ac.png" alt="🎬" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> &#8230; </span></p>

<p><span></div></div></span></p>
<h3>3. Tracking non-conversion events as conversions</h3>
<p>On the flip side of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/21/google-ads-not-converting">not seeing any Google Ads conversions</a>, you could be counting too many conversions. Don’t track actions that don’t provide some level of value to you. While the list I gave you above is fairly long, you’ll notice that I didn’t include things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Page views</li>
<li>Social media icon clicks</li>
<li>Video views</li>
<li>Time on site triggers</li>
<li>Ungated content downloads</li>
<li>Submitting a help ticket</li>
<li>Contacting customer service</li>
</ul>
<p>For each of these, while they might be useful to have stats on, they’re likely NOT conversion-worthy actions since they almost certainly aren’t providing you with any personal or payment information for the user.</p>
<p>Here’s how this mix-up typically happens: someone at a company identifies a page or specific action as highly valuable and likely to lead to a conversion. That then becomes a signal for user quality, then someone suggests it should be a conversion, then Bob’s your uncle, we’re tracking people who viewed an FAQs page in the same way we track demo requests.</p>
<p>I have an uncle Bob, and while he doesn’t work in marketing, even he knows it’s not a good move to have false positives in your account. Vet each of your calls to action for actual value for your company before deciding what should be a conversion and what shouldn’t.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/conversion-tracking-mistakes-goal-action-optimization.png" alt="google ads conversion tracking - goal action optimization" width="720" height="453" class="size-full wp-image-70055 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/conversion-tracking-mistakes-goal-action-optimization.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/conversion-tracking-mistakes-goal-action-optimization-480x302.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you get a lot of pushback on one of these actions and someone REALLY wants it as a conversion, then set it up as such, but count it as a secondary action. This means two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The conversion will be counted in the All Conv. column, not Conversions.</li>
<li>Any <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/17/google-ads-bid-management">Smart Bidding strategy</a> will not count this action as a success and won’t optimize for them directly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Tracking all conversion events equally, even if they’re not</h3>
<p>Ok, so you’ve narrowed down your conversion events and you have only those that are TRULY conversions in the primary status, but you’re treating them all equally. This isn’t inherently wrong, but there COULD be something amiss here.</p>
<p>Let’s take the list I provided earlier:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demo request form</li>
<li>Contact us form</li>
<li>Gated whitepaper/content download</li>
<li>Purchase</li>
<li>Engage with a chatbot</li>
<li>Schedule an appointment</li>
<li>Request a call back</li>
<li>Call</li>
</ul>
<p>While each of these may be a conversion, odds are, they’re not all of the same quality or value. Someone who fills out a demo request form likely isn’t as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/25/lead-qualification">qualified</a> as someone who simply called your business. A person who scheduled an appointment likely isn’t the same as someone who already made a purchase. And better yet, two users who both made a purchase could have <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/22/increase-average-order-value">bought orders with different values</a> and margins, impacting overall ROAS differently.</p>
<p>For ecommerce companies, this is a bit easier to sort out. You should be pulling in your revenue data along with your conversions so you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/16/return-on-ad-spend-roas">calculate a ROAS on your campaigns</a> to optimize from.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/conversion-tracking-mistakes-conversion-value.png" alt="google ads conversion tracking - conversion value" width="720" height="204" class="size-full wp-image-70054 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/conversion-tracking-mistakes-conversion-value.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/conversion-tracking-mistakes-conversion-value-480x136.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For lead gen, this could be a bit more difficult, but still worthwhile. If you’re not able to pull in dynamic values for each conversion action, you can use the default value settings available when you set up your conversions. Figure out a scale that can work for you and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/10/how-to-determine-conversion-value">determine the different value levels for each action</a>. Maybe a content download is worth $10 and a demo request is worth $250.</p>
<p>No matter what your scale is, you’re now able to track all actions in the Conversions column and then use the Conv Value and Cost / Conv Value columns to determine the value of the leads you’re generating.</p>
<h3>5. Tracking “every” conversion for lead generation</h3>
<p>On an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/08/how-to-build-an-ecommerce-website">ecommerce site</a>, if someone makes five different purchases, then their lifetime value will go up because each purchase had revenue attached to it. That’s simple.</p>
<p>Lead generation is different. If someone submits the same information to your site 15 times, you don’t get 15x the returns. You still only really have one lead and the data in your conversion column should reflect that.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/conversion-tracking-mistakes-conversion-count.png" alt="google ads conversion tracking - conversion count" width="720" height="179" class="size-full wp-image-70053 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/conversion-tracking-mistakes-conversion-count.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/conversion-tracking-mistakes-conversion-count-480x119.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In the conversion setup process, you can select the frequency of tracking: One or Every. For ecommerce, you’ll choose Every. Lead generation should select One so you only track the one lead submission for each user and avoid double and triple (or worse) counting of leads, which would again create a false positive.</p>
<h3>6. Tracking phone calls of very short duration</h3>
<p>In Google Ads, you can track calls directly from the platform if the call uses a Google forwarding number. These can be a great option for tracking (and in some cases recording) phone calls from your Call Assets (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/16/google-ads-extensions-now-assets">formerly Extensions)</a>. This gives businesses an easy way to see how many phone calls ads are generating and tie them directly back to the campaigns, ads, and keywords which triggered them.</p>
<p>The problem comes when the phone calls being tracked are ALL phone calls. But as anyone who has conducted a phone call will know, every call is different.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/conversion-tracking-mistakes-call-log.png" alt="google ads conversion tracking - call log" width="720" height="386" class="size-full wp-image-70052 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/conversion-tracking-mistakes-call-log.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/conversion-tracking-mistakes-call-log-480x257.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In the image above, you can see some calls are as long as 28 minutes (1,701 seconds) and others are as short as six seconds. Should those two calls be treated the same? Methinks not.</p>
<p>For most businesses, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/13/facebook-ecommerce-tips">a sale of a product</a> or a lead will be considered a conversion in their Google Ads campaigns. For those types of actions to occur, there’s a minimum amount of time someone will need to be on the phone to get the same level of value. At minimum, they would need to share their payment information or their personal contact information, both of which usually take a bit of time.</p>
<p>For this error, I encourage you to do a couple of things, but at minimum, to do one.</p>
<p>First, I’d like it if you talked to members of your sales/call center teams and get an idea of whether or not any calls actually yield business directly. If not, it might not be worth counting phone calls as conversions in the first place.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/conversion-tracking-mistakes-call-length.png" alt="google ads conversion tracking - call duration" width="720" height="209" class="size-full wp-image-70051 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/conversion-tracking-mistakes-call-length.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/conversion-tracking-mistakes-call-length-480x139.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If they do, then next you should ask for insights on how long it takes to gather either payment or personal information on the phone. Do those calls usually last 30, 60, 90 seconds? Longer? Find a number you’re comfortable with, and then add that as a minimum</p>
<h2>Avoid these conversion tracking mistakes</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the saying “some conversion tracking is better than no conversion tracking” isn&#8217;t always true. While it’s better to have put forth some effort, there are common mistakes that can be misleading and, in some cases, more damaging, than having no tracking at all. Hopefully this list will help you check your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/customize-google-ads-conversion-tracking">conversion tracking</a> for quality assurance to make sure you and any algorithm is optimizing on clean data.</p>

<h2>How do I track conversions in Google Ads?</h2>
<p>In order to track conversions in Google Ads, you need to define your conversion, install the proper tracking tag, and choose an attribution model. Of course, if it were that simple, we wouldn’t need an entire blog post for it. We’re going to get into the step-by-step instructions for this shortly, but before we do, let’s unpack what each of those terms means so you can get a full picture of what this all means for your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/10/google-ads-account-structure">Google Ads account.</a></p>
<p><strong>Conversions </strong>are any meaningful actions your audience members take after seeing your ad. What defines a conversion will look different for every business. For example, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/reasons-to-use-live-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live chat </a>interactions, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/25/google-ads-call-conversions">calls to your business</a>, clicks to specific pages, video views, form fills, and more could all be considered conversion actions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-ads-conversion-tracking-conversion-action-examples.jpg" alt="google ads conversion tracking - an example small business website with plenty of conversion action opportunities on its homepage" width="720" height="329" class="aligncenter wp-image-64055 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-ads-conversion-tracking-conversion-action-examples.jpg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-ads-conversion-tracking-conversion-action-examples-480x219.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A few examples of where conversions can occur on a </em><a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/small-business-websites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>small business website.</em></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conversion tracking</strong> is the practice of keeping count of all the completed conversion actions you assign to your account, and which ads are responsible for them.</li>
<li><strong>Attribution modeling</strong> is a required setting within your conversion tracking setup that impacts how your conversions are counted. If a user interacts with (but doesn’t convert on) more than one of your ads before completing a conversion action, an attribution model decides which ad(s) should get credit for the conversion.For example, first click attribution gives all the credit to the first ad the user interacted with, while linear attribution gives each ad a fraction of the credit. You can learn more in our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/15/multi-touch-attribution">guide to attribution models.</a></li>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/25/conversion-value"><strong>Conversion value</strong></a> is an option within some conversion actions that allows you to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/10/how-to-determine-conversion-value">assign a specific value towards that given action</a>. For example, a business might know that form-fills from a specific landing page lead to a $5000 job versus a $500 one, so that page&#8217;s conversion action will have that value applied to it. This can impact <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/19/google-ads-automated-bidding">bidding strategies</a> within your account, like maximize conversion value.</li>
<li><strong>Google tag</strong> is a code you add to your website that acts as the “middle man” between <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/14/website-examples">your website</a> and your Google Ads account. We’ll fully explain the Google tag installation process and purpose later. For now, keep in mind that this is what enables your website to accurately signal completed actions back to your Google Ads account.</li>
</ul>
<div id="types"></div>
<h2>What types of conversions can you track with Google Ads?</h2>
<p><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1722022?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google defines five main types of conversion actions</a> to choose from when setting up conversion tracking in your account:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Website actions: </strong>These are the most basic or well-known types of Google Ads conversions. A website action could be a purchase, form-fill, button click, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Phone calls: </strong>This conversion type is also very popular as it&#8217;s simply a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/22/call-tracking-industries">call to your business</a> that originates from your Google Ads.</li>
<li><strong>App installs and in-app conversions: </strong>These only apply to businesses that are advertising an app. Their purpose is to count app downloads or other interactions within an app.</li>
<li><strong>Imported or offline conversions: </strong>These are actions that happen offline, but may have originated from an ad. You would import those tracked offline actions, such as an over-the-phone sale or in-person action, via a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/09/crm-for-small-business">customer relationship management (CRM) </a>platform.</li>
<li><strong>Local conversions:</strong> Whenever someone completes an action specific to an advertiser’s physical location during or after interacting with an ad, it’s considered a local conversion action. These are automatically defined for you by Google Ads since they occur only across Google’s products or services, like Google Maps. Some examples of local actions are clicks to call, viewing a menu, or getting directions.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-ads-conversion-actions.png" alt="google ads conversion actions" width="720" height="161" class="aligncenter wp-image-58376 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-ads-conversion-actions.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-ads-conversion-actions-480x107.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Note that Local conversion actions would never be an available option here since they are automatically applied to your account by Google Ads. </em></p>
<h3>Conversion categories</h3>
<p>You’ll also have to choose a conversion category for your conversion actions. The point of this is to make segmenting your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/07/ppc-reporting">PPC reporting </a>easier later by separating out data by category. There are <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9791434" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12+ conversion categories in Google Ads</a>, but Google buckets them into three types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sale categories: </strong>Making a purchase, adding an item to a cart, initiating checkout, or subscribing to a recurring service are all examples of sales categories.</li>
<li><strong>Leads categories:</strong> These include other website actions as well as local actions, such as submitting a lead form, booking an appointment, requesting a quote, calling your business, or getting directions.</li>
<li><strong>Further categories: </strong>There are further categories you have the option to select for unique Google Ads conversion tracking situations, like pageviews.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to set up Google Ads conversion tracking in 3 steps</h2>
<p>Now that you know what to expect during the process, let’s walk through a basic website conversion action set up! In order to set up conversion tracking, you’ll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/31/basic-website">website</a> to place your Google tag code.</li>
<li>The ability to edit your website code. You or your web developer will have to paste a short snippet of code onto your website.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two core steps to start your Google Ads conversion tracking journey: creating a conversion action and installing your Google tag.</p>

<h3>Step #1: Create your conversion action</h3>
<p>The first step for a standard Google Ads conversion tracking setup is creating a conversion action within the Google Ads platform. Here are the quick, easy steps to do so:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign into your Google Ads account.</li>
<li>In the upper right corner, click into the <strong>tools menu</strong>, and select the <strong>Conversions</strong> option located under the <strong>Measurement</strong> bucket.</li>
<li>You’ll be brought to the summary section within your Conversions view, where you’ll want to click<strong> +New conversion action</strong>.</li>
<li>Select website.</li>
<li>Follow the prompts to<strong> enter your domain </strong>and <strong>scan</strong> your website. This is to check if you have the Google tag installed on your site. If you don’t, you’ll receive a snippet of code you’ll be prompted to put on your website.</li>
<li><strong>Choose</strong> how you want to set up your conversion action. You’ll get two options: a <strong>URL setup </strong>or a<strong> manual setup</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Which setup option should you choose?</h4>
<p>While a URL setup is the faster and easier option, it’ll only apply to you if you’re looking to track a page load as a conversion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-ads-conversion-tracking-url-setup.jpg" alt="google ads conversion tracking - example of what a conversion tracking setup using URL" width="720" height="359" class="aligncenter wp-image-64057 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-ads-conversion-tracking-url-setup.jpg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-ads-conversion-tracking-url-setup-480x239.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Meanwhile, a manual setup allows you to track clicks on buttons or links, and has the option to customize the event tag with conversion value tracking, transaction IDs, and other custom parameters.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-ads-conversion-tracking-manual-setup.jpg" alt="google ads conversion tracking - manual conversion setup screenshot example" width="720" height="365" class="aligncenter wp-image-64059 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-ads-conversion-tracking-manual-setup.jpg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-ads-conversion-tracking-manual-setup-480x243.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/12216226?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=12215426#zippy=%2Cinstructions:~:text=a%20conversion%20action.-,Instructions,-Use%20this%20method" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here are the instructions for a URL setup</a>, and <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/12216226?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=12215426#zippy=%2Cinstructions:~:text=a%20conversion%20action.-,Instructions,-Use%20this%20method" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here are the instructions for a manual setup</a>. It’s a fairly simple process you can just follow the prompts for, and it is during this step where you’ll select your attribution model, among other settings. You can use the attribution model guide I linked to earlier to decide which one is right for you.</p>
<h3>Step #2: Set up your Google tag</h3>
<p>Your next step for a Google Ads conversion tracking setup is going to depend on whether or not your Google tag is already set up.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If your Google tag<em> is</em> set up and you created your conversion action<em> using a URL</em></strong> you’re done and good to start seeing data on that conversion.</li>
<li><strong>If your Google tag <em>is not </em>set up and you created your conversion action <em>using a URL</em></strong> you’ll get a screen with Google tag set up instructions.</li>
<li><strong>If your Google tag <em>is</em> set up and you created your conversion action<em> manually</em></strong> you’ll get insutructions to add the action’s unique <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/12215519?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=12215426#gtm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">event snippet.</a></li>
<li><strong>If your Google tag<em> is not</em> set up and you created your conversion action <em>manually</em></strong> you’ll get instructions to add both a Google tag on every page of your site as well your conversion action’s event snippet.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Installing the Google tag</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/12/google-tag-manager">point of a Google tag</a> is to set new cookies to your domain that will store information about what a user does on your site after they click on your ad.</p>
<p>You’ll have to install the Google tag on every page of your site, but you’ll only need one tag per Google Ads account. To install your tag, you can either paste the Google tag on your website code (<a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/12215519?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=12215426#zippy=%2Coption-use-google-tag-manager%2Coption-paste-the-google-tag-on-your-website-code:~:text=Option%201%3A%20Paste%20the%20Google%20tag%20on%20your%20website%20code" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instructions here</a>) or do it via Google Tag Manager (<a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/12215519?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=12215426#zippy=:~:text=Option%202%3A%20Use%20Google%20Tag%20Manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instructions here</a>).</p>

<h3>Step #3: Check your Google Tag</h3>
<p>To ensure that your Google tag is properly installed and firing off conversion tracking correctly, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign into your Google Ads account and navigate back to the Conversions section via the upper right corner menu.</li>
<li>In the conversion actions table view, you can see the under the Status column how any single conversion action is performing. Check out our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/24/google-ads-conversion-tracking">Google Ads conversion tracking hang ups</a> guide to know which statuses to look out for.</li>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An example of various conversion action statuses you may see. </em></p>
<div id="analyze"></div>
<h2>Analyzing your Google Ads conversion data</h2>
<p>Once your Google Ads conversion tracking is correctly established, you’re good to start seeing conversion data within your account! Be sure columns like conversions (known as “conv.” in the column view of the platform), conversion rate (conv. rate), and cost per conversion (cost/conv.) are added to your view. That way, you can leverage those <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/19/ppc-metrics">PPC metrics</a> to know you’re getting the most bang for your buck.</p>

<h2>Google Ads conversion tracking troubleshooting</h2>

If issues arise with your Google Ads conversion tracking, check out these tips and be sure to read our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/24/google-ads-conversion-tracking">post on conversion tracking hangups</a>. Be sure also to visit our post on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/08/google-ads-conversion-tracking-mistakes">conversion tracking mistakes to avoid</a>, since these ones are sneaky and can go undetected.</p>
<h3>Conversion columns aren’t showing any data</h3>
<p>It can take up to 24 hours for conversion data to start appearing in Google Ads. If after 24 hours conversions still aren’t showing up, it’s possible that no customers have converted yet. One way to test this is by going through the motions of a conversion yourself by clicking on your ad when it appears, and doing whatever action is required to trigger the conversion on your site. If after another 24 hours your conversion isn’t registering, double-check that the code was installed correctly. You might have to install additional plug-ins or move the code to a different part of the page.</p>
<h3>Campaign receives many clicks, but few conversions</h3>
<p>Campaigns receiving many clicks and few conversions causes<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/cost-per-action"> higher cost per conversion</a> which lowers your return on investment (ROI). To understand why this may be happening, ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you using a dedicated <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">landing page</a>? Sending users to your homepage can result in low conversion rates.</li>
<li>Is the landing page optimized for conversion? Is there a prominent CTA, a simple form, and is the key information available above the fold?</li>
<li>Is the landing page relevant to the ad? Does it contain the same keywords and copy so that the person is reassured upon clicking on the ad that they’ll get what you’ve promised them?</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are not already aware, WordStream has released its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/18/search-advertising-benchmarks">2022 Google Ads &amp; Microsoft Ads Benchmarks for Every Industry</a> and there are many fascinating takeaways from the report. One that I found particularly interesting was that average conversion rate (CVR) has decreased across the board year over year for nearly every industry besides Arts &amp; Entertainment.</p>

<p>Conversion rate is a vital metric in the success (or failure) of your paid search efforts. What exactly is causing this decline and what can you do to ensure that your search ads continue to improve within every metric? In this post I’ll discuss some possible explanations for the decline in conversion rate and what you can do about it.</p>
<h2>What is conversion rate?</h2>
<p>Conversion rate is the percentage of users who click on your ad who then proceed to “convert”—to take the action that you want them to: submit a form, make a purchase, etc. Conversion rate differs from other what I call “surface-level metrics” because it encompasses the effectiveness of the ad copy, the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-intent">intent of the search query</a>, and the effectiveness of the landing page all in one.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ppc-conversion-rate-formula.png" alt="ppc conversion rate formula" width="720" height="274" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63313" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ppc-conversion-rate-formula.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ppc-conversion-rate-formula-480x183.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Many folks focus on the landing page aspect of CVR, however I always look at it as the <strong>relationship between the intent, the ad, and the destination</strong>. If your ad is good but your landing page is bad, that will affect conversion rate. If your ad is good but the intent of the search query isn’t strong, this will also affect your CVR.</p>
<h2>Why the low CVR?</h2>
<p>The percentage decrease in CVR is rather startling when looking at nearly every industry being affected. Given the disruptions across the board with the pandemic, it's likely that much of this is the result of the rapidly changing commercial environment. However, I don’t personally believe that is entirely responsible for the dip. So what are some other possible causes?</p>
<h3>1. Consumers are doing more research</h3>
<p>This reason was mentioned in the report. It’s possible that as economic pressures increase in addition to an overwhelming volume of options, users are choosing to do more research before making a purchase or signing up for a sales demo. They know they have options, and they want to explore them all—which leads to them clicking through on many ads but not converting. And we can see this with the increase in CTR across the board.</p>

<h3>2. Commercial intent may be lower as a whole</h3>
<p>Another viable explanation for decreased CVR is low commercial/transactional intent. Commercial and transactional intent keywords are those a user types in when they're looking to buy. For example, "best IT companies for small business" or "IT service consult." These are the keywords search advertisers bid on, and it’s possible that commercial intent is overall lower as a whole. Going back to buyer behavior, there could just be an overall trend of users not looking to buy overall given a variety of potential factors.</p>

<h3>3. Broadened match types</h3>
<p>One theory that I have revolves around Google's continued "simplification" of paid advertising—aka its continued trend of automation—and there are a few key examples that spring to mind, the first being match types.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/27/google-ads-match-type-update-2021-explained">Google expanded match types in 2021</a> and although that was a year prior, you may be seeing the residual effects. Broadened match types limit an account manager’s ability to tightly control which search terms are being pulled in through match types. For those using single keyword ad group strategies, this becomes a difficult thing to manage with adding negatives constantly.</p>
<h3>4. Limited search term visibility</h3>
<p>We may also be seeing long-term effects of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/03/google-search-terms-report-changes">changes made to the search terms report</a> which reduces the number of terms that appear to advertisers. This increases the difficulty of adding negatives as not all terms that triggered your ads will appear within the report.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-ads-search-terms-report-example.png" alt="google ads search terms report example" width="720" height="293" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63310" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-ads-search-terms-report-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-ads-search-terms-report-example-480x195.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>5. Performance Max</h3>
<p>Another key example of increased automation is the roll-out of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/20/performance-max-pros-cons">Performance Max campaign type</a>. This feature allows marketers to advertise across all Google properties in one campaign. The idea sounds more like consolidation than automation but as you continue to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/05/performance-max-tips">create your PMax campaign</a>, you realize that there is a lot more of Google “filling in the blanks” for you than having a tightly controlled campaign.</p>
<p>The “just trust us” mantra from Google has never sat right with me considering they are a company that thrives off of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/21/how-to-save-money-google-ads">advertisers’ wasted spend</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-ads-automation.png" alt="articles in SERP about google ads automation" width="720" height="716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63311" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-ads-automation.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-ads-automation-480x477.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>I am not providing an argument that Google is serving their customer’s ads to bots and dead users or junk digital real estate, but I believe that reducing the control that the advertiser used to have to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/25/google-shopping-ads-priority-bidding-structure">finely tune the alignment of intent and product</a> could possibly attribute to the general decrease in CVR.</p>
<h2>What you can do to improve your Google Ads conversion rate</h2>
<p>While there are factors beyond our control at play here, there are still a few approaches you can take to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/11/increase-conversion-rates">increase your PPC conversion rate</a>.</p>
<h3>1. Optimize the customer journey, not just landing pages</h3>
<p>Although the digital landscape is rapidly changing, many of the same core <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/conversion-rate-optimization">conversion rate optimization</a> principles apply. You’ll always want to align intent with a relevant ad and subsequent landing page. But as I mentioned above, there is more to CVR than just landing page optimization. You’ll want to ensure that the user’s <strong>entire journey</strong> from search to ad to landing page is fully optimized. This requires mapping out your customer journey, constantly gathering <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/17/customer-insights">customer insights</a>, and using your data to identify key touch points, pain points, drop off points, and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/identify-target-audience-questions.png" alt="questions to identify your target audience" width="720" height="611" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61989" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/identify-target-audience-questions.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/identify-target-audience-questions-480x407.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>2. Consider more top-of-funnel offers</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">Landing pages</a> are effective when optimizing for the intent of the user who searched and clicked on the ad to get them to take action quickly. Someone with either many options (several players in an industry) or increased cautiousness with purchasing decisions will need more time. This mindset is rather antithetical to many landing page best practices. It may not be that the ad or landing page did not convince the user to convert, but possibly that it made them explore your website for more information, look at competitors, and make a more elongated decision.</p>
<p>Given the above, you may want to consider adding more<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/15/lead-magnet-ideas"> top or mid-funnel offers</a> to your PPC strategy, such as ebooks. Or you can support the increased focus on buyer research by offering comparison tools.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-ad-example-compare-rates.png" alt="comparison tool example in a google ad" width="720" height="331" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63314" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-ad-example-compare-rates.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-ad-example-compare-rates-480x221.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>3. Prioritize keywords by intent</h3>
<p>You’ll want to take into consideration the level of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/30/commercial-intent-keywords">intent behind the keywords</a> you are targeting. This has a domino effect because it will either raise or lower the probability of the user clicking and converting on your ad.</p>
<p>Prioritizing keywords by intent is a good practice as you can focus solely on those specific terms and queries in order to guide the rest of your approach. If you have a search term that has very high intent, it may also be highly competitive. Your energy spent on optimizing the ads and landing pages for these keywords should help improve your conversion rate.</p>
<p>My advice would be to monitor the search terms report to the best of your ability to add negative keywords and reduce the amount of potentially irrelevant queries from triggering your ads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/search-terms-report-example-matcht-type.png" alt="search terms report example" width="720" height="329" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63315" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/search-terms-report-example-matcht-type.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/search-terms-report-example-matcht-type-480x219.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>4. Have multiple ad copy variations</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/22/google-ad-copy-mistakes">Ad copy</a> is one of the biggest needle movers when it comes to paid advertising as a whole. Slight changes in headlines and descriptions can go a long way with regard to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2010/11/22/what-is-a-good-click-through-rate-for">click-through rate</a> and overall ad performance. Having multiple compelling ad copy variations will allow you to find which language works best for each ad group. You should then be able to eliminate any variations that are underperforming from a CVR perspective.</p>
<p>Google’s Responsive search ads give you a wide variety of flexibility in terms of headline and description variations that the machine learning optimizes for over time.</p>
<p>For help with your ad copy, check out our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/05/responsive-search-ad-copy">responsive search ad copy template</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/how-to-use-google-ads-responsive-search-ad-rsa-template.png" alt="how to use google ads - responsive search ad template" width="720" height="283" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62321" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/how-to-use-google-ads-responsive-search-ad-rsa-template.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/how-to-use-google-ads-responsive-search-ad-rsa-template-480x189.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>5. Optimize your landing pages</h3>
<p>The main focal point for most conversion rate optimization posts is typically the landing page. Although I stress the importance of the other variables in the equation, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/adwords-landing-page">PPC landing page optimization</a> is still a critical component of advertising on any platform. You want to ensure that the copy and intent of the page aligns with both your ad copy and the intent of the keyword that you are targeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/anatomy-of-a-good-landing-page.png" alt="" width="743" height="678" class="aligncenter wp-image-43401" /></p>
<p>That is the easy part. Next, you’ll want to ensure that the page is cleanly designed, easy to digest, and contains as little or as much information as the intent of the inquiry requires. If the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/13/call-to-action-examples">call to action</a> for your landing page is a rather big decision or there is inherently a great deal of friction with the type of offer you are running, more information is preferable to give the user the assurance that they need. If the offer is cut and dry, less information and a faster route to action is preferable.</p>
<h3>6. Choose the right bidding strategies</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/19/google-ads-automated-bidding">Fully utilizing automated bid strategies</a> like Max Conversions, Target CPA, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/02/target-roas">TROAS</a> can make a massive difference in the performance of your ads and landing pages as Google uses its machine learning to align with the goal of the bid strategy. This is important because will selectively serve your ads to users it believes have a higher propensity to convert and within the costs that you specify.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-ads-bidding-strategies-chart.png" alt="what is target roas - google ads bidding strategies chart" width="700" height="430" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58094" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-ads-bidding-strategies-chart.png 700w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-ads-bidding-strategies-chart-480x295.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>Take these steps to improve your conversion rate</h2>
<p>There are a lot of variables that contribute to industry-wide averages on nearly any metric. With economic uncertainty, changing consumer behavior, and Google’s rapidly changing ad platform, it is hard to identify a smoking gun. But on an individual basis I believe it is entirely possible to improve CVR across your campaigns amidst all of these variables. Paid search is a complex ecosystem of intent and competition. CVR will improve for those who choose to focus on improving what they have and to do so in a methodical and strategic manner. To recap, here's what you can do to improve your conversion rates:</p>
<ol>
<li>Optimize the customer journey, not just your landing pages.</li>
<li>Consider incorporating more top-of-funnel, lower-friction offers into your strategy.</li>
<li>Prioritize keywords by intent.</li>
<li>Have multiple ad copy variations.</li>
<li>Optimize your landing pages.</li>
<li>Choose the right bidding strategies.</li>
</ol>
