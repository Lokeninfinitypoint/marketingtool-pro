										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are a small business targeting local customers, local SEO can still generate a great and sustainable ROI (and has become simpler and more predictable than other forms of SEO).</p>
<p>That said, an aspect of local SEO that is often misunderstood is local citations. This is because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many people don’t know whether citations impact map listings, organic listings, or both.</li>
<li>Most people aren’t sure how many citations they need to build, or how frequently they need to build them.</li>
<li>Citations are often confused with updating information across data providers and “NAP” consistency.</li>
<li>Citations are sometimes confused with links and link building.</li>
</ul>
<p>And perhaps most importantly: Many small business owners aren’t sure whether they should contract out work on citation building or do it themselves (and if they should do it themselves, how to do it).</p>
<p>In this article, I’ll answer all of these questions and walk through how to build citations yourself.</p>
<p>If you’re not interested in the nitty gritty and just want an answer to “how should I handle citations for my small business” you can <a href="#local-citations-recap">skip ahead to the last section</a> where I’ll answer that for you based on budget and how competitive your industry and area are.</p>

<div id="what-are-local-citations"></div>
<h2>What are local citations?</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/local-online-marketing#:~:text=Get-,citations,-in%20directories">local citation</a> is an online mention of a business. In the context of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-seo-in-2024">local SEO</a>, this typically refers to a structured listing on an external website that includes the business name, address, and phone number (NAP).</p>
<p>These are usually <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/home-services-business-listings-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business listings</a> at any of a variety of sites, most frequently directory-style websites. They come in different flavors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>General local business information across all types of businesses (e.g., Yellow Pages, Yelp)</li>
<li>Industry-specific (e.g., a directory of home remodeling companies across the US)</li>
<li>Location-specific (e.g., a directory of small businesses in Mississippi)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, let’s say we own a home remodeling business in Oxford, Mississippi. We can get our business listed on general sites like the Yellow Pages:</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/home-remodeling-citation-on-yellowpages.webp" alt="home remodeling citation on yellow pages" width="911" height="439" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87432" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/home-remodeling-citation-on-yellowpages.webp 911w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/home-remodeling-citation-on-yellowpages-480x231.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 911px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Chamber of commerce, government or travel directories, or other town/city, county, or state directories:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/chamber-of-commerce-local-citation-example.webp" alt="chamber of commerce local citation result example" width="846" height="394" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87433" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/chamber-of-commerce-local-citation-example.webp 846w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/chamber-of-commerce-local-citation-example-480x224.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 846px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Or we could find directories focused on construction or resources for homeowners:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/construction-niche-local-citation-example.webp" alt="niche local citation example" width="851" height="427" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87434" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/construction-niche-local-citation-example.webp 851w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/construction-niche-local-citation-example-480x241.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 851px, 100vw" /></p>

<div id="citation-building-vs-link-building"></div>
<h2>Are local citations links? Is citation building the same as link building?</h2>
<p>Many local citations that you build will include links to your website, but some will not.</p>
<p>The focus in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/12/local-citations">building citations</a> is not solely to get links, it’s to have your business listed in key directories where legitimate small businesses frequently appear, and in local and industry directories to help signal to Google that your business is noteworthy and trustworthy when it comes to your business focus and location.</p>
<p>That said, building citations will typically lead to an increase in the number of links to your website, as many sites will allow you to include a link.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Looking for more ways to drive people to your site?</strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website</a></p>
<div id="citations-vs-nap-consistency"></div>
<h2>Is building citations the same as NAP consistency?</h2>
<p>NAP consistency refers to the consistency with which your business listings across the web and with major data providers is the same.</p>
<p>If your business has changed names, addresses, phone numbers, websites, etc. you may have inconsistent data in different listings on the web. This can hurt <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-marketing-2024">local rankings</a> as it’s a signal to Google that your business may not be reliable and trustworthy.</p>
<p>Building citations generally refers to the practice of <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/best-free-business-listing-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creating new local citations</a> for your business which is not the same as updating your existing citations for consistency, but many vendors will simultaneously work on “cleaning up” any NAP inconsistencies (claiming your business profiles places where you may not have known they exist, updating them in instances where you, a vendor, or someone within your company may have created them before a change in business name, phone number, or physical address, etc.), and building out new citations.</p>
<div id="benefits-of-local-citations"></div>
<h2>How valuable are citations?</h2>
<p>I recently came across two different tweets from folks who share a lot of good local SEO information on X (formerly Twitter) with different perspectives on citations.</p>
<p>This case study:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/XC0qFMfrIU">https://t.co/XC0qFMfrIU</a></p>
<p>— Joy Hawkins (@JoyanneHawkins) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoyanneHawkins/status/1836039665578545205?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>And then this tweet and reply:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">constant citation building is so underrated for maps rankings imo</p>
<p>— Cole | Dental + Local SEO (@AllGasSeo) <a href="https://twitter.com/AllGasSeo/status/1849217209945780520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In the first example, the case study did find that citations boosted <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/03/organic-traffic">organic rankings</a> for a landing page, even though Maps rankings weren’t impacted. The responding tweet notes something that I’ve observed myself: Citations do have a direct impact on rankings in some cases.</p>
<p>So like with many SEO questions, the answer here is likely “it depends.”</p>
<p>A few things are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many practitioners have seen <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-maps-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maps rankings</a> improve when building local citations, so they do likely have a positive impact here.</li>
<li>The listings showing up for branded searches and listings that are indexed, as Joy points out in the case study cited above, are likely to have the largest impact.</li>
<li>If you are in a low-competition vertical with limited resources, you’re likely best served sticking to those citations.</li>
<li>If you are in a more competitive market, you’re likely best served to at least test building regular citations over time to determine their impact on both your maps and organic rankings.</li>
</ul>
<div id="how-many-local-citations-to-build"></div>
<h2>How many local citations does my business need?</h2>
<p>In terms of “how many” local citations your business needs, here are some guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every business should have citations on the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/best-free-business-listing-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10-20 most important sites</a>.</li>
<li>A standard starting point is to build ~50 citations, particularly in a competitive market.</li>
<li>If you’re in a very competitive market and want to test regular citation building, 10-25 is a standard range.</li>
</ul>
<div id="”how-to-build-local-citations&quot;"></div>
<h2>How can I build local SEO citations myself?</h2>
<p>Building local citations is a time-consuming process, but a relatively simple one.</p>
<p>First, you want to start by making sure you have the right information to bring to the citation-building process, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your company name</strong>: This seems simple enough, but you want this to be consistent with your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/09/edit-update-google-business-listing">Google Business Profile</a>, and with your official company name or DBA name. If my company name is “Tom’s Construction” but I want to rank well for bathroom remodeling jobs in search results, just calling myself “Tom’s Construction &amp; Bathroom Remodeling” can get me into trouble with Name, Address, Phone (NAP) consistency.</li>
<li><strong>Address:</strong> This is the physical address where a customer could theoretically show up to conduct business (not a virtual address or PO Box).</li>
<li><strong>Phone number</strong>: Whether you have a standard business number, or a standard <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/call-tracking">call tracking number</a> from a call tracking company, use that number everywhere. When you switch to a call tracking solution you need to update your citations, and if you’re using one currently you want to use that as you build new citations (for both consistency and tracking).</li>
<li><strong>Description: </strong>Have a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-write-a-business-description/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brief and compelling company description</a> ready to submit to third parties.</li>
<li><strong>URL:</strong> Use your website’s home page as you submit local citations.</li>
<li><strong>Categories:</strong> Have your categories ready (if you’ve optimized your GBP, you likely know these).</li>
<li><strong>Email:</strong> You usually want to set up an email dedicated to citations that someone will occasionally monitor, as you can sometimes get spam and cold outreach at these addresses.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/local-citations-google-business-profile.jpg" alt="an example of a google business profile for a coffee shop" width="378" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71136" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/local-citations-google-business-profile.jpg 378w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/local-citations-google-business-profile-189x300.jpg 189w" sizes="(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px" /></p>
<p>It’s a good idea to keep a spreadsheet handy and add fields that you run across as you’re building citations to your sheet, as they’ll often come up again. For instance, if a site asks you for an alternate phone number, plug what you submit there into your spreadsheet (or, in some cases, if the field is optional, you may want to just leave those blank).</p>
<p>You also want to be able to access the email you’re going to use and to be able to access the phone number you’re giving for verification across these citations.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4cd.png" alt="📍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Are your listings up to date?</strong> Find out with a free, instant audit using the <a href="https://localiq.com/free-business-listings-grader/?cid=Web_WS_InContentTextLink_Freemium_Listings&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium">LocaliQ Business Listings Grader</a>.</p>
<div id="how-to-find-local-citation-opportunities"></div>
<h2>How to find citation opportunities</h2>
<p>Looking for ways to build citations? Follow these steps.</p>
<h3>Get on the top citation sites</h3>
<p>The simplest way to start here is to make sure you have the “major players” and most common citation sources covered first. Start with these:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://business.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Business Profile</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mapsconnect.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Maps</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a></li>
<li><a href="https://foursquare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foursquare</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bingplaces.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bing Places</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yelp</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.yellowpages.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yellow Pages</a></li>
</ol>
<p>From there, you can also get to 50+ local citations easily by leveraging lists like this<a href="https://whitespark.ca/top-local-citation-sources-by-country/united-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> top 50 citations by WhiteSpark</a>, this one by <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/resources/top-citation-sites/general/top-50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrightLocal</a>, etc. (I’ll get more into how to evaluate different citations in a minute).</p>
<h3>Submit your business information to data aggregators</h3>
<p>While it’s not a direct citation, by having your data submitted to the major data aggregators you can then have those sites submit your data to multiple additional directories in turn. Here are the largest data aggregators:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://local-listings.data-axle.com/search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Axle</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.neustarlocaleze.biz/directory/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neustar Localeze</a></li>
<li><a href="http://business.foursquare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foursquare</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.localvisibilitysystem.com/2013/09/24/how-to-add-your-business-to-factual/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Factual</a></li>
</ol>
<p>If you submitted to these 11 places, you’d be off to a good start, and in some niches in some areas, you may even be <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/how-to-spy-on-competitors">ahead of some of your competitors</a>. In even a moderately competitive industry/geography combination, though, all of your competitors will have these citations. How can you get more, impactful citations?</p>
<h3>Look at competitor citations</h3>
<p>The quality and impact a citation has will vary depending on your industry and geography. There are some ways to gauge likely impact here.</p>
<p>Start by looking at competitors. Think more about your SERP (search engine result page) competitors than your “real life” competitors. The company you think of as your closest competitor may not be the company you’re competing with for real estate in search engine results. When I search for Oxford, MS, home remodeling, I can see the first competitors I want to investigate in the Map pack:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/competitor-citations-in-google-map-pack.webp" alt="competitor business results in google map pack" width="857" height="440" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87435" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/competitor-citations-in-google-map-pack.webp 857w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/competitor-citations-in-google-map-pack-480x246.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 857px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>I type in the full name of the company with the geo-modifier to make sure I get the right results and look at the listings showing the highest for the company name:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/branded-search-for-local-citations.webp" alt="competitor branded search results for local citations" width="869" height="479" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87437" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/branded-search-for-local-citations.webp 869w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/branded-search-for-local-citations-480x265.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 869px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here is a second company:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/competitor-branded-search-citation-results.webp" alt="competitor branded search citation results" width="732" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87436" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/competitor-branded-search-citation-results.webp 732w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/competitor-branded-search-citation-results-480x392.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 732px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As you go through multiple competitors, you’ll quickly get insights like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook popping up first for many queries.</li>
<li>Houzz as a good possible source here.</li>
<li>BBB and Chamber of Commerce listings as options.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use this as an exercise both to help prioritize citations if you have limited time and resources and to find new citation opportunities.</p>
<p>Once you have a sense of which competitor seems to be getting a lot of these types of citations (which you can usually tell just by looking at the search results above) you can then unearth more citation opportunities by going to Google.com and typing in “competitorwebsite.com:”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/competitor-citation-results.webp" alt="competitor citation results in google serp" width="661" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87438" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/competitor-citation-results.webp 661w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/competitor-citation-results-480x434.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 661px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As you scroll through these results, you can really start to find some gems that may not show up just by searching for the competitor name:</p>
<p>This is a useful tactic as well because it allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>See which citations Google views as most relevant to your competitor’s site.</li>
<li>Filter out other companies with a similar name in different areas.</li>
<li>Find a list of citations that your competitor has <strong>that are all indexed by Google.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Use SEO tools</h3>
<p>You can also use paid tools like Ahrefs or Semrush to look at the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/10/link-building-secrets">backlinks</a> a competitor has to see which sites are linking to them, and paid local <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-seo-tools">SEO tools</a> like BrightLocal and WhiteSpark offer tools to find citations generally, and to look at competitor citations as well.</p>
<div id="how-to-monitor-local-citations"></div>
<h2>How to make sure your citations are indexed</h2>
<p>If Google doesn’t acknowledge your citations, there’s not really any value in having them. Checking to see if your specific citation is indexed is a good way to determine if the citation has been “counted” by Google.</p>
<p>To manually do this for one citation is pretty simple. Just go to Google and type in site:directory.com/toms-construction-listing. If you see your listing, that means it’s indexed:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/manual-citation-check-google.webp" alt="how to manually check citation indexed on google" width="878" height="532" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87440" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/manual-citation-check-google.webp 878w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/manual-citation-check-google-480x291.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 878px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If not, then your listing (or a competitor’s listing) likely isn’t indexed:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/citation-not-indexed-example.webp" alt="example of citation not indexed on google" width="720" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87439" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/citation-not-indexed-example.webp 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/citation-not-indexed-example-480x399.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you want to check your citations in bulk it’s a little trickier, but you can use some paid tools and services like URL Profiler or IndexCheckr.com.</p>
<p>If you find your URLs aren’t getting indexed, there are a few methods you can use to get them indexed:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can share a link to the profile on social media.</li>
<li>You can use services like IndexMeNow or similar.</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of things to be aware of with indexing services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Often these services use things like social media profiles or low-quality link sources to force indexation of pages. For third-party profiles, that’s not usually an issue, but it’s not a great idea to fire this type of activity at your main website.</li>
<li>They will occasionally fail to get your page indexed (usually they’ll refund in these instances), and it’s not uncommon that they get a page indexed, and then it later falls out of the index (which is why it’s a good idea to replicate citations that are already indexed, as it’s a signal that Google is likely to index and leave indexed your own citations)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re in a particularly competitive industry and geography and you want to go beyond the core citations and your direct competitors’ best citations, there are a few ways to expand your citation reach:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look at the towns you service outside of your physical location and research those competitors for citations unique to those towns.</li>
<li>You can also use the loc: site search operator in Google to find different types of directory or industry opportunities you may not have uncovered:</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/directory-search-on-google.webp" alt="how to do a directory search on google" width="743" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87441" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/directory-search-on-google.webp 743w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/directory-search-on-google-480x386.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 743px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As with many tasks in your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/local-advertising-ideas/">local business</a>, however, you need to ask yourself the question: Should I be building these local citations myself in the first place?</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f914.png" alt="🤔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>What are the biggest challenges small businesses are facing?</strong> Find out that and more in our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/smb-marketing-trends-report?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2025SmallBusinessMarketingTrendsReport_Download">Small Business Marketing Trends Report</a>.</p>
<div id="local-citations-recap"></div>
<h2>Bottom line this for me: What should I do in regards to local citations?</h2>
<p>Here are your basic choices for building citations if you’re a small business owner:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can hire a contractor specifically for citation building.</li>
<li>You can ask your SEO company to execute this task (likely if you have an SEO vendor, they’re doing this for you already in some capacity).</li>
<li>You can do the work yourself on the cheap or with the use of a paid tool or multiple paid tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>Things to consider here will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Industry and location competition</strong>: If your competitors in Google Maps all have a couple of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-online-reviews-impact-your-business">reviews</a>, many don’t seem to be building citations, and generally you know your industry/area isn’t competitive when it comes to SEO you may not need to be consistently building citations. Just the key citations and some you find key competitors have may be enough.</li>
<li><strong>Resources:</strong> If you or an employee have both time and the ability to execute relatively simple data entry tasks <strong>and</strong> you’re cash-constrained, this may be a good task to hand off to someone in the company. If you don’t want to worry about handing this process off or completing it yourself and you can spare a few hundred dollars to have citations built and updated, and then potentially a monthly fee to build more citations over time in a competitive market, it may be worth it to outsource this task.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the fact that citation building can have a significant impact on local SEO results, tends to be time-intensive to execute on your own, and is a relatively low-cost service compared to other marketing activities, it’s often the right choice to outsource. If you do hire an agency or contractor for this task, make sure:</p>
<ul>
<li>You understand the types and volume of citations you’re getting (ask about their process, and whether monitoring indexation and attempting to get citations indexed is included).</li>
<li>They use an email you have access to and give you login information for any profiles they create on your behalf in a shared spreadsheet.</li>
<li>They share the actual citations they’ve built with you in a shared document (which you can then check for indexation yourself!).</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Running a successful business inevitably brings negative online reviews. No matter how amazing your products or services, how well-trained your employees, or how excellent your customer service, there will always be situations when someone is dissatisfied with their interaction with your business or finds that your product or service doesn&#8217;t meet their needs and expectations.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean you have zero control over the situation! So how can you manage your online reviews to limit the negative impact on your business? In this article, we’ll discuss and analyze how online reviews can affect your click-through rates (CTR) and other key metrics, plus how they influence prospects and customers in sometimes surprising ways.</p>

<h2>9 reasons why reviews impact revenue, sales, and business reputation</h2>
<p>Online reviews can impact your business&#8217;s online reputation, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-referral-traffic">traffic</a>, and sales. Here are a few ways that happens.</p>
<div id="reviews-appear-in-search-results"></div>
<h3>1. Reviews and star ratings appear in search results and maps&#8230;</h3>
<p>When people search for businesses, products, or services on search engines or map pages, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-citations">review sites</a> not only appear in search results but also as featured snippets where review counts and star ratings are visible and highlighted even before users click on the result.</p>
<p>Google displays reviews and star ratings in both search results and local pack results for businesses listed on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/10/create-google-my-business-account">Google Business Profile</a> (formerly Google My Business) or Google Maps.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-business-listings-for-roofer.webp" alt="google business listings for roofers" width="858" height="414" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84526" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-business-listings-for-roofer.webp 858w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-business-listings-for-roofer-480x232.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 858px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Additionally, Google includes a &#8220;Reviews from the web&#8221; section in various business results and key phrases, aggregating reviews from relevant networks. In regular search results, when displaying a business profile from a review network, star ratings, and review counts are also presented.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/reviews-from-the-web-on-google.webp" alt="reviews from the web on google" width="742" height="593" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86598" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/reviews-from-the-web-on-google.webp 742w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/reviews-from-the-web-on-google-480x384.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 742px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>On Bing local and maps results, review information and star ratings may be sourced directly from partner networks such as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-reviews">Facebook</a>, OpenTable, TripAdvisor, or others depending on the search query.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/what-is-duckduckgo">DuckDuckGo</a>, a private search engine, exclusively partners with Yelp to display business results, including reviews, for users.</p>

<div id="reviews-appear-across-the-web"></div>
<h3>2. &#8230;And almost everywhere else on the web</h3>
<p>Multiple websites collect online reviews, each serving different purposes and attracting distinct types of audiences and review readers. For instance, individuals planning a vacation often visit travel-specific sites to see experiences and photos shared by previous travelers. On the other hand, job seekers read reviews on job sites posted by current and former employees.</p>
<p>Here are some of the different types of review websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business directories,</strong> such as Google Business Profile (Google Maps), Trustpilot, and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-claim-a-business-on-yelp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yelp</a>, list businesses and allow customers to rate them and leave reviews. Find out the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/01/business-directory-listings">top business listing sites</a> here.</li>
<li><strong>Retail websites </strong>like Amazon, eBay, Walmart, and other ecommerce sites allow customers to review products they purchased and share their interactions with businesses.</li>
<li><strong>Travel review and booking networks</strong> like TripAdvisor, Expedia, Booking.com, Airbnb, and others enable travelers to review hotels, hosts, restaurants, and other travel-related services.</li>
<li><strong>Job networks and review sites,</strong> such as Glassdoor or Indeed, enable current and former employees, as well as job applicants, to review their employers, salaries, and benefits, share insights into the interview process, and office culture, and discuss their overall experiences.</li>
<li><strong>Social media networks</strong> like Facebook allow users to leave feedback, comments, and reviews on business pages.</li>
<li><strong>Online complaint sites</strong> like RipOff Report or Better Business Bureau (BBB) provide platforms for customers to express dissatisfaction with products or services they have purchased.</li>
<li><strong>Niche review websites</strong> like Capterra or G2 cater specifically to software buyers, and platforms such as <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/angi-business-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angi</a> and DealerRater focus on local services and the car buying experience, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/angi-reviews.webp" alt="example of reviews on angi" width="850" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86599" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/angi-reviews.webp 850w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/angi-reviews-480x338.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 850px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="positive-reviews-drive-clicks"></div>
<h3>3. Positive reviews are engaging and drive clicks</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/research/review-search-click-through-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research from BrightLocal</a> shows that businesses with positive 3 to 5-star reviews receive 25% more clicks from local pack results. Additionally, 82% of consumers read online reviews before making a purchase, spending an average of 14 minutes on review sites before making a decision. Positive reviews can also <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/03/organic-traffic">improve traffic to your site</a> and boost revenue.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Looking for more ways to drive people to your site?</strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website</a></p>
<div id="negative-reviews-can-decrease-traffic"></div>
<h3>4. Negative reviews can lead to a decline in traffic</h3>
<p>At the same time, negative reviews can be highly damaging. For example, a well-publicized<a href="https://www.landers.com.au/legal-insights-news/defamatory-google-reviews-plastic-surgeon-awarded-damages-for-untrue-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> lawsuit in Australia revealed</a> that a plastic surgeon experienced a 23% drop in online traffic after a fake, damaging review was posted on Google Maps.</p>
<div id="unhappy-customers-more-likely-to-review"></div>
<h3>5. Unhappy customers are more likely to leave reviews</h3>
<p>According to findings from Inc.com, when customers are unhappy, there&#8217;s a 91% chance they won&#8217;t do any business with that company again. Moreover, they are 10 to 15 times more likely to share their negative experience with others, often by posting bad reviews on online platforms about the product or service quality.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-review-example.webp" alt="example of review from competitor" width="878" height="497" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83701" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-review-example.webp 878w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-review-example-480x272.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 878px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>At the same time, only 1 out of 10 happy customers typically <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">leave a positive review</a>, indicating that many people may not remember positive experiences that long because when they are buying, they expect good service from businesses. Negative experiences tend to be more impactful and remembered longer.</p>
<div id="positive-reviews-help-zero-click-searches"></div>
<h3>6. Positive reviews can help with zero-click searches</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/zero-click-searches">Zero-click search</a> is when users search for something on a search engine like Google but do not click any links in the results. <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-search-zero-click-study-2024-443869" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nearly 60%</a> of searches result in no clicks. There are several reasons behind this phenomenon, such as people using search engines for spell checking or relying on widgets and highlighted information to quickly find answers to basic questions like &#8220;How old is Brad Pitt?&#8221; or &#8220;What day of the week is Christmas this year?&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/example-of-zero-click-search-result.webp" alt="example of zero-click search result" width="886" height="587" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86600" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/example-of-zero-click-search-result.webp 886w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/example-of-zero-click-search-result-480x318.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 886px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Similarly, in business-related, local, product, and service searches, many users conduct research on companies and look for things like phone numbers, addresses, or feedback.</p>
<p>It results in zero-click when they look up business information including star ratings and reviews directly in the search snippets. That’s why the appearance of positive reviews can be as important as the company’s website itself in the decision-making process.</p>
<div id="better-reviews-correlate-better-results"></div>
<h3>7. Better online reviews have a direct correlation with higher CTRs, traffic, and sales</h3>
<p>Positive online reviews and good star ratings can drive increased traffic and sales to a website in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Firstly, higher star ratings in search engine snippets enhance the chances of users clicking through to gather more information and conduct further research on the product or service, possibly leading to a purchase. At the same time, negative star ratings can deter users from clicking on a company website, and as proof, research by BrightLocal shows that a <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/research/review-search-click-through-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25%</a> improvement in <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-a-good-click-through-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click-through rates</a> can be achieved with favorable reviews on Google results. As mentioned earlier, bad reviews can significantly impact <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-a-good-click-through-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click-through rate</a>, just like with the plastic surgeon who saw a 23% drop in online traffic after a single bad review that appeared on top of Google results.</li>
<li>Secondly, reviews <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/limited-time-offers/">influence traffic</a> and sales by influencing Google&#8217;s prioritization of businesses with better local presence and positive reviews in Google Maps. Based on<a href="https://firstpagesage.com/reports/google-click-through-rates-ctrs-by-ranking-position/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> findings by FirstPageSage</a>, achieving the top position in Google&#8217;s Local Pack results can lead to a 17% CTR.</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-customer-reviews.jpg" alt="increase conversion rates - example of customer reviews on product landing page to help drive conversion rates up" width="700" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75898" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-customer-reviews.jpg 700w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-customer-reviews-480x410.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You&#8217;re probably going to click on results for a business with reviews like this over one with a lower star rating or no reviews.</em></p>
<div id="fake-reviews-impact-traffic-reputation"></div>
<h3>8. Fake reviews can impact online traffic and reputation</h3>
<p>Another unfortunate thing that can impact online reputation and sales is fake reviews. Fake negative reviews present a big challenge for businesses and are enabled by the anonymity of online platforms. It is estimated that <a href="https://retaintrust.com/fake-reviews-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 23%</a> of online reviews are fake, and &#8220;bad actors&#8221; like competitors, scammers, or disgruntled employees can post false or defamatory information about a business.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/brand-loyalty-wordstream-Review.webp" alt="Brand loyalty - Review on Google." width="833" height="359" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86146" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/brand-loyalty-wordstream-Review.webp 833w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/brand-loyalty-wordstream-Review-480x207.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 833px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This not only leads to decreased star ratings but can also cause a significant drop in traffic, directly impacting sales. Addressing this issue can be expensive, requiring businesses to allocate resources towards damage control, increase marketing efforts to recover lost revenue, and in some cases seek legal advice.</p>
<div id="leverage-positive-reviews-in-ppc"></div>
<h3>9. Positive reviews can enhance PPC and social campaigns</h3>
<p>One effective strategy for promoting positive reviews and ratings to improve CTR for your ads is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/18/google-shopping-reviews">integrate them into your PPC campaigns</a>. For example, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/21/how-to-run-google-ads">Google Ads</a> allows you to add positive reviews as ad copy extensions. Google collaborates with<a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2375474?hl=en#Supported_review_partners" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> supported review partners</a> to integrate and highlight these reviews under advertisers&#8217; search or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/20/google-shopping-ab-testing">shopping ads</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/reviews-in-ppc-campaigns.webp" alt="reviews in ppc campaigns example" width="880" height="543" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86601" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/reviews-in-ppc-campaigns.webp 880w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/reviews-in-ppc-campaigns-480x296.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 880px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Star ratings from the stores are integrated and appear in the shopping ads.</em></p>
<p>Additionally, you can share positive reviews on social media platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, X, and others. Promoting these reviews through sponsored campaigns targeted at your desired audience can further enhance your brand&#8217;s reputation and reach.</p>

<h2>Positive online reviews are a must</h2>
<p>Given the direct correlation between positive online reviews, click-through rates, and their impact on sales, businesses should prioritize monitoring and managing their <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/online-presence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online presence</a>. This includes actively monitoring reviews and ratings,<a href="https://retaintrust.com/how-to-remove-negative-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> flagging and reporting fake or rule-violating reviews</a>, and replying promptly to reviews to show customer service and commitment to future customers.</p>
<p>While some businesses are proactive in managing their online reputation, others may lack the knowledge and resources, especially when dealing with multiple review sites each with its own methods for<a href="https://localiq.com/products/listings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> managing business profiles</a>, flagging, reporting, replying, and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-delete-a-google-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removing reviews</a>.</p>

<h2>14 local marketing trends and tactics for 2024</h2>
<p>“Local marketing in 2024 no longer means placing an ad in a local paper—although that can have its place,” said Magee Clegg, CEO of <a href="https://cleartailmarketing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cleartail Marketing</a>.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s more about focusing on strategies that emphasize long-term customer relationships, utilizing professional platforms and proactively managing your online reputation.”</p>
<p>Here are some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/advertising-techniques">tactics</a>, trends, and ideas to help you build the most successful local marketing strategy for 2024.</p>
<div id="local-seo-optimization"></div>
<h3>1. Optimize your online presence for local SEO</h3>
<p>This isn’t necessarily a trend as Google Business Profiles have been around for 10 years (this year!), but it’s extremely important for any <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/15/local-marketing-ideas">local marketing</a> strategy. You still need to master the basics. This means <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/03/google-my-business-optimization">optimizing your Google Business Profile</a>, Apple Maps, and other local directories for local—and hyper-local—SEO.</p>
<p>“Ensuring your business appears in local search results, particularly your Google Business listing, can significantly increase visibility,” said Deepak Shukla, founder of SEO agency <a href="https://pearllemon.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pearl Lemon</a>. “In the post-pandemic era, where <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/online-presence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online presence</a> has become even more critical, this strategy is essential for attracting local customers.”</p>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/local-search-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Optimization tactics for local search include</a> the addition of hours, offerings, and reviews, which help <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/11/increase-conversion-rates">convert searchers</a> into customers, said Dan Dillon CEO of <a href="https://www.cleanitsupply.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CleanItSupply.com</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/google-business-profile-example-dentist-boston.jpg" alt="example of an optimized google business profile from a dentist in boston" width="920" height="492" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71139" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/google-business-profile-example-dentist-boston.jpg 920w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/google-business-profile-example-dentist-boston-480x257.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 920px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This also helps businesses establish themselves as authoritative and build local trust, added Dmytro Sokhach, founder of digital marketing agency <a href="https://admixglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Admix Global</a>.</p>
<p>As “near me” searches remain popular—more than 60% of mobile searches have local intent, by some estimates—Ken Fortney, CEO of SEO firm <a href="https://www.thatlocalpack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">That Local Pack</a>, pointed to one New York restaurant, which saw a 270% increase in revenue in a single year by adopting an enhanced <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local SEO</a> strategy that included Google Business optimization, as well as customer reviews (more on that later) and location-specific menus.</p>
<p>“Consumers are increasingly turning to local search to fulfill their immediate needs, and local SEO is key in attracting these ready-to-convert customers,” Fortney said.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4cd.png" alt="📍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Are your listings optimized for local search? </strong>Find out with our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/free-business-listings-grader?cid=Web_WS_InContentTextLink_Freemium_Listings&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent"><strong>Free Business Listings Grader</strong></a><strong>!</strong></p>
<div id="voice-search-optimization"></div>
<h3>2. Don’t forget voice search optimization</h3>
<p>In addition to local SEO basics, businesses should also integrate natural language processing to capitalize on voice queries.</p>
<p>“This involves utilizing conversational, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/long-tail-keywords">long-tail keywords</a> in content optimization, leading to a broader range of search visibility and potential customer attraction,” Fortney said.</p>
<p>For example, instead of targeting &#8220;Italian restaurants,&#8221; businesses could use &#8220;family-friendly Italian restaurant in Boston.&#8221;</p>
<p>“This hyper-personalization targets the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/niche-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">niche audience</a> directly and increases conversion probability,” added Gianluca Ferruggia, general manager of B2B marketplace <a href="https://www.designrush.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DesignRush</a>.</p>
<p>And don’t forget <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/15/what-is-schema-markup">Schema markup</a>.</p>
<p>“Optimizing for local pack rankings with precise location-based keywords and building <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/localize-google-ads">localized</a> links from directory listings and community websites is key,” said Lyn Collanto, marketing specialist at SEO agency <a href="https://kbaweb.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KBA Web</a>. “As mobile and voice search continue to rise, enhancing on-site elements like click-to-call and direction links will also be impactful.”</p>
<div id="local-influencers"></div>
<h3>3. Tap into local influencers</h3>
<p>While the benefits of using influencers to connect with consumers is widely documented, collaborating with local influencers, which may have smaller audiences, can be a big boon to local marketing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/content-creators-influencer.png" alt="content creator - screenshot of an influencer's post" width="640" height="429" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75863" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/content-creators-influencer.png 640w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/content-creators-influencer-480x322.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 640px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>“Including local micro-influencers in marketing campaigns can yield positive results,” Ferruggia said. “Their niche, dedicated following helps generate trustworthy <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/26/word-of-mouth-marketing">word-of-mouth</a> in the respective community.”</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Looking for more ways to drive people to your site?

<div id="local-events"></div>
<h3>4. Host, sponsor, or attend local events</h3>
<p>In addition to local influencers, local events are a good strategy to think about.</p>
<p>Examples include hosting workshops or classes, such as a cake decorating tutorial at a bakery.</p>
<p>“These events attract potential customers and create a memorable experience associated with your brand,” said Randy VanderVaate, CEO of <a href="http://www.funeralfunds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Funeral Funds of America</a>.</p>
<p>“By partnering with local influencers and businesses and hosting or sponsoring local events, a company can effectively tap into the local audience,” Shukla said. “These strategies not only enhance community engagement but also foster a sense of solidarity and support, which is particularly valuable in the current times where there&#8217;s a strong desire for community connection.”</p>
<p>In fact, Dillon believes community partnerships will grow in importance as these events help foster trust and authenticity.</p>
<p>Geoff Cudd, founder of review site <a href="https://ddiy.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Don&#8217;t Do It Yourself</a>, agreed businesses that engage in local events, sponsor local teams or partner with other local businesses can see a boost in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/06/online-reputation-management">reputation</a> and loyalty.</p>
<p>“This approach not only increases brand visibility but also builds a strong local network,” he added.</p>
<p>That could even include a cross-promotional offer with another local business.</p>
<p>“Brands that engage in local community initiatives or partner with other local businesses to create combined offerings may witness higher customer loyalty and differentiate themselves in the bustling marketplace,” said Pavel Naydenov, head of marketing at software platform <a href="https://businessmap.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Businessmap</a>.</p>
<p>Per his figures, Oleg Segal, CEO of discount site <a href="https://deala.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DealA</a>, said he has seen a 45% increase in these local partnerships in recent months.</p>
<div id="reviews-and-online-reputation"></div>
<h3>5. Prioritize reviews</h3>
<p>Along the way, encourage customers to leave <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">online reviews</a> on platforms like Google and Yelp. A solid presence here can contribute to a successful local <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-strategy-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing strategy</a>.</p>
<p>That’s in part because local sentiment and word-of-mouth lives online now. And so it’s important to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-respond-to-google-reviews-with-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">address both positive and negative reviews</a> instead of trying to bury the latter.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/google-review-response-example.webp" alt="example of negative google review response" width="936" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81267" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/google-review-response-example.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/google-review-response-example-480x231.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>“Actively listening, engaging positively, and addressing negative reviews is critical to maintaining community trust and loyalty,” said Iurii Nemtcev, CEO of <a href="https://biglab.ae/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Lab Digital Agency</a>.</p>
<div id="social-media-communities"></div>
<h3>6. Engage with social media communities</h3>
<p>In addition to advertising on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-media-strategy">social media</a>, local businesses can use these platforms to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/19/brand-community">drive community engagement</a>.</p>
<p>“Social media platforms are increasingly becoming local hubs,” Shukla said. “Engaging with the community by promoting local events, participating in local discussions, and showcasing community involvement can build a loyal local following.”</p>
<div id="linkedin"></div>
<h3>7. Don’t underestimate the power of LinkedIn</h3>
<p>While <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">social platforms</a> like Facebook and Instagram remain popular among local marketers—<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/facebook-ads-for-small-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and for good reasons</a>—Clegg called LinkedIn “a potent platform for local businesses looking to expand their reach.”</p>
<p>That’s in part because <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/25/optimize-linkedin-ads">LinkedIn</a> outreach can deliver enhanced results when combined with emails. For one client, Clegg added 400 emails per month and scheduled 40 qualified sales calls per month as a result of implementing this tactic.</p>
<div id="hyper-local-advertising"></div>
<h3>8. Run hyper-local advertising</h3>
<p>Beyond engaging communities on social media, tap into the power of these platforms to target your ads to local consumers.</p>
<p>“Platforms like Facebook and Instagram offer <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/13/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-world">advanced targeting options</a> that allow businesses to reach potential customers in specific geographic areas,” Cudd said. “By creating localized content and ads, businesses can effectively engage with a community-focused audience.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/google-ads-for-real-estate-ab-test-example.webp" alt="google ads for real estate ab test example" width="936" height="567" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76253" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/google-ads-for-real-estate-ab-test-example.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/google-ads-for-real-estate-ab-test-example-480x291.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An example of a localized ad vs. a generic ad for the same business.</em></p>
<p>The result is the personalized content consumers crave—and can reach potential customers with a high potential for engagement.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Want to learn about local ads on Google?

<div id="data-driven-hyper-local-targeting"></div>
<h3>9. Use data and analytics to create more powerful hyper-local targeting</h3>
<p>Hyper-local targeting will get a boost in 2024 thanks to more advanced data analytics.</p>
<p>“In 2024, the key is hyper-local targeting, using advanced data analytics to understand and engage with specific demographics within a community,” said Leena Sowambur, founder of Marcomms by Leena.</p>
<p>What’s more, the ability to combine <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/04/customer-segmentation-models">consumer data points</a>—such as shopping habits, online behavior and even political leanings—will fuel more personalized messaging.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re seeing an unprecedented emphasis on cross-sectional marketing,” she added. “This strategy allows for nuanced messaging that resonates deeply with diverse groups within a community.”</p>
<div id="video"></div>
<h3>10. Invest in video</h3>
<p>Local businesses that want to take their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-marketing-trends-2024">content marketing</a> efforts up a notch should consider video, which remains the format of choice across social media.</p>
<p>“This trend offers businesses new opportunities to creatively engage with their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audiences</a>, revolutionizing how they connect with viewers,” said Zain Bin Zameer, senior link-building expert at Technology Ally. “Whether through product demos, brand stories or educational tutorials, the impact of video content is set to reshape the marketing landscape for years to come.”</p>
<p>In addition, Dillon suggested small businesses experiment with formats like short-form or live videos to capitalize on platforms like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/14/tiktok-trend-discovery">TikTok</a> and Reels.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tiktok-trend-discovery-married-in-italy-trend.jpg" alt="tiktok trend discovery - example of business using tiktok trend" width="281" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-78535" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tiktok-trend-discovery-married-in-italy-trend.jpg 281w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tiktok-trend-discovery-married-in-italy-trend-141x300.jpg 141w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px" /></p>
<p>“These strategies will harness not only <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/digital-marketing-trends-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital trends</a> but also market shifts in consumer behavior and technological advancements,” he added.</p>
<div id="local-marketing-ai-tools"></div>
<h3>11. Use AI tools</h3>
<p>While the benefits of video content are well-documented, high-quality video isn’t always affordable.</p>
<p>However, thanks to the advent of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency">AI tools</a>, we’re going to see further democratization of high-quality video content in 2024.</p>
<p>That’s according to Lucas Ochoa, CEO of <a href="https://www.runautomat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automat</a>, who said, “What used to be an expensive and exclusive process is becoming more accessible and affordable. This shift won&#8217;t just level the playing field for local businesses but will also usher in a fresh wave of creativity and personalization in marketing communications.”</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f916.png" alt="🤖" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Want to use AI the right way? <strong>Free download &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteAIinMarketingGuide.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_AIMarketing_Download">Emergency Guide to AI in Marketing</a></p>
<div id="diversified-local-content"></div>
<h3>12. Create diversified local content</h3>
<p>But geo-targeted content like emails and texts can also be powerful tools.</p>
<p>“Most importantly, producing consistent, high-quality local content tailored to the area and offering real value to nearby searchers is what can propel SEO success for local businesses in the ever-evolving local search landscape,” Collanto said. “Focusing initiatives around these types of local marketing strategies and trends will yield the best results.”</p>
<div id="learn-from-b2b-tactics"></div>
<h3>13. Learn from B2B tactics</h3>
<p>Even B2C brands will want to pay attention to this one.</p>
<p>As consumer behavior continues to go digital and data-driven marketing tactics proliferate, local advertisers have an opportunity to embrace <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/b2b-marketing-trends-2024">B2B marketing strategies</a> to expand their reach.</p>
<p>“The concept takes a bit of a pivot from traditional B2C strategies—it views every local customer as a potential business partner,” Clegg said. “In practice, we helped our clients build stronger relationships with local customers and offered them value beyond a single transaction, converting them into long-term advocates for the business.”</p>
<div id="personalize-content-and-promotions"></div>
<h3>14. Personalize and segment content and promotions</h3>
<p>Finally, brands that sell products online have an opportunity in what Sunny Zheng, senior manager at cosmetic brand <a href="https://www.tyoemcosmetic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tengyu</a>, called “personalized local ecommerce.”</p>
<p>By creating web pages with content and deals specifically for target regions via its Regional Specials project, Tengyu netted 2000 additional online sales in three months.</p>
<p>“It shows how much people appreciate content that feels personally relevant to them,” Zheng said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It can be challenging for local businesses to break through and get found–particularly online. Local SEO has grown in importance over the past few years for businesses who want to dominate the SERPs within a particular city or region. But even with the best SEO strategy, you&#8217;re still not likely to own the first (or second, or third!) spot for local searches&#8211;especially those with purchase intent. Those belong to local search ads.</p>

<h2>5 common pitfalls of setting your Google Ads location targeting</h2>
<p>When you create a campaign in Google Ads, you have near-limitless location targeting options to choose from. Targeting the whole world, country, state, city, or zip code–the steps are easy and nearly identical.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-setup.webp" alt="google ads location targeting set up" width="936" height="383" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76512" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-setup.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-setup-480x196.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But that simplicity and ease with endless choice often cause advertisers to make mistakes before their first ads are even live.</p>

<h3>1. Don’t make decisions with your gut!</h3>
<p>All humans are biased, and we over-appreciate our own experiences. Don’t let your experiences blind your marketing. You’re likely the most experienced searcher regarding your own business–and your prospective customers certainly have a different background than you.</p>
<p>You might assume that only people in your business’s town or neighborhood would become customers. Still, you might be surprised at how far people are prepared to travel to find a dentist, doctor, or lawyer they trust (or how far they’ll travel to get away from the options in their own backyards!).</p>
<p>Instead of considering just your immediate area, view data within <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/17/ga4-features-for-advertisers">Google Analytics</a> to see where past visitors came from and how well they converted on your site. You may be surprised to see how intentionally people might search for your business, even several cities or states away.</p>
<h3>2. Don’t target areas based on their demographic profile</h3>
<p>You see your customers every day, and you likely know them the best! <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">Understanding your target audience</a> will be key to building your campaigns, but it might lead you astray when setting up your location-targeting settings. Towns and cities might have very different demographic profiles, but none are strictly homogenous. Even if your target audience is more concentrated in one area, they will search for you wherever they are.</p>
<p>Instead of strictly targeting areas based on their demographic profile, consider improving your ads to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/31/detailed-demographics">target users based on their demographics</a> and other audience signals.</p>
<h3>3. Don’t over-rely on your CRM data for your customers’ locations</h3>
<p>If you’re <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collecting data</a> from your past customers–you’re setting yourself up to make better decisions in both your business and advertising. But when it comes to their customers&#8217; location data in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/09/crm-for-small-business">CRM</a>, take that with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>Remember that their home address isn’t always where they’re searching. Especially since <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/google-search-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly two-thirds</a> of searches in the US are coming from mobile devices, your customers are likely finding you while they’re searching at home, at work, and everywhere else they go.</p>
<p>Your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/12/first-party-data">first-party customer data</a> is among the most powerful tools to optimize your Google Ads campaigns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/types-of-customer-data.webp" alt="types of customer data" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76534" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/types-of-customer-data.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/types-of-customer-data-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Use your CRM data to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/10/21/calculate-roi-offline-transactions">measure offline conversions</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/11/02/adwords-customer-match-setup">create customized audiences with Customer Match</a>. But when setting up location targeting, use your customer’s location data as a starting point for your analysis, not the end.</p>
<h3>4. Be cautious of radius targeting</h3>
<p>A common approach for many local businesses is to set their campaigns’ location as a few-mile radius around their storefront. It’s a simple approach that can help you ensure that you’re reaching your local audience in all directions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-radius-targeting.webp" alt="google ads location targeting - radius targeting setup screen" width="738" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76513" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-radius-targeting.webp 738w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-radius-targeting-480x390.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 738px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1722043?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">radius targeting</a> is deceptively simple–setting a radius of “a few miles” can quickly escalate to your ads reaching a much larger audience than you intended. Agreeing to “target a 10-mile radius” might quickly sound like it’s twice the area of “targeting a 5-mile radius”–but it’s actually not. That 10-mile radius area is <strong><em>four times as large</em></strong> as that 5-mile radius area. Remember–a circle&#8217;s area grows exponentially with its radius&#8217;s size!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-area-of-circle.webp" alt="google ads location targeting - radius of circle" width="448" height="314" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76514" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-area-of-circle.webp 448w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-area-of-circle-300x210.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px" /></p>
<p>Be aware of that verbal trick when you set up your radius targeting. Even if unintentional, your agency or marketing team may increase your reach (and necessary budget) significantly more than you first hear.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-increase-radius.webp" alt="google ad location targeting - increase radius" width="936" height="266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76515" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-increase-radius.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-increase-radius-480x136.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Of course, the opposite is also true. If you’re a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/09/free-and-low-budget-marketing-ideas">local business with a limited budget</a>, an effective way to reign in your campaigns’ needed budget is simply to reduce the size of your targeting radius. This verbal trick can be a sneaky way to get a proud business owner or stakeholder to agree to a significant cut in their campaign’s ambitious reach without sounding like you’re cutting your targeting too much.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-decrease-targeting.webp" alt="google ads location targeting - decrease location targeting" width="936" height="252" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76516" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-decrease-targeting.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-decrease-targeting-480x129.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>5. Revisit your targeting regularly</h3>
<p>Once your campaigns are up and running, it’s easy not to look back at their settings. After all, campaigns require enough <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/adwords-optimization">regular review and optimization</a> of their keywords, negative keywords, ads, assets, bids, and account structure. But still, too many advertisers never revisit the location settings they launched their campaigns with. Even if perfect at the time–people move, cities change, and how people search evolves.</p>
<p>Make it a point to review and revisit your location targeting in your campaigns at least every six months. A campaign that is performing well may be worth expanding into some new areas. Or a campaign that is struggling may have too ambitious reach as-is.</p>

<div id="how-to-analyze-google-ads-location-performance"></div>
<h2>How to analyze your location performance in Google Ads</h2>
<p>Over the years, Google has changed and hidden its reporting for how your ads perform in different geos. Luckily, you can still see exactly where your ads show the most, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/15/google-ads-benchmarks">their costs</a>, and conversions across different geographic areas.</p>
<h3>1. Using the Google Ads location report</h3>
<p>The most straightforward place to start is the most obvious. The locations report directly within Google Ads is readily accessible from the left-hand menu in a campaign. Sometimes hidden at the bottom of the bar, click “Locations &gt; Locations,” and you’ll see a standard report that includes each targeting region you typed into your campaign settings.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-location-report.webp" alt="google ads location report for location targeting" width="936" height="341" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76517" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-location-report.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-location-report-480x175.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you’ve only created one location target in your campaign, this is a trivial report as-is. Even if you were to include several, many advertisers get limited value from this screen.</p>
<p><strong>Let me tell you the trick.</strong> Check off all your targeted locations, and now a new option appears for “Narrow by.” Click Narrow by–and you’ll be amazed at the specificity you can break your Google Ads geo data down. You can break this national data down to the state, county, city, or zip code. Furthermore, you can see data on unique areas like Congressional districts or Nielsen DMAs or areas of interest like Airports and Universities.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-narrow-location.webp" alt="narrow location in google ads location report" width="561" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76518" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-narrow-location.webp 561w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-narrow-location-480x513.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 561px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>2. Using the Google Ads distance report</h3>
<p>The Google Ads distance report is particularly useful to advertisers who use radius targeting. If you’re unsure how large a radius your campaigns should target, the distance report will become your best tool. To access the <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2453994?hl=en#:~:text=Distance%20reports&amp;text=Your%20data%20will%20be%20organized,or%20content%20they'd%20viewed." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads distance report</a>, select the “Reports” icon in the top right corner of Google Ads. From there, select “Predefined reports (Dimensions)” &gt; “Locations” &gt; “Distance.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-distance-report.webp" alt="google ads location targeting - distance report" width="936" height="377" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76519" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-distance-report.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-distance-report-480x193.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The Google Ads distance report will show how your ads perform at different distances from your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/09/19/adwords-location-extensions-guide">Location Assets (formerly Location Extensions)</a>. You can customize the columns to include relevant metrics or further segment the data.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that this report shows cascading radii that grow in size as you get further from your business. Each row’s data includes the one above it–i.e., the data from “Within 5 miles” is also counted in the row for “Within 10 miles.”</p>
<p>To see how searchers behave within these ranges, you can easily export this data into Looker Studio or Excel for quick manipulation. Once exported, some simple subtraction can help you understand how people search and convert at different distances from your location. To know how your ads are performing between 1 and 5 miles away, subject the data in the “Within 1 mile” row of the location report from the data “Within 5 miles.” Repeat that process for further distances, and you’ll begin to see how far is “too far” for your local searchers.</p>

<h2>How to optimize your location performance with bid adjustments in Google Ads</h2>
<p>Now that you have more insight into how your ads perform in different areas, you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/07/google-ads-geotargeting">optimize your targeting</a>. Some easy wins might be to expand your reach by targeting neighboring regions or reducing wasted spend from areas that haven’t converted well for you. But don’t get hung up on the binaries of just targeting or excluding–you can use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/08/05/geotargeting-with-bid-modifiers">location bid adjustments </a>to bid more aggressively for areas near your business where you expect local users to be easier to convert and reduce your bids as a searcher is further away.</p>
<p>Using location bid adjustments, you can still reach audiences far away while prioritizing your spend and focus on a hyper-specific local market.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-optimization.webp" alt="google ads location targeting bid optimization" width="936" height="532" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76522" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-optimization.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-optimization-480x273.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h1>Optimize your Google Ads location targeting with ease</h1>
<p>It can be intimidating for local businesses to choose where to target their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/learn/ppc101">PPC campaigns</a>. Google Ads offers advertisers a lot of choice, and it can often feel like you’re risking your limited budget by targeting an area too wide or too far from your backyard.</p>
<p>Luckily, savvy advertisers know how to find data hidden within these geographic reports and use it to find new opportunities to reach prospective customers and minimize your wasted ad spend.</p>
<p>Here are those five <a href="https://www.link-assistant.com/news/top-search-engines.html">mistakes</a> to avoid when it comes to Google Ads location targeting:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t make decisions with your gut!</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t target areas based on their demographic profile</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t over-rely on your CRM data for your customers’ locations</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Be cautious of radius targeting</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Revisit your targeting regularly</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Location Assets (formerly known as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/09/19/adwords-location-extensions-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Location Extensions</a>) have been a staple of any good local business’s Google Ads account for over a decade. Although their name has changed a few times since their introduction, they’ve always functioned the same and served the same value–simply link your Google Business Profile to Google Ads and your ads will begin to show your location to searchers nearby.</p>
<p>After decades of this simple but effective design, Google recently began automatically enhancing its location assets to <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2404182?utm_source=awfe&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20249167#merchant_photos&amp;zippy=%2Copt-out-of-using-merchant-photos-in-local-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">include an image of their local business</a> alongside their address and hours. This new feature is designed to help your ads stand out on the busy SERP, improve ad performance, and reinforce trust in your local business.</p>

<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll walk through:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to feature your business&#8217;s images in your Google Ads location assets</li>
<li>Best practices for your business&#8217;s images in location assets</li>
<li>How to opt out of showing your images in location assets</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s get started.</p>
<h2>How to feature your business&#8217;s images in your Google Ads location assets</h2>
<p>To take advantage of this new feature, all advertisers need to do is maintain their Google Business Profile, have it linked to Google Ads, and have their location extensions active in their campaigns. Google will automatically highlight any of your Google Business Profile’s merchant photos.</p>
<p>Your Google Ads location <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-assets">assets</a> will only include images that you’ve uploaded directly to your GBP’s Merchant Photos–it will not pull any photos submitted to your GBP from past visitors or from reviews, so you’ll always set the right impression with your ads’ images.</p>
<h3>1. Create and manage your Google Business Profile’s merchant photos</h3>
<p>For your Google Ads’ location assets to feature your business’s images, you’ll first need to upload at least one merchant photo to your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/08/what-is-google-my-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Business Profile</a>. To upload merchant photos, first sign into your Google Business Profile and select “Add Photo.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/location-assets-enhancements-merchant-photo.jpg" alt="location assets google ads - where to manage images for merchant center" width="936" height="411" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75837" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/location-assets-enhancements-merchant-photo.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/location-assets-enhancements-merchant-photo-480x211.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>2. Upload your images</h3>
<p>You’ll then have three options for the type of photo to upload.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Logo: </strong>Your logo photo will help you keep your brand consistent and identifiable across Google. Your logo icon will appear alongside any posts from your profile or anytime you respond to a question or review.</li>
<li><strong>Cover photo: </strong>Your cover photo is the money shot – this photo is most likely to show up first in your Google Business Profile listing and will be used the most in your Google location assets images.</li>
<li><strong>Photo: </strong>These are supplementary photos that will show in your Google Business Profile listing. They’re often visible alongside your Cover photo, so it’s worth including at least several different and dynamic images of your business.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Remove outdated photos</h3>
<p>If your business photos are outdated or poor quality, you can also remove any old photos from your Google Business Profile. Just log into your Google Business Profile and select anywhere in the photos section. Navigate to the “By owner” section and select the photo you wish to remove. In the top right corner, you should be able to select a trash can “delete” icon to remove it from your profile.</p>

<h2>Best practices for Google Business Profile photos and Google Ads location assets</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/03/google-my-business-optimization">Optimizing your Google Business Profile</a> isn’t just important for your Google Ads location assets. Your Google Business Profile is likely the first thing searchers will see when they find you online, and it’s a huge part of Google’s own <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local SEO</a> ranking algorithm.</p>
<p>Spend the time to completely fill out your Google Business Profile and regularly update it to highlight to both Google and searchers alike that you’re an active, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-respond-to-google-reviews-with-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">responsive</a>, and trustworthy business.</p>
<h3>1. Prioritize a high-quality cover photo</h3>
<p>Your cover photo will usually be shown first and most prominently on the SERP, alongside your GBP, and now alongside your Google Ads. Ensure that your cover photo best represents the image of your brand and is accurate to your business. Use proper lighting, focus, and minimal alterations. Google recommends your cover photo to be at least 720 x 720 in size.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/location-assets-enhancements-example-plumbing.jpg" alt="location assets enhancements - example of ad with image as part of location asset" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75848" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/location-assets-enhancements-example-plumbing.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/location-assets-enhancements-example-plumbing-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>2. Include a variety of different photos</h3>
<p>Your cover photo may get the most attention, but it won’t always show alone. A prospective visitor is likely to browse several images online before visiting in person. Consider including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Several exterior images: </strong>To help customers recognize your business as they approach. Include different images to highlight how your storefront looks from different directions, parking and transit options, as well as how your business looks at night.</li>
<li><strong>Interior images: </strong>To highlight the atmosphere that customers should expect in your store. Highlight color product displays, seasonal areas, waiting rooms, common areas, and amenities that customers may want to see.</li>
<li><strong>Staff photos: </strong>To highlight your great team and present a more personal side of your business. Authentic photos that show your team working together earns trust in your business. Avoid including formal headshots.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Create a Google Ads Logo asset</h3>
<p>Your Google Business Profile will highlight your logo alongside your posts and responses automatically. You also highlight that same logo alongside all your Google ads to reinforce your brand consistently on the SERP. Creating a logo asset is a simple and effective way to improve your ads performance, but you’ll need to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/13/google-advertiser-verification">verify your Google Ads account</a> before you can implement it.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/location-assets-enhancements-logo-asset.jpg" alt="location assets - google logo asset" width="701" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75838" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/location-assets-enhancements-logo-asset.jpg 701w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/location-assets-enhancements-logo-asset-480x411.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 701px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>4. Enhance your ads with image assets</h3>
<p>Your location assets and images from your Google Business Profile will automatically appear when a user is searching for you locally–but searchers outside of your area may not always see these assets.</p>
<p>Include <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/21/google-ads-image-extensions">image assets</a> in your Google Ads campaigns to provide more visual aspects to your search ads, whether or not a user is searching locally or not. Image assets are also more flexible and don’t need to be directly related to your physical location.</p>
<p>Use them to highlight images of more seasonal events, sales, products, and services that wouldn’t always be appropriate to be prominently displayed on your Google Business Profile.</p>
<h2>How to opt out of automatically including photos in your local Google Ads</h2>
<p>Some businesses won’t always have the most aesthetic Google Business Profile photos and may want to opt out of including photos of their location within Google Ads. Luckily for them, these new features for location assets can be turned off and allow advertisers to just show their location alongside their ad without any photos.</p>
<p>To opt out of automatically including photos in your local Google Ads, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Within Google Ads, select “Ads and Assets” from the left-hand bar, then select “Assets.”</li>
<li>Under the “Associations view,” select the 3-dot “More” icon. Then select “Account-level automated assets.”</li>
<li>From this view, select the three-dot “More” icon again. Now select the option “Advanced settings”</li>
<li>Under “Automatic locations,” there is a check box to “Grant Google Ads license to use merchant photos and other rich media from the linked Google Business Profiles in the advertising campaigns from this account.” Unselect this option and hit save. This will prevent Google from pulling any photos from your Google Business Profile to serve alongside your ads.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Show off your business images in location assets</h2>
<p>These new enhancements to location assets should be valuable for local advertisers and help their ads stick out from their competition on the SERP. As these features continue to roll out to more advertisers, now is a perfect time to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/optimize-google-my-business-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review your Google Business Profile</a> and ensure your business is prominently displayed in local searches.</p>

<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/06/listings-management-tools">Use These 7 Listings Management Tools to Get Found &#038; Get Leads</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in the olden days, you’d leaf through a huge phone book to find a pet groomer, dentist, or roofer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-meme-phonebooks-1.jpg" alt="Listings management tools - Meme about getting a number from a phonebook" width="795" height="599" class="aligncenter wp-image-73408 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-meme-phonebooks-1.jpg 795w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-meme-phonebooks-1-480x362.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 795px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The internet lifted business listings off of the Yellow Pages, made them digital, and put them on hyper mode. Now you might find the same roofer listed on dozens of directories, search engine results, and map app screens.</p>
<p>These listings are a boon to local businesses, delivering ready-to-buy customers right to your front door.</p>
<p>But what happens if the information on a directory or map search is wrong? Or if it’s missing altogether? Those people searching will head right to your competitor&#8217;s listing.</p>
<p>That’s where local listings management tools come in. Built with a variety of features, listings management tools help you monitor and update your company&#8217;s details on the places people search. They give you data about how people find and interact with your listings. And some even let you track and respond to reviews so your ratings go, well, through the roof.</p>
<h2>7 listings management tools to try</h2>
<p>Not all listing management tools are the same. Some are a feature of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/01/business-directory-listings">business listings site</a> itself, like Google’s tools for managing the way people find your business on the search engine. Others give you the power to see and control dozens of listings in many locations all at once.</p>
<h3>1. Google Business Profile</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-business-profile-updates-for-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Business Profile</a> (GBP) is Google’s native tool for managing your listings on both Google Search and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-maps-mobile">Google Maps</a>. GBP’s features let you improve your search results and communicate with people interested in your business.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-GBP-intro.jpg" alt="Listings management tools - screenshot of Google Business Profile landing page" width="936" height="477" class="aligncenter wp-image-73409 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-GBP-intro.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-GBP-intro-480x245.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Google listing optimization</h4>
<p>The more information you have in your Google Business Profile, the better the chance you have of nabbing some traffic-generating real estate on search and maps results pages. GBP helps you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/03/google-my-business-optimization">optimize your profile</a> to make it more search engine-friendly.</p>
<p>For example, you can add a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-write-a-business-description/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business description</a> and category that gives customers and search engines more context about your company. GBP also lets you add photos to spice up text-only profiles.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-example-optimized-GBP.jpg" alt="Listings management tools - example of a profile before and after optimization" width="865" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-73410 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-example-optimized-GBP.jpg 865w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-example-optimized-GBP-480x333.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 865px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The great thing about GBP is that you only need to update your profile once. It’ll show those changes on Google Maps, search results, and in the coveted <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/get-your-business-on-google-3-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local 3-pack</a>.</p>
<h4>Message management</h4>
<p>Your Google Business Profile offers a couple of ways to engage with your customers on a one-to-one level.</p>
<p>First off, you can read and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-respond-to-google-reviews-with-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">respond to reviews</a> using GBP. Since reviews and ratings are prominently presented in results, you’ll want to make sure and keep up with them.</p>
<p>There is also the option to add direct messaging to your GBP profile. That gives you a way to answer more detailed follow-up questions (and hopefully gain more customers!).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-GBP-reviews.jpg" alt="Listings management tools" width="400" height="597" class="aligncenter wp-image-73411 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-GBP-reviews.jpg 400w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-GBP-reviews-201x300.jpg 201w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.google.com/business/?ppsrc=GPDA2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>And finally, you can add an FAQ section to your profile.</p>
<p>Answering frequently asked questions not only helps the person asking, but it also gives helpful information to anyone reading through your profile.</p>
<h3>2. LocaliQ Listings</h3>
<p>LocaliQ offers business listing management that puts you in control of how your business is seen on more than 50 different directories and websites.</p>
<p>The platform offers three ways to generate more sales from local business listing directories.</p>
<h4>Local listings management</h4>
<p>One of the most helpful features of LocaliQ&#8217;s listings management solution is its <a href="https://localiq.com/products/listings/?itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=mega_menu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listings management tool</a>. With a single click, you can update your business details to dozens of directories.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works. Let&#8217;s say you decide to add a new service and extend your operating hours on Saturdays. Normally, you’d have to go into Google, Yelp, Bing, and all the other directories to manually edit your citation.</p>
<p>With LocaliQ’s listings management tool, you type those changes in your dashboard, then syndicate them to each of those websites automatically.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-localiq-profile.jpg" alt="Listings management tools - screenshot of LocaliQs profile checker" width="654" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-73414 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-localiq-profile.jpg 654w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-localiq-profile-480x440.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 654px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You can also use LocaliQ to look for and remove SEO-killing duplicate listings and manage <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/multi-location-seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple location listings</a> from the same dashboard.</p>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><p>Not sure if your listings are up to par? Use LocaliQ&#8217;s <a href="https://localiq.com/free-business-listings-grader/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium">Free Business Listings Grader</a> to find out.</p></div></div>
<h4>Review management</h4>
<p>Many directories like Google and Yelp give users the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">ability to review your business</a>. It’s critical to read and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-deal-with-bad-reviews/#:~:text=Follow%20our%20steps%20for%20responding%20to%20negative%20reviews%2C,Offer%20a%20resolution.%20...%205%20Follow%20up.%20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">respond to those reviews</a>. But let’s face it, you’ll spend all day trying to chase them down in each directory.</p>
<p>LocaliQ lets you read and respond to recent reviews from several directories, right in your dashboard.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-localiq-reviews.jpg" alt="Listings management tools - LocaliQ's review management dashboard" width="582" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-73415 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-localiq-reviews.jpg 582w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-localiq-reviews-480x495.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 582px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You’ll also see important aggregated customer feedback data, like your average review rating. If there’s a big change in that info, you can figure out what happened and react.</p>
<h4>Business listings analytics</h4>
<p>How do customers find you? LocaliQ’s reports show you if it was search engines, maps, or other sources that led them to your listing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-localiq-analytics.jpg" alt="Listing management tools - LocalQ's analytics dashboard" width="445" height="439" class="aligncenter wp-image-73416 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-localiq-analytics.jpg 445w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-localiq-analytics-300x296.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px" /></p>
<p>The easy-to-read reports include data on what actions people take after seeing your listings. Do they call? Or are they more inclined to click on your website?</p>
<h3>3. Yelp</h3>
<p>According to Yelp, <a href="https://business.yelp.com/resources/study-shows-high-intent-consumers-are-contacting-businesses-quickly-on-yelp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80 million</a> people pop into its directory to find a business every month. And four out of five Yelp customers make a purchase within minutes of viewing a business’s profile. Yelp&#8217;s listing tools offer some unique ways to get more of those people to your door.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-Yelp-intro.jpg" alt="Local listings management - Yelp for Business landing page" width="929" height="498" class="aligncenter wp-image-73417 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-Yelp-intro.jpg 929w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-Yelp-intro-480x257.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 929px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Review management</h4>
<p>Sure, Yelp is a directory. But it’s first and foremost a review website. Users can leave reviews, <a href="https://blog.yelp.com/community/welcome-to-the-elite-squad-faqs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">become elite reviewers</a>, and even review the reviews. So it’s no surprise that Yelp provides review management tools.</p>
<p>Once you <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-claim-a-business-on-yelp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claim your Yelp listing</a>, you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/07/22/yelp-reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">respond directly to any review</a> your business receives through the Yelp dashboard.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-review-1.jpg" alt="Listings management tools - Yelp review example" width="930" height="453" class="aligncenter wp-image-73419 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-review-1.jpg 930w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-review-1-480x234.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 930px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-at-prudential-boston-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>If you want to take the conversation out of public view, Yelp lets you get direct messages—including requests for quotes, phone calls, or consultations—from customers.</p>
<h4>Business updates</h4>
<p>Listings can get stale over time. Yelp’s listing management tool lets you add updates to your profile to get people excited about what you offer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-Yelp-connect.jpg" alt="Listings management tools - Yelp connect example" width="606" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-73421 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-Yelp-connect.jpg 606w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-Yelp-connect-480x475.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 606px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Officially, the feature is called Yelp Connect. With it, you can add little image icons that look like <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/instagram-story-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram Story Highlights</a>. Users hover over them to read whatever delicious detail you’ve shared.</p>
<h3>4. Bing Places</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.bingplaces.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bing Places</a> is Microsoft&#8217;s answer to the Google Business Profile. While Bing Places can’t boast the functionality of GBP, it does have a few listing management tools to help you get found by <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/19/who-uses-bing-anyway#_ga=2.121975054.401447745.1688386652-497116163.1684162194&amp;_gac=1.53142234.1686663326.CjwKCAjwp6CkBhB_EiwAlQVyxVvyIjqPK9-OmjpTaQmFh2CJ2UJHvPlYTFzYFKz4ld9cyYhUrvRnwhoC_d0QAvD_BwE">more people than you may suspect</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-Bing-intro.jpg" alt="Listings management tools - Bing Places landing page" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-73422 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-Bing-intro.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-Bing-intro-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Listing information management</h4>
<p>If you’re not using a listings management tool like the one offered by LocaliQ, you’ll need to hop into Bing every once in a while to make sure your information is correct.</p>
<p>Just like for Google, you need to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-claim-your-bing-business-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claim your listing on Bing first</a>. But then Bing lets you fill in all the juicy details like hours of operation and so forth. The really cool bit is that you can just import all of that data right from your Google Business profile to save time.</p>
<p>Once you’re up and running, you’ll be eligible for placement on Bing Search and Maps.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-Bing-location-map-1.jpg" alt="listings management tools - Bing map" width="936" height="569" class="aligncenter wp-image-73424 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-Bing-location-map-1.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-Bing-location-map-1-480x292.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And bonus: You may even land yourself as the result in upcoming voice searches since Bing powers both Microsoft’s Cortana and Amazon’s Alexa.</p>
<h3>5. Facebook Business Page</h3>
<p>The social media website functions like a local business directory because <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-facebook-page-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Business Pages</a> often wind up in search engine results. Luckily, Facebook offers some tools that’ll help you manage your page as if it were a local listing.</p>
<h4>Location management</h4>
<p>It’s all about “location, location, location” in local search results. So your Facebook page <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/add-location-to-facebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">needs to be linked to a geographic location</a> for it to show up in “&#8230;near me” searches.</p>
<p>Facebook’s Business Page tools let you do that in a few ways. First and foremost, you can add your address to your Page.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-Facebook-location-map.jpg" alt="Listings management tools - Facebook map" width="563" height="595" class="aligncenter wp-image-73425 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-Facebook-location-map.jpg 563w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-Facebook-location-map-480x507.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 563px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Facebook also lets you tag posts and images—on both desktop and mobile—with a location. Then you can change the category of your business to one that works locally, like a plumber or hair stylist, so your business shows up when people filter for places, as opposed to people or posts.</p>
<h3>6. The Real Yellow Pages</h3>
<p>Yes, they’re still around. In fact, the <a href="https://www.yellowpages.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YP website</a> claims 4 billion searches for local businesses on its website and app each year. And there are some nice tools for businesses to manage their listings on the OG directory.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-YellowPages-intro.jpg" alt="Listings management page - YellowPages for business landing page" width="935" height="434" class="aligncenter wp-image-73426 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-YellowPages-intro.jpg 935w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-YellowPages-intro-480x223.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 935px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Multi-directory listing</h4>
<p>The YellowPages network actually includes three directories: The Real Yellow Pages, Superpages, and dexknows.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-YellowPages-network.jpg" alt="Listings management tools - graphic of yellowpages network" width="935" height="232" class="aligncenter wp-image-73427 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-YellowPages-network.jpg 935w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-YellowPages-network-480x119.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 935px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>That means any work you put into creating your business&#8217;s listing will automatically apply to all three locations for much more reach.</p>
<p>As for the listings themselves, YP gives you some options to customize <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/12/local-citations">citations</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-YellowPages-listing.jpg" alt="Listings management tools - yellowpages business citation" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-73428 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-YellowPages-listing.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-YellowPages-listing-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You can add branding, images, action links, and special offers along with all the standard business info. There’s also plenty of space to write a full business description and include customer reviews.</p>
<h3>7. Foursquare</h3>
<p><a href="https://business.foursquare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foursquare</a> isn’t what you think it is anymore. What was once a social media app for telling your friends which boba tea joint to find you in has become the location data provider for some of the largest geographic-dependent apps in the world (think: Uber and Nextdoor). So when you claim your business listing on Foursquare, you’re giving your business more opportunities to show up in the apps that matter.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-Foursquare-intro.jpg" alt="Listings management tools - Foursquare for business landing page" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-73429 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-Foursquare-intro.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-Foursquare-intro-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Socially networked listings</h4>
<p>Even though it doesn’t operate like a social media platform anymore, there’s still a network effect to the listings on Foursquare. In large part, that’s due to the “tips” feature of the app.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-Foursquare-tips-2.jpg" alt="Listings management tools - Foursquare tip from user" width="658" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-73430 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-Foursquare-tips-2.jpg 658w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-Foursquare-tips-2-480x438.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 658px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The idea is that customers can offer those little insider suggestions that help new visitors get the most out of their trip.</p>
<p>The tips feature encourages people to add their favorite places to Foursquare, which means your local business may already have a citation there. You just need to <a href="https://foursquare.com/venue/claim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claim it</a> and fill in the details—a task Foursquare makes easy with their listing management tool.</p>
<h4>Individualized analytics</h4>
<p>Like some of the other tools on this list, Foursquare also lets you track the analytics collected through each citation visit. But since people still check in to Foursquare leaving reviews and tips, the app has a lot of data about individual users. So you can not only tell how many people saw and clicked on your Foursquare listing, you can tell how often or how recently some of them walked through your door.</p>
<h2>Why local listings management tools are important</h2>
<p>Whether you’re using a tool like LocaliQ to manage many listings at once, or tackling each directory separately, listing management tools make it easy to view, manage, and track how you’re seen in directories. Here are some more reasons listings management tools are so important in finding <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/hot-leads-vs-cold-leads">hot leads</a>.</p>
<h3>Increase online presence</h3>
<p>Being present in online directories gets you access to more customers, can boost your SEO, and gives you more opportunities to collect reviews. That’s pretty important since <a href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/the-importance-of-online-customer-reviews-infographic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">72%</a> of consumers say positive reviews make them trust a business more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-stat-trust.jpg" alt="Listings management tools - graphic saying 72% of people say positive reviews make them trust businesses more" width="936" height="361" class="aligncenter wp-image-73432 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-stat-trust.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-stat-trust-480x185.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Millions of people use online directories to find local businesses. The more of those directories that include your business listing, the greater the chance you’ll be found by new customers.</p>
<p>Search engines also reward businesses that have more, fully optimized citations and reviews on trusted directories.</p>
<p>Local listing management tools help you get cited on more directory websites and map apps.</p>
<h3>Maintain correct listing information</h3>
<p>Your business likely exists on many directories whether you put it there or not. That means the information displayed might be incorrect, out-of-date, and downright unflattering.</p>
<p>All that bad information will frustrate customers and signal search engines that your business isn’t trusted as your competitors (which we know isn’t true!). In fact, <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/research/business-listings-trust-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">63%</a> of consumers say incorrect information would stop them from using that business.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-stat-incorrect.jpg" alt="Listings management tools - graphic saying 63% of people don't use businesses with incorrect listings" width="936" height="370" class="aligncenter wp-image-73433 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-stat-incorrect.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listings-management-tools-stat-incorrect-480x190.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>When you use listing management tools, you can make sure your details are correct and even spice up your listings to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/17/halloween-greetings-sayingsundefined" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attract more customers</a>.</p>
<h3>Understand the trends</h3>
<p>Many of the listing tools we’ve reviewed provide analytics. This peak behind the directory curtain clues you in on who’s visiting and where they’re coming from.</p>
<p>With these insights, you’ll know which directories to focus on, which may need to be updated, and which delivers the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cheapest leads</a>. And if one directory seems to generate lots of reviews, it may lead you to spend on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/pay-per-click-advertising">paid ads</a> there.</p>
<h2>Get cited, found, and reviewed with listing management tools</h2>
<p>Online directories have helped millions of people <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-get-leads-for-any-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connect with local businesses</a> like yours. The challenge for you is figuring out how to keep up with all of the places your business can be found (and all the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/insurance-leads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leads</a> you&#8217;ll get).</p>

<h2><strong>What are doctor review sites?</strong></h2>
<p>Healthcare and doctor review sites are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/01/business-directory-listings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online business directories</a> that list your business information and reviews to make it easy for patients seeking a new provider. When you <a href="https://localiq.com/industries/healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market your healthcare business</a> on doctor review sites, you can highlight key information like your:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/08/business-name-ideas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business name</a> and address</li>

<li>And more</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, healthcare listings and review sites can relay information from your website, highlight feedback from patients, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/17/increase-online-presence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase your business’s online presence</a>.</p>
<div id="why"></div>
<h2><strong>Why doctor review sites matter for your healthcare business </strong></h2>
<p>When a potential patient finds your healthcare business on a doctor review site, they can get a complete picture of what your practice has to offer.</p>
<p>Plus, listing your business on these directories helps your practice <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/16/get-more-google-reviews">get more reviews</a>—which is crucial to the success of any healthcare business. Most people prefer to find their next healthcare provider through doctor review sites. In fact, <a href="https://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/how-patients-use-online-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">71%</a> of patients use online reviews as the first step to finding a doctor.</p>
<p>Consider these two additional stats on why listing your healthcare business on doctor review sites is so important:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/03/27/online-reviews-impact-purchasing-decisions-over-93-consumers-report-suggests" target="_blank" rel="noopener">93%</a> of people are influenced by information found on <a href="https://localiq.com/products/listings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business directory listings</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/how-patients-use-online-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90%</a> of patients use healthcare listing sites to evaluate physicians.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly, listing your healthcare business on doctor review sites and directories isn’t a “nice to have” tactic, it’s a “need to have!”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/doctor-review-sites-stat-influenced-by-listings-sites.jpg" alt="doctor review sites - stat callout on number of people influenced by doctor review sites" width="936" height="353" class="aligncenter wp-image-72728 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/doctor-review-sites-stat-influenced-by-listings-sites.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/doctor-review-sites-stat-influenced-by-listings-sites-480x181.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>

<h2><strong>14 doctor review sites for healthcare businesses</strong></h2>
<p>Now you understand why healthcare listings and doctor review sites are so important. But which sites should you focus on? Here are the top doctor review sites for your healthcare business.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Vitals</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.vitals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vitals</a> specializes in <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/best-free-business-listing-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business listings</a> for popular practices like dentistry, OB-GYN, primary care, dermatology, psychiatrists, and optometry. It provides multiple ways for users to find your healthcare business since it supplies suggestions and searches by city, condition, specialty, procedure, or physician name.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/doctor-review-sites-vital.jpg" alt="doctor review sites - vitals home page screenshot" width="900" height="490" class="aligncenter wp-image-72730 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/doctor-review-sites-vital.jpg 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/doctor-review-sites-vital-480x261.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Vitals also makes it easy to claim your healthcare business’s profile with one simple form:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/doctor-review-sites-physician-profile.jpg" alt="doctor review sites - physician profile builder on vital example" width="483" height="638" class="aligncenter wp-image-72741 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/doctor-review-sites-physician-profile.jpg 483w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/doctor-review-sites-physician-profile-480x634.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 483px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3><strong>2. Healthgrades</strong></h3>

<h2><strong>4 ways to optimize your doctor review sites</strong></h2>
<p>Use these tips to optimize your healthcare business’s listings on all the doctor review sites we shared above:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Regularly check your listings for accuracy</strong></h3>
<p>Did you know that <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/reputation-management/10-online-reputation-stats-will-blow-your-mind-infographic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50%</a> of business owners have seen incorrect information on their online listings? Not only that, but <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/best-free-business-listing-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">68%</a> of consumers would stop working with a local business if they found incorrect information in online directories.</p>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/seo-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avoid common SEO and listing mistakes</a> by regularly checking in on your doctor review site listings. To start, you could use an online tool, like the <a href="https://localiq.com/free-business-listings-grader/?cid=Web_WS_InContentTextLink_Freemium_Listings&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LocaliQ Free Business Listings Grader</a>, to check all your listings in one quick sweep.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/doctor-review-sites-localiq-listings-grader.jpg" alt="doctor review sites - localiq listings grader screenshot" width="808" height="650" class="aligncenter wp-image-72729 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/doctor-review-sites-localiq-listings-grader.jpg 808w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/doctor-review-sites-localiq-listings-grader-480x386.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 808px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3><strong>2. Ask for reviews (and respond to them)</strong></h3>
<p>The more reviews you have on your doctor review sites, the better. Of course, you can’t always ask at the end of every appointment, but you can encourage your patients to leave reviews through channels like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/01/email-marketing-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email marketing</a>, social media, and even <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/qr-code-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QR code marketing</a>.</p>
<p>Odds are, your patients will be happy to do so as patients who are asked to give feedback are up to <a href="https://www.patientpop.com/blog/ask-for-patient-reviews-in-person/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three times</a> more likely to submit an online review. We cover more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ways to ask for reviews</a> here.</p>
<p>Once your reviews start flowing in, be sure to respond to every review (both good and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-deal-with-bad-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bad reviews</a>).  <a href="https://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/how-patients-use-online-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">66%</a> of people feel it’s “very” or “moderately important” for healthcare businesses to publicly respond to online reviews (without violating HIPAA, of course). Carving out time to regularly respond to reviews can make a big difference in your online reputation.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Include a unique value proposition</strong></h3>
<p>Most doctor review sites will have an open section for you to fill out additional information about your business. Don’t be afraid to mention in your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-write-a-business-description/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business description</a> what makes your practice stand out. Including your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unique value propositions</a> can help you communicate what makes your practice unique and help you win over new patients.</p>

<h3><strong>4. Include photos when applicable</strong></h3>
<p>Speaking of capturing the attention of your audience, a picture is worth a thousand words when it comes to optimizing your doctor review site listings. Showcasing pictures of your office, your staff, or even your successful patients (with their consent), can help people put a face to your business’s name.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/doctor-review-site-photo-example.jpg" alt="doctor review site - example healthcare listing with photo" width="861" height="433" class="aligncenter wp-image-72749 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/doctor-review-site-photo-example.jpg 861w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/doctor-review-site-photo-example-480x241.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 861px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The second listing here with a headshot image stands out more than the one above it. </em></p>

<h2>What are local citations?</h2>
<p>Local citations are online mentions of your business that include your name, address, phone number, and other relevant information such as customer reviews and business hours.</p>
<p>They can come from a variety of sources, including <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/01/business-directory-listings">directory listings</a>, social media platforms, review sites, blogs, and news articles.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/local-citation-sources.jpg" alt="graphic that shows the sources for local citations" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71151" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/local-citation-sources.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/local-citation-sources-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Local citations are essential for small businesses as they can significantly improve <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local SEO</a>.</p>
<p>Search engines like Google and Bing use local citations to verify the accuracy of your business information and to determine the relevance and authority of your business in relation to the local community.</p>
<p>The more citations your business has, the more likely it is to appear at the top of local search results, which ultimately helps <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drive more traffic to your website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Local citations can be grouped into three main categories:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Local listings</li>
<li>Data aggregators</li>
<li>Industry-specific/niche sites</li>
</ol>
<p>Local listings are directories and websites that focus on a particular geographic area, such as Yelp, Yellow Pages, and <a href="https://www.google.com/business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Business Profile</a>.</p>
<p>Data aggregator networks, such as<a href="https://www.home.neustar/lp/localeze/index-a.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Neustar Localeze</a> and<a href="https://www.data-axle.com/what-we-do/local-listings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Data Axle</a>, for a small fee, distribute your business information to a network of other sites and directories. <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/citation-builder/local-data-aggregators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrightLocal</a> offers a service that submits to five major data aggregator networks, making this painless.</p>
<p>Finally, industry-specific or niche sites are sites that publish listings that are directly relevant to businesses in a specific industry, such as Zillow for real estate agents or Avvo for lawyers.</p>
<div id="benefits"></div>
<h2>Why is local citation building important?</h2>
<p>Here are a few reasons building local citations is so important for businesses.</p>
<h3>Helps with SEO</h3>
<p>Citations play a crucial role in local <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/05/seo-trends">SEO</a> by communicating to search engines the legitimacy and prominence of your business in your area.</p>
<p>For example, anyone could claim that they&#8217;ve been in business doing lawn care in a certain city for multiple years, but without proof, why should they be believed?</p>
<p>By adding citations across the internet in the forms of listings and reviews, it convinces Google that you&#8217;re worthy of them ranking highly when someone in that area searches for their lawn care needs.</p>
<p>Consistent and accurate information about your business across multiple sources establishes trust and credibility, improving your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/09/google-ranking-factors">search engine rankings</a> and visibility in the search that will drive traffic to your website.</p>
<p>According to one study, citation signals account for <a href="https://whitespark.ca/local-search-ranking-factors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7%</a> of local search ranking factors.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-local-search-ranking-factors.jpg" alt="chart from whitespark showing 2023 local search ranking factors for organic and map pacl results" width="936" height="515" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71138" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-local-search-ranking-factors.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-local-search-ranking-factors-480x264.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://whitespark.ca/local-search-ranking-factors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Therefore, small businesses that want to show up in local search results and attract more customers must ensure they have accurate and consistent citations. It&#8217;s worth the effort.</p>
<h3>Build trust with prospective customers</h3>
<p>Accurate and consistent citations can also help build trust with potential customers, increase your credibility, and establish your business as an authority in your industry.</p>
<p>People trust reviews as much as they trust personal recommendations. So by <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-reputation-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monitoring your review sites</a> and encouraging existing customers to leave you feedback on these sites, you can sway potential customers to try your business.</p>
<h3>Increase visibility for your business</h3>
<p>Building local citations can also help you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/17/website-visibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase visibility</a> for your business, not only by improving your SEO, but also by getting your business listed and displayed on more sites and in more locations online.</p>
<p>For example, by building local citations for your business on directory listings, you can attract customers who use those sites, apps, and maps to discover new businesses. Similarly, if you built local citations on community news sites, you can reach more customers who are using those sites as a resource for finding new businesses.</p>
<p>By identifying the right local citations for your business, you can increase your chances of getting found in more places online by your potential customers.</p>

<div id="types"></div>
<h2>Types of local SEO citations</h2>
<p>Local citations can be classified into two main categories: <strong>structured</strong> and <strong>unstructured</strong> citations.</p>
<p><strong>Both types of citations can help improve your local search rankings, but they differ in terms of their format and where they appear online.</strong></p>
<h3>Structured citations</h3>
<p>Structured citations follow a specific format and are found on websites like local directories and review sites. They include information like your business name, address, phone number, and website URL. These citations are often referred to as NAP citations<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/08/citations-for-local-seo"> because they include your name, address, and phone number</a>.</p>
<p>Examples of structured citations include Google My Business, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/07/22/yelp-reviews">Yelp</a>, and Yellow Pages.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/local-citations-google-business-profile.jpg" alt="an example of a google business profile for a coffee shop" width="378" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71136" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/local-citations-google-business-profile.jpg 378w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/local-citations-google-business-profile-189x300.jpg 189w" sizes="(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px" /></p>
<p>Structured citations offer a consistent format for your business information, which in turn help improve your local search rankings. They also provide valuable <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/10/link-building-secrets">backlinks</a> to your website, an<a href="https://www.meetsoci.com/resources/knowledge/search/why-backlinks-are-an-important-part-of-local-seo"> important local SEO ranking signal.</a></p>
<p>However, they can be time-consuming to create and may require payment for a premium listing on some directories.</p>
<h3>Unstructured citations</h3>
<p>Unstructured citations, on the other hand, are mentions of your business that <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/ranking-visibility-unstructured">don&#8217;t follow a specific format</a> and can appear on a variety of websites, such as blogs, news articles, and social media platforms.</p>
<p>Examples of unstructured citations include mentions of your business on social media platforms like Twitter or Instagram, blog posts, and news articles.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/indystar-local-restaurant-feature-local-citations.jpg" alt="local citation from article in indystar about restaurant opening" width="721" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71137" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/indystar-local-restaurant-feature-local-citations.jpg 721w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/indystar-local-restaurant-feature-local-citations-480x399.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 721px, 100vw" /></p>

<p>Unstructured citations are more flexible than structured citations and can also help improve your local search rankings.</p>
<p>However, they may not always include all of your business information, and they can be more difficult to track, implement, and monitor.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the risk that an unstructured citation might get your information wrong, creating a headache for your prospective customers trying to get in touch with you.</p>
<p>In the next section, we&#8217;ll explore actionable tips for building local citations that can help improve your online visibility and attract more customers to your business.</p>

</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/google-business-profile-example-dentist-boston.jpg" alt="example of an optimized google business profile from a dentist in boston" width="920" height="492" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71139" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/google-business-profile-example-dentist-boston.jpg 920w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/google-business-profile-example-dentist-boston-480x257.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 920px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An example of an optimized Google Business listing</em></p>
<p>By claiming and optimizing your Google Business listing, you can improve your visibility in local search results, attract more customers to your business, and enhance your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/06/online-reputation-management">online reputation</a> dramatically.</p>
<h3>2. Use local directories and niche sites</h3>
<p>As mentioned previously, adding your small business to local directories and niche sites is a smart strategy for boosting your online presence and gaining more visibility in local search results.</p>
<p>Local citations are key to search engine algorithms that determine which businesses to display to users when they search for products or services online. By listing your business in these directories, you increase the likelihood of being ranked highly by Google, and thus, found by potential customers.</p>
<p>Here are some prominent local directories and niche sites that you can utilize to build local citations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.yelp.com/businesses/how-to-add-a-business-to-yelp/">Yelp</a></li>
<li><a href="https://marketing.yellowpages.com/en/?from=advertise-with-us-YP">Yellow Pages</a></li>
<li><a href="https://pro.angi.com/">Angi</a> (formerly Angie’s List)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/CreateListing.html">TripAdvisor</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The most important thing when creating your listings on these directories is to ensure that your business information is accurate, up-to-date, and consistent, including your business name, address, phone number, website URL, and operating hours.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/local-citations-yelp-listings.jpg" alt="two yelp listings with filled in information" width="743" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71140" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/local-citations-yelp-listings.jpg 743w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/local-citations-yelp-listings-480x388.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 743px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you change your phone number later down the line, be sure to update it across all of your citations as well. Consistency is crucial to avoid any confusion for both your customers and search engines alike.</p>
<p>If Google detects different ways to find you, they might decide to not display you at all to prevent a bad experience for their users.</p>
<p>In addition to the well-known directories mentioned, there may be industry-specific directories that cater to your business&#8217;s particular niche or geographic area.</p>
<p>These sites may have a more targeted audience and can be particularly useful for small businesses with a niche market or service. For example, healthcare businesses will want to be listed on sites like HealthGrades, Vitals, RateMDs, and more.</p>
<p>A few minutes of online search should reveal a few ideas for sites that you could use to build your local citations. You can use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/06/listings-management-tools">listings management tools</a> to help with this.</p>
<h3>3. Utilize data aggregators</h3>
<p>Data aggregators are websites that collect and distribute business information to various directories and search engines on your behalf.</p>
<p>This centralizes business data and makes it easier for search engines to display accurate information about your business, which can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/07/12/get-more-customers">attract more customers</a> and improve your online visibility.</p>
<p>According to HubSpot,<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/local-seo"> the most popular data aggregators</a> for local businesses to submit their information to for local SEO in 2023 are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://local-listings.data-axle.com/search">Data Axle</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.neustarlocaleze.biz/directory/us/">Neustar Localeze</a></li>
<li><a href="http://business.foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.localvisibilitysystem.com/2013/09/24/how-to-add-your-business-to-factual/">Factual</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that there are plenty of other data aggregators out there. Some may require payment to list your business, while others offer free listings. It&#8217;s important to research each option and choose the ones that fit your budget and business goals.</p>
<h3>4. Monitor and update your local citations</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s not enough to simply through your citations up and call it a day. It is essential to monitor and update your citations regularly once they exist.</p>
<p>Inconsistent or inaccurate citations can not only create a bad user experience but harm your local search rankings as well.</p>
<p>To help you keep your citations up-to-date, consider using a citation tracking tool.</p>
<p>There are many tools available, such as<a href="https://moz.com/blog/local-seo-tools"> Moz Local</a>,<a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/local-seo-tools/auditing/citation-tracker/"> BrightLocal</a>, and<a href="https://whitespark.ca/"> Whitespark</a> that can help you monitor your citations across different directories and sites and fix errors promptly. You can also use the <a href="https://localiq.com/free-business-listings-grader/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium">LocaliQ Business Listings Grader</a> to see how your listings look online and where you need to make updates.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/localiq-listings-grader-results.jpg" alt="localiq listings grader report for local business" width="840" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71142" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/localiq-listings-grader-results.jpg 840w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/localiq-listings-grader-results-480x343.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 840px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This will help ensure that your business information is consistent and accurate across all directories and sites.</p>
<h3>5. Encourage customers to leave reviews</h3>
<p>Improving your local search rankings can be done by encouraging customers to leave reviews.</p>
<p>Positive reviews are a crucial factor in local search algorithms, and businesses with more of them typically <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google">rank higher in search results</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some tips to help you encourage your customers to leave reviews:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make it easy. </strong>Include links to your business profiles on review sites like Google, Yelp, and Facebook in follow-up emails, on your website, and in your social media profiles.</li>
<li><strong>Ask for it.</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">Ask your customers for reviews</a> in person, on social media, or via email to leave a review. Show them that you value their feedback and appreciate their support.</li>
<li><strong>Respond to reviews. </strong><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-respond-to-negative-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Respond to all reviews</a>, both positive and negative. Thank customers for their feedback and address any issues or concerns they may have raised. This shows that you are engaged with your customers and committed to providing excellent service.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/local-citations-ask-for-reviews-social-media.jpg" alt="example of social media post on instagram request reviews" width="658" height="445" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71143" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/local-citations-ask-for-reviews-social-media.jpg 658w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/local-citations-ask-for-reviews-social-media-480x325.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 658px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Remember, it&#8217;s important to follow review site guidelines and avoid any practices that may be seen as fake or manipulative, such as paying for reviews or writing your own.</p>
<p>Encouraging customer reviews can be a powerful way to boost your local search rankings and ultimately drive more traffic to your website.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today&#8217;s digital landscape, having a robust online presence is essential for businesses of all sizes, but especially those in the local service industry. With more people relying on search engines to find what they are looking for, businesses that are easily found online and have a solid online reputation will have a major advantage over their competitors.</p>
<p>So in this post, I’m going to show you how you can improve the local online presence of your service-based business using two fundamental marketing strategies: SEO and PPC</p>
<h2>The 9 best ways for local service businesses to get found online</h2>
<p>As a digital marketing instructor and consultatnt, I have had the privilege of not only teaching my students about the importance of combining search engine optimization (SEO) and pay-per-click (PPC) advertising for businesses, but also experiencing the positive impact of this combination firsthand. Here’s how to leverage these two strategies to drive traffic, generate leads, and maximize a limited budget.</p>
<h3>1. Pick the right company and domain name</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/23/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name">Naming your business</a> should be a thoughtful process. You want something that reflects your brand personality and is not easily copyable.</p>
<p>As a local business, it can be extra helpful to pick something that aligns with your target audience’s search intent, but don’t force it. I once came across a dentist that named itself &#8220;Dentist Near Me&#8221; and secured the domain dentistnearme.com. Taking this approach to an extreme certainly has its SEO benefits but it may not always be the best idea as others may follow suit and adopt similar names, potentially rendering the strategy ineffective.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/dentist-near-me.jpeg" alt="dentist named &quot;dentist near me&quot;" width="720" height="513" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70789" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/dentist-near-me.jpeg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/dentist-near-me-480x342.jpeg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6889968707662077952/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>A helpful tactic is to include your city, town, or service area name in your business name but it isn’t essential.</p>
<h3>2. Get your listings in order</h3>
<p>Having an up-to-date <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-business-profile-updates-for-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Business Profile</a> is also a great way to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/17/increase-online-presence">improve your local business&#8217;s online presence</a>. Regularly update your business information, add photos, and create posts with deals and helpful articles to build trust and credibility with potential customers. You should follow suit for the rest of your online listings as well to increase your chances of <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-home-service-businesses-can-show-up-for-local-google-searches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranking in local searches</a>. You can use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/06/listings-management-tools">listings management tools</a> to simplify this.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/directory-listings-logos.png" alt="directory listing logos" width="720" height="245" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70649" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/directory-listings-logos.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/directory-listings-logos-480x163.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>

<p><span></div></div></span></p>
<h3>3. Target keywords with blog posts</h3>
<p>Publish keyword-rich blog posts that answer common questions from potential customers—not just about your business specifically but about things related to the products and services you provide.</p>
<p>This will not only improve your website&#8217;s search engine ranking, but it will also build trust and credibility with potential customers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-2023-on-page-seo.png" alt="seo trends 2023 - on page seo checklist" width="720" height="472" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-69436" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-2023-on-page-seo.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-2023-on-page-seo-480x315.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You can use our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/05/blog-post-templates">SEO-optimized blog post templates</a> to get started!</p>
<h3>4. Put your highest value CTA at the top right of your homepage</h3>
<p>Make sure your website is user-friendly and provides a great user experience. We have plenty of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/14/website-examples">website examples you can browse through here</a>. Implement prominent call-to-action buttons, such as a clickable a phone number in the top right-hand corner and footer, and a large contact form in the footer. These buttons are easily accessible, intuitive, and make it simple for customers to get in touch with you, book a lesson, start a free trial, etc.</p>
<p>Your highest value CTA should go in that right-hand section.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/healthcare-website-design-examples-synergy.png" alt="healthcare website design examples - synergy private practice" width="720" height="370" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-68820" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/healthcare-website-design-examples-synergy.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/healthcare-website-design-examples-synergy-480x247.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>5. Track your SEO performance</h3>
<p>In addition to reporting on your PPC performance, you should also keep track of your organic/SEO performance. Use Google Tag Manager and GA4 to analyze SEO metrics and customer behavior against your goals, as well as Google Search Console. You can also use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/18/how-to-use-google-data-studio">Google Looker Studio</a> (formerly Google Data Studio) to monitor organic performance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/google-data-looker-studio-traffic-sources.png" alt="google data/looker studio - traffic source report" width="720" height="173" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-66867" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/google-data-looker-studio-traffic-sources.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/google-data-looker-studio-traffic-sources-480x115.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>6. Reduce your PPC spend with location targeting</h3>
<p>This is a key<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/home-services-marketing-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> home service business marketing tip</a>. One challenge many <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/19/google-ads-for-small-businesses">small businesses face with advertising</a> is a limited budget. One client I worked with had only $10 a day to spend. To overcome this challenge, I used <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/07/google-ads-geotargeting">location targeting</a> to reach a 5km radius around the business’s location. This approach helped them <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/21/how-to-save-money-google-ads">save their advertising budget</a> while also reaching the right audience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/save-money-google-ads-location-settings.png" alt="how to save money in google ads - location targeting options" width="720" height="489" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57568" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/save-money-google-ads-location-settings.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/save-money-google-ads-location-settings-480x326.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>7. Bid on commercial intent keywords</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/21/how-to-run-google-ads">When running Google Ads</a>, you have to tell Google which keyword(s) you’re bidding on. While there are tons of keywords relevant to your business, the ones to bid on with your PPC campaigns should have high <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/30/commercial-intent-keywords">commercial intent</a>.</p>
<p>Do extensive keyword research to identify the keywords that potential customers would be searching for when looking for what you have to offer. Informational intent keywords should be used for SEO. For PPC, use commercial or transactional intent so that your ads won’t just <em>appear</em> for those searches, but so that they’ll get <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/14/improve-google-ads-click-through-rate"><em>clicked on</em></a> by people, and those most likely to convert.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/keyword-intent-four-types.png" alt="the four types of keyword intent" width="720" height="441" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61610" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/keyword-intent-four-types.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/keyword-intent-four-types-480x294.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>8. Maintain a negative keyword list</h3>
<p>In addition to targeting high commercial intent keywords, be sure to use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/06/negative-keyword-guide">negative keywords</a>—which are keywords that you do not want your ad to appear for. This will prevent your ads from showing up for and getting clicked on by people for whom your product or service is not a good fit.</p>
<p>In my view, even with broad match, this is especially important when your daily budget is low.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-ads-negative-keywords.png" alt="google ads - add as negative keyword" width="545" height="244" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58391" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-ads-negative-keywords.png 545w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-ads-negative-keywords-480x215.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 545px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>9. Set up conversion tracking</h3>
<p>Another important aspect of running a Google Ads campaign is measuring your success with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/30/google-ads-conversion-tracking">conversion tracking</a>. With this visibility, you can harness the campaigns, offers, settings, and strategies that are working and eliminate what’s not and improve your ROAS (Return On Ad Spend).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/conversion-tracking-mistakes-conversion-value.png" alt="google ads conversion tracking - conversion value" width="720" height="204" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70054" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/conversion-tracking-mistakes-conversion-value.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/conversion-tracking-mistakes-conversion-value-480x136.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>Unless you’ve been living under a rock these past thirty or so years, you’ve likely witnessed an incredible evolution in our use cases for technology in day-to-day life. There’s been a clear switch from landlines to wireless devices, printing out MapQuest directions to using a GPS, and from flipping through a phone book to doing a quick search.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/directory-listings-meme.png" alt="directory listings - meme about using mapquest" width="275" height="312" class="aligncenter wp-image-70608 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/directory-listings-meme.png 275w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/directory-listings-meme-264x300.png 264w" sizes="(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px" /></p>

<p><span>It’s no secret at this point that your business needs to be easily found online, and one of the best ways to do that is through directory listings. What are directory listings? We’re so glad you asked! In this post, we’re walking through:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span> Why directory listings are so important for getting found online.</span></li>
<li><span> The best directory listings for your business.</span></li>
<li><span>Quick tips you need to make your directory listings stand out.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Put your phone book down, unplug your landline, and let’s get to it! </span></p>
<h2><span>What are directory listings?</span></h2>
<p><span>Directories are like virtual Yellow Pages for businesses, but with even more information so that users seeking out products and services can easily find exactly what they&#8217;re looking for and make a decision as to the best provider for them.</span></p>
<p>Directory listings vary from platform to platform, but they may contain any of the following information about businesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li>Phone number</li>
<li>Website</li>
<li>Photos</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">Customer reviews</a></li>
<li>Posts</li>
<li>Special amenities</li>
<li>Menus</li>
<li>Booking/reservation options</li>
<li>More</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;ll be covering a full list of the best directory listings later in this post, but some examples of business directories include Google, Facebook, Waze, Foursquare, Apple Maps, and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/directory-listings-logos.png" alt="directory listing logos" width="720" height="245" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70649" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/directory-listings-logos.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/directory-listings-logos-480x163.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3><span>Why your business needs directory listings</span></h3>
<p><span>Odds are, your customers are part of the<a href="https://datareportal.com/global-digital-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 5.61 billion</a> people who use the internet. Your business needs online directory listings so you can be there when people are looking for your brand. </span></p>
<p><span>While that might feel like a given, here are a few more reasons why directory listings are so important for businesses:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><span><a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/12-local-seo-stats-every-business-owner-and-marketer-should-know-in-2019-i/549079/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">46%</a> of all searches on Google are local, <a href="https://seoexpertbrad.com/local-seo-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">88% </a>of which are looking to call or visit a business within 24 hours.

Directory listings help your business <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secure more online reviews.</a></span></li>

<h2><span>The best business directory listings</span></h2>
<p><span>There are likely a few directory listings you’re already familiar with, like Google Business Profile or Yelp. But there are tons of other more specific directories out there that will help your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/niche-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">niche market </a>find you. Let’s go through the top business directories you may want to consider: </span></p>
<h3><span>1. Google Business Profile</span></h3>

<h3><span>Include top keywords in your descriptions</span></h3>
<p><span>One of the main indicators directories look at when determining to show your listing is how well your content matches to the user&#8217;s search. Including core <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/06/on-page-seo#:~:text=of%20this%20post!-,1.%20Keyword%20research,-First%20and%20foremost">SEO keywords</a> is a must-have throughout your directory listings to ensure you show to the right audience. </span></p>

<h3><span>Always use high-quality photos when possible</span></h3>
<p><span>Many of the directory listings we walked through today provide the opportunity for you to add photos to your business’s profile. This can help catch your audience’s eye and stand out from the competition. </span></p>
<p><span>Like the saying goes, “a picture is worth a thousand words,” photos on your directory listing can convey concepts your text content can’t. For example, high-quality images can help your customers know what your storefront looks so they can easily find you in real life.</span></p>
