<h2 id="Share-a-persona-based-quiz-to-generate-leads-across-industries">8 lead generation ideas (with examples!) from marketing pros</h2>
<p>Our expert sources came through big time with an eclectic mix of lead gen examples. From quirky quizzes to creative comics, there&#8217;s an idea here for every type of business.</p>
<h3>1. Share a persona-based quiz to generate leads across industries</h3>
<p>The absolute best <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/15/lead-magnet-ideas">lead magnets</a> are hyper-relevant to the people you want to convert. But how do you make that happen when you sell a product that works for several industries?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wren-noble/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wren Noble</a>, Content Marketing Lead at <a href="http://glideapps.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glide</a>, says they focused on a personality trait their ideal customers share.</p>
<p>“When we realized what set the Glide customer apart was their eagerness to innovate, we came up with a creative way to connect with them and learn more about what they value,” she says.</p>
<p>Glide’s no-code software helps businesses create apps. And what Glide’s customers value is innovation.</p>
<p>So Wren and the team built the <a href="https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/1lUyCxkzRvCxGOM6JT8E5zz?domain=glideapps.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Innovator Quiz</a>.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-glide-quiz-1.webp" alt="Lead generation examples - Glide's Innovator Quiz" width="722" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-81419 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-glide-quiz-1.webp 722w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-glide-quiz-1-480x399.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 722px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://innovators-quiz.glide.page/dl/d0a5f4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>After answering a few questions, the quiz assigns you one of four innovation styles: builder, strategist, optimizer, or scientist. It also points out some characteristics of each style.</p>
<p>The brilliance of this campaign is that it generates leads <em>and</em> drives new traffic through social networks. It really took off on LinkedIn, where people eagerly shared and commented on their results.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-glide-linkedin.webp" alt="Lead generation examples - LinkedIn post about Glide's Innovator Quiz" width="525" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-81418 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-glide-linkedin.webp 525w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-glide-linkedin-480x549.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 525px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reaserios_im-an-optimizer-my-innovation-is-efficient-activity-7161383616533450753-b9gK?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>That got more people curious to find their innovation style. “The quiz started so many engaged conversations and helped us understand what our leads get truly excited about,” Wren says.</p>
<p>You can adapt this <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/lead-generation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lead generation idea</a> for any business and any audience. It doesn’t require a huge budget—just a strong understanding of your target customers and a good <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-distribution">distribution strategy</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Lead generation pages need a compelling call to action.

<div id="Exchange-a-custom-report-for-contact-details"></div>
<h3>2. Exchange a custom report for contact details</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/varun-penamatsa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Varun Penamasta</a>, Digital Marketing Manager at <a href="http://freshpaint.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freshpaint</a>, successful lead generation does not require complex calculus. You just need to solve a problem for your target customer.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had a ton of lead gen success by centering on real value for our audience. In exchange for their info, we offer something our audience will use in their jobs,” he says.</p>
<p>Varun pointed to Freshpaint’s <a href="https://info.freshpaint.io/custom-web-tracker-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web Tracker Report</a> as an <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/lead-generation-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">example of a winning lead generation strategy</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-Freshpaint-report-1.webp" alt="Lead generation examples - Freshpaint's report tracker." width="691" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-81420 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-Freshpaint-report-1.webp 691w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-Freshpaint-report-1-480x417.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 691px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://info.freshpaint.io/custom-web-tracker-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Freshpaint’s customers are <a href="https://localiq.com/industries/healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthcare</a> organizations. They follow strict HIPAA rules about the data they collect and store from website visitors. The people who use the Web Tracker Report get a one-time audit of all the tracking snippets capturing data on each page of their website.</p>
<p>The genius here is that the Web Tracker is also a Freshpaint product. So, leads who get a report can also see the product in action.</p>
<p>“We use these site scans as a lead generation anchor because we know they provide a ton of value to healthcare teams. We also introduce Freshpaint as a value-add,” says Varun.</p>
<p>How can you adapt this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-generation-strategies">lead gen strategy</a> for your business? You could provide a sample or free trial in exchange for an email address. Or let leads use your product to solve one specific problem, with the promise that it can solve more once they sign up.</p>

<h3>3. Create unexpected and on-brand content to build trust</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/12/28/content-marketing-advice">Content marketing</a> is a proven lead-generation strategy. It builds trust so your new lead doesn’t hesitate to register or subscribe.</p>
<p>That’s easier said than done, especially if your audience distrusts overt marketing efforts. You need to get creative with content that stands out and resonates with your core audience.</p>
<p>We love this example from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elaine-atwell-a1b87710b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elaine Atwell</a>, Content Manager at <a href="https://www.kolide.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kolide by 1Password</a>. Elaine produces a series of industry-related comics to connect with her skeptical audience of IT managers. She publishes them on LinkedIn, along with a link to the newsletter signup page.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-kolide-comic-1.webp" alt="Lead generation examples - Kolide's comic" width="936" height="455" class="aligncenter wp-image-81421 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-kolide-comic-1.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-kolide-comic-1-480x233.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kolide-inc_attention-mac-and-windows-userswere-about-activity-7161385355529646080--INe?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>While the comics aren’t a lead magnet, Elaine says they’ve helped increase newsletter subscriptions by 1000% over the last year.</p>
<p>“People in our industry are very selective about which newsletters they subscribe to. But they really appreciate an opinionated, humorous tone. The comics set the stage for what subscribers will get in the newsletter.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-Kolide-sub-page-1.webp" alt="Lead generation examples - Kolides subscribe page." width="768" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-81422 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-Kolide-sub-page-1.webp 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-Kolide-sub-page-1-480x375.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 768px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://lp.kolide.co/kolidescope" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>By the time readers get to the signup page, they know they’ll get interesting content that speaks their language, so subscribing is a no-brainer.</p>
<p>Elain’s content-first <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/01/content-marketing-funnel">marketing funnel</a> brings in leads because the team knows its audience well. They spend time roaming Reddit and talking to the sales team. This strategy can work for your business, too. Start by following your customers on <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/linkedin-banner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media</a>, interacting with them in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/19/brand-community">online communities</a>, and listening to how they interact on sales calls.</p>
<div id="Build-a-free-tool-your-ideal-prospect-can’t-resist"></div>
<h3>4. Build a free tool your ideal prospect can&#8217;t resist</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/wordstream-graders?camplink=mainnavbar&amp;campname=freetools">free tool</a> is a lead generation goldmine. Create it once, and it will sit on your site, passively attracting new customers for years. When you add <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/04/internal-linking">internal links</a> to your free tool in content and promote it on social media, the leads really get flowing.</p>
<p>What’s extra cool about a free tool is that it can also qualify <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/linkedin-ads-bidding">leads</a> for you. The people who use it are most likely your target customers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ajdinperco.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ajdin Perco</a>, Head of Content at <a href="https://www.animalz.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Animalz</a>, told us how they created <a href="https://revive.animalz.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revive</a> to get leads from their audience of marketers. Revive uses Google Analytics data to find content that’s losing traffic on your blog. With that list in hand, you can refresh the posts so they rank higher on search engines and get more visits.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-Animalz-revive-1.webp" alt="Lead generation examples - The Revive free tool." width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-81423 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-Animalz-revive-1.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-Animalz-revive-1-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://revive.animalz.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></p>
<p>To start the process, people head to the Revive home page and enter their email address (new lead!). After giving access to their Google Analytics, they’ll get a list of posts ripe for refreshing.</p>
<p>Ajdin says the tool’s so successful because it solves a core pain point—lost traffic—for the people Animalz needs to convert. “I like it because it provides actionable output that users can act on. It lists articles worth refreshing, which is incredibly valuable and can lead to traffic growth.”</p>
<p>It’s no small lift to create a new tool, though. Go into it with a strong understanding of how it’ll improve your ideal customer’s life. And have a solid plan to distribute it through social media, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO</a>, and email.</p>
<div id="Use-direct-messages-to-get-new-leads-faster"></div>
<h3>5. Use direct messages to get new leads faster</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/01/09/social-media-marketing-strategies">Social media marketing</a> is a great way to connect with new prospects. However, most people have to click from the social media platform to your landing page to enter their contact details, which is not great since some of them won’t want to leave the social media site.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/larrykim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Larry Kim</a>, CEO of <a href="http://customers.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Customers.ai</a> (formerly Mobile Monkey), told us how he used Instagram Messenger automation to collect leads right from Instagram.</p>
<p>Here’s how it worked. The Mobile Monkey team created a guide showing people<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/02/how-to-get-verified-on-instagram"> how to get verified on Instagram</a>—valuable information for their target audience of brands and celebrities looking to grow their social media presence.</p>
<p>Then, they promoted the guide using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/instagram-advertising">paid Instagram campaigns</a>. Anyone who replied with “VERIFIED” got the guide in their <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-dm-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">direct messages</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-mobile-monkey-1.webp" alt="Lead generation examples - Instagram post from Mobile Monkey." width="897" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-81424 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-mobile-monkey-1.webp 897w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-mobile-monkey-1-480x321.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 897px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CR87iQzFCpq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Sliding into your customers&#8217; DMs can be creepy. But Larry and his team started the conversation by giving something useful people asked for. And since Instagram won’t let you place links on posts, they cut out a lot of lead-gen friction (no “link in bio” craziness).</p>
<p>“It just seemed like the offer of ‘how to get verified for free’ resonated with people actively working on growing their IG presence,” Larry said. “Promoting it in an IG post with a call to action to comment on it and experience Instagram Direct Message automation was a great way to onboard prospective users.”</p>
<p>Larry used <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/05/b2b-marketing-automation-tactics">marketing automation</a> to reply to requests instantly. That’s a great way to scale this strategy. Follow up with everyone who replies so you don’t waste any leads. If time is tight, consider <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-in-marketing">using AI</a> to help answer everyone faster.</p>
<div id="Create-a-compelling-guide-from-original-data"></div>
<h3>6. Create a compelling guide from original data</h3>
<p>Yeah, we know using a guide to generate leads isn’t groundbreaking. But here’s the thing: they work! We recently ran a poll asking which <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/search-advertising-benchmarks/">type of lead generation</a> offer drove the most leads. <strong>Guides and ebooks won by a long shot</strong>!</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-yoder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stephanie Yoder</a>, Director of Client Services at <a href="https://megawattcontent.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Megawatt</a>, says your guide better be good if you want someone to give up their email address. She suggests Arcadia as a business that’s writing exceptional <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/18/gated-content">gated content</a>.</p>
<p>“So many whitepapers out there are purely self-serving and, frankly, boring,” she says.“But I’m a big fan of Arcadia&#8217;s whitepapers because they connect to timely industry topics and provide actual value to potential readers.”</p>
<p>Here’s an example Stephanie said she really likes. “This paper on the solar buying experience uses original survey data to answer a real question for Arcadia’s customers. Namely, what do people want when they’re buying solar equipment?”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-Arcadia-guide-1.webp" alt="Lead generation examples - Arcadia's lead gen landing page" width="936" height="450" class="aligncenter wp-image-81425 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-Arcadia-guide-1.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-Arcadia-guide-1-480x231.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.arcadia.com/resources/solar-buying-whitepaper" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>The lead capture page asks for a little extra information, like job title and company name. These details can help when it’s time to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/13/targeted-email-marketing-strategies">segment your email audience</a>. And it’s not terribly personal information, so it shouldn’t be a big friction point.</p>
<p>As for gathering original data for a top-notch guide, you don’t have to commission a vast data study. You can interview a handful of industry leaders, run a half-dozen polls on LinkedIn, or mine your records for trends (just make sure what you show is anonymized). Then, couple that with existing stories and publicly accessible data to tell a complete and valuable story.</p>

<h3>7. Get customers to qualify themselves with a product quiz</h3>
<p>We’ve seen how quizzes can break down the silos between your customers’ industries. But <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lyndsay-cordell-2228077b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lyndsay Cordell</a>, an SEO and Content Strategist working with <a href="http://faire.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Faire.com</a>, says they’re also great at educating new leads about your products.</p>
<p>By way of example, Lyndsay showed us this <a href="https://www.willowhillsoapcompany.com/pages/what-fragrance-is-best-for-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product quiz</a> from the <a href="https://www.willowhillsoapcompany.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Willow Hill Soap Company</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-willow-hill-1.webp" alt="Lead generation examples - Willow Hill Soap Company quiz page." width="936" height="586" class="aligncenter wp-image-81426 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-willow-hill-1.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-willow-hill-1-480x301.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.willowhillsoapcompany.com/pages/what-fragrance-is-best-for-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>The quiz is only a couple of questions long. People who complete it get a recommendation for a soap scent that’ll suit them, plus a visceral description of the product.</p>
<p>Lyndsay says this tactic helps overcome the challenge of selling things people can’t fully experience from an online shop. “The quiz uses descriptive language that helps customers pinpoint their fragrance preference. It’s a creative way to showcase fragrances, especially when smell-o-vision doesn’t exist.”</p>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/lead-capture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lead capture</a> doesn’t actually take place on the quiz. Instead, quiz takers immediately see a discount popup on their results page.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-willow-hill-popup-1.webp" alt="Lead generation examples - Willow Hill popup with discount." width="652" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-81428 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-willow-hill-popup-1.webp 652w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-willow-hill-popup-1-480x442.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 652px, 100vw" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/04/interactive-content">Interactive content</a>, a valuable <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/22/popup-examples">popup</a> offer, and a personalized product recommendation are powerful lead-generation combos.</p>
<p>This is such a versatile and low-lift tactic. Consider what questions you’d ask a customer to help them pick a product. Post those in a quiz, add a popup offer, and boom! You’ve got leads.</p>

<h3>8. Invite experts to your webinars for greater reach</h3>
<p>Webinars are an easy way to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/03/repurposing-content">repurpose your best content</a>. Gather a few posts covering different aspects of the same theme and use them as webinar topics.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/susie-marino129/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Susie Marino</a>, our Senior Content Marketing Specialist, runs a monthly webinar that’s regularly one of our highest-performing lead generators. Some people learn better from video. As Susie presents the information in a fun and personal way, she’s engaging the portion of our audience that might not read a blog post.</p>
<p>Susie gets even more reach—and leads—by inviting an expert to sit in with her. For example, she recently had <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenna-zeidan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jenna Zeidan</a>, Google’s Senior Strategic Manager, join to talk about upcoming search and social media trends.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-localiq-video-1.webp" alt="Lead generation examples - Screenshot of a webinar video." width="936" height="548" class="aligncenter wp-image-81429 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-localiq-video-1.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lead-generation-examples-wordstream-localiq-video-1-480x281.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3M0BSHpWxSM" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Susie says having a guest with specific expertise gave the webinar a big boost. “Jenna was great. She answered tough questions people had about SEO and search. Having someone from Google helped us promote the webinar and get more people to sign up.”</p>
<p>But there’s another reason to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/26/partner-marketing">partner up</a> on webinars. <em>You get access to your guest&#8217;s network</em>. “When you look for someone to invite, look for people with a following,” Susie says. “You’ll get exposure with their network, so it’s like an extra promotion channel.”</p>
<p>This idea doesn’t just work for webinars. Find a business that’s complementary to yours and co-create a guide or run a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/giveaway-ideas">giveaway</a> on social media. You’ll double the exposure for the same effort.</p>
<h2>Find lead generation ideas for your business</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-lead-generation">Lead generation</a> is the top goal for most marketers, but getting people to give up their contact details is not always easy. No matter which ideas you try, remember that it&#8217;s a game of trading value. Give something your ideal customer can use, and they’ll reward you with the ability to continue the conversion.</p>

<h2>6 strategies for generating leads on LinkedIn</h2>
<p>Without further ado, let&#8217;s get into the top six tips for<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/25/optimize-linkedin-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> generating leads on LinkedIn Ads</a>!</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> For more ideas on how to generate leads for your business, download our free, definitive <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDL25LeadGenIdeas.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_LeadGenIdeas_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guide to lead generation</a> complete with 25 ideas, plus tips and examples!</p>
<div id="how-to-generate-leads-on-linkedin"></div>
<h3><span>1. Reset your expectations</span></h3>
<p><span>This is the first thing I address with any new client who <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/05/linkedin-advertising" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advertises on LinkedIn</a>. Nearly every time I hear “LinkedIn didn’t work for us,&#8221; it’s because the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/05/best-call-to-action-phrases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">call to action</a> simply wasn’t a match with how the LinkedIn platform performs. </span></p>
<p><span>While other <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/26/marketing-channels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing channels</a> like search ads or<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/facebook-ad-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Facebook Ads</a> may convert bottom-of-funnel users, LinkedIn rarely does. Demo requests and sales pitches don’t typically work on LinkedIn unless the audience is a highly engaged segment of users who have already been introduced and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ehanced-cpc-going-away">nurtured through other channels</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>On LinkedIn, your best-performing calls to action are likely going to be in the top to mid-funnel range. Think brand or product awareness and interest driving. The best offers typically are around a piece of content that talks about an industry or your company&#8217;s offerings more so than trying to get someone on the phone right away.  </span></p>
<p><span>There are lots of different calls to action that could work for these campaigns. Here’s a short list that you can get creative with:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><span>Industry report</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Infographic</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Webinar</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Cost calculator</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Sweepstakes entry</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Newsletter signup</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Event information</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>No matter what you’re trying to sell to them eventually, you’re likely going to need to offer your potential customers something much less pricey on those first touchpoints on LinkedIn to see success.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/generating-leads-on-linkedin-example-offers.jpg" alt="generating leads on linkedin - example offers to use to generate leads on linkedin" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-81124 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/generating-leads-on-linkedin-example-offers.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/generating-leads-on-linkedin-example-offers-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="generating-leads-on-linkedin-remarketing"></div>
<h3><span>2. Don’t slack on remarketing</span></h3>
<p><span>Since we’re not focusing on our button funnel calls to action, we need to make sure we nurture the users we do attract with our higher funnel campaigns. </span></p>
<p><span>The LinkedIn platform has tons of different ways you can retarget users based on how they engage with you. There are website lists, engagement audiences based on ad formats, and customer uploads you can use from your customer relationship management software (CRM) to nurture either individual users or companies for an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/10/account-based-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">account-based marketing</a> approach.</span></p>
<p><span>No matter the audience, you can likely reach them on LinkedIn Ads. </span></p>
<p><span>But on the flip side of that coin, LinkedIn is a pretty expensive ad platform, so think about ways to retarget those users elsewhere. Users who visit your website from LinkedIn are also likely to conduct searches on Google, follow their friends and family on Facebook or Instagram, and maybe even <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/how-to-get-more-views-on-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watch videos on YouTube</a>. Why not reach those highly valuable LinkedIn users on those other platforms? </span></p>
<p><span>All you need to do is create remarketing lists that are either exclusive to or include your LinkedIn visitors and you’ll be well on your way to nurturing them through the further stages of the funnel that you shouldn’t be using as your initial call to action.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2753.png" alt="❓" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Could your PPC accounts benefit from optimizations like a LinkedIn remarketing list? Find out with our free<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Google Ads Grader</a>!</p>
<div id="linkedin-lead-personas"></div>
<h3><span>3. Speak to multiple buyer personas</span></h3>
<p><span>I often hear of people having a hard time reaching their targets with LinkedIn because they can’t get everyone in a company on board with their offering. They may target the end user of their software, but they’re not able to convince their higher-ups to use it. </span></p>
<p><span>The best way to get around this is to actively target and engage with multiple personas within the target companies you’re reaching out to. If you’re selling software, you likely want to target the end user of that platform, of course. But what about that person’s boss? How would they benefit from looking into your software for their team? What about the finance department or leadership team? How could they be influenced to at least be open to making a shift for their company? </span></p>
<p><span>Find all of the stakeholders in a company that influence a decision of whether to engage with you or not, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/25/buyer-persona-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create personas</a> for each, then devise campaigns and calls to action that speak to each and help create a cohesive and compelling case for your business.  </span></p>
<div id="linkedin-lead-generation-forms"></div>
<h3><span>4. Test different lead generation forms</span></h3>
<p><span>Neither of these options is better or worse than the other, but depending on your industry and the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/target-market-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">target customers</a> you speak to, you may be doing yourself a disservice if you’re not testing your LinkedIn<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/12/how-to-generate-leads" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> lead generation</a> forms. In my experience, they work very well for users on the platform to quickly fill out a form, engage with your company, and then shift right back into their LinkedIn feed. </span></p>
<p><span>I know many companies prefer to send users to their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/08/landing-page-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">landing pages</a> for multiple reasons and those reasons shouldn’t be ignored. Some prefer it because they can provide more context to the form and better entice users to convert. Others like it to build out <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-remarketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website remarketing</a> lists. Alternatively, some businesses need to have more focused questions on their forms or have better validation on their website than what they can get from LinkedIn lead generation forms. </span></p>
<p><span>But if you’re following my first piece of advice and resetting your expectations away from bottom-of-the-funnel calls to action and focusing more on mid to top-of-funnel, LinkedIn Lead Gen forms can usually do just fine for those stages.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/generating-leads-on-linkedin-form-example.jpg" alt="generating leads on linkedin - example of linkedin ads form flow" width="731" height="430" class="aligncenter wp-image-81107 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/generating-leads-on-linkedin-form-example.jpg 731w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/generating-leads-on-linkedin-form-example-480x282.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 731px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="generating-leads-on-linkedin-ads"></div>
<h3><span>5. Get creative with ad formats</span></h3>
<p><span>Honestly, LinkedIn has some pretty cool ad formats, even outside of the Lead Gen forms I mentioned above and most people don’t seem to want to test them out. Here are just a couple of my favorites for <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-audit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generating leads</a> on LinkedIn. </span></p>
<h4><span>Document Ads</span></h4>
<p><span>With LinkedIn Document Ads, you can offer a specific document as a call to action and even offer a preview in the user feed before they download. I personally really like these for any sort of slide-formatted document as it feels like a teaser presentation before someone gets started.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/generating-leads-on-linkedin-linkedin-document-ads.jpg" alt="generating leads on linkedin - linkedin document ad example" width="595" height="512" class="aligncenter wp-image-81108 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/generating-leads-on-linkedin-linkedin-document-ads.jpg 595w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/generating-leads-on-linkedin-linkedin-document-ads-480x413.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 595px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4><span>Conversation Ads</span></h4>
<p><span>Rather than simply cold emailing someone, why not start a conversation where they can choose their responses and you can then adjust your messaging to that user based on that response? Very cool, if you ask me. </span></p>
<p><span>Conversation Ads are a great way to engage your users, meet them where they are in the funnel, and help qualify users so you know how to nurture them later on.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/generating-leads-on-linkedin-messenger-ads.jpg" alt="generating leads on linkedin - linkedin conversation ads" width="697" height="394" class="aligncenter wp-image-81118 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/generating-leads-on-linkedin-messenger-ads.jpg 697w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/generating-leads-on-linkedin-messenger-ads-480x271.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 697px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4><span>Text Ads</span></h4>
<p><span>So many people hate on Text Ads because the CTRs are incredibly low and they don’t drive much volume. To that I say, “who cares?” No business I’ve ever heard of has been mad at getting incremental business. Every sale counts. So why not leverage this very, very cheap ad format on one of the most expensive ad platforms to engage an audience that you know is highly relevant. Text Ads are a personal favorite of mine for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/12/linkedin-retargeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remarketing on LinkedIn</a> if you want to do so directly on the platform.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/generating-leads-on-linkedin-text-ads.jpg" alt="generating leads on linkedin - example of linkedin text ads" width="734" height="429" class="aligncenter wp-image-81120 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/generating-leads-on-linkedin-text-ads.jpg 734w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/generating-leads-on-linkedin-text-ads-480x281.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 734px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f331.png" alt="🌱" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Make a plan to grow your business on LinkedIn with our free, easy-to-use <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite7StepstoGrowthStrategy.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_GrowthStrategy_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growth strategy template</a>!</p>
<div id="generating-leads-on-linkedin-bidding"></div>
<h3><span>6. Don’t start with automated bidding</span></h3>
<p><span>While it might be the default for any new campaign, the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/19/google-ads-automated-bidding" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> automated bidding</a> option for LinkedIn Ads campaigns simply is not efficient for the vast majority of advertisers. The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/linkedin-ads-cost">costs per click</a> (CPCs) you’ll see are far higher than if you spend a little time and effort to start conservatively and then increase your competitiveness over time.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/generating-leads-on-linkedin-bidding.jpg" alt="generating leads on linkedin - linkedin bidding strategy example screenshot" width="695" height="317" class="aligncenter wp-image-81119 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/generating-leads-on-linkedin-bidding.jpg 695w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/generating-leads-on-linkedin-bidding-480x219.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 695px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>Instead, I highly encourage you to use manual bidding and start by bidding at the lowest price LinkedIn will let you bid. This ensures you’ll still reach the same users, but will see the lowest CPCs you’ll get on the platform. As you see success or if you need to drive more volume, you can slowly start to increase the bid to get more competitive. Over time, you’ll likely find a sweet spot where you’re generating the volume (and ideally performance) you want, but you’re also only paying a fraction of what you would be using the Maximum Delivery option. </span></p>
<h2><span>Generating leads on LinkedIn can be easier than you think (using these tips!)</span></h2>
<p><span>LinkedIn is an excellent ad channel to reach anything related to business. It just can’t be matched by other platforms with its targeting, but it does require you to step outside of your comfort zone and think about things from a different perspective. With its uniqueness in targeting also comes a uniqueness of best practices. Hopefully these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-marketing-tips">marketing tips</a> will help you start to rethink your strategies on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/linkedin-ads-bidding">LinkedIn Ads</a> and run <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/linkedin-ads-audit">audits</a> to start driving the results you’re looking for. And be mindful of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin">when you post organic content</a>, too.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>It&#8217;s not enough to simply generate leads. You need to generate high-quality leads, meaning leads that are ready to buy your specific products and services right now. </span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, low-quality leads come with the territory in lead generation. There will never be a campaign that generates only good quality leads while also generating enough to keep a business afloat. </span></p>
<p><span>But that doesn’t mean we can’t work to improve lead quality and try to get closer to perfect. In this article, we&#8217;ll walk through a handful of strategies that I use regularly to improve lead quality and drive revenue-generating leads.</span></p>

<h2>6 ways to increase lead quality</h2>
<p>Without further ado, here are the top six ways you can increase your business&#8217;s lead quality.</p>
<h3><span>1. Increase your number of form fields</span></h3>
<p><span>The first tactic is probably the easiest. By adding more fields to your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/22/lead-capture-form" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> lead generation forms</a>, you’re requiring the user to give you more information and to spend more time inputting that information. This will scare off people who are not serious in two ways: they won’t want to share the information because they probably don’t want to be followed up with, plus they’re most likely not willing to dedicate the time to input that information either. </span></p>
<p><span>Think about your forms as they exist now. How many form fields does a user have to fill out to submit the lead? Is it two, three, four? </span></p>
<p><span>There’s almost always room to add additional fields to gain more qualifying information. </span></p>
<p><span>The simplest set of questions could be quick additional details. Maybe you ask for someone’s job title or their company name and website. Most likely none of these are fields that anybody will fill out if they’re not serious, but they also won’t feel out of place to somebody who is a serious and qualified lead. That’s the needle you’re trying to thread when adding more form fields. They need to be relevant to accomplish the goal of improving lead quality.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/meta-ads-conditional-logic-lead-forms.jpg" alt="meta advertising - conditional logic lead form example" width="796" height="564" class="aligncenter wp-image-76161 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/meta-ads-conditional-logic-lead-forms.jpg 796w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/meta-ads-conditional-logic-lead-forms-480x340.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 796px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Adding conditional logic that applies a secondary set of form fields depending on your lead&#8217;s initial response, can help further qualify your leads. </em></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Get our free, <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDL25LeadGenIdeas.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_LeadGenIdeas_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">definitive guide to lead generation</a> to maximize your business&#8217;s lead generation strategy!</p>
<h3><span>2. Ask more difficult questions</span></h3>
<p><span>In addition to asking more questions, you can further improve lead quality by making the questions you ask slightly more difficult or invasive of the user filling out the form. </span></p>
<p><span>Just like with the time investment that we mentioned in the previous section, users who are less qualified are also less likely to share more invasive information. </span></p>
<p><span>Do you currently ask for a project timeline or budget? What about the details or scope of a project?  </span></p>
<p><span>By asking these more forward but still relevant questions in your generation form, you cannot only scare off lower-quality leads, but also help support your sales team by giving them more information when they follow up with the lead. If you’re having trouble thinking of additional fields, ask your sales team what information would be useful for them to help convert a user and add that to the form. </span></p>
<h3><span>3. Require additional steps</span></h3>
<p><span>Depending on the platform you’re using to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/lead-generation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generate leads</a>, there are a few different ways that you can require additional steps for somebody to submit a form fill.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lead-quality-additional-steps.jpg" alt="lead quality - example of an additional form step" width="772" height="381" class="aligncenter wp-image-79751 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lead-quality-additional-steps.jpg 772w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lead-quality-additional-steps-480x237.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 772px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>If you’re<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/12/how-to-generate-leads" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> generating leads on your website</a>, you can use functions like captions or form verification software that requires all of the information to be credible and for the person to prove that they are not a robot. Much of this software is much more attainable than it has been in the past and it’s relatively easy to roll out.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lead-quality-form-type.jpg" alt="lead quality - screenshot of form customization" width="787" height="353" class="aligncenter wp-image-79753 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lead-quality-form-type.jpg 787w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lead-quality-form-type-480x215.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 787px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>If you’re generating leads through lead generation forms, like on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/15/meta-ads-vs-google-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Ads</a>, you can use the higher intent form type to provide a review screen before the user submits the form. This operates almost as a “Are you sure?“ for the user before they submit. </span></p>
<p><span>In several cases that I’ve come across, bad leads are simply a function of the user not knowing they were submitting a form to a business through a Facebook or Instagram instant form. That might seem silly to some of us, but to others, they kind of blend into the user interface. By using the higher intent form type, the user can review all of the information they are sharing with you and they are also able to realize that they are sharing information with you in the first place.</span></p>
<h3><span>4. Use more focused targeting</span></h3>
<p><span>This might seem simple, but I think it bears repeating: the targeting options you use to find your users are going to greatly impact the quality of the leads that you get. </span></p>
<p><span>One of the biggest challenges I see advertisers having is the conflict between the suggested targeting from the platforms compared to who they believe their target audience is. It seems like every new announcement from Google, Facebook, or LinkedIn is promoting some new form of automated high-volume targeting. While that might be what they see internally, the data for those suggestions comes from an aggregate level of all accounts. That does not mean that this type of targeting is guaranteed to generate the highest quality leads for you. </span></p>
<p><span>Whether it’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/23/optimize-performance-max-campaigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Performance Max</a> and broad match keywords in Google Ads, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/12/06/facebook-advertising-trends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advantage+ Facebook audience targeting</a>, predictive audiences, or whatever else they come up with next, these platforms are suggesting targeting options that are going mostly for volume not for quality.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lead-quality-ad-targeting.png" alt="lead quality - advantage plus audiences " width="718" height="517" class="aligncenter wp-image-79752 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lead-quality-ad-targeting.png 718w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lead-quality-ad-targeting-480x346.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 718px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>If you’re able to guide those targeting options, either through<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/11/search-themes-for-performance-max-campaigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> search themes for Performance Max</a> or by providing example audiences for Advantage+ Audience, this is a great place to start.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lead-quality-search-themes.jpg" alt="lead quality - audience signals and search themes screenshot" width="856" height="301" class="aligncenter wp-image-79748 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lead-quality-search-themes.jpg 856w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lead-quality-search-themes-480x169.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 856px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>If those optimizations don’t work, it might mean you need to shift back to a more manual form of targeting, or simply get more specific with who you’re trying to reach. That could mean more phrase and exact match terms on search, it could mean more legacy lookalike audiences on Facebook, and it may mean reverting to good old job title targeting on LinkedIn. But at this juncture, our focus is lead quality, not quantity, and many of these targeting options simply aren’t doing us any favors.</span></p>
<h3><span>5. Turn off extended networks</span></h3>
<p><span>Extended audience networks also impact your targeting, but rather than focusing on the person themselves, we’re taking a harder look at the placement of your ads. Just like the suggested targeting above, while these extended networks are helping you see more volume, they’re very rarely going to generate the high-quality leads that we all want to see.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/improve-lead-quality-audience-segment.jpg" alt="how to improve lead quality - audience networks example" width="293" height="489" class="aligncenter wp-image-79750 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/improve-lead-quality-audience-segment.jpg 293w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/improve-lead-quality-audience-segment-180x300.jpg 180w" sizes="(max-width: 293px) 100vw, 293px" /></p>
<p><span>This includes the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/04/adwords-search-partners" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Google search partner network </a>or Microsoft ads partner network. Both of these can be great tools for extending your reach if you’re saying good performance, but they both also have a reputation for generating some pretty crap performance alongside your search campaign. I highly suggest you review the performance of these networks if you’re using them with your campaigns, which is pretty easy to do on both platforms.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lead-quality-placements.jpg" alt="improve lead quality - placements" width="923" height="272" class="aligncenter wp-image-79749 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lead-quality-placements.jpg 923w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lead-quality-placements-480x141.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 923px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>The same strategy holds true for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/05/linkedin-advertising" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn advertising</a>. If you’re using lead generation forms, you’re only going to generate leads on the LinkedIn platform. But if you’re using sponsored content in the LinkedIn newsfeed, you’re likely also targeting users on the LinkedIn Audience Network.</span></p>
<p><span>This network is opted into by default for all new campaigns, so unless you turn it off, you’re more than likely showing up here. You can review the performance of these placements with the breakdown section just like you can in the search channels. And then if you need to, you can opt out of the LinkedIn audience network by simply unchecking the box in your campaign settings.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Find out what strategies could help improve your Google Ads lead quality using our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free Google Ads Grader</a>!</p>
<h3><span>6. Create more targeted calls to action </span></h3>
<p><span>The last suggestion I have for you requires you to look inward more so than at the platforms or the audience themselves. </span></p>
<p><span>What are you currently using as your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/05/best-call-to-action-phrases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offer or call to action</a>? Is it appealing on a mass level or is it highly focused on the target audience that you’re going after?</span></p>
<p><span>A common challenge I see with my clients revolves around their offer. They generate an asset like a whitepaper or infographic on a high-level, wide-ranging topic that appeals to a large group of users. They see decent volume come in, but then are irritated when the lead quality isn’t as high as they would like it to be. </span></p>
<p><span>In these instances, the challenge isn’t with the targeting or the networks or the forms, the problem is with the assets themselves. Its focus is so broad that even somebody who is tangentially interested in the topic may fill out the form just to get the asset and learn more about something that they’re interested in. </span></p>
<p><span>Think about an<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/11/28/facebook-ads-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> industry report</a>. This is a common, high-volume asset that I have utilized with many of my clients. For something like a Gartner report, there’s likely only a handful of users who are actually in the market to make a purchase. Some are simply evaluating how their current tech stack compares to others, some are looking to competitor targets, and others may be doing a research paper for their college-level graduate class and it just so happens that productivity software is the focus so a Gartner report is really helpful.</span></p>
<p><span>Now that’s not to say that a report can’t work really well for your accounts, but if you noticed that you’re seeing lots of low-quality leads coming through with an asset, it might be time to revisit and develop calls to action that speak far more specifically to your buyer personas rather than anyone in your target market. </span></p>
<p><span>What types of questions do your buyers ask your sales team that you can develop pieces of content around? What type of challenges do your customers normally have with products that are similar to yours that your customers don’t have? How can you develop more technical or focused calls to action that are only interesting and relevant to your specific buyers and not simply people who might be interested in your overall industry?</span></p>

<div id="lead-quality-vs-quantity"></div>
<h2><span>Word of caution: reset your lead quality vs. quantity expectations</span></h2>
<p><span>No matter what, when you focus on lead quality over lead quantity, you are almost certainly going to generate a lower overall number of leads. Many of the strategies mentioned above are purposefully designed to ward off low-quality users who aren’t ready to speak to anyone. That means volume has decreased, but the percentage of the good quality to bad quality leads should be moving in the right direction. </span></p>
<p><span>Before you embark on any of these optimizations, you should discuss the potential outcomes with your marketing, leadership, and sales teams to ensure that everybody is on the same page and no one is caught by surprise with a decreased lead count. </span></p>
<p><span>I also recommend you set a floor for lead volume that you’re not willing to go below in the name of quality improvement. In every business, there’s a level where the quantity of leads is too low to support the company. If you notice that your lead volume goes down to an unsustainable level, maybe you’ve gotten too aggressive with your qualification tactics. For that, all you need to do is revert some portion of your adjustments and get the volume back to a sustainable level. </span></p>
<p><span>Over the course of these tests, the metric you should be looking to improve is the ratio of high-quality leads. Essentially, high-quality leads are divided by total leads. </span></p>
<p><span>Are you improving in quality even if volume is decreasing? Are you just decreasing the least and not improving quality? Depending on where those stats end up, that will determine your next step.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re concerned about generating more leads, you’re not alone. But if you’re focusing on increasing the quantity of your leads without considering the quality, then you’re going to end up wasting a lot of time. That’s why lead scoring is so important.</p>
<p>Implementing a lead scoring model will help you focus your time on the most likely contacts to convert, so that you can work smarter, not harder.</p>

</ul>
<p>Plus, we’ll share plenty of templates and examples throughout.</p>
<div id="What-is-lead-scoring"></div>
<h2>What is lead scoring?</h2>
<p>Lead scoring is the practice of assigning an incoming contact a numerical value based on their demographic information or behaviors relating to your brand. This value aligns with a scoring system that allows sales and marketing teams to quickly identify the lead’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/11/increase-conversion-rates">likeliness to convert</a> at this time and their place in the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/07/marketing-funnel">marketing funnel</a>.</p>
<p>Now, this might sound like it makes managing your process for reaching inbound contacts more complicated. That’s correct—but it’s for a good reason. By identifying a lead’s likelihood of converting early during an initial interaction, marketing and sales can prioritize their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/11/03/lead-nurturing">outreaches</a>.</p>
<p>That could mean marketing sends a guide to a lead that could turn into a great customer but doesn’t have the buying power in their current role. Or Sales reaches out with a phone call to a lead that needs your services, like, yesterday to offer a discount to close the deal.</p>
<p>Take a look at this <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/sales-funnel-template/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales funnel example</a> below. On the left, you’ll see actions that the marketing team takes for each stage of the funnel. On the right, you’ll see the actions from an interested lead as it grows warmer.</p>

<p>Lead scoring helps ensure that you’re responding to each incoming contact <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/lead-tracking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you&#8217;ve tracked</a> with the most impactful content or action for their needs and for your business, whatever that might be.</p>

<h2>What types of businesses can benefit from lead scoring?</h2>
<p>Lead scoring helps businesses prioritize their incoming contacts to make their marketing and sales processes as efficient and effective as possible. This can be beneficial for almost any type of company.</p>
<p>Here are some types of businesses where lead scoring can make a huge impact.</p>
<h3>B2B</h3>
<p>Sales cycles for B2B (or business-to-business) companies are often longer and require more touchpoints between your business and your potential customers. This makes it even more important to quickly identify the leads who have the most interest in becoming customers.</p>
<h3>Ecommerce</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/05/ecommerce-digital-marketing">Ecommerce</a> businesses can use lead scoring to prioritize contacts who are most likely to move forward with a purchase. This could be based on browsing behavior, purchase history, or demographic attributes. We’ll talk more about lead-scoring attributes below.</p>
<h3>Real estate agencies</h3>
<p>We’ve all been guilty of scrolling through Zillow, and some of us even submit an open house form for more information or set up alerts for houses we have no realistic interest in buying (Guilty and guilty.) <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/26/google-ads-for-real-estate">Real estate agencies</a> can set up lead scoring to avoid wasting time on recreational viewers and focus their time on real potential butter.</p>
<h3>Financial services firms<strong> </strong></h3>
<p>This industry includes insurance companies, banks, credit card companies, investment platforms, and more. Lead scoring can be helpful for evaluating which incoming contacts are qualified, whether it’s for coverage or credit, and interested in becoming a customer.</p>
<h3>Marketing agencies</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/16/grow-your-digital-marketing-agency">Marketing agencies</a> with all kinds of specialties can benefit from lead scoring, whether it’s design, websites, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO</a>, content, branding, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/pay-per-click-advertising">paid media</a>, or any combination of the above.</p>
<h3>Healthcare services</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/03/10/healthcare-marketing">Healthcare</a> providers can use lead scoring to identify the contacts who are in need of services and prioritize based on health conditions, location, engagement with content, and other factors that might impact the fit for care.</p>
<h3>Higher education institutions</h3>
<p>Colleges and universities can use lead scoring to rate applicants’ likelihood of attending if accepted and how well they match the institution’s programs.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this isn’t an exhaustive list. If your business has a flow of incoming leads that you need to prioritize responding to, then you might benefit from lead scoring. Now, let’s jump into how to set up a lead scoring system that works for you.</p>
<div id="how-to-set-up-a-lead-scoring-model-for-your-business"></div>
<h2>How to set up lead scoring models for your business</h2>
<p>A lead scoring model is the system you use to assign value to a lead based on how likely it is that they’ll make a purchase.</p>
<p>Lead scoring models are identified by the type of parameters used to assess a lead&#8217;s value. Those parameters could be about the company like its size and market. Or it could be about how many times a person has visited your website or attended webinars.</p>
<p>The most important part of building a lead scoring model is figuring out which attributes or actions are meaningful in your business.</p>
<p>Here’s how to do that and get started with lead scoring.</p>
<h3>1. Review your lead data</h3>
<p>The first step in setting up a lead scoring system that works for your business is taking a look at the data you have available to you. This data will look different depending on the complexity of your inbound marketing process.</p>
<p>Let’s say, for instance, that you’re a small, one-person <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/02/strategies-to-grow-your-digital-marketing-agency">marketing agency</a> with a focus on design and development for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/29/dentist-websites">dentist websites</a>. A specific niche, but not necessarily a small one.</p>
<p>Your best customers probably learn about you through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/26/word-of-mouth-marketing">word-of-mouth</a>, like referrals from existing customers. You also have a healthy <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/05/seo-strategy">SEO strategy</a> with blog posts and guides about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/14/website-examples">website design</a>, and you get a steady flow of incoming leads from your website. The form for your guide downloads asks for an email address, industry, and job title.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lead-scoring-wordstream-giveaway.webp" alt="Lead scoring - screenshot of a lead magnet " width="606" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-79506 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lead-scoring-wordstream-giveaway.webp 606w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lead-scoring-wordstream-giveaway-480x475.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 606px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Balance the amount of info you ask for in your </em><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/15/lead-magnet-ideas"><em>lead magnets</em></a><em>. Too little is unhelpful, too much scares people away.</em></p>
<p>That means your website <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/05/15/google-analytics-tips">analytics</a>, any referral program info, customer relationship management system (or the repository of your forms, if you don’t have a CRM) are all sources of information about your leads. That’s the parameters you’ll have available.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of the types of data you can use to create lead scoring models:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographic info: </strong>This includes job title, industry, company size, location, age, and even educational background. This might exist in your CRM, if you have one.</li>
<li><strong>Company information: </strong>Think details like total number of employees, annual revenue, budget, or in-office or distributed team. This might be in your CRM, your customer profiles, or it could be in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/01/email-marketing-tips">email</a> management system or a different tool you use to collect details from forms on your website.</li>
<li><strong>Content engagement: </strong>Look at data from your whitepapers<strong>, </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post#:~:text=Keep%20Sentences%20Short%20and%20Paragraphs%20Shorter&amp;text=It%27s%20a%20common%20mistake%20for,making%20your%20audience%27s%20job%20easier.">blog posts</a>, webinars, events to see who is engaging with your content and how often.</li>
<li><strong>Website analytics: </strong>Check time spent on your website, visits to product or service pages, repeat visitors, and goal completes.</li>
<li><strong>Lead source: </strong>This is where your inbound leads are coming from, whether it’s a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/14/referral-program-ideas">referral program</a>, paid advertising, organic search, event attendees, or other venues.</li>
<li><strong>Email engagement: </strong>Look at subscribe behavior, open rates, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/average-ctr">click-through rates</a> to consider how interested a lead is in your product or service.</li>
<li><strong>Customer feedback: </strong>This means ad hoc feedback during calls, formal survey responses, and any testimonials.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the topic of customer feedback leads us to the next step in the process of setting up a lead scoring program.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="👋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Attract more leads with these <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 ways to increase traffic to your website</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Interview your customers</h3>
<p>Reviewing all of the data is a crucial starting point. But it’s important to actually talk to your customers, too. They’ll be able to give you a fuller picture of your marketing funnel. Your customers can share candid reactions to your content, provide context to the clicks in email or on the SERP, react in the moment to your website—whatever the path might be, your customers can speak to their perception.</p>
<p>So set up some calls with your best customers, your most active users, and those clients that you just hear from the most often. Ask them <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-feedback-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feedback questions</a> to give you a better idea of the process for inbound leads and listen carefully. Then use these conversations to start looking for similarities with your other leads and patterns in your quickest, most high-value conversions.</p>
<h3>3. Align marketing and sales</h3>
<p>If you’re a solopreneur or a small business team of one, then you don’t have to worry too much about making sure everyone is involved in the lead scoring process. But if you work at even a <em>slightly </em>bigger company, with at least one person in each marketing and sales, then you need to make sure you’re having conversations with your counterparts early.</p>
<p>In general, it’s critical for marketing and sales teams to be aligned on the profile of target customers, the stages of the funnel, and the company’s customer acquisition goals. In fact, <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">87%</a> of sales and marketing leaders say collaboration between sales and marketing enables critical business growth.</p>
<p>For lead scoring, marketing and sales will need to agree on the criteria that makes a lead a strong candidate to convert. Once you have takeaways from looking at your lead data and talking with your customers, share those with your partners on the sales team to get their input. Plus, you’ll be able to get more insights from the company’s process.</p>
<p>For example, maybe that customer recalls a phone call from their rep and a discount that made them sign up—but they actually had a demo, a follow-up phone call, and the discount was the second offer.</p>
<p>That’s incredibly useful context to have as you’re putting together your metric for scoring leads.</p>
<p>While it’s important for marketing and sales to be on the same page to develop your company’s lead scoring process, it’s perhaps even more critical they remain on the same page as the practice becomes a part of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/25/optimize-lead-generation-process">lead generation</a> and revenue targets moving forward. So, include sales in the conversations early for a collaborative effort setting up your lead scoring system, and plan for regular check-ins to create a feedback loop as you’re fine-tuning.</p>
<h3>4. Choose your lead scoring model</h3>
<p>Now that you have the data in front of you, determine which attributes make the biggest difference in your conversion rates. There are tons of different attributes, but most of the ones you’ll find relevant will fall into three buckets: demographic and company information, engagement activities, and acquisition details.</p>
<h4>Demographic lead scoring model</h4>
<p>These attributes help you build a lead scoring model based on personal or company attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Gender identity</li>
<li>Job title</li>
<li>Industry</li>
<li>Company size</li>
<li>Company revenue</li>
<li>Budget</li>
</ul>
<h4>Behavioral lead scoring model</h4>
<p>While background information is key, the way your leads engage with your brand are good indicators of how interested they are in your offering. Here are some attributes you can use to build a behavioral lead scoring model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Site visits</li>
<li>Time spent on key pages</li>
<li>Whitepaper downloads</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/26/how-to-do-a-webinar">Webinar</a> or event attendance</li>
<li>Newsletter subscription</li>
<li>Email opens and clicks</li>
<li>Shopping cart activity</li>
<li>Sales calls</li>
<li>Demo requests</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/16/get-more-google-reviews">Reviews</a></li>
<li>Loyalty or referral program participation</li>
</ul>
<h4>Acquisition channel lead scoring model</h4>
<p>How someone finds your business can tell you a lot about whether they’ll be a brand fan or a paying customer. These acquisition details consider the path people take to find you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acquisition channel</li>
<li>Referral source</li>
<li>Relationship with company</li>
<li>Relationship with competitors</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn’t a complete list—but it is a great place to start to build your model and start assigning values to each attribute. This is the foundation of your lead scoring model, so it’s important to take your time here.</p>
<h3>5. Name your scoring thresholds</h3>
<p>Once you have a lead scoring framework set up, it’s time to set thresholds.</p>
<p>Lead scoring works by assigning points to certain demographic attributes or activities to come up with a numerical value for each contact. The thresholds that you set determine what your next action should be.</p>
<p>Like the attributes, these thresholds will depend largely on your business—your leads, your marketing activities, your funnel, and your sales cycles. But here are a few common terms that teams use to sort their contacts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prospect: </strong>These are your contacts who meet the basic criteria to do business with your company. It will be the lowest point threshold in your lead scoring metric.</li>
<li><strong>Lead:</strong> Your leads are your contacts who have engaged with your company, bumping them up from prospects. This will be the next highest threshold.</li>
<li><strong>Hot lead: </strong>Some companies use this to designate leads who have recently engaged in a high-value activity, like attending an event. Companies that use “hot lead” don’t use MQL or SQL.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing qualified lead (MQL): </strong>MQLs are highly engaged, active leads who have some or all of the attributes of your ideal customers. These leads may have attended webinars, clicked on links or ads on social media, or downloaded whitepapers.</li>
<li><strong>Sales qualified lead (SQL): </strong>Your SQL threshold will be your highest. These are leads that have been vetted Sales (and possibly marketing). They are ready for the next sales step.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we’re clear on terms, here’s a quick lead scoring template based on a 100-point lead score for an org that uses MQLs and SQLs:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><strong>Threshold</strong></td>
<td><strong>Attributes &amp; Activities</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Prospect</strong></td>
<td>10</td>
<td>Email signup (+10)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Lead</strong></td>
<td>30</td>
<td>Email signup (+10), Multiple site visits (+5), whitepaper download (+15)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>MQL</strong></td>
<td>50</td>
<td>Email signup (+10), Multiple site visits (+5), whitepaper download (+15), key industry job title (+20)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>SQL</strong></td>
<td>80</td>
<td>Much of the same activities as an MQL and has been vetted by Sales</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the template above, the attributes and activities build on one another as one prospect keeps engaging more with the company. But remember it doesn’t always happen like this. Sometimes a contact enters your funnel as an MQL, sometimes they enter as an engaged lead who likes your content but will never be a potential customer.</p>
<p>That’s why setting these thresholds for more action—and more investment—from you and your business is important.</p>
<h3>6. Determine your tracking method</h3>
<p>Now that you have your lead scoring system in place and your thresholds with your action plans, you need to figure out how you’re going to manage calculating and tracking the scores.</p>
<p>There are a few different common methods for managing lead scoring: manual, automated, and predictive.</p>
<h4>Manual lead scoring</h4>
<p>Exactly what it sounds like—you’re putting pen to paper (ok, dropping numbers in a spreadsheet) to calculate the score for each lead.</p>
<p>If your company has a steady <a href="https://localiq.com/resources/lead-generation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inbound lead flow</a>, this will likely be too much to manage. But if you’re a small business with a super-specific niche and a low lead flow from a few forms or emails, this might make the most sense for you. That way, you have a grasp on everyone who is interested in your product or services.</p>
<h4>Automated lead scoring</h4>
<p>Here, you’ll use a tool to calculate, assign, and track a score to your leads. If you have any significant incoming lead flow, you’ll want to figure out how to automate your scoring and tracking, including notifications when contacts reach your thresholds.</p>
<p>There are tons of options for tools here, like MadKudu or Fwrd.ai. You might not even need to look for an additional tool, though. Your CRM may offer lead scoring already. HubSpot and Salesforce both do.</p>
<h4>Predictive lead scoring</h4>
<p>Predictive lead scoring is a method of automated scoring that uses machine learning to assign a predicted value to a lead. This is hosted by a third-party tool—the examples above all offer this—that uses historical data to come up with the estimation.</p>
<p>What’s the benefit? You can prioritize contacts who are predicted to become MQLs and move them down the funnel faster. The drawback is that historical behavior isn’t always predictive of future actions, so there’s more room for error.</p>
<h3>7. Launch, monitor, and adjust as needed</h3>
<p>Once you have your lead scoring system and your method for managing it all set, it’s time to think through your plan for launching, monitoring, and adjusting over time.</p>
<p>When you’re ready to start using your lead scoring, you don’t need to get bogged down in a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/20/go-to-market-strategy">go-to-market</a> for this internal tool. But it is a good idea to update your marketing team, the sales team, and make sure key people are aware of the criteria for your most valuable leads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lead-scoring-wordstream-lead-scoring-model.webp" alt="Lead scoring - lead scoring model matrix" width="910" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-79507 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lead-scoring-wordstream-lead-scoring-model.webp 910w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lead-scoring-wordstream-lead-scoring-model-480x316.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 910px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A visual of your model like this one from </em><a href="https://blog.move-mktg.com/best-practices-to-developing-an-effective-lead-scoring-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Move Marketing</em></a><em> might be a useful tool for your team. </em></p>
<p>Make a plan to evaluate how your lead scoring system is working so that you can refine over time, too. Your lead scoring system should make your marketing more effective and your sales process more targeted. You need to make sure that’s what’s happening—especially after you’ve invested so much time and, likely, money getting started.</p>
<p>It’ll be up to you to determine the success metrics, but here are some things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/conversion-rate#:~:text=Your%20conversion%20rate%20is%20the,easily%20able%20to%20get%20it!">conversion rates</a> of the SQLs?</li>
<li>How do those compare to previous rates?</li>
<li>How do the touchpoints compare, in quality and quantity?</li>
<li>What are the conversion rates of MQLs?</li>
<li>How do those compare to SQLs?</li>
</ul>
<p>The most important thing is to figure out what success looks like, set a length of time for the test, and then follow-through on your retrospective.</p>
<h2>Start lead scoring to work smarter, not harder</h2>
<p>We covered a lot, so let’s do a quick recap.</p>
<p>Here’s how to set up lead scoring that will work for your business:</p>
<ol>
<li>Review all your lead data</li>
<li>Talk to your customers</li>
<li>Align marketing and sales</li>
<li>Identify attributes for your lead scoring</li>
<li>Determine your scoring method</li>
<li>Determine your tracking method</li>
<li>Launch, monitor, and adjust as needed</li>
</ol>
<p>This might seem like a lot of work, but remember that most—not all, but most—is upfront. And once you have your lead scoring system set up, you can focus your time, money, and attention on the contacts who are most likely to become customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It would be amazing if every person bought or booked after their first point of contact with your company. It rarely happens that way. But with a solid lead nurturing strategy, you can greatly increase the chances that a lead turns into sale.</p>
<p>After over 20 years split between sales and marketing, I’m acutely aware of the anxiety that fills the space between a lead showing interest and when they finally place an order. So let me break down what a successful lead nurturing campaign looks like and give you a few examples of them in action. Put some of these strategies in place and watch your conversion rate jump.</p>

<h2>What is lead nurturing?</h2>
<p>Lead nurturing refers to the steps you take to build a relationship with people who’ve shown interest in your product or service but aren’t ready to buy yet. Using lead nurturing strategies, you guide people through your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/07/marketing-funnel">marketing funnel</a> from initial interest to conversion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/lead-nurturing-stat-funnel.png" alt="lead nurturing - marketing funnel represented as an ice cream cone" width="688" height="830" class="aligncenter wp-image-77084 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/lead-nurturing-stat-funnel.png 688w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/lead-nurturing-stat-funnel-480x579.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 688px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Lead nurturing guides people through your sales funnel.</em></p>
<p>A lead nurturing campaign can take on many forms and use multiple channels to reach a prospective customer. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ehanced-cpc-going-away">Email</a> is the most often used, but social media, snail mail, and even the occasional phone call are useful. Anything that strengthens your relationship while the prospect considers their options will up your chance of making the sale.</p>
<p>As a practical example, let’s say someone has a consultation with your team but doesn’t book a service during the call. Over the next couple of weeks, you send a few <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/09/follow-up-email">follow-up emails</a>, mail out a coupon-code postcard, and attempt to schedule the work through SMS texts. All of those actions are part of your lead nurturing strategy.</p>

<h2>Benefits of lead nurturing</h2>
<p>Here are a few ways that a lead nurturing strategy leads to a higher sales close rate.</p>
<h3>Builds a relationship with your business</h3>
<p>Over <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/consumer-intelligence-series/trust-new-business-currency.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90%</a> of people polled by PWC said they’d buy from a company that gained their trust. And nearly that many said they’d recommend that company to others.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/lead-nurturing-stat-trust.jpg" alt="lead nurturing - graphic of the 90% stat" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-77086 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/lead-nurturing-stat-trust.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/lead-nurturing-stat-trust-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Your lead nurturing campaign is an opportunity to send helpful tips, social proof, and other content that gives a lead more confidence in your company.</p>
<h3>Increases brand awareness and recall</h3>
<p>How many times do you see an advertisement or logo before you remember it? The common answer is that you need seven touchpoints with a potential customer before they remember your brand, logo, or products (it’s unoriginally called <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/rule-of-seven" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the rule of seven</a>).</p>
<p>A developed lead nurture strategy lets you have those meaningful interactions with someone after they’ve requested information or saved a product to their cart. When it comes time to buy, yours is the brand at the top of their mind.</p>
<h3>Educates your best customers</h3>
<p>Buyers are taking advantage of the vast amount of information available at their fingertips. A Google study revealed that <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/consumer-trends/shopping-research-before-purchase-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">53%</a> of shoppers always research before buying. At the same time, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/05/04/transparency-is-no-longer-an-option-its-a-must/?sh=7f36c5f575fe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transparency</a> is becoming as important as price and quality for many buyers.</p>
<p>The business that offers the most information will win. And that’s exactly what happens during the lead nurturing process. You give more information about where your products are sourced or the steps you take to leave a service area spotless. The more informed your lead feels, the more likely they’ll choose your solution.</p>
<h3>Leads to an increased conversion rate</h3>
<p>All of these benefits lead to the ultimate goal of enticing more people who’ve become leads to buy from your business. Since nurtured leads make <a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/lead-nurturing-statistics/#gref" target="_blank" rel="noopener">47%</a> more purchases than leads that weren’t nurtured, it has a good track record of hitting that goal.</p>

<h2>7 strategies for successful lead nurturing campaigns</h2>
<p>Lead nurturing isn’t one size fits all; a clothing retailer will use different tactics than an enterprise software consultant. So consider this a menu of super effective lead nurture ideas you can mix and match to build your own strategy.</p>
<h3>1. Send targeted emails</h3>
<p>I love email as a lead nurture channel. It’s easy to automate, less expensive than ads, and endlessly flexible. Plus, it’s useful for just about any type of company or product.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-email-stats.jpg" alt="lead nurturing - graphic showing the benefits of email marketing" width="929" height="569" class="aligncenter wp-image-77087 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-email-stats.jpg 929w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-email-stats-480x294.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 929px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Of course, you can’t just send a bunch of random emails to a lead. That’ll get annoying. Here are some ways to get the most out of your nurture emails:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Segment your list:</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/13/targeted-email-marketing-strategies">Segment</a> your leads by behavior (clicked on a product page, watched a video), engagement (those that opened the last email vs. those that didn’t), or journey stage (new lead vs. returning customer).</li>
<li><strong>Personalize for relevance:</strong> Send <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">personalized emails</a> with offers and information relevant to each customer based on what you know about them (their birthday, their interests, their shopping habits).</li>
<li><strong>Write captivating headlines:</strong> Keep open rates high by writing concise, actionable <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/40-great-email-subject-lines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subject lines</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Include a strong CTA: </strong>Add a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">call to</a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action"> action</a> that clearly states what your lead should do next (buy now, watch a video, claim your discount).</li>
<li><strong>Make sure they’re mobile friendly:</strong> <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/guides/email-marketing-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70%</a> of emails are opened on a mobile device, so make sure yours are fast-loading and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/18/mobile-ad-strategies">easy to read on mobile</a>.</li>
<li><strong>A/B test:</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/02/26/ab-testing-best-practices">A/B test</a> variations of your CTA, subject line, and offers to see which gets the most clicks and conversions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Retarget with ads</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/01/15/retargeting-ads">Retargeting ads</a> help you nurture leads by presenting your offers to them multiple times as they click around the web. If you’ve ever clicked on a product page and then seen an ad for that product on other websites, you’ve probably experienced retargeting ads.</p>
<p>These ads work by tagging someone who visits your website or enters your marketing funnel in some other way. The lead is then presented with ads automatically on websites within an advertising network (like the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/10/google-display-network-targeting">Google Display Network</a>, for example).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-retargeting.jpg" alt="lead nurturing - graphic showing the retargeting flow." width="936" height="497" class="aligncenter wp-image-77088 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-retargeting.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-retargeting-480x255.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Make sure to follow lead nurturing best practices when <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/12/04/adwords-remarketing-best-practices-guide">setting up your remarketing campaigns</a> so your ads don’t go from effective to overbearing.</p>
<h3>3. Leverage SMS marketing</h3>
<p>In the right situation, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/09/sms-marketing">SMS marketing</a>—using texts to reach your audience—is the ideal lead-nurturing strategy. That’s because SMS requires an opt-in, so the people you text have qualified themselves as interested leads.</p>
<p>Here’s why SMS marketing works:</p>
<ul>
<li>It costs less than other forms of advertising</li>
<li>A text doesn’t fight for attention like an email in a crowded inbox has to</li>
<li><a href="https://marketscale.com/industries/retail/business-texting-sales/#:~:text=Businesses%20are%20tentative%20to%20text%2C%20but%20study%20after,and%20it%E2%80%99s%20a%20hassle%20to%20play%20phone%20tag." target="_blank" rel="noopener">89%</a> of customers say they prefer texts to calls with businesses</li>
<li>Text open rates are as high as <a href="https://ponyexpresshq.medium.com/3-reasons-why-sms-marketing-is-more-effective-than-email-addb689801b8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">98%</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Just like emails, you can use texts to offer time-sensitive discounts, confirm appointments, or announce new products or services.</p>
<h3>4. Create nurture content</h3>
<p>Content marketing solves the need to educate your leads while they consider their options. It includes several formats such as blog posts, FAQs, ebooks, or webinars.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-example-content-email.jpg" alt="lead nurturing - screenshot of a content email" width="901" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-77089 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-example-content-email.jpg 901w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-example-content-email-480x320.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 901px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Following up with helpful content is a solid nurture strategy.</em></p>
<p>Content is a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/10/15/multi-channel-marketing">multi-channel marketing</a> tactic that fuels the other nurture channels. You can send a piece of educational content through email, SMS, or distribute it on social media.</p>
<p>Ideally, you’ll create content for each stage of your marketing funnel:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Awareness stage</strong>: Focus on exposing and solving a problem through how-to content.</li>
<li><strong>Consideration state:</strong> Show how your product or service solves the problem with use cases.</li>
<li><strong>Action stage:</strong> Explain specific product features coupled with discounts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Connect on social media</h3>
<p>I think some marketers forget about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">social media</a> as a viable lead nurture channel because it feels less one-to-one than email or texts. That’s a shame because it’s a natural fit for building trust if you’re already posting helpful content.</p>
<p>An important step for lead nurturing on social media is to make sure you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/get-more-instagram-followers">invite leads to follow</a> your accounts. Then they’ll see your brand, products, and amazing content in their feeds.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-example-content-collins.jpg" alt="lead nurturing - Instagram post from a service company" width="897" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-77090 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-example-content-collins.jpg 897w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-example-content-collins-480x321.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 897px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Social media is the perfect place to nurture leads with helpful content.</em></p>
<p>Once leads start following you, it’s important to increase their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/27/how-to-increase-instagram-engagement">engagement</a> by asking questions, posting polls, or going live on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/30/instagram-live">Instagram</a> or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/31/facebook-live-guide">Facebook</a>. That helps you in three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>You connect directly with a lead, especially in comments and replies.</li>
<li>You learn more about your leads through polls, questions, and their engagement.</li>
<li>You get more people viewing your posts because social media platforms reward engagement.</li>
</ol>
<p>And don’t forget, you can always ask a lead to contact you via direct message if they pose a question or response on one of your social media posts.</p>
<h3>6. Pick up the phone</h3>
<p>I got a voicemail a while back from a yoga studio I visited once. I’d done a free trial class and the instructor that led it called to see if I was interested in coming back. She’d asked me some questions in the class, so her voicemail had specific recommendations for which sessions best fit my needs.</p>
<p>Using the phone like this to nurture leads can be tricky business. Many people, <a href="https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/why-millennials-ignore-calls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">especially younger generations</a>, don’t like phone calls. Make sure you have permission to call and make sure you add value.</p>
<p>The call I received was valuable because it was personalized for me. And yes, I went back for more sessions because of it.</p>
<h3>7.  Score leads</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/10/22/demand-generation">Lead scoring</a> is the process of assigning a value to a lead based on a set of predetermined characteristics. Leads become more or less valuable based on things like the value of the product they’re interested in and the likelihood of them making a purchase.</p>
<p>A lead score then determines what nurture strategies you’ll apply. Leads with higher scores might get higher touch follow ups. Lower scores can be handled with automated lead nurturing tactics.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-lead-scoring.jpg" alt="lead nurturing - graphic of the lead scoring process." width="936" height="339" class="aligncenter wp-image-77091 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-lead-scoring.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-lead-scoring-480x174.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Example time. Person A gave their email address in exchange for a guide to home lawn maintenance. Person B called and spoke to a rep about hiring crews to maintain three golf courses. Both the product value and the action give lead B a higher score and suggest the need for more direct follow up.</p>
<p>There are other characteristics to consider. The person’s decision-making ability (e.g. head of purchasing) or the source of the lead (referral vs. cold website visit) might also affect the lead score.</p>
<p>Lead scoring helps you direct the highest effort towards the best potential return.</p>
<div id="lead-nurturing-examples"></div>
<h2>5 lead nurturing examples</h2>
<p>Theory is great, but let’s dig into some lead nurturing examples from companies that do it well.</p>
<h3>1. Abandoned cart recovery</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/17/shopping-cart-abandonment">Abandoned carts</a> are a scourge for most online retailers. Missing the sale after coming so close is like getting stopped at mile 25 of a marathon.</p>
<p>Menswear band True Classic doesn’t take missed opportunities lightly. They immediately send a valuable offer to people who look at a product or place it in their cart.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-example-true-classic-1.jpg" alt="lead nurturing - a recovery email from True Classic" width="477" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-77092 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-example-true-classic-1.jpg 477w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-example-true-classic-1-239x300.jpg 239w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" /></p>
<p>Notice the urgency they’ve added by making the offer for “a limited time.” The offer and urgency will convert lots of leads to customers.</p>
<h3>2. Milestone celebrations</h3>
<p>Of course, not every lead is so close to making a purchase. For lower-intent leads, it makes sense to just keep a friendly dialogue open.</p>
<p>This chiropractor does a nice job of it by sending a happy birthday SMS text with a link to a fun birthday message.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-chiropractor.jpg" alt="lead nurturing - a birthday text from a chiropractor." width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-77093 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-chiropractor.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-chiropractor-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You don’t need to gather personal information to use this lead nurturing strategy. You could send a thank-you note on the anniversary of your first connection. Or if you work in a particular industry, like education, you could send a “happy Teacher’s Day” email.</p>
<h3>3. Dynamic remarketing</h3>
<p>Google’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/04/01/dynamic-remarketing">Dynamic Remarketing Ads</a> make lead nurturing more personalized by automatically pulling the products you look at and filling them in the ads.</p>
<p>Here’s an example from a retail shoe store.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-example-shoe.jpg" alt="" width="936" height="173" class="aligncenter wp-image-77095 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-example-shoe.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-example-shoe-480x89.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And perhaps no one is better at it than companies in the travel industry.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-example-travel-1.jpg" alt="lead nurturing - retargeting ad from a travel company" width="936" height="165" class="aligncenter wp-image-77096 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-example-travel-1.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-example-travel-1-480x85.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The idea is to make it super easy for the lead you’re nurturing to see the ad and complete their purchase.</p>
<h3>4. Maintenance reminder</h3>
<p>There are so many things in life that need regular maintenance. Our cars, our HVACs, and our bodies all need the occasional review and tune-up. If you’re in the business of providing those services, an automated lead nurturing campaign is perfect for booking more business.</p>
<p>This home services company sends timely texts each year to catch leads as they’re facing seasonal maintenance jobs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-retargeting-2.jpg" alt="lead nurturing - reminder text from a home services company." width="329" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-77097 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-retargeting-2.jpg 329w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-wordstream-retargeting-2-165x300.jpg 165w" sizes="(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px" /></p>
<p>This lead nurturing tactic works well for consumable products, too. If a tube of toothpaste or bag of dog food is expected to last 30 days, then a reminder to purchase every 30 days should give conversions a boost.</p>
<h3>5. Social listening</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/20/social-listening">Social listening</a> is such a cool and underrated lead nurture strategy. The gist is that you set up alerts when someone mentions your brand or a keyword on social media platforms. You then join the conversation in an organic way.</p>
<p>I consider this a lead nurturing tactic when someone directly asks about a product you produce, which is exactly what happened here.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-example-sword.jpg" alt="lead nurturing - instagram post showing a woman cutting wood with a sword." width="862" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-77098 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-example-sword.jpg 862w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lead-nurturing-example-sword-480x334.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 862px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The original poster tagged the company, Viking Wood Splitter, which makes wood cutting swords (of course). People showed interest in the swords throughout the comment section. The brand was right there, nurturing their new leads with answers and advice.</p>
<h2>Start lead nurturing to convert more sales</h2>
<p>Most people won’t buy right away. Lead nurturing helps you convert more of your hard-won leads into customers by building a relationship through trust, transparency, and education.</p>
<p>Here are seven of the most effective lead nurturing strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Send targeted emails</li>
<li>Retarget with ads</li>
<li>Leverage SMS marketing</li>
<li>Create nurture content</li>
<li>Connect on social media</li>
<li>Pick up the phone</li>
<li>Score leads</li>
</ol>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Customers are the lifeblood of your business. You need to understand their pain points, desires, wants, and needs.</p>
<p>Today, you can use technology and customer surveys to gather information about your customers. Then you can use this important data to understand your customers better, so you can ultimately serve them to the best of your ability (while improving revenue, customer service, and your return on investment). This process is called customer segmentation, and it’s how you can understand every part of your customer base.</p>
<p>We’re going over nine customer segmentation models and how to use them to improve your marketing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/customer-segmentation-models.webp" alt="nine customer segmentation models" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74999" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/customer-segmentation-models.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/customer-segmentation-models-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>What is customer segmentation?</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/audience-segmentation-for-email-campaigns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Customer segmentation</a> is the process of grouping customers by similar characteristics.</strong> Think of it like planning a wedding reception: you group together tables of your friends, tables of friends, and a separate table for food.</p>
<p>Different customer segmentation models separate customers by <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/07/google-ads-geotargeting">geographic location</a>, behavior, demographics (age and gender), and values. You can separate your customers by whatever criteria you want.</p>
<h2>How customer segmentation models can help your business</h2>
<p>Customer segmentation models give you insight into your customers. By understanding the age, gender, location, values, and behavior of your customers, you will be able to tailor your offerings to their needs.</p>
<h3>Improved customer service</h3>
<p>With customer segmentation, you can give your customers better service. When a customer reaches out to your support team, your customer support agents will have information gathered from customer segmentation models. They’ll be able to provide smoother, faster customer service.</p>
<p>That’s good news for your business: <a href="https://cdn2.assets-servd.host/paltry-coyote/production/exports/24f0c7e1039033ee5e88f1eaec5c867a/zendesk-cx-trends-2022-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90%</a> of customers will spend more with businesses that personalize their customer service.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/personalize-customer-service-stat.webp" alt="customer service personalization stat" width="936" height="357" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74997" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/personalize-customer-service-stat.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/personalize-customer-service-stat-480x183.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Improved advertising campaigns</h3>
<p>A farmer in small-town Indiana won’t share the same needs as a first-time homeowner. Yet both customers can buy the products they need from John Deere. If John Deere started advertising combines to homeowners, it would be a waste of the company’s time (and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/28/small-business-budget">advertising budget</a>!).</p>
<p>By using customer segmentation models, John Deere can split its customer base into segments so the company can pinpoint and target different people’s needs.

<h3>Improved communications that engage your customers</h3>
<p>Customer segmentation models will help you understand more about what your customers need and want. The communications they receive from you will be relevant to their lives and interests, instead of something they ignore.</p>

<h2>9 customer segmentation models for your business</h2>
<p>Use these nine customer segmentation models to connect with specific customers so you can increase your sales, spend advertising money wisely, and improve your customer service.</p>
<h3>1. Demographic segmentation</h3>
<p>Demographic segmentation is the one you’re probably most familiar with. This customer segmentation model separates customers by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Race</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Marital status</li>
<li>Income</li>
<li>Education</li>
</ul>
<p>Demographic segmentation can be used by marketing teams, customer service representatives, and researchers. There are no limits to how you can use this information!</p>
<p>You could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use age demographics to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/generational-marketing-tactics">communicate with different generations</a> through chats, email, and phone calls.</li>
<li>Use education status to identify people who would be interested in <a href="https://localiq.com/industries/education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher education</a>.</li>
<li>Use income level to target customers who are on a budget.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buying-motives-self-actualization.webp" alt="buying motive - self actualization - ad from college that appeals to self actualization buyer motive" width="461" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74758" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buying-motives-self-actualization.webp 461w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buying-motives-self-actualization-231x300.webp 231w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This school likely used demographic segmentation to target current students.</em></p>
<h3>2. Behavioral segmentation</h3>
<p>With <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/28/behavioral-segmentation">behavioral segmentation</a>, you can separate customers by how they use your brand. For example, you can divide them by:</p>
<ul>
<li>How they use your products.</li>
<li>Buying patterns.</li>
<li>How they shop (in person or online).</li>
</ul>
<p>This information will be most useful with personalized ads. You can target loyal customers with similar products.</p>
<p>You can also use it with your customer service team. Study your customer’s behavior and look for frequently asked questions. Then create a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/24/faq-page">FAQ page</a>, help desk, or <a href="https://localiq.com/products/chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automated customer support chats</a> that address them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/customer-segmentation-models-behavioral.webp" alt="customer segmentation - behavioral segmentation use examples" width="936" height="528" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74991" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/customer-segmentation-models-behavioral.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/customer-segmentation-models-behavioral-480x271.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>3. Psychographic segmentation</h3>
<p>Psychographic segmentation is all about the inner feelings and attitudes your customers hold. It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Values</li>
<li>Interests</li>
<li>Attitudes</li>
<li>Personality types</li>
<li>Lifestyle</li>
<li>Opinions</li>
</ul>
<p>This type of customer segmentation model allows you to get the most personal point of view into your customer’s thoughts, beliefs, and feelings. Run <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/10/best-online-survey-tools">customer surveys</a> to gather some of this info.</p>
<p>Then, use psychographic segmentation to appeal to their perceptions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Showcase your environmental, LGBTQ, and diversity initiatives with passionate customers.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/03/how-to-sell-on-etsy">Sell handmade goods</a> to customers by using the personal stories of their makers.</li>
<li>Identify customers who have similar interests (like reading) to sell related products to (like bookmarks).</li>
<li>Create a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/25/buyer-persona-examples">customer persona</a> (a fictional character) who represents a customer segment.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Value-based segmentation</h3>
<p>Value-based segmentation is all about the level of value your customer is offering <em>you</em>. With this customer segmentation model, you’ll measure your customer’s return on investment (<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-roi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ROI</a>). You’ll be able to identify your most loyal customers and understand where you’re losing value. You can sort customers by how many purchases they make, how much they spend, and how often they buy.</p>
<p>Use value-based segmentation to understand the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/10/cac-vs-clv">lifetime value of your customers</a> so you can increase the ROI.</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify which customers buy products with high and low prices.</li>
<li>Implement a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/live-chat-benefits/">chatbot</a> to answer customer questions.</li>
<li>Send messages and special sales to unsatisfied customers.</li>
<li>Create a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/14/referral-program-ideas">rewards program</a> to increase sales.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-loyalty-program.png" alt="how to increase average order value - loyalty program example" width="720" height="273" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62953" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-loyalty-program.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/increase-average-order-value-loyalty-program-480x182.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>5. Geographic segmentation</h3>
<p>Geographic segmentation is pretty obvious. This customer segmentation model groups people together by location, including country, state, city, and town.</p>
<p>By understanding where your customers are based, you can serve them better. You could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send tailored communications celebrating local festivals and traditions.</li>
<li>Use local terminology, slang, and knowledge to appeal to them.</li>
<li>Identify opportunities for secondary locations.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is also essential when <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/07/google-ads-geotargeting">targeting your ads to local customers</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/google-ads-location-extension-example.png" alt="google ads location extension example" width="720" height="238" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63034" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/google-ads-location-extension-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/google-ads-location-extension-example-480x159.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>6. Technographic segmentation</h3>
<p>Teghnographic segmentation separates your costumes by their comfort level with technology.</p>
<p>You can gain this knowledge by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending out customer surveys.</li>
<li>Looking at how people access your site.</li>
<li>Discovering what brand of devices customers use (Apple, Android, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/customer-segmentation-models-technographic-google-analytics.webp" alt="customer segmentation models - technographic - example of data in google analytics" width="936" height="485" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74993" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/customer-segmentation-models-technographic-google-analytics.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/customer-segmentation-models-technographic-google-analytics-480x249.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You can see what devices people use to visit your website in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/23/google-analytics-4-vs-universal-analytics">Google Analytics</a>. </em></p>
<p>Then you can use this knowledge to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decide if launching a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-market-an-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobile app</a> is worth it.</li>
<li>Understand how to improve your existing SaaS product.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/20/product-positioning">Design products</a> for people less familiar with technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use this information to determine if you should use a marketing strategy like <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/geofencing-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">geofencing</a> or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/09/sms-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SMS marketing</a> to target people on their mobile devices (here are some <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/text-message-templates/">SMS marketing templates</a> to help).</p>
<h3>7. Needs-based segmentation</h3>
<p>Every customer needs something different from your company. With needs-based segmentation, you can figure out what you need to improve on. Needs-based segmentation groups customers by <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/types-of-customer-needs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">problems and desires</a>.</p>
<p>For an example of needs-based segmentation, let&#8217;s look at food delivery. If Home Chef delivered its food boxes at the wrong time, customers would be upset about spoiled goods. But by allowing customers to choose delivery days, the company can provide better customer service.</p>
<p>Here’s another example of needs-based segmentation: accessibility. Not all of your customers can see your brand photos, or hear your videos. By putting <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/ada-compliant-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accessibility measures</a> in place, you can reach every one of your customers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/customer-segmentation-models-needs-based-example.webp" alt="customer segmentation models - need-based - example for accessibility on website" width="731" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74994" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/customer-segmentation-models-needs-based-example.webp 731w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/customer-segmentation-models-needs-based-example-480x393.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 731px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>8. Firmographic segmentation</h3>
<p>Firmographic segmentation is when you separate customers by company attributes. You can use firmographic segmentation to group customers by company size or structure, industry, revenue, and type of organization.</p>
<p>Find this information by looking at public data sources, company websites, annual reports, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/04/how-to-write-a-press-release">press releases</a>.</p>
<p>This type of segmentation is most helpful when your customer base is primarily companies, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-marketing-data/">small businesses</a>, and other organizations.</p>
<h3>9. Lifecycle stage segmentation</h3>
<p>Another type of customer segmentation model is grouping customers by where they are on the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-customer-journey/">customer journey</a>. Lifecycle stage segmentation divides customers into different stages so you know how to target them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/customer-segmentation-models-lifecycle.webp" alt="customer segmentation models - lifecycle journey - buyers journey example graphic" width="936" height="553" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74995" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/customer-segmentation-models-lifecycle.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/customer-segmentation-models-lifecycle-480x284.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You can use data from your CRM or <a href="https://localiq.com/products/marketing-dashboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lead management software</a> to track and tag customers or prospects to better target them through this customer segmentation model.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can use lifecycle stage segmentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify how to help potential customers.</li>
<li>Find new ways to keep customers engaged.</li>
<li>Improve onboarding for new customers.</li>
<li>Reduce customer turnover.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Start using customer segmentation models now</h2>
<p>Using customer segmentation models is the best method of separating customers by different characteristics. Gathering these insights will lead to new strategies, processes, and policies that will improve your business.</p>
<p>Here are the nine customer segmentations models you need to know:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a small business owner, your ability to understand and connect with your target audience is paramount. In fact, your success hinges on it!</p>
<p>By identifying your ideal customers&#8217; needs, motivations, and pain points, you can gain insight into them on a deeper level and develop compelling messaging that resonates and drives results. This is where buyer personas come in.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buyer-persona-matrix.webp" alt="buyer persona matrix" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74384" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buyer-persona-matrix.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buyer-persona-matrix-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In this article, we&#8217;re sharing five helpful buyer persona examples along with everything you need to know to build your own, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The definition of a buyer persona</li>
<li>Why creating these detailed profiles is important for your business</li>
<li>Steps to create buyer personas</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s dive in!</p>
<h2>What is a buyer persona?</h2>
<p>A buyer persona is a fictional representation of your ideal customers that helps you and your team better visualize and communicate to your target audience.</p>
<p>Imagine you are the owner of a small plant container business. Perhaps there are three typical types of customers you currently have or target in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/26/marketing-channels">marketing</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Individuals looking for seasonal plant styling for their homes.</li>
<li>Local businesses that need plants for their shops and offices.</li>
<li>People who gift plants for special occasions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, for each of these, imagine you combine all the most common qualities into one fictional person representing that ideal customer. This generalized description is what we call a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/23/buyer-personas">buyer persona</a>. While the persona is fictional, the detailed profile is based on everything we know about our current and future customers.</p>
<p>Based on data and research, a buyer persona typically includes but is not limited to the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demographic information: Age, location, education, occupation, income, etc.</li>
<li>Psychographic information: Values, interests, lifestyle, etc.</li>
<li>Behavioral information: Goals, pain points, shopping habits, decision-making process, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why create buyer personas for your business?</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve covered what buyer personas are, let’s look at why developing them is a crucial step for your business.</p>
<p>Buyer personas are essential for several reasons:</p>
<h3>More effective marketing</h3>
<p>As a small business, you are likely always looking to attract new customers. Buyer personas will provide the information needed to craft persuasive campaigns more likely to convert your prospects into long-term customers.</p>

<h3>Enhanced sales performance</h3>

<h3>Informed product development</h3>
<p>As you and your team use buyer personas in your sales and marketing efforts, the unique <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/types-of-customer-needs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">needs of your customers</a> will become clear. You will then be able to pivot to focus your time on the most important and lucrative segments of your business, including opportunities for product development as well as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/20/product-positioning">product positioning</a>.</p>

<p>For example, this <a href="https://localiq.com/products/search-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search ad</a> for The Farmer&#8217;s Dog suggests a product that&#8217;s geared toward pet owners who are cautious about what they feed their dog and are looking for &#8220;human-grade&#8221; food.</p>
<h3>Improved customer retention</h3>
<p>Your customers’ experience is of the utmost importance. Using buyer personas, you can better <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">personalize your sales and marketing efforts</a> to delight your customers and keep them loyal to your business.</p>
<p>As you can see, creating buyer personas is critical for all aspects of your small business.</p>
<h2>How to create buyer personas</h2>
<p>Developing buyer personas for your small business can be simple. Follow these steps to get started.</p>
<h3>Gather data</h3>
<p>Gather demographic, psychographic, and behavioral data on your current customers and prospects. Helpful resources for this process could be historical or new <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-feedback-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer surveys</a>, intel from your sales team, <a href="https://localiq.com/products/marketing-dashboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analytics</a> (website, <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/local-social-media-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media followers</a>, etc.), and any information you can glean from your competitors’ customer base (completing a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/12/20/swot-analysis">SWOT analysis</a> might be helpful here!).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/facebook-audience-insights-example-demographics.jpg" alt="facebook audience insights demographics for buyer persona example" width="563" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74388" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/facebook-audience-insights-example-demographics.jpg 563w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/facebook-audience-insights-example-demographics-480x512.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 563px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> This will likely be the most time-consuming step in the process, but conducting thorough research is essential to creating helpful buyer personas.</p>
<h3>Find similarities</h3>
<p>Review your gathered data, identify patterns and commonalities, and organize into customer groups. For example, you may discover that many customers who purchase your plants as gifts are young professionals who prioritize convenience and price. This would be one of your key <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/21/customer-journey-mapping">customer groups</a>.</p>
<h3>Build buyer personas</h3>
<p>Develop detailed fictional characters to represent each customer group you created. For these profiles, the more details you can include, the better! You want the personas to be as realistic as possible to make them memorable for your sales and marketing teams.</p>
<p>Give them ages, hobbies, goals, challenges, and even a stock image of their appearance! When brainstorming names for your personas, consider using alliteration so your team can quickly recall them in their day-to-day work.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/munro-buyer-persona-example.jpg" alt="example of a visual buyer persona from munro" width="751" height="597" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71248" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/munro-buyer-persona-example.jpg 751w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/munro-buyer-persona-example-480x382.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 751px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use these details to quickly build a persona like the one above with a </span><a href="https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">free dedicated buyer persona builder from HubSpot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h3>Refine and update regularly</h3>
<p>The key to effective buyer personas? Keeping them up-to-date! The last thing you want to do is spend all the time researching and creating these detailed profiles, only for them to be obsolete a few months later. Regularly modify your profiles as your business evolves and your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audiences</a> shift. Scheduling these updates (e.g., once per quarter) will help ensure you keep the personas relevant and helpful for your team.</p>
<p>Investing time into developing accurate and memorable buyer personas can increase <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/09/lower-customer-acquisition-cost">customer acquisition</a> and loyalty, impacting your bottom line. So the effort you put forth will benefit your business in the long run.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://economicimpact.google/methodology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stat source</a></em></p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented challenges to many businesses, including a music school I worked with that had to shut its doors to in-person teaching. With students no longer coming to their facility, their phones stopped ringing, and they desperately needed to find a solution. They decided to pivot to offering virtual lessons and turned to Google Ads to get the word out. This decision proved to be a game-changer, as their phones started ringing again, and their business began to thrive.</p>
<p>In this article, I’ll be sharing:</p>
<ul>
<li>The top strategies for creating effective lead generation ads in Google Ads, using the music school&#8217;s experience as an example.</li>
<li>How these strategies can work for businesses that need leads in any industry.</li>
<li>Step-by-step directions for how to implement conversion tracking and remarketing with Google Ads to make the most of these strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end, you’ll have the tools needed to maximize your marketing efforts and achieve your goals with Google Ads.</p>
<h2>How to use Google Ads for lead generation</h2>
<p>These practical strategies will help you use Google Ads to generate more leads for your business.</p>
<h3>1. Know your target audience</h3>
<p>For any ad to be successful in generating leads, it needs to be targeted to the right audience.</p>
<p>Before creating ads, the music school conducted research using Google Search Console to collect data on demographics, interests, and behaviors, creating a detailed buyer persona of potential students.</p>
<p>By analyzing search queries, audience demographics, and <a href="https://localiq.com/website-grader/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website performance</a>, they gained valuable insights into their audience&#8217;s preferences and behaviors.</p>
<p>Armed with this information, the school was able to create more targeted ads and content that resonated with their audience and resulted in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/03/improve-conversion-rates">improved conversion rates</a>.</p>
<p>To learn about your target audience from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/16/how-to-use-google-search-console" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Search Console</a>, you can follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Search Console</a> and select the website you want to analyze.</li>
<li>Click on the &#8220;Performance&#8221; tab to see the search performance of your website.</li>
<li>Look at the data under the &#8220;Queries&#8221; tab. This section will show you the queries (keywords) that people are using to find your website.</li>
<li>Analyze the impressions and clicks data for each query. Impressions refer to the number of times a search result from your website appeared in the search engine results page (SERP) for that query, while clicks refer to the number of times a user clicked on that search result.</li>
<li>Look for patterns in the queries that are <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bringing traffic to your website</a>. Are there any particular queries that are driving a significant amount of traffic? What types of queries are they (e.g. informational, navigational, transactional)?</li>
<li>Look at the demographic data of the users who are performing these queries. Are they mostly from a certain geographic location or age range?</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/google-ads-for-lead-generation-search-console.webp" alt="google search console top queries" width="936" height="432" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73915" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/google-ads-for-lead-generation-search-console.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/google-ads-for-lead-generation-search-console-480x222.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Use this information to tailor your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/03/ad-copy-examples">ad copy</a> to better target your audience. For example, if you notice that a certain demographic is more likely to search for certain keywords, you can include copy that is specifically tailored to that demographic.</p>
<p>By regularly analyzing your Search Console data, you can gain valuable insights into your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a> and make data-driven decisions to improve your search ads performance.</p>

					<div class='et-box-content'>Are your Google Ads making the grade? Find out with our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free Google Ads Performance Grader</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></div></div>
<h3>2. Utilize the right keywords</h3>
<p>Keywords are the foundation of your Google Ads campaigns. The music school conducted thorough <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteBigEasyKeyword.html?cid=Web_Any_Homepage_PPC_BigEasyKeyword_Download">keyword research</a> using tools like Google Keyword Planner to identify high-intent keywords that their target audience was likely to use. They included a mix of long-tail and short-tail keywords to cover various search queries and improve their ad visibility.</p>
<p>When selecting your keywords to generate leads with Google Ads, make sure to consider keyword intent. Depending on how you’re collecting leads, you’ll need to align keyword intent with the keywords you’re choosing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/keyword-intent-wordstream.jpg" alt="keyword intent chart" width="859" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73944" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/keyword-intent-wordstream.jpg 859w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/keyword-intent-wordstream-480x335.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 859px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For example, if you collect leads through gated white papers or resources, you could target informational keywords. But if you collect leads through a quote request, you’d want to target keywords with transactional or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/30/commercial-intent-keywords">commercial intent</a>.</p>
<p>Use our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">Free Keyword Tool</a> to discover new keywords you can use in your Google Ads for lead generation.</p>
<h3>3. Craft compelling ad copy</h3>
<p>The music school&#8217;s ad copy was the first point of contact between their business and potential leads. They wrote clear, concise, and persuasive ad copy that highlighted the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/07/unique-selling-proposition">unique selling points</a> of their virtual music lessons. They included a compelling call-to-action (CTA) to encourage users to take the desired action, such as contacting them, signing up, or making a purchase.</p>
<p>These are all important aspects of Google Ads that drive leads.</p>

<h3>4. Optimize landing pages</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://localiq.com/products/websites-landing-pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">landing page</a> is where the magic happens. It&#8217;s the page that potential leads will arrive at after clicking on the ad.</p>
<p>The music school optimized its landing page according to best practices.</p>
<p>Some of these <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLiQContentDLHowToMakeGreatLandingPages.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_LandingPages_HowToMakeGreatLandingPagesGuide_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">landing page best practices</a> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engaging and visually appealing design.</li>
<li>Pages optimized for conversion with some type of lead capture (i.e., a form, large click-to-call button, or a <a href="https://localiq.com/products/scheduling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduling tool</a>).</li>
<li>Messaging that’s consistent with ad copy.</li>
<li>A prominently-placed <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/20/call-to-action-buttons">CTA button</a> to drive conversions.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-no-risk-trials.png" alt="landing page trends - no risk free trial example by constant contact" width="720" height="387" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-69566" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-no-risk-trials.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/landing-page-trends-no-risk-trials-480x258.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>By looking at great <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/08/landing-page-examples">landing page examples</a> and following best practices, you can increase the likelihood that your Google Ads will generate leads. Plus, good landing pages can also contribute to better <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/19/does-quality-score-still-matter">Quality Score</a> and higher conversion rates.</p>
<h3>5. Use ad extensions</h3>
<p>Another way to use Google Ads for lead generation is to take advantage of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/25/google-ads-extensions-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ad extensions</a>.

<p>The music school made the most of these extensions to provide more value to users and increase their chances of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/12/how-to-generate-leads">generating leads</a>.</p>
<h3>6. Test and optimize your ads</h3>
<p>Continuously testing and optimizing your ads is crucial to improve your performance. You should track the performance of your ads using metrics like CTR, cost per click (CPC), conversion rate, and cost per lead (CPL).</p>
<p>You can compare your metrics against <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/15/google-ads-benchmarks">search advertising industry benchmarks</a> to see where you fall and also benchmark against your own performance to see how you can improve throughout the life of your campaigns.</p>

<h3>8. Monitor competitors&#8217; strategies</h3>
<p>Keeping an eye on your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/01/competitor-keyword-analysis">competitors&#8217; advertising strategies</a> can provide valuable insights and help you identify areas where you can gain an edge.</p>
<p>By understanding what works for others in your industry, you can create more targeted and effective ads.</p>
<p>The music school studied its competitors&#8217; ads to learn from their successes and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/07/google-ads-mistakes">mistakes</a>, as well as to find opportunities to differentiate their virtual lessons.</p>
<h3>9. Use location targeting for local relevance</h3>
<p>For businesses like the music school that cater to a local audience, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/07/google-ads-geotargeting">location targeting</a> is essential. You can use location targeting in Google Ads to ensure your ads are only shown to users in your target area. This can help you avoid wasting ad spend on clicks from users outside your service area and increase the relevance of your ads to potential customers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/google-ads-location-targeting.jpg" alt="google ads location targeting option in set up" width="936" height="426" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73918" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/google-ads-location-targeting.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/google-ads-location-targeting-480x218.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>10. Add remarketing</h3>
<p>A hugely powerful way to generate leads and re-engage users who have previously visited your website through Google Ads is to implement <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/05/google-ads-remarketing-lists">remarketing</a>.</p>
<p>Remarketing is an impactful strategy that enables businesses to reconnect with users who have previously interacted with their website but haven&#8217;t converted.</p>
<p>The music school used remarketing to target users with ads to remind them about their virtual lessons and the benefits of learning music online. This approach not only reinforced the music school&#8217;s brand in the minds of potential students but also increased the likelihood of converting those users into leads and, ultimately, customers.</p>

<li>Sign in to your Google Ads account and navigate to the &#8220;Tools &amp; Settings&#8221; menu &gt; Shared Library.</li>

<li>Click on the &#8220;Audiences&#8221; tab in the left-hand menu.</li>
<li>Select Edit Audience Segments</li>
<li><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2454064?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Choose &#8220;Website visitors&#8221; </a>as the list source, if it’s already there for you, if not you can create one in Audience Manager.</li>
<li>Select the remarketing list that you created earlier.</li>
<li>Set the bid adjustment for the audience, if applicable.</li>
<li>Click &#8220;Save&#8221; to add the remarketing list to your campaign.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The “TikTok made me buy it” era is over.</p>
<p>Well, not quite, but it isn’t the only platform where users sincerely engage with sponsored content—Spotify is a close second (and may be gunning for the top place).</p>
<p>The second volume of <a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/sonic-science/vol-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sonic Science</a>, a biometric study that reveals the impact of digital audio and ad engagement, found that Spotify listeners remember the brands they hear about on podcasts or while streaming music.</p>
<p>And ad recall isn’t the only metric that’s through the roof.</p>
<p>1 in 5 study participants reported looking up a brand or product after hearing about it in a Spotify ad, and 30% said they’re likely to make a purchase—nothing but great news for advertisers looking to get into audio advertising.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-homepage-example.jpg" alt="spotify advertising example on homepage - desktop and mobile" width="817" height="524" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73575" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-homepage-example.jpg 817w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-homepage-example-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 817px, 100vw" /></p>

<h2>What is Spotify advertising?</h2>
<p>Spotify advertising includes running audio ads (accompanied by a branded video or image) between songs, podcasts, and playlists, typically within the free version of Spotify.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-main-placement-example.jpg" alt="spotify advertising main placement example " width="328" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73576" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-main-placement-example.jpg 328w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-main-placement-example-165x300.jpg 165w" sizes="(max-width: 328px) 100vw, 328px" /></p>

<h3>Other Spotify ad types</h3>
<p>Aside from the typical Spotify ads mentioned above, there are a few custom options available for Spotify advertising. These vary in costs and cannot be run as part of the self-serve ad platform (we&#8217;ll get more into that later).</p>
<h4>Sponsored Playlist</h4>
<p>With <a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/ad-experiences/sponsored-playlist-ad-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sponsored Playlists</a>, you can run your ads when people listen to Spotify’s most popular owned and operated playlists. Spotify’s streaming intelligence can help you better <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">understand your target audience</a> and identify the best playlists that align with your brand.</p>

<p>When listeners first open the Spotify app or return to it, they’re greeted with the <a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/ad-experiences/display-ads-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overlay</a>—an ad engineered for viewability that ensures significant brand impact.

<h2>Is Spotify good for advertising?</h2>
<p>Short answer: Heck yes, it is!</p>
<p>Digital audio is a sound investment (get it?). And with the recent surge in demand for both podcasts and music (thanks to the numerous lockdowns and quarantines), advertisers have been flocking to the medium.</p>
<p>And Spotify is sitting pretty at the top with the largest <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/amo/advertising/audio-advertising/digital-audio-advertising/worldwide#key-players" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market share</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-market-share.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - market share for different audio advertising channels" width="800" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73582" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-market-share.jpg 800w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-market-share-480x359.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/amo/advertising/audio-advertising/digital-audio-advertising/worldwide#key-players" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Spotify offers a deeply personalized and interactive user experience, making it far more engaging, emotionally arousing, and memorable when compared to other mediums like digital video, social media, and TV.</p>
<p>Here are some reasons Spotify advertising works.</p>
<h3>People pay attention to Spotify ads</h3>
<p>In a digital world where user attention is becoming a scarce commodity, Spotify is one of the best places to find an engaged and attentive audience.</p>
<p>Dentsu International’s research project, <a href="https://www.dentsu.com/uk/en/our-latest-thinking/unlocking-the-new-currency-of-attention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Attention Economy</a>, can confirm that. Compared to the platform average, Spotify’s audio ads and video ads drove +14% and +155% “<a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/news-and-insights/dentsu-research-attention-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greater attentive seconds</a>” respectively.</p>
<p>Attention isn’t just a nice-to-have metric—it can boost ad recall and purchase intent. And the data from the Sonic Science study has already established how Spotify ads positively impact those metrics.</p>
<h3>That attention and engagement lasts all day, every day</h3>
<p><a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/sonic-science/vol-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">63%</a> of Spotify listeners stated that Spotify is an integral part of their day.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that global audiences listen to <a href="https://www.ifpi.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Engaging-with-Music-2022_full-report-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20 hours</a> of music every week, and <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/the-podcast-industry-report-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 in 5 people</a> tune into podcasts, and that number is rapidly growing (here’s looking at you true crime fans!)</p>
<p>And Spotify isn’t white noise—listeners choose audio over screens when they either can’t or don’t want to engage with TV, games, or movies.</p>
<p>Whether folks are cooking up a storm or tackling an important work task, they engage with the audio. That means advertisers have unparalleled access to a leaned-in audience throughout the day as opposed to other channels that serve as distractions for a limited amount of time.</p>
<h3>Ad-supported subscriber base is growing</h3>
<p>In Q1 2023, Spotify hit <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/813787/spotify-ad-supported-monthly-active-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">317 million</a> ad-supported monthly active users—a sharp increase from 295 million last year. With the streaming platform constantly adding new users to its ad-supported subscriber base, the audience of engaged listeners continues to grow.</p>

<h3>You have the chance to connect with younger listeners</h3>
<p>Spotify’s recently launched “<a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-04-13/spotifys-new-publishing-tool-makes-it-easy-to-turn-broadcasts-into-podcasts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Broadcast-to-Podcast</a>” publishing tool makes it easy for radio broadcasters to turn existing content into on-demand podcasts. That means publishers can reach the <a href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/weekly-insights-11-30-22-am-fm-over-the-air-vs-streaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newer generations turning to digital radio</a> and advertisers can target more audiences on and off Spotify.</p>
<h3>Spotify offers more than digital audio</h3>
<p>Digital audio ads are great—we just established that. But capturing attention requires a multi-format play. And that’s perhaps one of the reasons why Spotify’s leading the pack in Dentsu’s Attention Economy study.</p>
<p>Spotify’s research has shown that combining audio and video ads has a significant brand impact. In fact, multiformat campaigns have a 90% increase in ad recall and more than double (<a href="https://www.nielsen.com/news-center/2018/nielsens-relationship-spotify-continues-grow-brand-effect-measurement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2.2X</a>) brand awareness.</p>
<h3>Spotify is constantly expanding its product offering</h3>
<p>From new dynamic ad formats to new ways to track ad performance, Spotify is constantly developing its offering for global advertisers.</p>
<p>For instance, the platform launched <a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/ad-experiences/podcast-ads-specs/">CTA cards for podcasts</a> in the US, increasing the number of places where listeners can click on them during and after an audio ad. This feature has boosted traffic to advertiser-specified URLs.</p>
<h3>Sonic branding might be the next big thing</h3>
<p>Although used <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/2022-03/power-of-you-ipsos.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 10%</a> of the time, brand assets that use sonic brand cues are more effective than other music or roping in celebrities.</p>

<p>So Netflix commissioned Hans Zimmer to extend it for theaters and &#8230; it&#8217;s &#8230; so &#8230; good.<a href="https://t.co/RGw26vCAGY">pic.twitter.com/RGw26vCAGY</a></p>

<p>Think about the tu-dum sound you hear when you load Netflix—that’s a great example of what a solid sonic identity can do for a brand. When that 3 second long sound didn’t work for theaters, they had Hans Zimmer create an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366371/netflix-sound-hans-zimmer-theaters-tadum-twenty-thousand-hertz-podcast-sound-design">extended version</a>.</p>

<p>While traditional jingles may be losing their appeal, there’s no denying that they worked.</p>
<p>And with brands trying to create a consistent <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-multichannel-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-channel presence</a> across social media, TV, streaming, and radio, sonic branding might be the new jingle.</p>

<h2>How to advertise on Spotify</h2>
<p>With Spotify Ad Studio, you can create an audio or a video (horizontal or vertical) ad.</p>
<p>Here’s how to use the self-serve ad manager, Spotify Ad Studio, to create an audio or video ad.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Create an account (if you have one already, skip this step)</h3>
<p>Make a <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free Spotify account</a>. Use Google, Facebook, or your email to sign up.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-create-account.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - create account homepage" width="497" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73584" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-create-account.jpg 497w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-create-account-480x579.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 497px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Once you’ve logged in, you will be able to access the <a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ad Studio</a>, which will allow you to create individual ads or complex campaigns that involve ad sets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-ad-studio-campaigns.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - campaigns page" width="936" height="549" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73585" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-ad-studio-campaigns.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-ad-studio-campaigns-480x282.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Step 2: Add campaign details</h3>
<p>Name your campaign and tell Spotify what you’re advertising.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-new-campaign.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - create campaign name" width="936" height="556" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73586" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-new-campaign.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-new-campaign-480x285.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Fill in the ad set name and declare an ad category (the ad category helps Spotify deliver relevant ads to listeners).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-ad-set-details.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - enter ad set details" width="936" height="534" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73587" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-ad-set-details.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-ad-set-details-480x274.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Step 3: Set your target audience</h3>
<p>Select the right location(s). You can choose specific regions or countries.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-audiences.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - specify audience" width="936" height="548" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73588" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-audiences.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-audiences-480x281.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you’re running a nationwide campaign, you can also add postal codes in bulk (up to 1,000 locations) by typing or copying and pasting them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-add-postal-codes.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - batch enter postal codes" width="520" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73589" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-add-postal-codes.jpg 520w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-add-postal-codes-480x554.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 520px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Choose the age group(s) and gender(s) you want to target.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-age-gender.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - choose age and gender of audience" width="936" height="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73590" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-age-gender.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-age-gender-480x256.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Narrow down the interests and behaviors of your audience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-interests-behaviors.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - include interests and behaviors" width="936" height="580" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73591" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-interests-behaviors.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-interests-behaviors-480x297.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you select no additional targeting, you will be able to reach the broadest audience. Selecting one of the other options will help you serve your ad to a more relevant segment. For instance, if you choose contextual playlists, your ad will only be played during specific activities when listeners play a themed playlist.</p>
<p>Next, choose the language you want to target.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-language.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - choose language for ads" width="936" height="274" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73592" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-language.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-language-480x141.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Select the platform(s) where you want to serve your ad.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-platforms.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - choose platform for ads" width="936" height="241" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73593" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-platforms.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-platforms-480x124.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Step 4: Choose the format and placement of the ad</h3>
<p>You have three formats to choose from: audio, horizontal, and vertical video. While Spotify recommends you choose the automatic placement, i.e., your ad will run across music and podcasts, you can opt to place your ad in music streams only.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-format-placement.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - specify format and placement of ad" width="936" height="465" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73594" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-format-placement.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-format-placement-480x238.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You also have control over whether you want to exclude your ads from playing during certain podcast episodes that may not align with your brand. Similarly, you can add topics that make sense for your brand values and offer <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">personalized experiences</a> to listeners.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-podcast-episode-topics.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - choose any podcast content controls" width="602" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73595" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-podcast-episode-topics.jpg 602w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-podcast-episode-topics-480x477.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 602px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Step 5: Create the ad schedule and set the budget</h3>
<p>You can choose to run the ad indefinitely or select a start and end date and time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-schedule-ad.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - schedule ad " width="936" height="417" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73596" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-schedule-ad.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-schedule-ad-480x214.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The minimum average daily budget is $15 and the minimum lifetime budget is $250. You can enter a custom amount. Based on the audience, Spotify can predict whether you’ll spend some or all of your budget.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-budget.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - choose budget" width="853" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73597" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-budget.jpg 853w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-budget-480x337.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 853px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Step 6: Choose a delivery objective<strong> </strong></h3>
<p>You can select one of three delivery goals for Spotify to prioritize: impressions, reach, or clicks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-objective.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - choose objective for ad" width="635" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73598" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-objective.jpg 635w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-objective-480x453.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 635px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You also get to set the frequency cap (how frequently the ad will appear per day, per week, and per month) and the bid cap.</p>
<p>Spotify offers recommendations for the bid amount based on similar audiences.</p>
<h3>Step 7: Create your ad</h3>
<p>Fill in the ad details like ad name, advertiser name, and tagline, and choose the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/13/call-to-action-examples">CTA</a>. Set the destination URL and tracking URL (optional).</p>
<p>You can see an example of what the ad preview looks like at this stage:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-ad-details.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - create your add" width="603" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73599" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-ad-details.jpg 603w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-ad-details-480x478.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 603px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Add a companion image that’ll appear while the ad plays and your logo (optional). These images should be in JPG or PNG format and at least 640 x 640 pixels.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-image-logo.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - add image and logo" width="739" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73600" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-image-logo.jpg 739w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-image-logo-480x390.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 739px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here’s what the preview looks like when those images are uploaded:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-ad-preview.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - ad preview example" width="320" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73601" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-ad-preview.jpg 320w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-ad-preview-160x300.jpg 160w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></p>
<p>Since we chose audio as the ad format, we’ll show you the options you have:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-add-audio.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - add audio for ad" width="604" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73602" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-add-audio.jpg 604w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-add-audio-480x476.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 604px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The first option is pretty straightforward. You can upload your audio or choose one from the library.</p>
<p>But the “Create Audio” option is a game-changer for businesses. You don’t even need a script or an in-house voice actor. Spotify can write one for you and produce your ad in 2-4 business days.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-creative-brief.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - creative brief" width="321" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73603" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-creative-brief.jpg 321w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-creative-brief-161x300.jpg 161w" sizes="(max-width: 321px) 100vw, 321px" /></p>
<p>If you choose video as the ad format, you also get the option to enable viewability tracking thanks to third-party vendors along with the optional tracking URL.</p>

<h2>Tips to tune into success with Spotify advertising</h2>
<p>Due to “the carryover effect,” Spotify listeners are just as engaged while listening to ads as they were while streaming music or binging on podcasts. <a href="https://storage.pardot.com/52662/1677552207ZGvhSQfc/Sonic_Science_US.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60%</a> of the ad engagement is carried over from what listeners consumed before.</p>
<p>In short, you’ve got a highly receptive audience that’s willing to engage with your ad. Apart from the usual advice&#8211;mention your brand, include a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/05/best-call-to-action-phrases">strong CTA</a>, and stay on message&#8211;here are some data-backed best practices you may want to use.</p>
<h3>Mix audio, video, and display</h3>
<p>Your best bet at holding your audience’s attention and making it count is to combine different ad formats for your Spotify advertising campaigns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-ad-recall-chart.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - ad recall for spotify audio and video ads" width="786" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73607" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-ad-recall-chart.jpg 786w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-ad-recall-chart-480x366.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 786px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/news-and-insights/dentsu-research-attention-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p><a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/news-and-insights/dentsu-research-attention-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dentsu’s study</a> has proven that Spotify’s ability to run ads in different formats yields those benchmark-breaking metrics.</p>
<h3>Don’t skimp on the ad creative</h3>
<p>Strong ad creative is the biggest lever you can pull when it comes to making an engaged audience convert. Dentsu’s data showed that a poor creative can cause a <a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/news-and-insights/dentsu-research-attention-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">17%</a> decline in ad recall.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-ad-creative-example.jpg" alt="spotify advertising ad creative examples" width="778" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73608" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-ad-creative-example.jpg 778w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-ad-creative-example-480x370.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 778px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-IN/ad-experiences/sponsored-sessions-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Spotify allows you to create compelling ads with free built-in creative tools like background music and 3D audio (AKA the surround sound effect) and deliver them in an engaging format like Homepage Takeover or Overlay.</p>
<h3>Let the genre guide you</h3>
<p>Since audio ads have a 55-70 word range, you have to be economical with your choice of words. You don’t want to sound rushed or breathless, so edit with a heavy hand.</p>
<p>Knowing your audience well can help with that. If you’re going to serve ads to sports fans, you might want to play up the energy and sprinkle in some sports metaphors. But if the goal is to get in front of an audience that prioritizes wellness, you want to adopt a calm, soothing tone. 73% of the Sonic Science study participants were willing to listen to an ad if the tone fits their current activity.</p>
<h3>Write for real people’s ears</h3>
<p>Your priority is to connect with real listeners. Remember not to let rigid brand guidelines eliminate the human element from your script.</p>
<p>Use contractions, colloquialisms, and hang up the grammarian hat for a while. Infuse the script with your personality, a little bit of humor, and bring that main character energy.</p>

<h2>Spotify advertising costs: How much do you have to invest?</h2>
<p>Now that you understand how to run Spotify ads, let’s talk about how much they’re going to cost you.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-ad-spending-audio-channels.jpg" alt="spotify advertising ad spending on audio channels" width="936" height="527" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73609" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-ad-spending-audio-channels.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-ad-spending-audio-channels-480x270.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/amo/advertising/audio-advertising/digital-audio-advertising/united-states#ad-spending" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>While you can get started with the minimum daily budget is $15 and a lifetime minimum budget of $250 in the self-serve Ad Studio, here’s how the pricing works for all the models:</p>
<h3>Self-serve</h3>
<ul>
<li>Minimum lifetime spend: $250</li>
<li>Free access to background music, voice actors, and professional audio mixing.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s an auction for audio and video ads that are served while listeners stream music. If there’s more competition for your audience, you might have to place a more aggressive bid to effectively spend your budget.</p>
<p>Podcast ads, on the other hand, have fixed prices and aren’t part of the ad auction.</p>
<p>You can watch how the ad auction works <a href="https://youtu.be/oPzLoHn_h8w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Automated</h3>
<p>If you’re working with a DSP (demand-side platform), you can access Spotify inventory through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Private Marketplaces (PMPs) which have an auction-based model that allows for dynamic bidding, or…</li>
<li>Programmatic Guaranteed (PG) buys that have a fixed rate that you can discuss with a Spotify rep prior to launch.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Direct</h3>
<p>If you’re looking to create customized experiences, mix up the ad formats, or want a guaranteed inventory, you can speak to the Spotify team to set rates and campaign parameters. The pricing is based on the format, audience, and any add-ons you choose.</p>
<div id="reporting"></div>
<h2>How to measure Spotify advertising success</h2>
<p>Apart from using Spotify’s <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-06-13/evolving-brands-measurement-experience-with-all-new-spotify-ad-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built-in ad analytics</a>, you can work with approved third-party measurement partners to act on real-time insights and make changes to your ad or ad sets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/measure-spotify-advertising.gif" alt="measure spotify advertising" width="936" height="702" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73610" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/news-and-insights/introducing-spotify-ad-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>If you’re using Ad Studio, you’ll see some results on the dashboard in 24 hours. You can see how many people you’ve reached and the frequency with which your ad has been heard.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-NL/help-center/reporting-ad-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report tab</a>, you’ll receive a summary of delivery, performance, and audience insight metrics.</p>
<p>Some key metrics you may want to take note of include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Impressions</li>
<li>Completion rate</li>
<li>CPM (cost per impression)</li>
<li>CTR (click-through rate)</li>
<li>Ad played to X% (25%, 75%, or 100%)</li>
<li>Genre (what your audience was listening to before the ad played)</li>
</ul>
<p>These reports can easily be exported to your existing measurement tech stack if needed.</p>
<p>If you’re working with Spotify to manage your campaigns, you can tap into the custom measurement solutions on offer. Spotify has partnered with third-party measurement platforms to help you measure viewability and brand lift.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re asking investors to make a bet on your business or convincing a customer that yours is the right solution, an executive summary is a critical component of persuasion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Executive-summary-meme.jpg" alt="Executive summary example - meme of Spock talking about pursuasion" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-73503 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Executive-summary-meme.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Executive-summary-meme-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Why? Because many key decision-makers and gatekeepers won’t get past page one of your business plan without a really good reason.</p>
<p>And that’s where many people go astray. An executive summary isn’t the boiled down CliffsNotes of your business plan. It’s the sizzle reel. The movie trailer. It’s there you convince a busy client or executive that your company can bring them value.</p>
<p>So if you plan to write any type of business plan or project proposal, you’ll need to get great at writing executive summaries, too.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll break down the components of a winning executive summary. We’ll show you plenty of tips to make your summary persuasive. And we’ll give you an executive summary example you can swipe so writing your own is a breeze.</p>

<div id="what"></div>
<h2>What is an executive summary?</h2>
<p>An executive summary is a brief overview of a larger document—like a business plan—that grabs a reader&#8217;s attention and familiarizes them with the main points of the larger report. The executive summary isn’t just a teaser. It should be a condensed and skimmable version of everything you’ve provided in the full document.</p>
<p>You’ll place the summary at the beginning of your business plan. That way, a reader can learn what they need to know upfront, without wading through the entire plan. A version of your summary may also be useful as the copy on your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/27/guide-to-about-us-pages">“About Us” page</a>.</p>
<p>At a very high level, an executive summary for a business plan should do three things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Present the problem</strong>: A quick explanation of the problem you aim to solve.</li>
<li><strong>Suggest the solution and its costs</strong>: An overview of your proposed solution and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples"> value proposition</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Explain the benefits</strong> A summary of the benefits to clients and investors.</li>
</ul>
<p>To accomplish these goals, your executive summary should follow the same structure as your business plan and cover all of the same topics. In fact, you should assume some readers will make their decision based only on your summary without ever reading the full plan.</p>
<div id="purpose"></div>
<h2>What’s the purpose of an executive summary?</h2>
<p>Most people won’t take the time to read your entire 15-page business plan. At least not at first. You need an elevator pitch they can read in about five minutes that convinces them to consider your proposal. That’s what an executive summary does.</p>
<p>Let’s break that down into the ways an executive summary helps your reader make a decision about your business.</p>
<h3>Informs</h3>
<p>An executive summary gives the reader all the information they need to make an educated decision. It should include the most compelling data from your business plan. It’ll provide context about the current market, competitors, financials, and growth plans.</p>
<p>Men’s grooming brand Harry’s gives website visitor’s plenty of detail about their company on their About Us page, which acts as an executive summary about their business.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Executive-summary-example-harrys.jpg" alt="Executive summary example - Harry's shave club about us page" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-73504 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Executive-summary-example-harrys.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Executive-summary-example-harrys-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.harrys.com/en/us/our-story" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<h3>Proves</h3>
<p>You can’t just say there is a problem and that yours is the right solution. You’ll need to give enough background detail to prove those statements. Your executive summary should leave the reader with confidence in the opportunity you present.</p>
<h3>Persuades</h3>
<p>Within a few paragraphs, your executive summary should lead the reader to believe that the logical conclusion is to work with your business. You’ll use language and stats that build a case to that end.</p>
<p>Like Harry’s, hammock maker Yellow Leaf uses their About Us page like an executive summary about their company. In their version, the brand provides a persuasive argument that doing good and relaxing aren’t mutually exclusive.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Executive-summary-example-Yellowleaf.jpg" alt="Executive summary example - Yellowleave hammocks About US page" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-73505 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Executive-summary-example-Yellowleaf.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Executive-summary-example-Yellowleaf-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.yellowleafhammocks.com/pages/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<h3>Asks</h3>
<p>Unlike academic papers, a business plan often includes an ask for some action by the reader. It could be a request for a loan. Or it may ask a customer to choose your product or service. In any case, the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/05/best-call-to-action-phrases">call to action</a> (the next step you want the reader to take) should be clear.</p>
<div id="included"></div>
<h2>What’s included in an executive summary?</h2>
<p>No two executive summaries will be exactly alike. Your audience, goals, and type of business will all affect the final product. But there is a list of elements you’ll include in most types of summaries.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A problem statement</strong>. What’s the current situation? Why is it bad? What is the gap that needs to be filled?</li>
<li><strong>A solution statement</strong>. What is the business or product idea that will solve the problem and fill the gap?</li>

<h2>How to write an executive summary</h2>
<p>We’ve reviewed just how important and useful an executive summary is. But how do you go about writing one? Use these steps to craft a summary that gets people excited about your business–and drives them to take action.</p>
<h3>1. Complete your business plan first</h3>
<p>While a good executive summary functions as a standalone document, it is solely based on your business plan. So the first step is to complete the rest of the plan and use it to guide your summary.</p>
<h3>2. Decide who your reader will be</h3>
<p>You may write multiple executive summaries for the same business plan, each one targeting a different reader and purpose. If you’re asking the bank for a loan, you’ll probably focus more on short and long-term financials. Or if the summary is meant to convince someone to hire your company, the summary will lean heavier on social proof and capabilities.</p>
<p>Before you get to work, make sure you’re clear on your target audience and what information they’ll need to make a decision.</p>
<h3>3. Create an outline</h3>
<p>A structural outline of your executive summary will help you see where each piece of information fits. It’ll show you the logical progression from problem to conclusion. It’ll also make <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/07/improve-writing-skills">writing</a> the summary much easier.</p>
<h3>4. Write a compelling introduction</h3>
<p>The first few sentences should hook your reader so they want to keep reading. Write an introduction that quickly explains what your business is about and why it matters to your intended reader.</p>
<p>When a one-woman show becomes a billion-dollar industry trailblazer, it’s not hard to catch people’s attention in an executive summary. Be like Spanx and lead with the uniqueness of your business.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://spanx.com/pages/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<h3>5. Tell a story</h3>
<p>People are more likely to understand and take action on information presented in story form. As you’re writing your executive summary, make sure to include the characters (customers, business leaders), your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/02/how-to-write-a-business-mission-statement">mission statement</a>, and an arc that explains the current and future states.</p>

<h3>6. Write in a professional but approachable tone</h3>
<p>An executive summary is written for an executive (it says so right in the name!). So the language and layout you choose should be professional and confident.</p>
<p>That said, you don’t want to overcomplicate the summary. Remember, your audience is busy. The easier it is to understand your summary with a quick skim, the better your chances of getting them to say yes.</p>
<h3>7. Get feedback</h3>
<p>Have a few people read your executive summary in under five or 10 minutes. Then ask them questions like “what does my company do?” and “how will my business solve the problem?” The idea is to find out if your summary is easy to understand in a short amount of time.</p>

<h2>Tips for writing a compelling executive summary</h2>
<p>Your executive summary has a big job to do. Let’s make sure it’s ready to capture attention and motivate action.</p>
<h3>Keep it short</h3>
<p>For much the same reason, your executive summary shouldn’t be very long. For most business plans, a one or two page summary should be enough. It’ll almost never be longer than 10% of the entire business plan. A good rule of thumb is to make the summary as brief as possible while still being comprehensive.</p>
<h3>Avoid useless jargon</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/11/07/conversion-sabotaging-words">Useless jargon</a> like “industry-leading” and “bleeding edge” don’t add any substance to your position. At best, they’re extra words that slow readers down. At worst, they’ll hurt your credibility.</p>

<h3>Clearly state your differentiation</h3>
<p>Do you offer a low-cost alternative or “white glove” service? Will you cover a service area other businesses don’t? Your differentiation is important to customers, lenders, and investors, so they should know what it is after reading your executive summary.</p>

<h3>Add social proof</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/01/10/social-proof-guide">Social proof</a> includes reviews, referrals, and ratings from previous customers that say how amazing your business is. If you already have it, sprinkle in this positive feedback to prove that your business is what people want.</p>
<h3>Make it skimmable</h3>
<p>Use graphics, bullet points, and subheaders to get your point across to people who skim the document before reading. Ideally, a reader should be able to recite the major points after a 60-second scan.</p>
<h3>Refer directly to your business plan</h3>
<p>An executive summary should act as a reference guide to your business plan. If there’s expanded financial data in the plan that’s not in the summary, call it out and say where it is. Readers can then choose to dive into specific pieces of your business plan depending on their interests.</p>
<div id="example"></div>
<h2>Executive summary example</h2>
<p>Whenever you take on a new task, it helps to see all the parts in action. Here’s an executive summary I created for a fictitious business called Nirvana Studios. Swipe this template to write your next executive summary.</p>
<h3>Nirvana Studios executive summary example</h3>
<p>Since 2016, Nirvana Studios has provided boutique health and wellness services at accessible prices to communities around New York City.</p>
<p>People in these communities regularly fill waitlists for Reiki, sports massage, yoga, and nutritional support classes. And a recent survey showed that people of all generations now consider holistic wellness to be critical for long-term health.</p>
<p>That said, there are few opportunities for middle-income earners in New Jersey to access these important services. Existing local providers cater to high-income clients, leaving the bulk of the population unable to afford the benefits of holistic wellness.</p>
<p>By leveraging a proven and profitable operational model, a streamlined technology stack, and advantageous vendor relationships, Nirvana Studios can bring Reiki and the rest right to the New Jersey neighborhoods that need them most. We anticipate instant demand for these services, especially when delivered at rates the average office worker or plumber can afford.</p>
<p><strong>A record of successful growth</strong></p>
<p>In 2015, Nirvana Studios co-founders Imani Evans and Rosa Diaz—themselves yoga and Reiki master instructors—realized that they couldn’t afford the classes they taught. To solve the problem, Diaz and Evans worked with business consultants, commercial real estate professionals, and technology experts to create a business plan to reduce the overhead of running wellness studios while maintaining fair pay for instructors.</p>
<p>The resulting model allows Nirvana Studio locations to offer services similar to its competitors but at a 30% discount.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Executive-summary-graph-service-cost-1.jpg" alt="Executive summary example - Graphic showing cost comparison of services" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-73512 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Executive-summary-graph-service-cost-1.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Executive-summary-graph-service-cost-1-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The mix of experienced instructors, beautiful studios, and accessible pricing allowed Nirvana to quickly expand to 20 locations throughout the five boroughs.</p>
<p><strong>Unmatched investment opportunity</strong></p>
<p>Both market and company financials show that this is the right time to invest in Nirvana Studios.</p>
<p>For starters, there’s never been more public interest in holistic health. A recent Trudential Insurance report showed that 93% of their clients wanted more access to yoga and stretching classes. Meanwhile, the mentions of preventative health on social media skyrocketed by 483% between 2021 and 2023.</p>
<p>Nirvana is perfectly positioned to grow in this atmosphere of heightened need. With dramatically lower operational costs, the projected net profit for the proposed New Jersey locations is over 45%. That’s based on maintaining client pricing that’s 25% lower than existing studios in the market.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Executive-summary-graphic-profit.jpg" alt="Executive summary example - Graphic highlighting the company's 45% profit" width="936" height="382" class="aligncenter wp-image-73513 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Executive-summary-graphic-profit.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Executive-summary-graphic-profit-480x196.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Class fees from 10 new locations are expected to generate $50 million in the first full year of operation. In addition, it’s anticipated Nirvana will generate $5 million at an 80% profit margin in retail sales from branded clothing and products in the first full year of New Jersey operations.</p>
<p><strong>Financial requirements for expansion</strong></p>
<p>In order to maximize the opportunity for growth in the New Jersey Market, Nirvana Studios requires a $5 million dollar investment. The additional funds will be used to secure long-term leases, outfit physical locations, acquire equipment, and pay for marketing until the studios are operational.</p>
<p>In exchange for this investment, the investor will receive 10% ownership in Nirvana Studios NJ, LLC, a subsidiary of Nirvana Studios Inc.</p>
<p><strong>The right plan at the right time </strong></p>
<p>The Nirvana Studios mission has always been to provide holistic wellness to more people through operational excellence. Your investment accelerates that mission to make needed services available to thousands more people.</p>
<p>Considering anticipated growth and historic company financials, Nirvana Studio’s New Jersey expansion is an exciting opportunity to capitalize on an unprecedented growth trend.</p>
