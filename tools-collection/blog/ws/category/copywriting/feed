					<description><![CDATA[<p>SEO copywriting is still important, but it's changed. Learn how it works best now.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-copywriting">15 SEO Copywriting Tips to Rank Higher in 2025</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m the first to admit that search engines are getting a little wonky these days (looking at you, Google AI Overviews). But they’re still the leading source of traffic (around <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-statistics">53%</a>) to websites. And that means SEO copywriting is still a critical skill to have in 2025.</p>
<p>Of course, AI and zero-click searches have changed the rules of writing for search engine exposure significantly. So while many of the SEO fundamentals still apply, you’ll need a new playbook to get found on search (and AI) results pages.</p>
<p>In this guide, you’ll learn how to find the exact words your audiences search for and write content that both Google and readers love. Plus, you’ll get a bunch of copywriting tips that’ll ramp up your rankings on all search platforms.</p>

<h2>What is SEO copywriting?</h2>
<p>SEO copywriting is the practice of writing content designed to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google">rank well on search engines</a> while providing value and clarity to readers.</p>
<p><span>SEO copywriting is basically the creation of </span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/01/17/seo-content-beginners-guide">SEO content</a><span>—but while content can refer to an infographic that you place into a blog post or a video you create and optimize for </span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/10/youtube-seo-tips">YouTube SEO</a><span>, copywriting refers to the actual words in the written parts of your content.</span></p>
<p>Many of the tactics I give in this guide are about structuring content in a way that helps algorithms crawl and index it. But Google has gotten pretty clever at sniffing out copy that’s not great for people. So SEO copywriting also means creating content that’s helpful and interesting to your audience.</p>
<p>If you want to see a classic example of SEO copywriting, look at a top-ranking recipe post.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-cake.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - recipe blog." width="532" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93493 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-cake.webp 532w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-cake-480x541.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 532px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>They’ve got keywords everywhere they need to be (maybe more than needed, sometimes). Their content is structured so it’s skimmable, crawlable, and easy to follow. And they confirm their expertise (“I’ve been baking versions of this cake for 30 years”), so algorithms and followers trust what they say.</p>
<p>These content creators have perfected the recipe for SEO copywriting.</p>
<h3>SEO vs. GEO copywriting</h3>
<p>I want to quickly define a related tactic called <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/generative-engine-optimization">generative engine optimization</a> (GEO), AKA AI engine optimization (AIO). GEO refers to optimizing content so it gets cited by AI search engines, like Perplexity and Google’s AI-powered features.</p>
<p>I’m focusing on what it takes to rank on search engine results pages in this guide. But if you haven’t dug into GEO yet, this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-referral-traffic">guide to getting traffic from AI search engines</a> is a great place to start.</p>

<div id="how-to-do-seo-copywriting-for-higher-rankings"></div>
<h2>The complete guide to SEO copywriting for higher rankings (+examples)</h2>
<p>The goal of SEO copywriting is to get found in search engine results <em>and </em>get people to click on your content. These steps and tips help make both happen more often.</p>
<div id="conduct-keyword-research"></div>
<h3>1. Conduct keyword research</h3>
<p>Keyword research is the task of finding the terms people use to look for things on search engines. Even though Google and its competitors are smart enough now to understand the meaning of web pages without <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/exact-match">exact keyword matches</a>, it’s still a good practice to start with the best terms in mind.</p>
<p>Here’s a simplified version of how I find keywords using an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-seo-tools">SEO tool</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start with a general topic:</strong> I think of a question my target audience has, like “how do I file state taxes,” or “what’s the best way to paint an exterior door.”</li>
<li><strong>Find ranking posts:</strong> Next, I type in whatever idea I have into Google and see which posts are on the search engine results page (SERP) already.</li>
<li><strong>Use a tool to find the right keyword:</strong> Finally, I paste the URL of a ranking post into a keyword tool like Ahrefs to see which exact key phrases it’s ranking for.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-keywords-paint.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - list of keywords." width="937" height="460" class="aligncenter wp-image-93494 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-keywords-paint.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-keywords-paint-480x236.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>I can then pick one of those or dig deeper into things like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/12/keyword-difficulty">how difficult</a> it will be to rank for that keyword and how many people search for it every month.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a paid subscription to something like Ahrefs, WordStream’s<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool"> Free Keyword Tool</a> will come in very handy.</p>
<p>That’s a simplified version of my process&#8211;and it&#8217;s just one option you can try. Use this<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide"> guide to keyword research</a> for a more in-depth explanation.</p>
<p><strong>Keyword tip:</strong> Stick with keywords and topics that are relevant to your website. Google will happily suppress an accountant’s website that’s posting about popular video games just to get clicks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-physical-therapy.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - physical therapy blog." width="937" height="436" class="aligncenter wp-image-93495 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-physical-therapy.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-physical-therapy-480x223.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Keep your keyword topics relevant to your overall website to avoid Google penalties.</em></p>
<div id="understand-and-match-keyword-intent"></div>
<h3>2. Understand and match keyword intent</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-intent">Keyword intent</a> refers to the <em>reason</em> people search for the keyword you’re thinking about targeting. Generally speaking, there are four broad types of keyword intent:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Informational:</strong> A user wants to learn more about something, like a topic, product, or industry. Example: “history of Valentine’s Day”</li>
<li><strong>Navigational:</strong> A user wants to visit a specific website or web page. Example: “1800 flowers”</li>
<li><strong>Commercial:</strong> A user is researching products or services and has the intent to make a purchase in the near future. Example: “Best flowers for a friend on Valentine’s Day”</li>
<li><strong>Transactional:</strong> A user is ready to make a purchase. Example: “buy a bouquet of flowers”</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/keyword-search-intent-1-png.avif" alt="different types of keyword intents" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90734" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/keyword-search-intent-1-png.avif 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/keyword-search-intent-1-300x192.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/keyword-search-intent-1-768x492.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/keyword-search-intent-1-480x308.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" /></p>
<p>Since it’s in Google’s best interest to deliver its users top-notch search results, it rewards marketers who closely match keyword intent.</p>
<p>If you tried to target the keyword “history of Valentine’s Day” with the pricing page for your flower delivery service, you wouldn’t perform very well in the organic search results. Why? Because you’d fail to match keyword intent.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-valentines.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - results page for Valentine's Day." width="937" height="623" class="aligncenter wp-image-93496 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-valentines.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-valentines-480x319.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The intent of the keyphrase “history of Valentine’s Day” is informational, so you won’t see many commercial pages in the organic results.</em></p>
<p><strong>Keyword intent tip: </strong>Align your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">calls to action</a> with keyword intent, too. If it’s an informational keyword, use CTAs like “Subscribe for the latest news” or “Download this guide.” For transactional intent keywords, try “Buy now” or “Get a free quote.”</p>
<div id="target-ancillary-keywords"></div>
<h3>3. Target ancillary keywords</h3>
<p>A single piece of content can rank for several keywords. Ideally, much of your content will rank for several keywords.</p>
<p>Once you’ve picked a primary keyword, look for complementary terms that keep within the overall theme of the topic but don’t overlap 100%.</p>
<p>Say you want to target the term “back pain.” There are a bunch of ancillary keywords you could also target in the same content, like “what causes back pain” and “how to relieve lower back pain.”</p>
<p>You can use your keyword tool to find ancillary keywords. Or you can look at two features of the Google search page: People also ask and People also search for.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-pas.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - people also search screen." width="937" height="426" class="aligncenter wp-image-93497 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-pas.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-pas-480x218.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Those two features tell you what people search for next after reviewing the main keyword’s results. So they’re the perfect additions to make your content comprehensive and rank for more keywords with one asset.</p>
<p><strong>Ancillary keyword tip: </strong>Google’s search bar autofill is another way to quickly find ancillary keywords. Just start typing your primary keyword in the search bar and see what it autofills. Oh, and try doing this in “private” or “incognito mode” so your search history doesn’t affect the results.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-autofill.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - Google autofill." width="620" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93498 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-autofill.webp 620w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-autofill-480x465.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 620px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="place-keywords-strategically-and-naturally"></div>
<h3>4. Place keywords strategically and naturally</h3>
<p>Using keywords strategically means using them where they can have the most influence on search engines without negatively affecting the experience for readers.</p>
<p>Where should you use keywords? Wherever they can act as a signal that a webpage has the information a searcher is looking for. Here are the most common keyword placements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The page title</li>
<li>In your URL</li>
<li>Meta title tag</li>
<li>Meta description</li>
<li>In the introduction</li>
<li>In subtitles like H2s and H3s</li>
<li>Organically in the body copy</li>
</ul>
<p>This post ranked for the search term “how to choose a daycare.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-daycare.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - Daycare blog post." width="596" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93499 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-daycare.webp 596w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-daycare-480x483.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 596px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It has the exact keyphrase match in the title, and a couple of variations in the introduction. The keyphrase is also in the page’s URL and title tag.</p>
<p>It’s easy to go overboard here, but whatever you do, do NOT try to stuff your page full of keywords. That tactic worked for about 10 minutes at the dawn of SEO. Not only will it not help you rank, it’ll provide a terrible experience for your visitor, which, in turn, will hurt your chances of ranking.</p>
<p>Instead, use related terms and synonyms—like “daycare choices,” “options for daycare,” and “where to look for daycares online.” The goal is to balance SEO goals with a positive reader experience.</p>
<p><strong>Keyword placement tip:</strong> Only use keywords in the body of your text organically. That means placing them if they flow with the rest of your writing and feel conversational, rather than repetitive or forced.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Let’s keep this traffic train rolling!</strong> Get your free copy of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/increase-traffic-to-your-website?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website</a></p>
<div id="create-a-clear-structure"></div>
<h3>5. Create a clear structure</h3>
<p>A well-structured, easy-to-read page keeps readers rolling through longer pieces of content and helps search engines understand what it’s all about.</p>
<p>Structuring content for SEO means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/04/internal-linking">internal links</a> to other relevant pages of your site.</li>
<li>Organizing content into smaller sections and labeling them with clear headlines and subheadlines.</li>
<li>Using bullet points to share information faster.</li>
<li>Placing images to break up walls of text.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out this section of a long blog post about updating your house to increase its value.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-home-update.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - house upgrade blog post." width="411" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93500 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-home-update.webp 411w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-home-update-206x300.webp 206w" sizes="(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px" /></p>
<p>Bold type, subheadings by improvement type, internal links, attractive images&#8230;this post has it all! There’s a ton of information here, but it doesn’t ever feel exhausting to read.</p>
<p>Also, notice how concise the paragraphs are.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-short-paragraphs.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - house improvement blog post." width="647" height="266" class="aligncenter wp-image-93501 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-short-paragraphs.webp 647w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-short-paragraphs-480x197.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 647px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Remember, many people will read your content on a mobile phone. If they see a screen full of text for days, they’re going to hit the back button (which tells Google your content doesn’t deserve to rank).</p>
<p><strong>SEO structure tip:</strong> Look for ways to display chunks of information in more digestible ways. Charts, graphs, infographics, and tables are great options.</p>
<div id="get-to-the-point"></div>
<h3>6. Get to the point</h3>
<p>I’ll admit that I’ve been known to write a lengthy introduction every now and then. As valuable as that may be for those writing term papers or Dickensian novels, when we’re talking about SEO copywriting, we have to keep in mind the ultimate goal: to create <strong>relevant </strong>content. Relevant content, after all, is the stuff Google puts at the top of the organic results.</p>
<p>Though creating relevant content is largely about matching keyword intent, that’s not the <em>only </em>consideration; it’s also important to prove to Google that your content is pertinent. As I’ve learned first-hand, an effective way to prove the pertinence of your content is to <strong>target your main keyword early on in your copy.</strong></p>
<p>To see what I mean, take a look at the first two paragraphs of <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/improve-your-email-subject-line" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this HubSpot article</a> about writing email subject lines:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/seo-copywriting-get-to-the-point.jpg" alt="seo copywriting example from HubSpot" width="739" height="162" /></div>
<p>By 50 words in, the writer’s already targeted her main keyword three times. Is that the sole reason this post tops the organic results? No, but it’s certainly one of them. Take a page out of the HubSpot playbook and increase <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-density">keyword density</a> at the beginning of your next blog post.</p>
<div id="optimize-for-googles-e-e-a-t"></div>
<h3>7. Optimize for Google’s E-E-A-T</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/14/google-e-e-a-t">Google&#8217;s E-E-A-T</a> is a set of criteria Google uses to assess the quality of webpages and content. Although Google says they don’t use them as a ranking factor, following the guidelines of E-E-A-T can prove to search engines (AI and traditional) that your website deserves exposure.</p>
<p>Here’s what E-E-A-T stands for and how you can show it in your content:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Experience:</strong> Share personal experiences, first-hand knowledge, and your results.</li>
<li><strong>Expertise:</strong> Stay within the topical realm of your website, include credentials in author bios, and cite only credible sources.</li>
<li><strong>Authoritativeness:</strong> Get backlinks from credible websites and encourage mentions of your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Trustworthiness:</strong> Verify the information you share, nurture a solid online reputation, and be transparent.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key to all of this is remembering that trust isn’t just one of the criteria; it’s at the center of them all.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-eeat.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - EEAT graphic." width="881" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93502 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-eeat.webp 881w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-eeat-480x327.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 881px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As a bonus, AI search results ground some of their responses in the E-E-A-T principles. As you work to make your content more trustworthy to Google, you could land on more AI search results pages.</p>
<p><strong>E-E-A-T tip:</strong> Original data has always been a great addition to content. But now, with some brands leaning hard on AI-generated copy, those survey results or unique research studies will help you stand out even more.</p>

<h3>8. Cover the topic in depth</h3>
<p>Many informational topics require a comprehensive answer covering several subtopics. Opening a business, for example, is a scary thing to do and has many facets to it.</p>
<p>The table of contents in a post from NerdWallet shows how exhaustive they’ve covered the topic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-business-toc.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - table of contents for a comprehensive blog post." width="596" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93507 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-business-toc.webp 596w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-business-toc-480x483.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 596px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is the kind of energy you’ll need to bring to big topics like this to rank.</p>
<p>And you can add even more value to your post by including internal links to more resources. That’ll also help Google know that your website is an authoritative resource on the topic.</p>
<p>Look at all the organized internal links just in the first section of that NerdWallet post.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-business-links.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - NerdWallet post." width="937" height="421" class="aligncenter wp-image-93508 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-business-links.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-business-links-480x216.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="think-hard-about-your-headline"></div>
<h3>9. Think hard about your headline</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon to spend hours writing a beautifully optimized 2,500-word blog post, only to dedicate 45 seconds to writing a mediocre headline (I&#8217;ve done it!). That’s like spending years on the interior design of a beautiful home and then throwing on a second-hand, unpainted door nobody wants to walk through.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll make your content way more competitive in the SERPs if you set aside a substantial amount of time for brainstorming headlines. It may feel like you&#8217;re overindexing on a few words. But trust me, when your organic CTR skyrockets and your pageviews go through the roof, you’ll be happy you did it.</p>
<p>There are entire books dedicated to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/07/17/headline-writing">writing great headlines</a>. These headline ideas will get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a sense of urgency</li>
<li>Ask questions</li>
<li>Keep it concise</li>
<li>Feature your keywords</li>
<li>Establish your authority</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/headline-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">headline example</a> that uses a question to create a curiosity gap that readers will want to fill (by clicking your link!).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-242154 size-full" src="https://localiq.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/headline-examples-localiq-vitamins-png.webp" alt="headline examples - headline for vitamin article." width="1810" height="584" /></p>
<p><strong>Headline tip:</strong> Keep your titles to around 50 to 60 characters max to increase your chances Google won&#8217;t shorten (or change it) in the SERP.</p>
<div id="get-more-clicks-with-optimized-meta-descriptions"></div>
<h3>10. Get more clicks with optimized meta descriptions</h3>
<p>I mentioned using keywords in meta tags. That’s part of optimizing these key SEO components.</p>
<p>Quick catch-up if you’re newer to SEO: <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/meta-description">Meta descriptions</a> are a brief description of your website for search engines.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-electric-serp.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - electrician search result." width="937" height="181" class="aligncenter wp-image-93503 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-electric-serp.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-electric-serp-480x93.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As you’re meta descriptions, remember that it’s prime real estate to teach a search engine about your site and convince people to click your link.</p>
<p>Here are some things to think about to optimize your meta description for SEO:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lead with search intent.</li>
<li>Include details and results.</li>
<li>Add a clear call to action.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-dentist-serp.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - Dentist search result." width="937" height="223" class="aligncenter wp-image-93504 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-dentist-serp.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-dentist-serp-480x114.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The title tag and meta description in this search result are well-optimized for the search term “best dentist for kids in Chicago.”</p>
<p><strong>Meta tag optimization tip:</strong> Use numbers and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/22/power-words">power words</a> in your meta copy. For example, say “save up to 70% off” instead of “get big discounts.”</p>

<div id="shoot-for-zero-click-searches"></div>
<h3>11. Shoot for zero-click searches (where applicable)</h3>
<p>Nearly <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-search-zero-click-study-2024-443869">60%</a> of Google searches resulted in a click in 2024. Meaning that now, most of the time, users leave the SERP without clicking a single hyperlink.</p>
</div>
<p>Before AI took over results pages, featured snippets were the main culprit for the zero-click trend. Featured snippets still exist. But now, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-overviews-impact-on-seo">AI Overviews</a> are delivering complete answers right in the SERP. So searchers don&#8217;t have to click a link to learn how to winterize their homes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-aio.webp" alt="SEO copywriting -" width="649" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93519 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-aio.webp 649w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-aio-480x444.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 649px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="examples-of-seo-copywriting">
<p>The good news is that Google also offers links, citations, images, and videos from the content it uses to create its AI Overviews. That means there&#8217;s at least a chance of some brand exposure, and maybe a click, in these AI answers. Here&#8217;s what that looks like for our home winterization result.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-aio-citations.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - AI Overview citations." width="937" height="416" class="aligncenter wp-image-93521 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-aio-citations.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-aio-citations-480x213.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The even better news is that you can shoot to show up in both a featured snippet and an AI Overview. They both tend to answer direct, informational queries. Make sure you answer the fundamental SEO questions in your content with concise answers in a few sentences or less. In our example, that means including a sentence that goes something like &#8220;To winterize your home, do [this], [this], and [this].&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>There&#8217;s more to this story, and we tell it all in the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/generative-engine-optimization">guide to GEO</a> I mentioned earlier.</p>
<div id="examples-of-seo-copywriting">
<div id="add-faqs"></div>
<h3>12. Add FAQs</h3>
<p>An <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/24/faq-page">FAQ section</a> in a blog post or sales page is a fantastic way to provide those concise answers that featured snippets and AI Overviews love to cite. They also let you quickly target secondary keywords.</p>
</div>
<p>This is an especially useful tactic for your most important keywords. Sprinklr offers a social listening tool. So it&#8217;d be big for them to rank for the keyphrase &#8220;best social listening tools.&#8221; They published a blog post on the topic, and then added an expandable FAQ section that covered the main and secondary keywords.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-faq-1.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - FAQ example." width="759" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93524 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-faq-1.webp 759w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-faq-1-480x379.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 759px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to make your FAQ expandable. But do make sure and use subheaders like H3s to break it up into smaller sections.</p>
<div id="examples-of-seo-copywriting">
<div id="include-real-life-examples"></div>
<h3>13. Include real-life examples</h3>
<p>Notice how throughout this post I&#8217;ve included examples of real SEO copywriting. That&#8217;s a great SEO copywriting tip I hope everyone uses more often.</p>
<p>Real-life examples do a few things for your SEO and overall value of your content:</p>
<ul>
<li>They add credibility to your content since what you say is happening in the wild.</li>
<li>They give you something to &#8220;deconstruct&#8221; to help readers grasp the concepts you&#8217;re sharing.</li>
<li>They offer a reason to add visuals, which breaks up your long-form content.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real-life examples tip:</strong> Try adding the word &#8220;examples&#8221; to some of your most important keywords to see if those new keyphrases are worth targeting, too. So if you want to rank for &#8220;How to create a landing page,&#8221; look at &#8220;Best landing page examples&#8221; as an additional keyword to target.</p>
</div>
<div id="bake-in-local-seo"></div>
<h3>14. Bake in local SEO</h3>
<p>Even if someone doesn’t explicitly type the city they’re in, Google will still match searchers up to local businesses that are clearly near them. So it’s extra important for<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-seo-in-2024"> local SEO</a> to add geo-targeted keywords throughout their site.</p>
<p>Have a quick look at this Brooklyn plumber’s website.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-plumber.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - plumber website." width="871" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93506 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-plumber.webp 871w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-plumber-480x331.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 871px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The word Brooklyn appears five times in this section, and more than a dozen times total as you scroll through the page.</p>
<div id="prove-your-trustworthiness"></div>
<h3>15. Prove your trustworthiness</h3>
<p>Ideally, Google only ranks trustworthy sites. That isn’t always the reality, but it’s a good assumption to work from. And it is often true for sensitive topics like finances, health, and safety, which Google calls Your Money or Your Life (YMYL) topics.</p>
<p>BetterHelp demonstrates its credibility by featuring a review from a mental healthcare professional.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-betterhealth.webp" alt="SEO copywriting - BetterHelp blog post." width="937" height="496" class="aligncenter wp-image-93509 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-betterhealth.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seo-copywriting-tips-wordstream-betterhealth-480x254.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>That should be a signal to Google that it’s a trustworthy post. And even better, readers can trust it more, too.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t publish content about YMYL topics, it’s still useful to share your authors’ expertise in their bios or in the posts themselves.</p>
<div id="seo-copywriting-stats-and-trends"></div>
<h2>SEO copywriting stats and trends to guide your next project</h2>
<p>SEO copywriting is evolving quickly (faster than I’ve seen it change in over a decade!). Here’s what the numbers tell us is happening.</p>
<h3>Is SEO copywriting still important?</h3>
<p>There are plenty of soothsayers claiming that SEO and SEO copywriting are dead. The data tells a different story:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.digitalsilk.com/digital-trends/top-seo-statistics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>53.3%</strong></a><strong> of all website traffic comes from organic search</strong>: This underlines how pivotal SEO-written content still is to website visibility.</li>
<li><strong>SEO drives over </strong><a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/seo-statistics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>1,000%</strong></a><strong> more traffic than organic social media</strong>: That shows how powerful search-focused copy is at attracting visitors.</li>
<li><strong>Leads from SEO have a </strong><a href="https://aioseo.com/seo-statistics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>14.6%</strong></a><strong> close rate</strong>: This is notably higher than many other lead sources, highlighting SEO copy’s influence on conversions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What’s working in SEO copywriting now?</h3>
<p>Here are a few places SEO copywriters should put their focus:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content <a href="https://aioseo.com/seo-statistics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 3,000 words</a> wins 3X more traffic</strong>: And 4X more shares, and 3.5X more backlinks than average-length content (~1,400 words), emphasizing the value of in-depth SEO content.</li>
<li><strong>Featured snippets boast the highest click‑through rate of around </strong><a href="https://aioseo.com/seo-statistics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>42.9%</strong></a>: That tells us the impact of structuring copy to target “snippet” placements.</li>
<li><a href="https://aioseo.com/seo-statistics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>52%</strong></a><strong> of sources cited in Google AI Overviews rank in the top 10 results</strong>: So, if we continue to work on traditional SEO copywriting strategies, we can also achieve visibility in AI-generated responses.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How is AI reshaping SEO copywriting?</h3>
<p>AI is heavily impacting both the creation side and the demand side of SEO. Here are a few ways it’s happening:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ai-has-upended-the-search-game-marketers-are-scrambling-to-catch-up-84264b34?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>80%</strong></a><strong> of consumers now resolve 40% of searches without clicking any links (zero-click searches): </strong>Brands need to optimize content for AI platforms and consider targeting awareness from zero-click searches.</li>
<li><a href="https://seoprofy.com/blog/seo-statistics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>67%</strong></a><strong> of small businesses use AI to improve their content and SEO</strong>: AI is leveling the playing field for small and local businesses so they can compete online with the big guys.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.siegemedia.com/strategy/ai-writing-statistics?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>75%</strong></a><strong> of content marketers plan to use AI to support content marketing efforts in 2025</strong>: That’s up from 64.7% in 2023—demonstrating a steep and growing reliance on AI in content creation strategy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prepare for the future of SEO copywriting</h2>
<p>SEO copywriting will continue to be important for a long time. It just may be that writers target different types of keywords for many platforms beyond Google. And although many of the core principles remain intact, there are nuances to ranking on non-traditional search platforms we’ll all need to learn.</p>
<p>No matter what happens, though, keep leading with value for the reader. Hopefully, that will never go out of style.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want to boost subscriptions for your underwear newsletter? Or make people emotional about a sweat-proof T-shirt? As you’ll see throughout this article, a well-crafted call to action (CTA) can do that.</p>
<p>CTAs are the most important copy on any page. They’re your closing argument—your final shot at convincing skeptical readers that clicking a button will improve their lives. That’s a lot of heavy lifting for a few little words.</p>
<p>I asked several experienced marketers to deconstruct some of their favorite recent CTAs. They explained what makes them so darn effective and how they could be even better. Each one revealed a different aspect of conversion copywriting that’ll make your next CTA absolutely unskippable.</p>

<h2>8 great CTAs deconstructed by the pros</h2>
<p>How can a handful of words convince so many people to take a specific action? These examples show how emotion, specificity, and a little psychology make it happen.</p>
<div id="match-cta-to-your-audience"></div>
<h3>1. Match the CTA to your audience</h3>
<p>Randomly glance at a hundred <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">calls to action</a>, and you’re bound to see “Buy now” and “Shop now” at least a few times. And why not? They lead with a strong action verb, and they work.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/mailtrap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daria Roshchyna</a>, a Technical Content Writer at <a href="https://mailtrap.io/email-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mailtrap Email Marketing</a>, believes there’s an even better way. “I prefer when companies tailor CTAs to match their audience’s needs and shopping habits,” she said.</p>
<p>She points to Amazon’s ads as one example. “Amazon is often used to buy gifts for the whole family. It’s a necessity. Their CTAs: ‘For her,’ ‘For him,’ and ‘For kids’ make finding the right product quick and simple.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-amazon.webp" alt="call to action ideas - Amazon ad with three CTAs." width="502" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87025 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-amazon.webp 502w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-amazon-480x574.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 502px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>These semi-personalized CTAs remove one layer of friction from the buying process. If the button just said “Shop now,” the shopper would get to a generic <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">landing page</a> and need to filter for the type of person they’re shopping for. Instead, they get to where they need to be one click faster.</p>
<h4>How to swipe this CTA strategy</h4>
<p>Think about how you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/04/customer-segmentation-models">segment your audience</a>. Is it by use case like “at the beach,” “at the campsite,” and “at the job site?” Or maybe it’s by “enterprise,” “small business,” and “solopreneur.”</p>
<p>Once you’ve sorted that out, tag your CTAs using those delineations. Then, have each CTA lead to a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/10/high-converting-landing-pages">conversion landing page</a> purpose-built for that audience segment. You will make it easier for your customers to buy and make the experience feel more relevant (which is always a goal for<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/copywriting-101"> great copywriting</a>).</p>

<h3>2. Use a pre-CTA</h3>
<p>I suppose a company that sells underwear is well-versed in making a lot out of a little. So it wasn’t surprising when <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/victoradedara/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Victor Adedara</a>, an experienced email and landing page copywriter for DTC brands, said that MeUndies had a strategy for getting the most out of its CTAs.</p>
<p>“CTA buttons are essential for driving clicks, but best practices suggest limiting them to just three or four words,” Victor explained. “That’s a tight window to make a compelling case for action. But MeUndies has cracked the code by using a pre-CTA—a short phrase right above the final CTA button.”</p>
<p>You may also expect such a brand to be a bit cheeky in their copy. And you’d be right. Victor shared this CTA example, encouraging people to follow the brand’s social channels.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-meundies.webp" alt="call to action ideas - MeUndies CTA" width="807" height="589" class="aligncenter wp-image-87026 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-meundies.webp 807w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-meundies-480x350.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 807px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>“‘We post butts. Lots of butts’ works as the hook, priming users to click the simple two-word CTA, ‘Follow Us,’” Victor pointed out. “The pre-CTA adds an extra layer of motivation, making the main CTA more persuasive.”</p>
<p>The voice, the tone, and the tactic all work in MeUndies’ favor.</p>
<h4>How to swipe this CTA strategy</h4>
<p>Your CTA button doesn’t have much space, but what about the page, email, or post surrounding it? That’s where your call to action can really shine. Add some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotional language</a>. Use a little intrigue. And stir up the reader’s imagination.</p>
<p>Just like MeUndies, though, make sure your pre-CTA is on brand. If the rest of your message is friendly but subdued, don’t give the reader whiplash with a brash bit of copy.</p>
<div id="be-emotional-and-empathetic"></div>
<h3>3. Be emotional and empathetic</h3>
<p>Your customers have a problem. You can solve it. Your best CTA will not only say that, but it will say it in a way that lets your customers feel seen.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/colby-flood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colby Flood</a>, Founder at <a href="http://www.dataally.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DataAlly</a>, brought up the perfect example of a CTA that’s both emotional and empathic. The company is called Thompson Tees. Its undershirts are made for people with hyperhidrosis, a medical condition that causes excessive sweating and is exacerbated by anxiety and fear.</p>
<p>“The purpose of this project was to create a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/colby-flood_the-brighter-click-team-had-a-blast-planning-activity-7235292180020375553-Jev4?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provocative ad</a> that leverages the concept of facing your fears and animating it to capture attention by showing a common bucket list item (skydiving) and a fear most everyone can relate to, a fear of heights or falling,” Colby said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-thompson-tee.webp" alt="call to action ideas - ad from Thompson Tee" width="391" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87027 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-thompson-tee.webp 391w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-thompson-tee-196x300.webp 196w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px" /></p>
<p>“This sweat test ad includes a CTA to help you face your personal fears and overcome them with Thompson Tees,” he continued. “Hyperhidrosis causes many people to isolate and not live their life, so we created this provocative ad to hook their attention and provide an opportunity to get out and live life to the fullest.”</p>
<p>Colby said the ad earned a ROAS of 3.69X over 30 days, proof that it connected with its audience.</p>
<h4>How to swipe this CTA strategy</h4>
<p>The first step is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">find your target audience</a> and get to know them. Learn what they buy and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/types-of-customer-needs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">why they buy it</a>. As the adage goes, are they buying a drill or the holes it makes? Once you understand your core buyer’s motivation to take action, build your CTA around that.</p>
<p>Sometimes, that’s easier said than done. I find it helpful to read online forums where people talk about the challenge a product solves. For example, Colby shared this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6mtees/after_years_and_years_i_finally_found_a_cure_for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link to a Reddit conversation</a> about hyperhidrosis. Those personal stories help you relate to the people you want to connect with.</p>
<div id="foster-that-fomo"></div>
<h3>4. Foster that FOMO</h3>
<p>At this point, FOMO (fear of missing out) may feel a little cliche. But there’s a reason it still comes up in so many copywriting tutorials…it works!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/milica-ugrenovic-contentwriter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Milica Ugrenovic</a>, a freelance content manager, showed me a great example of FOMO in action.</p>
<p>“Here’s a CTA that recently made me click,” she said. “It is short and to the point but very clever because it makes you feel like you’ve lost something you had.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-lastpass-1.webp" alt="call to action ideas - add from LastPass." width="479" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87058 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-lastpass-1.webp 479w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-lastpass-1-240x300.webp 240w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px" /></p>
<p>Milica said this CTA works so well because people who see it have made the product part of their workflow. “I got comfortable using the features, and now I don’t have them anymore. It takes FOMO to a whole new level.”</p>
<p>FOMO works best when it’s tied to a sense of urgency. And Milica said that’s something this CTA missed. “One thing that would really make it even better is a deadline. If I saw a deadline timer right below it with a countdown, it would make me do it even faster.</p>
<h4>How to swipe this CTA strategy</h4>
<p>The type of FOMO used in this CTA would be great for free trials, subscription services, and abandoned carts. But there are plenty of other FOMO varietals out there. One of my favorite versions is <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/bandwagon-advertising">bandwagon marketing</a>. That’s where you show happy customers having their best lives with your product so everyone else wants in.</p>
<p>As for tethering urgency to your CTA, Milica suggested “adding real-time personalized deadlines” using a product like <a href="https://www.deadlinefunnel.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwsoe5BhDiARIsAOXVoUurQnsHGbvzRbfLzMuOklYpiMyKHbBu8d5zEMcSdP86nc4KYhIoJ54aAmU0EALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deadline Funnel</a>.</p>
<div id="ask-educate-and-connect"></div>
<h3>5. Ask, educate, and connect</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaitlin-graham-bba7411b7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaitlin Graham</a> is a freelance copywriter and editor. Here’s the CTA she uses in her newsletter.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-freelance-newsletter-1.webp" alt="call to action ideas - cta for a newsletter" width="936" height="237" class="aligncenter wp-image-87059 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-freelance-newsletter-1.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-freelance-newsletter-1-480x122.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Look closely and you’ll see three elements she’s built into it: asking, educating, and connecting.</p>
<p>“[This CTA] works because it asks the audience a question and simply educates them on what I offer,” Kaitlin said. “It also provides a way to get in contact with me, which is the action I&#8217;m calling them to do.”</p>
<p>CTAs are also a fantastic place to include one final hit of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/01/10/social-proof-guide">social proof</a>, which Kaitlin cleverly tags in a postscript. “The P.S. is an extra touch I like to have to give them additional experience about my expertise.”</p>
<p>There are three more elements of Kaitlin’s CTA worth calling out:</p>
<ol>
<li>The verb “leap” is unexpected and energetic.</li>
<li>She’s clear that the first exchange will be to “discuss rates.”</li>
<li>“I’ll make it easy for you” is a great way to reduce perceived friction.</li>
</ol>
<h4>How to swipe this CTA strategy</h4>
<p>Kaitlin’s laid out a simple three-layer CTA that’s easy to mimic. Just ask your audience a question, educate them on the offer, and provide a way to connect.</p>
<p>You can reuse this format to sell almost anything. Say you market anti-odor, orthotic shoes (do those exist?); your CTA could be: “Are you ready to have fantastic feet forever? Our patented ortho-fresh footwear captures odors while providing all-day support. Click the link for your personalized fitting.”</p>
<div id="try-the-cliffhanger-approach"></div>
<h3>6. Try the cliffhanger approach</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinoberman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justin Oberman</a>—copywriter, ghostwriter, marketing consultant—has a sneaky little tactic for cranking reader curiosity up to 11. Find out what it is in tomorrow’s blog post.</p>
<p>Just kidding. But Justin’s strategy is no joke. He replaces the typical CTA with a cliffhanger that makes you want to learn what’s next.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/justinoberman_copywriting-ghostwriting-personalbranding-activity-7227456073824096257-Mh06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn post</a> he sent me as an example.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-freelance-cliffhanger-final.webp" alt="call to action ideas - LinkedIn post about cliffhanger CTAs" width="936" height="509" class="aligncenter wp-image-87060 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-freelance-cliffhanger-final.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-freelance-cliffhanger-final-480x261.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Yes, it’s a cliffhanger CTA about cliffhanger CTAs. It’s also pretty effective when done right. We are naturally curious creatures, and an unanswered question will nag at us enough to take action. And since the goal is to get someone to take action, a cliffhanger is a natural device for a CTA.</p>
<h4>How to swipe this CTA strategy</h4>
<p>You can use a cliffhanger CTA to announce all sorts of products and launches. Are you releasing a new color variant? Use a cliffhanger CTA in this week’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/25/email-newsletter-ideas">newsletter</a> to hint at it. Did you find a shocking result in your latest survey? Ask people to click on the report to see what it is.</p>
<p>Remember that the payoff must match the wait, no matter how you use it. The longer the buildup, the bigger the benefit. For small stakes, asking people to click to the next page is appropriate. Don’t expect them to give you all their contact details or come back a week later for a small tidbit of information, though.</p>
<div id="be-extremely-explicit"></div>
<h3>7. Be extremely (excruciatingly) explicit</h3>
<p>As much as I love puns, I love specificity in copywriting even more. What do I need to do? What exactly will I get? When will I get it? And—this one’s important—how will it make my life better?</p>
<p>That’s why I loved the CTA example <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammod-munir-53a6211a3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mohammod Munir</a>, Content Manager at <a href="https://www.agencyhandy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AgencyHandy</a>, showed me. “It’s pretty scarce to see good CTAs,” he said. “But I liked this Brevo CTA because it’s persuasive and explains the offer.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-brevo.webp" alt="call to action ideas - Brevos CTA." width="806" height="285" class="aligncenter wp-image-87035 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-brevo.webp 806w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-brevo-480x170.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 806px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>When I read this CTA copy, I know what I’m getting. Plus, the button copy makes it clear that it is truly free. And I also know how that’ll make my life better (by growing my email list).</p>
<p>This particular CTA sits at the bottom of a <a href="https://www.brevo.com/blog/what-is-email-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/01/email-marketing-tips">email marketing</a>. So there’s another good reminder here about matching the CTA to the context of the content around it.</p>
<h4>How to swipe this CTA strategy</h4>
<p>First of all, be excruciatingly specific. Specificity informs and builds trust. For example, saying, “Click here to double your sales,” is less evocative than saying, &#8220;Click here to increase your sales by 105%.”</p>
<p>Mohammod also said he “believes mid-sized CTAs are good,” provided they’re not too long. You don’t want any wasted words to slow down the reader. But if it takes 25 words to explain the offer properly, go for it.</p>
<div id="offer-an-instant-benefit"></div>
<h3>8. Offer an instant benefit</h3>
<p>None of us like waiting when a good thing is headed our way. Case in point: how many times do you tap the “Track my shipment” link on every Amazon order? <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aidan-axelsen-34018559/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aidan Khalilova</a>, a Social Advertising Team Lead at <a href="http://localiq.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LocaliQ</a>, shared two CTAs that expertly capitalize on this psychological trigger.</p>
<p>“This CTA from Spotify works for two reasons,” she said. “First, it’s simple. You can understand the entire message in a millisecond. And second, it promises instant gratification.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-spotify.webp" alt="call to action ideas - Spotify CTA" width="609" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87036 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-spotify.webp 609w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-spotify-480x473.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 609px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The message is so clear. Here’s what you get, here’s how to get it, and (implied) you get it right now.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-canva.webp" alt="call to action ideas - canva CTA" width="788" height="267" class="aligncenter wp-image-87038 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-canva.webp 788w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cta-examples-wordstream-canva-480x163.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 788px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Canva’s copywriters pulled the same levers with this CTA.</p>
<p>“The header confirms you’ll be creating new projects today, and the button copy suggests you can get to work as soon as you click it,” Aidan explained. “Plus, the whole message is inspirational and invokes curiosity, which makes it all the more actionable.”</p>
<h4>How to swipe this CTA strategy</h4>
<p>This might be the easiest addition you can make to all of your CTAs. Just make it clear that whatever is on the other side of the click will happen instantly (or at least quickly). Try adding the word “now” to a discount CTA like “Save 30% now” or incorporate the word “start” like Spotify and Canva did.</p>
<h2>Start writing better CTAs now</h2>
<p>The quote, “I didn’t have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one,” could have been said about CTAs. It can take a ton of time to distill all the information and emotion of your pitch into a few words.</p>
<p>The cadre of tips from these marketing pros will help. They show several copywriting tactics that’ll make your CTAs more relevant and compelling. But above all else, remember to prioritize clarity first, conciseness second, and cleverness third.</p>

<h2>What is a positioning statement?</h2>
<p>A positioning statement is a way of defining where your brand stands in the market. It consists of your target audience, the problem you solve, your unique value, and other key benefits. It’s different from a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/02/how-to-write-a-business-mission-statement">mission statement</a>, which describes your overall purpose and values. It’s also different from your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/unique-selling-proposition">unique selling proposition</a> (USP), which focuses solely on what makes you unique.</p>
<p>Your mission statement is more of an internal driver of culture and alignment, while your positioning statement is more of a tactical and external guide for your marketing strategy and messaging.</p>

<h2>Final tips for crafting an effective positioning statement</h2>
<p>Here are a few last tips to write a great positioning statement:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Keep it concise</strong>: Aim for clarity and brevity. A positioning statement should be one to two sentences, easy to understand, and memorable.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on your audience</strong>: Always prioritize the needs and desires of your target audience. Think <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/23/buyer-personas">personas</a>. Your statement should resonate with them and address their key pain points.</li>
<li><strong>Be specific</strong>: Avoid vague language and (picture me making a gaggy face) generic cliche statements. Clearly spell out the unique features and benefits that set your brand apart from competitors.</li>
<li><strong>Stay authentic</strong>: This is a big one! Make sure your positioning aligns with your brand’s true strengths and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/09/company-core-values">core values</a>. Don’t write something just to write it, don’t overpromise or overhype, and definitely don’t misrepresent what you offer.</li>
<li><strong>Test and refine</strong>: Share your positioning statement with coworkers, customers, and partners and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-get-customer-feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ask for feedback</a>. And once you have it just right, be prepared to make adjustments as your business evolves.</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Copywriting is a fundamental element of marketing. Your copy appears in your ads, on your website, across your social channels, and more. That’s why it’s so important to have strong, persuasive, and attention-grabbing copy. In this crash course in writing great copy, we’ll cover what copywriting is, what a copywriter does, and how to write great copy.</p>

<h2>What is copywriting?</h2>
<p>Copywriting is creating text that’s explicitly meant to encourage an action. This kind of writing includes all <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/online-ads">types of ads</a>—social, search, out-of-home, and more. But it also includes headlines for a graphic encouraging event sign-ups, sidebars persuading a website visitor to start a free trial, or headlines offering a promotion in exchange for a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/11/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups">newsletter sign-up</a>.</p>
<p>This is all copy with the expressed goal of eliciting an action. This purpose is more important than the length of the copy or its placement.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-rakuten.webp" alt="copywriting example from rakuten" width="839" height="383" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85510" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-rakuten.webp 839w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-rakuten-480x219.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 839px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This page from </em><a href="https://rakutenadvertising.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Rakuten</em></a><em> directs visitors to two actions: one click for each audience it is targeting.</em></p>
<p>This purpose is also the primary difference between content marketing and copywriting, too.</p>

<div id="copywriting-vs-content-marketing"></div>
<h2>Copywriting vs. content marketing</h2>
<p>Copywriting drives the reader to a specific action, while <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/12/28/content-marketing-advice">content marketing</a> informs, educates, or entertains the reader. This is a longer-term strategy to grow your audience, build trust with your readers, and ultimately inspire loyalty to your brand.</p>
<p>Now, does content marketing sometimes point you toward an action? Absolutely. Here’s a good example.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-marketing-vs-copywriting.webp" alt="example of content marketing " width="631" height="117" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85511" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-marketing-vs-copywriting.webp 631w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/content-marketing-vs-copywriting-480x89.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 631px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This excerpt from a blog post about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/03/ad-copy-examples">ad copy</a> directs readers to another relevant post about ad copywriting tips pretty explicitly in that last sentence. This is a super common practice in content marketing, but remember, it’s not the explicit purpose of any piece of content. That’s one line in a long, in-depth post that breaks down why ad copy examples work well.</p>
<p>Another easy-to-spot difference is the medium: While content can refer to anything from infographics to videos to long-form writing, copy is always text. Text that’s trying to persuade its reader into an action.</p>
<div id="what-does-a-copywriter-do"></div>
<h2>What is a copywriter?</h2>
<p>A copywriter writes ads, headlines, social media posts, and more content with the purpose of persuading a reader to take a specific action, whether that’s signing up for a demo, booking an event, or downloading a guide. This is a common role on a marketing team, where the copywriter will support any or all <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/26/marketing-channels">marketing channels</a>.</p>
<p>It’s also a common role in an advertising agency, where the copywriter will work with clients to produce copy. This copy may include captions or taglines for a photo or even scripts for a video. But it’s most likely that the copywriter’s contribution is the writing, not the vision or the visuals.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-petcarewebp.webp" alt="example of copywritten and designed petcare ad" width="821" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85512" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-petcarewebp.webp 821w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-petcarewebp-480x351.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 821px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The adorable ad concept? Probably a creative director. That tagline? Copywriter.</em></p>
<div id="types-of-copywriting"></div>
<h2>The fundamental types of copywriting</h2>
<p>We’ve established that the definition of copywriting is broad because action-driving content can appear in tons of different places.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-lawyer.webp" alt="copywriting example for legal billboard" width="882" height="529" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85513" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-lawyer.webp 882w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-lawyer-480x288.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 882px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://oaaa.org/creative-library/ibf-law-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>But even though that range is possible, there are a few common types of copywriting that come up more often than others, especially in marketing.</p>
<p>Here are those common types of copywriting:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Advertising copy: </strong>Ad copy is probably what comes to mind when you think of copywriting, and for good reason. This copy appears everywhere, in print media, across social media, on the Google SERP, even on the radio or TV. The goal is always the same: to get your attention, capture your interest, and convince you to act.</li>
<li><strong>Website copy:</strong> Website copywriting appears on the homepage, the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/about-us-page-examples-and-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about page</a>, the product pages, the side bars, the navigation bars, and even the footer. The goal here is usually to direct the visitor to engage further, whether it’s to sign up for a newsletter, click to a deeper page, or fill out a form.</li>
<li><strong>SEO copywriting: </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-content-beginners-guide">Writing copy for SEO</a> involves optimizing headlines, subtitles, and metadata with the goal of having the page rank of the SERP.</li>
<li><strong>PR copywriting: </strong>The goal of any PR copy in a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/04/how-to-write-a-press-release">press release</a>, announcement, or even campaign blurb, is to get media to cover your story, whether it’s traditional print journalists, digital coverage, or even influencer spots.</li>
<li><strong>Email marketing copy: </strong>When you’re writing email copy, you might have different actions as your goal for each piece. The goal for your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/email-subject-lines-for-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subject line</a> is to encourage opens, but the goal for the email copy might be to download a guide or even forward the email.</li>
<li><strong>Social media copywriting: </strong>Writing for social media involves drafting posts, optimizing bios, and creating captions. The goal of social media copywriting might be to follow your profile, go to the website, or click a link to view content or even check out your product.</li>
<li><strong>Direct response copy: </strong>This comes up in ecommerce a lot. That’s because <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/03/14/direct-response-marketing">direct response copywriting</a> drives an immediate engagement, like putting an item in a cart or completing a purchase.</li>

<h2>11 tactics to make any copywriting stronger</h2>
<p>Whenever you’re crafting copy, it’s important to keep the context of the end result in mind. We talk about this a lot with social media, since it’s an easy example: You wouldn’t write the same copy for LinkedIn and TikTok, because they’re different platforms.</p>
<p>Still, there are some things that can make any copywriting stronger and more effective. Here are the essential elements of all great copywriting:</p>
<h3>1. Be clear</h3>
<p>Clarity is so important. Sometimes it’s easy to get caught up in the process of creation. You need to write taglines for a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">product launch</a>. You fill out ad copy for a Facebook ads campaign. This is especially true when you have too much to write, too much to do—which is often the case when you’re a marketing team of one or you’re running your own small business.</p>
<p>But when you’re writing that copy, remember that you’re communicating with your audience. They should be able to understand not only what you’re saying, but also what you’re asking of them. Take these two Facebook ads from Supergoop, for example.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-supergoop-glowscreen.webp" alt="example of facebook ad copywriting for glowscreen from supergoop" width="650" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85514" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-supergoop-glowscreen.webp 650w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-supergoop-glowscreen-480x442.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-supergoop.webp" alt="example of facebook ad copywriting for supergoop" width="648" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85515" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-supergoop.webp 648w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-supergoop-480x444.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 648px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The copy in the first ad is so much better because it’s clearer. “Discover” gets me to a fun new beauty product way quicker than the language in the second ad. Plus, making room on my shelf sounds like a chore. Avoid that kind of confusion and ambiguity.</p>
<h3>2. Write within the limits</h3>
<p>Your copy will be stronger if you’re writing with the constraints and context of its place in mind. That’s because you’ll be able to know how much space you have to get creative—we’ll spend more time on this soon—and how efficiently you need to convey your message. The context will also let you know what else your audience is looking at.</p>
<p>For instance, if they’re on your website, they’re seeing your other page copy or pop-ups. But if they’re on social media, they’re seeing ads from other brands and content from friends and creators. And if they’re on the SERP, they’re seeing your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/competitors-ads">competitors</a>.</p>
<p>So make sure this context is top of mind while you’re drafting.</p>
<h3>3. Know your audience</h3>
<p>This is so important, even though it seems like common sense: You need to know who you are writing to to persuade them into action. So get to know your audience.</p>
<p>If your brand has <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/25/buyer-persona-examples">buyer personas</a>, make sure you’re familiar with them. If your company has customer interviews or spotlights, keep up with these. The demographic information is useful, so you can glean basic interest. The motivations and pain points, though—these are more useful.</p>
<p>Here’s a great example from the formula company <a href="https://www.hibobbie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bobbie&#8217;s</a> homepage.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-bobbie.webp" alt="copywriting example from bobbie" width="855" height="430" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85516" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-bobbie.webp 855w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-bobbie-480x241.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 855px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The tagline appeals to a common ground with parents: “Our babies made us do it.” The language is casual but confident, with “mom-led” prominent and a well-placed “damn” in the parenthetical. These hints make the visitor want to learn more about the founders and how they started this company. It encourages you to click that button and read the story. As a new mom myself, and part of the target demo, I can confirm that this is motivating. Reader, I read the story, then I bought the formula.</p>
<h3>4. Get creative with language</h3>
<p>Copy should encourage an action, but that doesn’t mean it needs to be explicit or, worse, boring. You want to grab your reader’s attention because this will make encouraging that action more effective.</p>
<p>So take a look at great <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/03/copywriting-examples">copywriting examples</a> for inspiration, and then start drafting. Choose your words intentionally to surprise your readers. Use humor if that works for your brand. Include wordplay to entertain your readers and let them in on the joke. Be sure to keep your audience in mind here, too. Writing and editing tool <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grammarly</a> does this really well with its punny use of “word” in its website headline.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-grammarly.webp" alt="copywriting example from grammarly" width="850" height="401" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85517" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-grammarly.webp 850w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-grammarly-480x226.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 850px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>5. Appeal to emotions</h3>
<p>People make decisions based on emotions, and this is important for your business. <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/11/the-new-science-of-customer-emotions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard Business Review</a> research shows that customers with an emotional connection to a brand will actually represent more value to the company.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/emotional-connection-copywriting.webp" alt="chart showing the value of emotional copywriting" width="292" height="565" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85519" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/emotional-connection-copywriting.webp 292w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/emotional-connection-copywriting-155x300.webp 155w" sizes="(max-width: 292px) 100vw, 292px" /></p>
<p>Use this for your copywriting. Consider the emotional impact you’re looking to evoke, whether it’s happiness, hopefulness, or even anger. Then use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotional words for your copy</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-peloton.webp" alt="copywriting example from peloton" width="877" height="597" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85518" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-peloton.webp 877w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-peloton-480x327.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 877px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Transforming your life is more emotionally appealing than, say, “take a remote spin class.”</em></p>

<h3>6. Keep it concise</h3>
<p>Copywriting is often a practice in doing more with less. Taglines for image or video-heavy ads don’t leave much space, and ads on search and social have strict limits. That’s why keeping it concise and to the point is key.</p>
<p>Even when you have the space for more context and more explanation, less is more. Take this full-page magazine ad, for example.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-chex.webp" alt="copywriting example from chex" width="459" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85520" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-chex.webp 459w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-chex-230x300.webp 230w" sizes="(max-width: 459px) 100vw, 459px" /></p>
<p>This is an old ad for a Chex cereal. Two-thirds of the page contains images of a woman about to eat a spoonful and a picture of the box to make sure it’s easy to spot in the grocery aisle. The copy takes up about a third of the page, but much of this is white space. The copy is almost exclusively exclamations. Some of them are one word, including my personal favorite: “Yum-m-m-mmm!” This ad gets the idea across—people love this new flavor of Chex—in about 20 words (this is a form of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/bandwagon-advertising">bandwagon advertising</a>). Short and sweet.</p>
<h3>7. Tell a story</h3>
<p>We crave stories. Neuroscientists have found that reading fiction and engaging with narratives, offers a full sensory experience in our brains, and the immersive experience helps foster an emotional connection.</p>
<p>Creating this emotional connection by using stories helps make the audience more invested in the outcome and more likely to remember your ad. That’s why using a narrative—or the implication of a narrative—in your copy is effective.</p>
<p>Here’s an ad that captures a story in just a few lines. This is an advertisement for Australian tourism that ran after travel opened up after the pandemic lockdowns. The copy references this lightly by including a “Welcome Back,” and even in the tagline about saving the “first” look. This, of course, is that “first” look after the country’s tourism reopened.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-australia.webp" alt="tourism copywriting example" width="847" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85521" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-australia.webp 847w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-australia-480x339.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 847px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>8. Use your brand voice</h3>
<p>The best copywriting is effective, recognizable, and memorable. Using your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/07/31/brand-voice">brand voice</a> helps with all three of these, since your company’s distinctive <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">personality</a> appeals to your target audience. So brush up on your company’s brand identity and make sure to incorporate that voice whenever you have the opportunity.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-liquid-death.webp" alt="copywriting example from liquid death" width="886" height="527" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85522" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-liquid-death.webp 886w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copywriting-example-liquid-death-480x286.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 886px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> A great example from Liquid Death, a company with an incredibly specific brand voice. </em></p>
<h3>9. Learn to leverage AI</h3>
<p>There are tons of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-copywriting-tools">AI tools</a> specifically for copy. Open AI’s Chat GPT works for generating captions, website copy, or even taglines, or you can use a tool like Copy.ai that is specifically created for sales and marketing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copyai-copywriting-example.webp" alt="example of copywriting prompt output from copy.ai" width="883" height="514" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85523" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copyai-copywriting-example.webp 883w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/copyai-copywriting-example-480x279.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 883px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An example prompt and output from Copy.ai. Not perfect (those ? should be emoji), but it’s a start.</em></p>
<p>Now, let’s be clear: Don’t type in an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-prompts">AI prompt</a> to create taglines or generate Facebook ads and call it a day. Regardless of what some AI proponents might say, the output is a starting point. It’s a way to avoid a blank page so you can shape, edit, and rewrite, or use for inspiration for new versions. But it’s a great first step that way.</p>
<p>And speaking of editing your copy brings us to our next tip.</p>
<h3>10. Proofread your copy</h3>
<p>Your copy should be error-free. This might seem like we’re being sticklers, but it’s important. Not only for your copy, but for your business.</p>
<p>In a survey of 1,800 people, <a href="https://www.tidio.com/blog/common-grammar-mistakes/">Tidio</a> found that grammar and spelling errors can have a real impact on your brand—and even your revenue. Over 50% of respondents shared that grammar mistakes ruin a company’s professional image. 35% said that grammatical errors can impact the company’s credibility.</p>
<p>The good news is that this is an avoidable risk. Take the extra time to proofread your copy before finalizing it.</p>
<h3>11. Test and optimize</h3>
<p>The best way to improve your copy is to, well, keep improving it. Whenever possible, set up <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/25/copy-testing">copy testing</a> to A/B test your copy to determine which versions perform better. You can do this with your Google Search Ads, with website copy, and even social ads. Once you get feedback, make changes to continue optimizing. Then make sure to remember what works—and use that.</p>

<h2>What makes website copywriting different?</h2>
</div>
<p>Because it’s all goal-oriented, there are a lot of similarities when you’re <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/copywriting-101">crafting copy</a> for email, social, search, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/26/out-of-home-advertising" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out-of-home advertising</a>, and your website. But copy for each of these channels isn’t interchangeable. That’s why it’s important to know <em>where</em> your copy is going while you’re writing.</p>
<p>Here are a few ways <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/15/website-copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website copywriting</a> is distinct:</p>
<ul>
<li>Website visitors have limited attention spans, but you have a lot of information to include because this is your brand’s<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/17/increase-online-presence" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> online presence</a>.</li>
<li>Your site has interactive elements, like buttons, navigation bars, and more. Many of these will require copy to guide your visitors through your site.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO</a> is important for your website to rank on search engines, which is where many of your visitors will find you.</li>
<li>Your website visitors are your most diverse audience—more people will head to your website than sign up for your email or follow your brand on social.</li>
<li>The ultimate goal of website copywriting is to get your visitors to convert.</li>

<h2>17 tips for better website copywriting</h2>
</div>
<p>If a visitor makes their way to your website, you want to make it easy for them to get the information that they came for. You also want to encourage them to engage further, learn more, and/or sign up for your newsletter or a demo. Here’s how to make that happen by <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/22/marketing-copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writing copy that converts</a>.</p>
<h3>1. Know your audience</h3>
<p>This is the most important step for crafting copy. You need to understand who you’re talking to in order to encourage any action. So before you start writing or refreshing website copy, spend some time reviewing your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/target-market-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">target customers</a>. If you have them, read over your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/23/buyer-personas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buyer personas</a> to get a sense of both general demographics and motivations. If you don’t have those handy, take a look at your ideal customers. Consider their demographics like age, marital status, or job title, whatever might be relevant. Listen to recorded calls delving into their consideration process, motivation for buying, the biggest benefit of using your product or offering—or set up some time to ask your customers these questions.</p>
<p>Armed with this understanding of your audience, you can write to them directly. Leverage their motivations, speak to their problems, and maybe use a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/01/psychology-copywriting-tips-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">psychological effect</a> in your copy.</p>
<p>But remember, this can look simple. Here’s a great example of copywriting that subtly communicates who the audience is from home compost tool <a href="https://www.mill.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mill&#8217;s</a> website.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-example.webp" alt="website copywriting example" width="795" height="424" class="aligncenter wp-image-84017 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-example.webp 795w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-example-480x256.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 795px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>By stressing the time to fill and promising to “lighten” garbage, this copy speaks to busy adults. Most of us, right? But then it gets more targeted.</p>
<p>The “trips to the curb” clearly applies to a home-owning suburban audience. This focuses on locations, living styles, and economic status with just a few words.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Learn how to best connect with your audience using our free guide on <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite26BrilliantWaysToUsePsychology.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_TextLink_guide_26waysPsychGuide_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">26 ways to use psychology in marketing</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Build your brand</h3>
<p>When visitors hit your website, you want to supply them with all the information they need and make it easy for them to navigate deeper to higher-value pages. But while you’re doing that, you can also take the opportunity to make a memorable brand experience.</p>
<p>Your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/website-color-scheme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website color scheme</a> and visuals will do a lot of this work, sure, but so will the accompanying copy. Here’s some inspiration from the trendy, fun prebiotic soda brand <a href="https://drinkpoppi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poppi</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-branding.webp" alt="website copywriting - poppi example" width="794" height="380" class="aligncenter wp-image-84029 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-branding.webp 794w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-branding-480x230.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 794px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The neon colors and ’70s font is eye-catching, but the winks in the copy might just be the best part. The “but make it fashion” highlighting bright baggy sweatsuits that are all over Instagram is perfect. The punny “making pop history” even makes Shark Tank sound cool and youthful.</p>
<h3>3. Understand your offering</h3>
<p>One of my biggest marketing pet peeves is when I visit a website and can’t tell what the company does. Most of the time, it looks beautiful, sounds impressive, but that offering? Entirely unclear.</p>
<p>So when you’re writing website copy, make sure you know your offering inside and out. This will help you communicate it effectively to your audience—and avoid any frustrated visitors of your own.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriing-walden-meat.webp" alt="website copywriting - walden meat screenshot" width="803" height="409" class="aligncenter wp-image-84028 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriing-walden-meat.webp 803w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriing-walden-meat-480x244.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 803px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://waldenlocalmeat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Walden Meat</em></a><em> is a local meat delivery service, which is totally clear based on their website copy above. Well done.</em></p>
<h3>4. Stress the benefits</h3>
<p>When you’re talking about your offering, you want the details to be there for prospective customers. But instead of wasting time and words on the features, talk about the benefits.</p>
<p>Features describe what your offering is, but benefits show how that helps your customer. Here’s an example from <a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mailchimp</a>. The email platform’s feature is the AI-powered predictions referenced in the copy as “intelligent predictions.” The benefit is highlighted in the headline. With these predictions, Mailchimp will help your business get loyal, long-term customers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-mailchimp-example.webp" alt="website copywriting - mailchimp website copy" width="971" height="420" class="aligncenter wp-image-84026 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-mailchimp-example.webp 971w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-mailchimp-example-480x208.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 971px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is an example of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/02/b2b-marketing-strategies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">B2B marketing</a>, but you can stress the benefits in your website copy regardless of your business type. Write out the features to highlight and then translate. And then, of course, take some time to revise until you get it right.</p>
<h3>5. Get your headings right</h3>
<p>The average time on page is <a href="https://www.websitebuilderexpert.com/building-online-stores/average-time-spent-on-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">53</a> seconds, which means that people aren’t spending too much time reading your website copy. Instead, most are skimming over the copy as they scroll to find the information they’re looking for.</p>
<p>To work with this reality, you want to spend the most time getting the most high-value words right. Those words? Your headings. Take the time to make them clear, concise, and compelling. And be sure to read through the headings of your website only before finalizing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-discover.webp" alt="website copywriting - discover website copy example" width="616" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-84018 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-discover.webp 616w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-discover-480x468.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 616px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The headings on </em><a href="https://www.discover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Discover</em></a><em>’s homepage get the idea across—even if you skip over the text below.</em></p>
<h3>6. Limit your copy</h3>
<p>In a class academic study of website user behavior, researchers found that users read about <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-little-do-users-read/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20%</a> of text on a webpage with 400 to 1,200 words, but up to 50% of text on a page with 200 words or fewer.</p>
<p>More text means less reading. The takeaway? Limit the copy on your website.</p>
<p><a href="https://zapier.com/l/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zapier&#8217;s</a> homepage is impressively brief without sacrificing information. Take a look at the hero section, with a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/01/headline-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compelling headline</a>, key pricing details, and a signup CTA.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-zapier-example.webp" alt="website copywriting - example of zapier home page" width="937" height="477" class="aligncenter wp-image-84027 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-zapier-example.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-zapier-example-480x244.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Even more impressive, this is the rest of Zapier’s home page.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copwriting-example-zapier.webp" alt="website copywriting - zapier example 2" width="859" height="472" class="aligncenter wp-image-84021 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copwriting-example-zapier.webp 859w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copwriting-example-zapier-480x264.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 859px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Keeping it as compact as Zapier might not work for your homepage, but it’s a good practice. Cut where you can—it might even translate to more words read by your visitors.</p>
<h3>7. Write strong CTAs</h3>
<p>The goal of copywriting is to inspire the reader to act, whether it’s to download a guide, sign up for a newsletter, or purchase a product. Your calls to action, or CTAs, are the final push, and as such major opportunities to persuade readers.</p>
<p>Because we’re all on so many websites fielding tons of promotional emails, we’re seeing standard CTA language often enough to grow desensitized. Submit, Sign Up, Register Now, Start Your Free Trial, Schedule Now. These barely register.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-cta.webp" alt="website copywriting - cta example" width="803" height="332" class="aligncenter wp-image-84023 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-cta.webp 803w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-cta-480x198.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 803px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Another example from Mill, but this one’s pretty meh.</em></p>
<p>Sometimes, dependable makes sense. But whenever you can, write a stronger CTA. The best way to do this is to get descriptive and specific.</p>
<h3>8. Work with the UX</h3>
<p>Don’t sleep on microcopy. These are the short phrases or words that guide visitors through your website, and they have the potential to inform, inspire, and even delight. Put them to work whenever you can.</p>
<p>Here’s a good, simple use of microcopy from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/popular-searches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pexels</a>, a library of stock photos and videos.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-ux.webp" alt="website copywriting - ux copy example" width="767" height="428" class="aligncenter wp-image-84024 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-ux.webp 767w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-ux-480x268.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 767px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In the search bar, the copy reads “Search for free photos.” The free access is a key selling point of Pexels and a differentiator from its competitors. Sticking that into the search bar gets the point across one more time.</p>
<h3>9. Bust out your thesaurus</h3>
<p>There are over 1 billion websites, and every minute, <a href="https://siteefy.com/how-many-websites-are-there/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">175 </a>new ones are created. That’s a lot of noise. And with visual branding <a href="https://dpdk.com/stories/blanding-why-so-many-brands-look-same" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growing more and more similar</a>, your copy is an underrated medium for differentiating your company’s website.</p>
<p>Remember, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/15/copywriting-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener">copywriting</a> is a creative exercise. So take a look at your favorite ads for inspiration, draft and redraft, and bust out your thesaurus—or, uh, head to that website—to break out of your routine.</p>
<h3>10. Optimize for SEO</h3>
<p>Optimizing your website and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-copywriting">copywriting for SEO</a> is imperative to ensure your brand is visible online. <a href="https://videos.brightedge.com/research-report/BrightEdge_ChannelReport2019_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">68%</a> of all online experiences begin with a search engine, and Google is the most used by far. So before you launch any copy changes, be sure to double-check <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/06/on-page-seo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on-page SEO</a> best practices.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-seo-channels-chart.jpg" alt="website copywriting - seo channels share chart" width="835" height="476" class="aligncenter wp-image-84016 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-seo-channels-chart.jpg 835w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-seo-channels-chart-480x274.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 835px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>11. Use trust markers</h3>
<p>Not all of your website visitors will be ready to convert. Some will check it out for the first time then return again and again before they’re ready to become a customer. For these visitors, you want to make the most of each visit to build trust in your brand.</p>
<p>Using common trust markers like reviews, awards, or key customers is a good way to do this. You can embed reviews from Google, or you can pull out some key phrases in your copy. You can even reference the company names or the aggregate numbers to highlight.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-ruggable.webp" alt="website copywriting - ruggable example" width="777" height="357" class="aligncenter wp-image-84025 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-ruggable.webp 777w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-ruggable-480x221.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 777px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://ruggable.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruggable</a></em></p>
<h3>12. Use numbers</h3>
<p>Numbers are a quick way to convey authority, especially when they’re big and specific. If you have the stats to leverage, get those figures into your copy. This could be the number of locations of your business, customers you’ve served, reviews you’ve received, projects you’ve finished, or even the number of products you’ve sold.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-instacart.webp" alt="website copywriting - instacart example" width="827" height="395" class="aligncenter wp-image-84022 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-instacart.webp 827w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-instacart-480x229.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 827px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instacart.com/?utm_medium=sem&amp;utm_source=instacart_google&amp;utm_campaign=ad_demand_search_brand_us-na-catchall_exact_us_AUDACT&amp;utm_content=accountid-1732890876_campaignid-10023670317_adgroupid-102598077042_device-c_adid-550389740099_network-g&amp;utm_term=matchtype-e_keyword-instacart_targetid-aud-1891755199416:kwd-297369219725_locationid-9002353&amp;kskwid=1532524&amp;ksadid=&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw26KxBhBDEiwAu6KXt52lpqCmm0mn6cCUoI29wnSFu3Jwiyy4falPPGCUlDrGNDFZql4LrxoC2UwQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Instacart</em></a><em> packs a ton of numbers into a short section on its homepage. </em></p>
<h3>13. A/B test</h3>
<p>A/B testing doesn’t actually stand for always be testing, but it’s a common, connected refrain that fits too perfectly not to use. A/B testing, or split testing, involves running two versions of a test subject simultaneously and tracking the performance of each version in order to determine a winner. For your copy, this could mean two different CTAs or headlines.</p>
<p>Your headlines in particular are worth testing. Chartbeat conducted a study of its users and found that websites consistently testing headlines drove more than <a href="https://blog.chartbeat.com/2021/02/24/headline-experimentation-time-value/">5X</a> the engagement. Even if you’re not using that specific tool, it’s convincing.</p>
<p>Moral of the story? Always be <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/25/copy-testing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">copy-testing</a>.</p>
<h3>14. Prioritize mobile</h3>
<p>In March 2024, <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">67%</a> of web traffic was on mobile devices. If more than half of your website visitors are likely reading it on their phone, you should be <a href="http://Google antitrust case - gavel just above a sound block.">writing the copy</a> with this medium in mind.</p>
<p>What does that look like? Think about the length of words, the cut-off points, and the number of lines. Take a look at this example from <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grammarly</a>’s website.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-ai.webp" alt="website copywriting - grammarly example" width="912" height="347" class="aligncenter wp-image-84020 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-ai.webp 912w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-ai-480x183.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 912px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is the desktop version, and even this view looks a bit heavy. Three lines of a single heading stacked in bold on a phone screen? Worth an edit.</p>
<h3>15. Make it accessible</h3>
<p>Your website must be accessible. Most of this will be down to the website design, but there are still a number of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/15/website-accessibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADA compliance standards for website copy</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick overview the <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Website Accessibility Initiative</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure your titles are unique and informative.</li>
<li>Be mindful of your heading structure.</li>
<li>Make sure you have descriptive alt text for any graphics.</li>
<li>Create transcripts of any audio.</li>
<li>Link descriptive text vs filler, like “See here.”</li>
<li>Write clearly and concisely, especially with instructions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>16. Test out AI</h3>
<p>There are tons of ways to use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-in-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI in marketing</a>, and sourcing ideas for website copy is a solid one. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/08/chatgpt-prompts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Head to ChatGPT</a> to get a dozen heading examples, find new ways to describe your offering, and more.</p>
<p>A time saver that might just yield better results is a win-win. Just be sure not to use AI-generated copy for your final product. That definitely needs an edit—which leads us to our final tip.</p>
<h3>17. Don’t forget to edit</h3>
<p>You need to edit your copy to catch any typos, grammar mistakes, incorrect spellings, errant capital letters, or any other minor issues. This might seem pedantic, but copy mistakes have business impacts. In fact, in a <a href="https://www.tidio.com/blog/common-grammar-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tidio</a> study, 97% of respondents said that grammar errors negatively impact their perception of a brand.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-grammar-standards-survey-results.webp" alt="website copywriting - how spelling and grammar impacts consumers" width="552" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-84019 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-grammar-standards-survey-results.webp 552w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/website-copywriting-grammar-standards-survey-results-480x522.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 552px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you’re working quickly, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/12/self-editing-checklist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-editing</a> can work. But it’s better to see if you can find someone with fresh eyes to read over your copy—ideally someone with a great eye for errors.</p>

<h2>What is neuromarketing?</h2>
<p>Neuromarketing merges neuroscience, psychology, cognitive science, and marketing to understand and influence consumer behavior. It uncovers subconscious and emotional factors impacting choices.</p>

<p>Specialists use neuromarketing techniques to study the human brain and predict decision-making behavior. Let&#8217;s explore why you should implement neuromarketing techniques in your copywriting.</p>

<div id="why-use-neuromarketing"></div>
<h2>Why use neuromarketing?</h2>
<p>Why apply neuromarketing techniques to your copywriting and other marketing activities? Here are some benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Better understanding of consumer behavior:</strong> Neuromarketing unveils emotions, attention, and memory triggers in consumer behavior, thus enabling the creation of impactful marketing messages.</li>
<li><strong>More effective ways to optimize website design:</strong> By studying eye-tracking data and user behavior, you can optimize design elements to encourage desired actions.</li>
<li><strong>Improved personalization and targeting:</strong> Uncover individual preferences and emotional triggers to tailor messages and offers for specific consumer segments.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced content creation:</strong> Understanding how the brain processes information helps you craft compelling stories that evoke emotions and drive engagement.</li>
</ol>
<p>Numbers speak volumes. According to the stats, neurological engagement can increase advertising effectiveness by up to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050920322389" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19%</a>. We also know that <a href="https://ethiqueadvisory.com/blogs/unleash-the-power-of-storytelling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">63%</a> of users remember brands that tell stories, and <a href="https://financesonline.com/customer-reviews-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">74%</a> of consumers trust businesses more after reading positive reviews.</p>
<div id="what-are-neuromarketing-examples"></div>
<h2>Neuromarketing examples in copywriting</h2>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to be a scientist. By analyzing research insights, you can identify neurological responses, emotional triggers, and attention patterns influencing your target most. Apply them to tailor your overall marketing strategy and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/performance-marketing">drive purchasing decisions</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of neuromarketing in action.</p>
<h3>1. Two odd numbers in headings</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/features/is-your-brain-wired-for-numbers-69194" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brain loves numbers</a>. They make content more digestible and provide order to chaos.</p>
<p>Why two numbers? To double the effect: The first one grabs attention, and the second one explains why read the content.</p>
<p>Why odd numbers? It&#8217;s about <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/odd-vs-even-number-psychology-6307047bf5de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">psychology</a> again: Even numbers look friendlier, while odd ones are more thought-provoking. It doesn&#8217;t mean you should use only the odd numbers. Consider the effect (emotion) you want to evoke with your content.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-examples-numbers-in-headings.webp" alt="neuromarketing example with two odd numbers in headline" width="540" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81933" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-examples-numbers-in-headings.webp 540w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-examples-numbers-in-headings-480x533.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 540px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/press-release-distribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>2. Questions in subheads</h3>
<p>Online readers scan the content to understand if it&#8217;s what they need. Format subheads as questions to clarify what readers will learn, spark curiosity, and appeal to FOMO.</p>
<p>Questions encourage scanners to continue the investigation to ensure they haven&#8217;t missed anything and satisfy their <a href="https://www.enneagrammer.com/the-three-instincts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social instinct</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-examples-questions.webp" alt="neuromarketing example with questions in headings" width="727" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81935" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-examples-questions.webp 727w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-examples-questions-480x396.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 727px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>3. The Socratic method in introductions</h3>
<p>Post three questions or statements in a row to engage users in communication.</p>
<p>Why three?</p>
<p>The human brain <a href="https://www.psychotactics.com/harness-the-psychological-power-of-3-to-improve-communication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grasps three the best</a>, so the sequence of three makes it easier to remember the information. Writers <em>do</em> love the <a href="https://copyblogger.com/rule-of-three/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rule of Three</a>: It builds the rhythm and keeps readers glued to your message.</p>

<h3>4. Power words and active verbs in content</h3>
<p>Power words are persuasive and descriptive. They trigger an emotional response, make readers experience different states, and push them in particular directions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/22/power-words">Power words</a> are adjectives indicating and explaining your statements. Like these:</p>

<p>This wheel chart by Geoffrey Roberts shares 150+ emotion-triggering words you can use in your copies.</p>
<p>Also, power words are strong verbs that add action to your message.</p>

<h3>5. Sensory language when appropriate</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/sensory-words/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sensory words</a> are lexical items appealing to the human physical senses. When reading the content with such words, users &#8220;see,&#8221; &#8220;hear,&#8221; &#8220;touch,&#8221; &#8220;smell,&#8221; or &#8220;taste&#8221; it.</p>
<p>Sensory words are powerful because they paint scenes in readers&#8217; imagination. They activate the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0093934X12000028" target="_blank" rel="noopener">somatosensory cortex</a>, making us recognize these words faster. Sensory words make readers feel as if they are in your story, thus remembering your message better.</p>

<p>Remember to use these principles ethically and transparently, respecting consumer trust and expectations.</p>
<div id="what-neuromarketing-techniques-work"></div>
<h2>20 neuromarketing techniques to encourage desired actions</h2>
<p>With the above emotional triggers in mind, include the following neuromarketing principles in your copywriting to make it work.</p>
<h3>1. Authority</h3>
<p>Position your brand as an industry expert through research findings, data, and credible collaborations.</p>
<p>Why do you think <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/26/influencer-marketing">influencer marketing</a> works? Users subconsciously believe famous people can&#8217;t go wrong because they choose the top products/services for themselves.</p>
<p>But: Authority isn&#8217;t only about top celebs with millions of subscribers on social media. Think of micro- or nano-influencers: They have the most loyal audience. Collaborate with experts in your niche: CEOs, top managers, or specialists who know what they talk about.</p>
<h3>2. Common enemy</h3>
<p>Struggling with a common enemy unites people. It&#8217;s not only about physical enemies but pains, complexes, or bad habits, as well. Concepts like hunger, poverty, diseases, or climate change are also here.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s your brand&#8217;s mission? Is it socially responsible?</p>
<p>Users are loyal to businesses that align with their identities and share the same values. Prescribe this element and incorporate corresponding meanings into your content strategy.</p>
<p>Create a positive ethos for your brand: Why does it matter? Why should people listen to your message?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-common-enemy.webp" alt="neuromarketing technique of common enemy in copywriting" width="936" height="403" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81940" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-common-enemy.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-common-enemy-480x207.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.deathwishcoffee.com/pages/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>3. Consistency and commitment</h3>
<p>Encourage commitment through regular communication, loyalty programs, and subscription services.</p>
<p>The more you interact with a customer, the more they trust your product, service, team, or individual specialist. The challenge is to establish a productive interaction and get a response.</p>
<p>You can initiate a dialog in messengers, newsletter emails, or online chat. Tests, quizzes, and other interactive content also work.</p>
<h3>4. Cross-marketing</h3>
<p>This trigger is about the intersection of several target audience segments. Organize your content so website visitors see your minor products with major ones.</p>
<p>In ecommerce, we know this trick as &#8220;You may also like&#8221; or &#8220;Buy together:&#8221; When examining a product description, a customer sees related items they might also want to buy.</p>
<p>Informative or educational websites address the same principle with content elements like &#8220;Related articles,&#8221; &#8220;Extra read,&#8221; &#8220;Editor&#8217;s Pick,&#8221; etc.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-crossmarketing.webp" alt="neuromarketing copywriting technique of cross-marketing" width="892" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81941" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-crossmarketing.webp 892w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-crossmarketing-480x322.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 892px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://cxl.com/blog/seo-vs-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>5. Framing</h3>
<p>Different framing techniques impact perception:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comparative framing:</strong> Highlight superiority over competitors.</li>
<li><strong>Loss aversion framing:</strong> Use phrases like &#8220;limited time offer.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Goal framing:</strong> Present your product as a solution to specific goals.</li>
<li><strong>Attribute framing:</strong> Highlight appealing features.</li>
<li><strong>Time framing:</strong> Encourage immediate action by prescribing deadlines (&#8220;today only,&#8221; &#8220;first three subscribers will get…,&#8221; &#8220;two hours left,&#8221; etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Flattery</h3>
<p>Incorporate genuine praise or appreciation to build rapport. Personalized emails and positive feedback boost customer loyalty.</p>
<p>Incorporate genuine praise or appreciation to build rapport. Personalized emails and positive feedback boost customer loyalty.</p>
<p>You can personalize a customer by name, profession, age, social status, or hobbies. It is realistic to find a suitable appeal for every niche and customer segment.</p>
<p>When a subscriber, prospective client, or webpage visitor sees a familiar hook, they subconsciously realize you&#8217;re talking to them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-flattery.webp" alt="neuromarketing technique using flattery in copywriting" width="817" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81942" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-flattery.webp 817w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-flattery-480x351.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 817px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.classcreator.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Their response to a personalized greeting will be faster and warmer than to generic wording.</p>
<h3>7. Greed</h3>
<p>Appealing to one of the core human weaknesses helps boost engagement and raise sales. Promotions, discounts, and contests encourage prospective customers to open their wallets.</p>
<p>Greed pushes subscribers to invite friends to groups, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-time-to-post-on-social-media">repost social media content</a>, and share links. Spontaneous purchases are also here.</p>
<p>Palmary examples of using this neuromarketing principle: Black Friday and Cyber Monday campaigns most brands organize.</p>
<h3>8. Herd behavior</h3>
<p>Every person is a unique individual, and no one wants to recognize themselves as part of a so-called &#8220;herd,&#8221; but:</p>
<p>Social instinct is among the top three basic ones, so we can&#8217;t resist appreciation and a sense of belonging to some group. Most websites appeal to this instinct with messages like:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&#8220;100,000+ downloads already&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;Rating: 4.5/5 stars&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;With over 300k subscribers and 4 million readers, we are&#8230;&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>When a user sees such messages, they subconsciously approve your offer. After all, so many people can&#8217;t be wrong, huh? So, everything is okay with the product/service you have for them.</p>
<h3>9. Intrigue</h3>
<p>This one is like cliffhangers in a movie series, cutting off episodes at the most intriguing moment to motivate the audience to come back and watch the next one.</p>
<p>A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>In next week&#8217;s video, I will tell how I&#8217;ve my first 100 thousand subscribers.</em></li>
<li><em>I&#8217;ve become popular by a happy accident, but I will talk about it a little later.</em></li>
<li><em>I have to pause now; please wait for the second part in tomorrow&#8217;s release.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>10. Justification</h3>
<p>It is easier to push a site visitor to the desired action if you explain <em>the why&#8217;s</em> behind it. Reveal all the benefits of purchasing in this particular place and time.</p>
<p>Collect all available arguments and added values. Simplify messaging, designs, and instructions to minimize cognitive load.</p>
<h3>11. Instant benefit</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/sales-funnel-template/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales funnel</a> is a core marketing instrument, but sometimes it&#8217;s possible to get loyal clients once they land at your website. Think of a perk (a here-and-now benefit) to offer to visitors:</p>
<p>A free template, checklist, or ebook can become the lead magnet to hook a user to stay with you and become your client.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.creative-copywriter.net/the-insiders-guide-to-copyediting-and-proofreading-free-checklist" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>12. Novelty</h3>
<p>Appeal to the brain&#8217;s attraction to novelty by introducing innovative elements and collaborations.</p>
<p>Please note that the word &#8220;new&#8221; itself doesn&#8217;t work. The trigger will do the job if your offer is <em>truly </em>fresh, unusual, and unique. Think of it as your UVP (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/unique-selling-proposition">unique value proposition</a>).</p>
<p>What makes you different from competitors? What can you do for a customer that they don&#8217;t?</p>
<h3>13. Reciprocity</h3>
<p>The principle of reciprocity suggests that when you provide value to your audience, they are more likely to engage with your brand. Offer free resources, trials, discounts, or personalized recommendations.</p>
<p>The catch is you&#8217;ll ask something in return. For example, an email address to send informative newsletters with compelling content, encouraging to buy.</p>
<p>But remember: Reciprocity works when used right. It&#8217;s critical to know your limit, especially today when the audience is fed up with tons of &#8220;gifts&#8221; and offers they find in inboxes daily. Being too aggressive with marketing messages, you risk unsubscriptions and negative reactions.</p>
<p>Be honest and write about what you&#8217;ll send users once they share emails with you.</p>
<h3>14. Result</h3>
<p>The common example is content assets presenting &#8220;before&#8221; and &#8220;after&#8221; to users. Photos or videos demonstrating how your product works do the magic!</p>
<p>The trick is to present everything in as much detail as possible so that people can see the difference between the first and second versions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before&#8221; and &#8220;after&#8221; is not the only way to demonstrate results. Case studies do wonders in all niches, too. Working with the same principle, they are the format where you can show results with a text.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://smartblogger.com/products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>15. Scarcity</h3>
<p>Create urgency through limited availability tactics. Ethically use limited quantity, time-limited offers, and scarcity techniques to drive action.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about FOMO again: People don&#8217;t want to miss an offer that will be unavailable soon.</p>
<p><strong>Two options here: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s a super popular product/service of extra quality.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s originally for a narrow circle of &#8220;chosen ones.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>Scarcity works with any restrictions: color, features, time, date, quantity, cost, etc. When using this trigger, it&#8217;s critical to keep your word. If sales close tomorrow, that&#8217;s what should happen.</p>
<h3>16. Social proof</h3>
<p>Use testimonials, endorsements, ratings, and reviews to establish trust and credibility.</p>
<p>Testimonials remain the most popular social proof, but it&#8217;s critical to make it trustworthy. Today&#8217;s users aren&#8217;t as naive as some marketers continue to believe: They won&#8217;t trust comments from John Doe with stock photos in avatars.</p>
<p>Share reviews from real people: Make videos, provide active links to their social media profiles, use signed and stamped thank-you letters from partners, etc.</p>
<p>Another instrument to boost social proof for users is your contact information. Many websites hide it, placing nothing but a standard contact form instead.</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>It hurts <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/14/google-e-e-a-t">E-E-A-T</a> factors and kills user loyalty and trust. Your address, phone number, email, and active social media accounts are worth placing on the website.</p>
<p>Certificates, ratings, budges–all they confirm your expertise and emphasize your responsibility and integrity in customers&#8217; eyes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-social-proof.webp" alt="social proof neuromarketing example" width="936" height="407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81945" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-social-proof.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-social-proof-480x209.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>17. Specifics</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s still an issue for many websites. They continue generating vague content assets, bringing words but no value.</p>
<p>Compare:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&#8220;We sell the best windows in Chicago!&#8221; </em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;Our energy-saving windows keep 93.4% of heat in your apartment.&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, the example is a little hackneyed, but numbers and facts work better than sophisticated metaphors when it comes to converting traffic into leads.</p>
<p>Even if your niche is info products, customers want to know how long it will take to get results.</p>
<h3>18. Storytelling</h3>
<p>Harness storytelling&#8217;s power to evoke emotions, build connections, and make your brand memorable.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.go-globe.com/storytelling-statistics-trends-infographic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human brain operates with stories</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It retains 70% of information through them, while only 10% comes from data and facts.</li>
<li>It responds better to narratives as they activate brain areas responsible for experiences.</li>
<li>Combining data with a story increases info retention from 5-10% to 67%.</li>
</ul>
<p>The secret is that stories don&#8217;t impose anything but, at the same time, bring the right idea to readers. Your task is to build a story in a way readers would choose your business over the others.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-storytelling.webp" alt="storytelling neuromarketing example" width="570" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81946" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-storytelling.webp 570w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-storytelling-480x505.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 570px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>19. Upsell</h3>
<p>This trigger serves a specific purpose: Make a customer buy more than they planned.</p>
<p>The oldy-moldy <em>&#8220;Buy two–and take the third one for free&#8221;</em> hook still works, grabbing even the savvy customers who understand the trick. Indeed, it&#8217;s hard to resist the temptation to get a free product.</p>
<h3>20. More emotional triggers</h3>
<p>Here are some additional emotional triggers you can use in your copywriting:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Trust: </strong>Building credibility and reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Fear:</strong> Tapping into common anxieties or concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Belonging: </strong>The need to be part of a community or tribe.</li>
<li><strong>Curiosity:</strong> Piquing interest to learn more.</li>
<li><strong>Pride:</strong> Targeting one&#8217;s self-esteem and accomplishments.</li>
<li><strong>Guilt:</strong> Reminding the audience of a problem or responsibility.</li>
<li><strong>Urgency:</strong> Creating a sense of limited time or availability.</li>
<li><strong>Relief:</strong> Offering a solution to a problem or pain point.</li>
<li><strong>Anticipation:</strong> Building excitement for what&#8217;s to come.</li>
<li><strong>Validation:</strong> Confirming a reader&#8217;s thoughts or beliefs.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Use neuromarketing responsibly</h2>
<p>Neuromarketing offers powerful techniques to enhance your strategies, resonating with audiences. Apply emotional triggers and psychological principles to SEO content and promo campaigns, and the result will surprise you.</p>
<p>But remember: Not all principles are universal, so do your best to test and iterate what works best for your audience.</p>
<p>Explore deeper insights, such as subconscious cues and neural engagement, to refine your strategies further. And try these other <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/advertising-techniques">advertising techniques</a>, too.</p>

<h2>Part one: The anatomy of a Google ad</h2>
<p>To get to the part where we&#8217;re writing our finest ad copy, we first need to cover the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/how-to-use-google-adwords">basics for text ads on Google</a> (which are called Search campaigns). Here are the components:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>URL: </strong>Also known as the destination, this is where users will land when they click on your ad.</li>
<li><strong>Display path: </strong>This is what appears after the URL, after the slash. It&#8217;s called &#8220;display&#8221; because it doesn&#8217;t have to be the actual URL of the page. It&#8217;s what gets displayed as a part of the ad and is used to provide more clarity to the user about the destination of the link. More on this in a bit.</li>
<li><strong>Headline: </strong>The headline is the large blue text that appears below the URL. This is the most prominent part of your ad and most likely the first (and sometimes only) thing users read. Ads can have two or three headlines, up to 30 characters each.</li>
<li><strong>Description: </strong>The description is the body text that appears below the headline and provides more details. These can be up to 90 characters.</li>
<li><strong>Assets: </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/16/google-ads-extensions-now-assets">Formerly known as extensions</a>, these are additional elements you can tack onto your ad to give it more appeal. There are sitelinks, phone numbers, images, promotions, and more. Note that they aren&#8217;t guaranteed to show with every impression. Learn more in our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/25/google-ads-extensions-guide">extensions/assets cheatsheet</a>.</li>

<h2>Part two: The 5 responsive search ad copy best practices</h2>
<p>Okay, one more housekeeping item because <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/02/google-sunsetting-expanded-text-ads">responsive search ads are the only type of search ad you can create</a> (on both Google and Bing), and these guys are shifty little shapeshifters, so they can be a little tricky when it comes to ad copy.</p>
<p>And by shapeshifter, I mean that you input a number of headlines and descriptions and Google will rotate different combinations based on the searcher, search query, and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-responsive-search-ads-work.webp" alt="how responsive search ads work" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76246 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-responsive-search-ads-work.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-responsive-search-ads-work-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Which means that you need to input headlines that could all work in combinations. This is the tricky part, which is why you should know the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/10/responsive-search-ads"> best practices for responsive search ad copy.</a> You&#8217;ll also find that they tie in nicely with our PPC ad copy tips in the next section.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Embrace multiple headlines.</strong> Don’t use the bare minimum. Use at least 8-10 of the 15 headlines, and at least three of the four descriptions available to you.</li>
<li><strong>Keep your headlines distinct.</strong> Google will not show similar variations.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t put keywords in every headline.</strong> At least three of your headlines should not be keyword-focused—as in, they should be feature, benefit, or CTA instead.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t over-pin.</strong> It can be tempting to freeze certain headlines in place, or even all of them, but this limits Google’s ability to test out different combinations and maximize performance.</li>
<li><strong>Vary headline lengths.</strong> Don&#8217;t use all 30 characters for every headline. This will allow Google to show some ads with two headlines and some with three.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Part three: 11 tricks to write exceptional PPC ad copy</h2>
<p>Now that we know what we&#8217;re working with here, we can get to the good stuff—how to write PPC ad copy that earns <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/19/does-quality-score-still-matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high Quality Scores</a>, captures attention, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/14/improve-google-ads-click-through-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gets the clicks</a>.</p>

Uncover the <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite12SecretsToHigherCTR.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_PPC_HigherCTR_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 secrets to a higher click-through rate</a> for free here!</p>
<h3>1. Think feature-benefit-<em>feeling</em></h3>
<p>As we just learned above, not every headline needs to include the keyword you&#8217;re targeting—some of them should include features and/or benefits. Features and benefits are a staple in any sort of marketing copy, but all too often, we neglect the most important part: emotion.</p>
<p>Why does the user want the benefit to happen? What, ultimately, is the good feeling they are trying to achieve or the bad feeling they&#8217;re looking to avoid?</p>
<p>For example, let&#8217;s say you are running an ad for public speaking coaching:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feature:</strong> One-on-one coaching</li>
<li><strong>Benefit:</strong> Become a better public speaker</li>
<li><strong>Feeling:</strong> Confidence</li>
<li><strong>Headline:</strong> Speak with Impact &amp; Authority</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-feature-benefit-feeling.png" alt="ppc ad copy tips - example of google ad with feature, benefit, and feeling" width="720" height="423" class="size-full wp-image-65052 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-feature-benefit-feeling.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-feature-benefit-feeling-480x282.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>

<ul></ul>
<ul></ul>
<h3>2. Include a differentiator</h3>
<p>So you’ve established your key features and benefits. Great. But guess what—your competitors provide the same exact ones. Don&#8217;t worry, I know yours are different on a more detailed and nuanced level, but you can&#8217;t capture that in a single text ad, so for all intents ad purposes on the SERP, in consumers&#8217; eyes, it&#8217;s all the same.</p>
<p>So you need to identify what makes you different. This is the key to any <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/16/elevator-pitch-examples-templates">good elevator pitch</a> or scenario where you have limited time and space.</p>
<p>This is easy when you are any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original</li>
<li>The official</li>
<li>The only</li>
<li>The fastest</li>
<li>The first</li>
<li>The lowest-priced</li>
<li>The top rated</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-number-one.png" alt="ppc ad copy tips - example of google ad with differentiating feature" width="720" height="502" class="size-full wp-image-65072 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-number-one.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-number-one-480x335.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But even if you&#8217;re not any of the above, you can still differentiate your business from competitors with things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific numbers (such as reviews and ratings).</li>
<li>A particular endorsement.</li>
<li>A &#8220;not your typical&#8221; or &#8220;not your average&#8221; statement.</li>
<li>A &#8220;this, not that&#8221; statement.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-different.png" alt="ppc ad copy tips - example of google ad with differentiating feature" width="720" height="648" class="size-full wp-image-65053 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-different.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-different-480x432.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Just something that makes your ad copy different from all the other ads around it. &#8220;Different&#8221; stands out. And standing out is attractive.</p>
<h3>3. Show a little personality</h3>
<p>Another way to differentiate your business from other ads on the SERP? Show a little personality. With no options for images or branding (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/21/google-ads-image-extensions">image extensions</a> don&#8217;t count), text ads give us little room for creativity, but it&#8217;s still doable.</p>
<p>Take a look at the examples below. Same number of blue and black characters every other ad has, but the descriptions are packed with personality:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We didn&#8217;t invent professional copywriting, we just changed everything about it.</em></li>
<li><em>Enjoy artisanal content lovingly crafted by grass-fed, 100% organic copywriters.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/how-to-write-ad-copy-ad-personality-example.jpg" alt="how to write ppc ad copy - personalized ad example" width="900" height="567" class="aligncenter wp-image-81374 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/how-to-write-ad-copy-ad-personality-example.jpg 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/how-to-write-ad-copy-ad-personality-example-480x302.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>These ads stand out. Now I know that not every industry can be creative like this, but if it&#8217;s an option for you, I recommend taking a look at different <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/24/google-ads-examples">Google Ads examples</a> to get some inspiration.</p>
<p>(Side note: if you ever want ad copy ideas, just search &#8220;ad copywriting services&#8221; and you can rest assured that ad copy services will provide some inspiration.)</p>
<h3>4. Get competitive</h3>
<p>You know what they say&#8230;keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Keep an eye on what your competitors are using in their ad copy and use it for your own positioning. In the example below, you can see Got Print&#8217;s ad offering 500 business cards for $8.50. Right above that is Overnight Print&#8217;s ad for $8.49.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a tiny detail—and I&#8217;ll admit borderline cheap trick—but does it catch your eye? Yes. And does this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/01/headline-examples">headline example</a> also show that Overnight Prints is on the ball? Also yes.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>More <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/26/competitive-ads">competitive ad examples here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another example. We have an ad for a family-owned-and-operated HVAC company at the top of the SERP (excellent differentiator, in addition to &#8220;serving since 1957&#8221;), and then right below it an ad that reads &#8220;Don&#8217;t hire those guys, really &#8211; we can beat their prices.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-competitive-punch.png" alt="ppc ad copy tips - example of competitive google ad copy" width="720" height="543" class="size-full wp-image-65049 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-competitive-punch.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-competitive-punch-480x362.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bold move, but being competitive reflects confidence in your business which imbues confidence in the audience. Plus, the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/05/conversational-tone"> conversational style of writing</a> gives it personality.</p>
<h3>5. Include a CTA in your headlines&#8230;</h3>
<p>It would be naive to assume that every searcher reads every ad in its entirety, but headlines are difficult to skip over. So don’t hide your call to action in the description, put it out there for the world to see in your headline. This is likely to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/14/improve-google-ads-click-through-rate">improve your CTR</a>.</p>
<p>In the examples below, we have three ads. The first one doesn&#8217;t have a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/05/best-call-to-action-phrases">call to action phrase</a> in the headline, but it does have a question. Questions do stand out and technically call forth some action in the form of thought. This one&#8217;s in the clear.</p>
<p>The second one has no CTA in the headline.  Luckily there are CTAs in the description. The third one has a crisp and clean CTA to book a free 30-minute consult. Bingo.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ad-copy-tips-cta-no-cta.png" alt="ppc ad copy tips - example of google ads with and without CTAs" width="720" height="610" class="size-full wp-image-65054 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ad-copy-tips-cta-no-cta.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ad-copy-tips-cta-no-cta-480x407.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>&#8230;highly specific CTAs</h3>
<p>Notice how the CTA in the example above is super-clear? Avoid vague statements like &#8220;Buy Now&#8221; and &#8220;Learn More&#8221; and replace them with specific details. For example:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered table-hover table-condensed">
<thead>
<tr>
<th title="Field #1">Instead of this&#8230;</th>
<th title="Field #2">Try this</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Buy Now and Save</td>
<td>Save $125 Off Your First Order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Used Text Books for Sale</td>
<td>Buy Used Text Books for $30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sale Ends Soon</td>
<td>Claim Offer Before 9/25</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Learn More</td>
<td>Book a 30-Minute Call Today</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<p>The better your prospects can see themselves performing the desired action, the more likely they are to take that action.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-specific-cta-example.png" alt="ppc ad copy tips - example of google ad with specific CTA" width="720" height="360" class="size-full wp-image-65059 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-specific-cta-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-specific-cta-example-480x240.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>6. Use display paths</h3>
<p>The display path is the text that appears after the URL associated with your ad. You’ve got two 15-character display paths to work with. These are optional, and they’re not guaranteed to show, but should you leave them blank? Nope.</p>
<p>Use display paths to show:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keywords</li>
<li>Branded terms</li>
<li>Call to action</li>
<li>Your USP</li>
</ul>
<p>In the example below, the ad uses /online-programs/get-info as the display paths to include the keyword and a call to action.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-display-path.png" alt="ppc ad copy tips - example of google ads using display paths" width="720" height="582" class="size-full wp-image-65064 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-display-path.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-display-path-480x388.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>7. Reiterate and reinforce, but don&#8217;t be redundant</h3>
<p>Yes, you want to make use of the space available to you in your ad, and yes, relevance to the keyword is important for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/quality-score">Quality Score</a>. But no, repeating the same keywords and phrases isn’t going to get you anywhere.</p>
<p>Including it once in your headline, display path, and/or description should be enough. Use the rest of the space for features, benefits, or related keywords. The idea is to reinforce or reiterate without being redundant.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-repetition-redundant-reinforce.png" alt="ppc ad copy tips - example of google ads that are repetitive, redundant, and reinforcing" width="720" height="501" class="size-full wp-image-65056 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-repetition-redundant-reinforce.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-repetition-redundant-reinforce-480x334.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>8. Try seasonal modifiers</h3>
<p>Try using a seasonal headline in your ad, even if you offer your product or service year-round. This can encourage a sense of novelty and urgency and prompt clicks. In the example below, the headline reads &#8220;Fall Promo Ends 12/1.&#8221; Extra bonus points for the specificity of the date.</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-seasonal-modifier.png" alt="ppc ad copy tips - example of google ad with seasonal modifier" width="720" height="617" class="size-full wp-image-65060 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-seasonal-modifier.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-seasonal-modifier-480x411.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></h3>
<h3>9. Address objections with the magic words</h3>
<p>Even though intent to buy is pretty high on search, consumers are, by default, programmed with objections. These are specific to your product or service, but in general, they fall into one of three buckets:</p>
<ol>
<li>I can&#8217;t afford it</li>
<li>It’s too much of a hassle</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t need it</li>
</ol>
<p>Fortunately, I&#8217;ve got a handful of magic words (and synonyms) that are excellent antidotes to these objections. They are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Free:</strong> No cost, low cost, save, affordable, as low as, % off, only, cheap, bargain.</li>
<li><strong>Easy:</strong> Fast, instant, easy, simple, just, in minutes/days/hours, immediate, quick, jif</li>
<li><strong>Worth it:</strong> Return on investment, used by thousands, game-changing, you&#8217;ll never turn back.</li>
</ol>
<ul></ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-objections.png" alt="ppc ad copy tips - example of google ad with objection addressed" width="720" height="353" class="size-full wp-image-65070 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-objections.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-tips-objections-480x235.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>10. Use relationships to evoke emotion</h3>
<p>Coming full circle back to tip #1: Emotion is the most powerful ad copy tool at your disposal. Both positive and negative emotions influence behaviors. And what&#8217;s the best source for emotional ad copy? Relationships.</p>
<p>Way back when, Perry Marshall devised a structured approach to persuasive ad copy called the <a href="http://www.perrymarshall.com/marketing/sak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swiss Army Knife</a>. Blade #1 focuses on relationships, and in the model you have six key players:</p>
<ul>
<li>The customer</li>
<li>Your business</li>
<li>Something they love</li>
<li>Something they hate</li>
<li>Their best friend</li>
<li>Their worst enemy</li>
</ul>
<h3><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/how-to-write-ppc-ads-perry-swiss-army-knife-infographic-1024x656.jpg" alt="how to write ppc ads - perry marshall swiss army knife chart" width="1024" height="656" class="aligncenter wp-image-81393 size-large" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/how-to-write-ppc-ads-perry-swiss-army-knife-infographic-980x628.jpg 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/how-to-write-ppc-ads-perry-swiss-army-knife-infographic-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></h3>
<p>Among these six players there are 15 relationships you can play off of to create emotional hooks for your ads. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t let [worst enemy] prevent you from [something they love].</li>
<li>When [something they hate happens], [your business] [something they love].</li>
<li>Free up time to [something they love] with [someone they love].</li>
</ul>
<p>Just keep in mind that you don&#8217;t need to go over the top with your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotional words and phrases</a>—especially with search ads. You want to evoke emotions so they inspire action, but not provoke them so they distract or come off as desperate or salesy. Oftentimes, a subtle approach works best.</p>
<p>In the example below, the headline reads &#8220;When Banks Say No, We Say Yes.&#8221; There aren&#8217;t even any emotional words in there, but you feel rejection and relief in a matter of seconds.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-relationships.png" alt="ppc ad copy tips - example of google ads using emotional ad copy" width="720" height="376" class="size-full wp-image-65069 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-relationships.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tricks-click-ppc-ad-copy-relationships-480x251.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>11. Use AI&#8230; sparingly</h3>
<p>If you’ve tried all 10 tips so far but still experience a bit of writer’s block when attempting to craft exceptional ad copy, AI can be a handy fallback. While AI should never be used for your finalized ad copy, it can help you start to brainstorm new headline and description ideas when you’re in a pinch.</p>
<p>If you decide to go this route, you’re not alone. In fact, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/ai-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI statistics</a> show that two-thirds of businesses use AI to brainstorm content. Just be sure to perfect your AI prompt first to get a high-quality response from your AI tool and leave yourself time to manually edit and finalize any of your AI-generated ideas.</p>
<p>Here is an example of an AI prompt you could use to jumpstart your PPC ad copywriting:</p>
<p>&#8220;Brainstorm five different ad headlines under 30 characters that promote booking services with my local full-service salon targeting keywords like [insert keywords].&#8221;</p>
<p><span><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f916.png" alt="🤖" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span>Learn more about how AI can help your business&#8217;s Google Ads strategy with our free, complete guide to <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteAIinMarketingGuide.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_AIMarketing_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI in marketing</a>.</p>
<p><a id="template"></a></p>
<h2>Part four: The free PPC ad copy template</h2>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time to put these best practices and tips together. We covered a lot in this guide, and with the responsive component, it can be hard to make sure you cover it all. Which is why we&#8217;ve created this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CWkPBsvUYivxGkBWFkRV7DTTW_b3lfRTHrCQS6o295w/copy">free PPC ad copy Google Sheet template</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s simple but sanity-saving. In it you&#8217;ll see eight different categories of headlines (or even phrases for your descriptions), which include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Keyword-focused:</strong> You need the keyword in your ad, of course, for relevance and Quality Score</li>
<li><strong>Benefits:</strong> What they stand to gain</li>
<li><strong>Features:</strong> How they gain the benefit</li>
<li><strong>Feelings/outcomes:</strong> Why they want the benefit (think emotions and relationships).</li>
<li><strong>Brand messaging:</strong> Taglines, brand names, value propositions</li>
<li><strong>Differentiators:</strong> Social proof, advantages over competitors, other specifics</li>
<li><strong>Pricing terms:</strong> Prices, discounts, promos, savings</li>
<li><strong>CTAs:</strong> Calls to action—remember, keep these super specific!</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/how-to-write-responsive-search-ad-template.jpg" alt="how to write responsive search ads - ad copy template" width="900" height="407" class="aligncenter wp-image-81375 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/how-to-write-responsive-search-ad-template.jpg 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/how-to-write-responsive-search-ad-template-480x217.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CWkPBsvUYivxGkBWFkRV7DTTW_b3lfRTHrCQS6o295w/copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here to get the free template</a>.</p>
<p>With a color-coded visual of these components, you can then make sure you&#8217;re mixing and matching accordingly.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/responsive-search-ad-headline-template.jpg" alt="how to write responsive search ad - ad copy headline template " width="900" height="248" class="aligncenter wp-image-81376 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/responsive-search-ad-headline-template.jpg 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/responsive-search-ad-headline-template-480x132.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Note that there&#8217;s a bucket for CTAs, but you could also just make sure you include headlines that have CTA language in each bucket.</p>
<p>The template has character counts so you can make sure you&#8217;re staying within your limits. And it&#8217;s fully customizable so you can create your own headline buckets.</p>
<h2>Part five: Start writing irresistible PPC ad copy</h2>
<p>You now are fully equipped to write compelling Google Ads that not only stand out and capture clicks, but that also maintain relevance. This is essential for maintaining your Quality Score, which impacts what you pay for each click. Here&#8217;s the quick recap:</p>
<ol>
<li>Think feature &#8211; benefit &#8211; <em>feeling/outcome.</em></li>
<li>Stand out from other ads with a differentiator.</li>
<li>Include highly specific CTAs in your headlines.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be afraid to get boldly competitive.</li>
<li>Show personality with conversational tone and humor.</li>
<li>Use display paths to include your keyword, CTA, and more.</li>
<li>Reinforce and reiterate keywords, but don&#8217;t be redundant.</li>
<li>Try seasonal modifiers to add novelty and urgency.</li>
<li>Address objections with &#8220;free,&#8221; &#8220;easy,&#8221; and &#8220;worth it.&#8221;</li>
<li>Use relationships to evoke emotion</li>
<li>Use AI&#8230; sparingly</li>
</ol>

<h2>How do AI copywriting tools work?</h2>
<p>AI copywriting tools are software that combines machine learning algorithms with huge collections of existing content to produce human-sounding marketing copy. You can then use that copy to inspire your own <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post">blog posts</a>, landing page content, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/01/email-marketing-tips">marketing emails</a>, and even entire <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-write-an-ebook">ebooks</a>.</p>
<p>The big difference between AI and other software is that AI has a sort of algorithmic intuition. It can comprehend and respond in a more human-like way and learn from each interaction.</p>
<p>Here’s an example. Let’s say you’re stuck on writing a blog post headline about the best <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-copywriting">SEO copywriting</a> tools (relatable) so you write a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/08/chatgpt-prompts">prompt</a> in casual language asking for help.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/best-ai-copywriting-tools-chatgpt3.webp" alt="AI copywriting tools - ChatGPT screeshot" width="936" height="485" class="aligncenter wp-image-79969 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/best-ai-copywriting-tools-chatgpt3.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/best-ai-copywriting-tools-chatgpt3-480x249.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Interesting, but I want a little more humor.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/best-ai-copywriting-tools-google-chatgpt2.webp" alt="AI copywriting tools - Second chatgpt screenshot" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-79970 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/best-ai-copywriting-tools-google-chatgpt2.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/best-ai-copywriting-tools-google-chatgpt2-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Not ready for publication yet. And it ignored my request to remove the colons. But the point is, we didn’t have to start over. The AI can take context from our first interaction and continue from there.</p>
<p>There are dozens of AI copywriting tools designed to solve a variety of challenges. But for the most part, they all take a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-prompts-for-social-media">prompt</a>, review large libraries of content, and iterate on a response that’s more human-like than robot.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Writing ads is tough. Use this free <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Google Ads Grader</a> and get an instant audit of your account to make sure all that work isn’t going to waste.</p>

<h2>Great uses for AI copywriting tools</h2>
<p>It’s best <em>not</em> to think of AI as a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/19/copywriting-skills">copywriter</a>, but as a partner that helps you write better copy more efficiently. Sure, AI can blurt out a whole blog post from a single <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/ai-prompt-examples/">prompt</a>, but it probably won’t be very good. And it may even be <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/28/ai-for-marketing">flat out false</a>.</p>
<p>Here are a handful of ways <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/05/generative-ai-in-digital-marketing">AI can help</a> you create better copy faster:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ideation:</strong> Ask your AI tool to suggest 10 blog ideas around a particular topic.</li>
<li><strong>A/B testing:</strong> Use AI to create a few variants of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-write-great-advertising-copy">ad copy</a> to test.</li>
<li><strong>SEO:</strong> AI tools can help you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/05/chatgpt-seo">improve SEO</a> by suggesting how to incorporate keywords into a blog post.</li>
<li><strong>Meta descriptions:</strong> Some AI <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/website-copywriting">copywriting</a> tools can review an image and suggest <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/meta-description">meta descriptions</a> for it.</li>
<li><strong>Busting writer’s block:</strong> If you get stuck on how to phrase a description or write a header, prompt your AI tool to give you some alternatives.</li>
<li>Crafting competitive ad copy: Writing competitive Google Ads is tough, but <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-ads-ai-copy-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI copy tools</a> can make it a breeze.</li>
<li><strong>Surfacing stats:</strong> Ask your AI tool to give you current statistics that support a claim (just make sure you verify them).</li>
<li><strong>Summarizing content:</strong> Many AI tools can pull a transcript from a video or voice recording and create a bullet-point summary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not every AI copywriting tool is built for every job. Let’s look at some of the best tools available and where to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-in-marketing">use AI</a>.</p>
<div id="Best-AI-copywriting-tools"></div>
<h2>Best AI copywriting tools (that aren’t ChatGPT)</h2>
<p>These are some of the best AI copywriting tools based on their popularity and from our own experience. We left ChatGPT off this list since it gets a lot of coverage. Plus, we’ve already <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/06/how-to-use-chatgpt-for-small-business-marketing">written about it</a>.</p>
<h3>Copy.ai</h3>
<p><a href="http://copy.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Copy.ai</a> is purpose-built to automate sales and marketing functions—and this includes a bucketload of tools for copywriters. You can use it to inspire outlines, briefs, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/01/09/social-media-marketing-strategies">social media posts</a>, and even personalized marketing emails.</p>
<p>Workflows on Copy.ai make everything plug-and-play. Each workflow is made for a specific purpose, like ideating Facebook posts.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/best-ai-copywriting-tools-google-workflow.webp" alt="AI copywriting tools - screenshot of a Copy.ai workflow" width="936" height="485" class="aligncenter wp-image-79971 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/best-ai-copywriting-tools-google-workflow.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/best-ai-copywriting-tools-google-workflow-480x249.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You just enter information about your keyword, target audience, and so on. In this case, Copy.AI gave us several ad options based on different <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/16/copywriting-formulas">copywriting frameworks</a>, like problem, agitate, solve (PAS).</p>

<p>There are several styles of content you can create like photography, acrylic paint, and ink. Just remember to closely review any image you plan to post.

Plus, search engine results pages are highly competitive, so you&#8217;ll need multiple variations of each ad to see which works best. That&#8217;s where the <a href="https://localiq.com/google-ads-ai-copy-tool/?cid=Web_LiQ_InContent_AICopyTool_AICT&amp;itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links">Google Ads Copy Tool</a> comes in. Just enter a few details like your business name, target keywords, industry, etc., and the copy tool creates both Google Ads headlines and ad descriptions based on that information.</p>

<h2>How do you get high-quality copy from AI copywriting tools?</h2>
<p>Once you’ve picked some AI copywriting tools to try out, it’ll help to have a plan for how to use them.</p>
<h3>Use AI as a starting point</h3>
<p>There are marketers using AI tools to <a href="https://twitter.com/RossHudgens/status/1729889490947518868" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scrape blog topics</a> from existing websites and create hundreds of posts in a few days for quick traffic. But those gains are sometimes short-lived as Google can cut off the traffic to low-value content in an instant.</p>
<p>The better strategy is to use AI as a writing partner to bounce ideas off of. Ask it to rewrite something you’re struggling with. Or get a list of headlines that might offer a word or structure you hadn’t thought of.</p>
<h3>Factcheck and edit</h3>
<p>Not all AI tools have the latest content to learn from. Much of the verbiage they choose sounds bland. And sometimes they provide false information.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/best-ai-copywriting-tools-google-false.webp" alt="AI copywriting tools - Chatgpt response with incorrect data" width="613" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-79981 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/best-ai-copywriting-tools-google-false.webp 613w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/best-ai-copywriting-tools-google-false-480x470.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 613px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://twitter.com/indranil_leo/status/1608548534386565120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1608548534386565120%7Ctwgr%5E40bef6128b6180cfabce993a97bfb7f8f1977adb%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wordstream.com%2Fblog%2Fws%2F2023%2F06%2F28%2Fai-for-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>That’s why it’s critical that you closely review and edit any AI-generated content. And as we’ve seen, that goes doubly true for images.</p>
<h3>Add personal experience and original data</h3>
<p>Your goal as a marketer is rarely to blend in. To stand out against a sea of AI sameness, you’ll need to interject some original statistics, unique stories, and a voice that doesn’t sound like the exact tone everyone else will get from their AI tools.</p>
<p>In fact, the increased importance of original data and experiences was one of the top<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-marketing-trends-2024"> content marketing trends</a> we noticed.</p>
<div id="AI-copywriting-tools-FAQs"></div>
<h2>FAQs about AI copywriting tools</h2>
<p>We covered a lot of ground. But there are a few questions we see a lot and are worth answering on their own.</p>
<h3>Which is the best tool for AI copywriting?</h3>
<p>This is a bit like asking which is the best hammer. Each tool has features and use cases that fit different needs and users. To find yours, start with the descriptions we gave above, and trial a few to see which suits your needs best.</p>
<h3>Is AI copywriting legal?</h3>
<p>It’s currently legal to use content created by AI as long as it doesn’t directly copy another copyrighted work verbatim. There are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuits</a> and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/01/02/copyright-law-violation-artificial-intelligence-courts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legality discussions</a> in the works that could change how AI content is regulated, though. For now, it’s best to use a plagiarism checker to make sure your AI tool hasn’t drafted a nearly exact copy of something that already exists.</p>
<h3>Can Google detect AI copywriting?</h3>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/02/google-search-and-ai-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google suggests</a> that its systems can identify AI content. However, as long as the search engine deems the copy to be high quality (and meeting its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/14/google-e-e-a-t">E-E-A-T standards</a>), it’s allowed and will not be punished on search engine results pages.</p>
<h2>Find your ideal AI copywriting tool</h2>
<p>AI copywriting tools take on lots of forms for many different functions. The key to finding the right one to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/copywriting-101">improve your copy</a> is structured experimentation.</p>
<p>Start by laying out the most challenging and friction-filled parts of your job. Look for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-ai-tools">AI tools</a> with features to meet them. Then test each one for its output and user interface. This process will make sure you’re choosing software that solves your unique challenges.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a marketer or small business owner, you&#8217;re likely familiar with the challenge of turning abstract ideas into concrete plans. That&#8217;s where a well-written creative brief comes into play. It&#8217;s more than a mere document—it&#8217;s a roadmap for your creative projects that guides your team, aligns your vision, and sets clear expectations for your clients.</p>
<p>But what should a creative brief include and how do you create one that clearly communicates your desired output? We’re sharing all that and more in this article!</p>

<h2>What is a creative brief?</h2>
<p>A creative brief is a concise document that outlines the key elements and objectives of a marketing project or campaign. It serves as a centralized location to communicate all the necessary details in 1-2 pages.</p>
<p>Typically, a creative brief takes the form of a document, whether it&#8217;s a Google doc or a .pdf file. However, it can also be a sheet or a table within a project management tool.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that your brief isn’t a place for draft copy or sketching out ad graphics. It shouldn’t be a collaborative, working document because its purpose is to record the crucial details that everyone involved in a project has agreed to.</p>

<div id="when-to-use-a-creative-brief"></div>
<h2>When do you need a creative brief?</h2>
<p>You need a creative brief for any marketing project that requires developing creative elements and coordination between multiple stakeholders. If you’re a marketing team of one whose boss doesn’t want to oversee social content? You don’t need a creative brief for the holiday content you’re putting together yourself. But if you’re a marketing team of one who is working with an agency to create and manage a holiday social campaign? You’re going to want a creative brief.</p>

<p>Here are a few common types of marketing creative that might require a creative brief:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Graphic design:</strong> Logos, brochures, business cards, brand materials.</li>
<li><strong>Ad campaigns:</strong> Concepts, copy, graphics, media.</li>
<li><strong>Website and UX design:</strong> Full site overhaul, individual pages, event product interfaces.</li>
<li><strong>Content creation:</strong> Blogs, articles, social media posts, and social series.</li>
<li><strong>Videography: </strong>Video content, animations, motion graphics, event videography.</li>
<li><strong>Photography: </strong>Headshots, brand images, product photos, event photography.</li>
<li><strong>Product packaging:</strong> Labels, boxes, containers, shipping materials.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a good overview, but it’s not an exhaustive list. If you need to align multiple people on a project, a creative brief is going to be a good idea—and here’s why.</p>
<div id="why-use-a-creative-brief"></div>
<h2>Why use a creative brief?</h2>
<p>You should use a creative brief to align all stakeholders on a marketing project or campaign. A brief that includes all essential elements—background essentials, creative direction, and follow-through plans—will help avoid re-doing designs or scrapping a blog post. That means saving time and money spent on any given initiative.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise then that Monday.com found that <a href="https://monday.com/blog/marketing/creative-brief-template/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">93%</a> of marketers use a creative brief of some form to capture and communicate information for their projects.</p>
<p>Even though the overwhelming majority of marketers surveyed used creative briefs, most weren’t satisfied. In fact, 67% reported that they found their briefs completely or partially ineffective.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-stat.webp" alt="why use a creative brief stat" width="500" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77180" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-stat.webp 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-stat-480x574.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you’re going to spend time drawing up a document like this for your projects, then it should be effective. Here’s how to write up a successful creative brief—one that leads to better outcomes for your projects and less stress getting there.</p>
<div id="how-to-write-a-creative-brief"></div>
<h2>How to write a creative brief</h2>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step guide to writing your creative brief.</p>
<h3>1. Write a project overview</h3>
<p>The first thing you need in a creative brief is an overview of the project to identify what you’re looking for, for what purpose, and how that will be completed and finalized.</p>
<p>Outlining these will avoid scope creep, which is the gradual expansion of a project&#8217;s original deliverables or requirements. If you’ve ever freelanced, you’re probably all too familiar. This happens when a client adds additional tasks, requests additional features, or increases expectations after the project’s already started. Often, all this ends up as uncompensated work.</p>
<p>This isn’t only bad for contractors, though. When you increase the scope of the project, it often takes more time to complete and needs more communication to review and approve.</p>
<p>Having a quick, clear overview of the project will help avoid scope creep and time delays so that you can keep on track and meet your goals.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/26a1.png" alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website</a></p>
<h3>2. Define the project objectives</h3>
<p>You need objectives for all your marketing activities, and that includes creative campaigns.</p>
<p>Take this example creative brief for PayPal below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-examples-paypal.webp" alt="creative brief example from paypal" width="473" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77182" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-examples-paypal.webp 473w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-examples-paypal-237x300.webp 237w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/aaga8/paypal-creative-brief" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>The objective is stated nicely: The point of the campaign is to clear up misunderstandings about what PayPal does and make its offering super clear.</p>
<p>Now, in a perfect world, the specific misconceptions would be written out here. But this is still a good example of an objective for a campaign. What are you trying to do with the creative? Make sure this is what’s communicated to everyone involved in the project.</p>
<h3>3. Share your brand’s key messaging and facts</h3>
<p>You’ll also need to include your main message or messages that you’re trying to communicate with this marketing collateral.</p>
<p>Say you’re working with a freelancer who is writing copy for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/07/google-ads-location-assets-enhancements">Google Ads</a> about your latest product offering. What’s the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">value proposition</a> of your product? What’s the tagline? What’s the positioning statement? Share your messaging essentials in your creative brief.</p>
<p>While this is especially important for any creative using copy, it’s still useful guidance for visuals. It never hurts to know how best to communicate with your audience—which brings us to the next element of a successful creative brief.</p>
<p>You’ll also need to include some facts that can be used to guide your project. These could be stats, information about your brand, or insight into your audience.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/270f.png" alt="✏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Ready to make your marketing messaging more compelling?

<h3>4. Describe your target audience</h3>
<p>Understanding your brand’s target audience is the key to developing compelling creative assets.</p>
<p>So include relevant details about your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a>. This will include basic demographic information, like age ranges, gender identities, or occupations. But it should also include more insight into your audience’s connection to your company. Why do they connect with your branding?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/identifying-your-target-audience.webp" alt="questions to ask to find your target audience" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77202" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/identifying-your-target-audience.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/identifying-your-target-audience-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If your creative partner knows the pain points that your customers experience and what motivates them to buy your solution or service, they can use this to make the designs, content, or media more personal. And <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">personalized marketing </a>is effective.</p>
<h3>5. Summarize your brand guidelines</h3>
<p>When you’re working with someone outside of your organization—or even simply outside of the marketing team—you should include guidelines for your brand.</p>
<p>The other relevant brand information for this will depend on the project. For graphics, for example, this will include your colors, themes, logos, and any design rules. For content, this will include your brand voice and tone standards or your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/10/content-style-guide">content style guide</a>.</p>
<p>Masooma Memon, a freelance content marketer who writes the great <a href="https://masooma.substack.com/p/letter-51-5-must-use-docs-for-working" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Content Workshop </a>newsletter, recommends keeping this background short and sweet. Instead of sharing a big document, link to a quick one-pager with big dos and don’ts. No one is going to be able to internalize a thick document for a single freelance project, but they are likely to go through a one-pager to make sure everything’s in order.</p>
<h3>6. Point out your competitors</h3>
<p>In your creative brief, you’ll want to include key competitors. You don’t need to include in-depth <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/21/competitive-analysis-templates">competitive analysis</a> in your project document. But you do want to include relevant competitor information.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you manage marketing for a doggy daycare and there’s only one other option in town. If you’re looking for new brand visuals, you want to make sure that your colors, style, and overall creative feel are super distinguishable from your major local competitor.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-competitor-example.webp" alt="creative brief - example of logos from two businesses that look similar" width="766" height="559" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77183" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-competitor-example.webp 766w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-competitor-example-480x350.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 766px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you ended up with logos this close to your competition because you didn’t include it in the creative brief, you’d be in trouble. </em></p>
<h3>7. Include any references for inspiration</h3>
<p>Let’s start with a caveat: Your creative brief should include more information about your business and your products than your competitors. But if you’ve got examples of amazing creative from other companies that you’re looking to for inspiration, include that.</p>
<p>The best examples to use will be from businesses that aren’t your competitors. You never want to copy, but</p>
<p>Take this creative from dog food company <a href="https://www.petfoodprocessing.net/articles/16103-stella-and-chewys-launches-first-ever-national-ad-campaign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stella &amp; Chewy</a>’s campaign below. This photo could be a great reference visual for photos highlighting dog leashes, pet-friendly hotels, or even hiking shoes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-example-inspiration.webp" alt="how to write a creative brief - inspiration photo example" width="869" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77184" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-example-inspiration.webp 869w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-example-inspiration-480x331.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 869px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3><span>8. Spell out the timeline and deliverables</span></h3>
<p>Your creative brief is different from your contract, which you should have as an agreement with any agency or freelancer you’re working with. It’s your contract that will cover payment terms and timelines, as well as other aspects of the agreement such as rights, non-disclosure agreements, and more.</p>
<p>But your creative brief should include an overview of the specific deliverables you’re looking for and the exact deliverables you’re expecting to receive.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re looking for a new logo, you need to specify what file types you’ll need—like .svgs, .pngs, and more—as well as any versions—like black and white, color, reversed, favicon. Those additional logos may not require additional designs, but they do require additional work. Your designer needs to be aware.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-logo-file-formats.webp" alt="logo file formats for creative brief" width="936" height="373" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77185" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-logo-file-formats.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-logo-file-formats-480x191.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://looka.com/blog/logo-file-formats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>It’s also worth confirming the delivery method. Videographers, for instance, might require you to provide a hard drive for physical delivery or specify ahead of time if you need a digital file transfer. If you have a bigger project, those files will be huge. Plus, you’ll need to agree on how many rounds of edits will be included and the turnaround time for these.</p>
<p>So stick a list reviewing the agreed-upon deadlines, the deliverables, and the method of delivery in your creative brief to cover your bases.</p>
<h3>9. State your distribution plan</h3>
<p>Context matters, and it should have a quick spot in your creative brief. Whether you’ve got someone <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post">writing a blog post</a> or putting together graphics for a campaign, it’s good for the creator to have an idea of where their project fits in your marketing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/social-media-sites-popular.webp" alt="popular social media sites" width="678" height="750" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76936" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/social-media-sites-popular.webp 678w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/social-media-sites-popular-480x531.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 678px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Social media assets are great examples for considering this. You can use graphics and copy across platforms, but you’ll want to tailor it slightly for the different personalities of each platform. On Facebook groups and family updates are the big draw. Images are secondary on Twitter. Photos are most polished on Instagram. LinkedIn loves a long-winded post.</p>
<p>Knowing the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">social media platform</a> you’re planning to use for distribution won’t necessarily change the scope of your project. But it will make sure your designer is aware of the types of content you’re competing with for user attention. That’s helpful information.</p>

<h2>Creative brief examples</h2>
<p>Need some inspiration before you write your own creative brief? Here are a few to help guide you!</p>
<h3>Colgate creative brief</h3>
<p>This creative brief from Colgate is simple, yet effective.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-examples-colgate.webp" alt="creative brief examples - colgate creative brief" width="477" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77186" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-examples-colgate.webp 477w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-examples-colgate-239x300.webp 239w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" /></p>
<p>They clearly lay out the information needed to get started on their project. And they keep it simple, yet on brand, with some Colgate-red icons.</p>
<h3>Nike creative brief</h3>
<p>Nike has excellent branding, so it stands to reason that their creative brief would be excellent as well.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-examples-nike.webp" alt="creative brief example from nike" width="436" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77187" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-examples-nike.webp 436w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-examples-nike-219x300.webp 219w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" /></p>
<p>They clearly lay out their facts, objective, problem, the big picture, and their target audience to help guide their project.</p>
<h3>LocaliQ creative brief</h3>
<p>Here’s an example of a creative brief the LocaliQ team uses for internal projects.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-examples-localiq.webp" alt="creative brief example from localiq" width="738" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77188" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-examples-localiq.webp 738w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-examples-localiq-480x390.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 738px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It includes all the necessary information needed to create final deliverables that can include presentations, guides, ads, and more.</p>
<div id="creative-brief-template"></div>
<h2>Creative brief template</h2>
<p>Here’s a simple creative brief template to help you get started. Make a copy and get to work!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-template.webp" alt="creative brief template from wordstream by localiq" width="494" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77189" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-template.webp 494w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/creative-brief-template-480x582.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 494px, 100vw" /></p>

<h2>Make your creative briefs count</h2>
<p>This might seem like a lot of information, but remember that each of these steps shouldn’t take more than a paragraph. Your creative briefs should be compact—short and sweet documents that contain everything you need to know about a marketing project in process in just a few pages.</p>
<p>Here’s how to write a creative brief in 9 simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a project overview</li>
<li>Define the project objectives</li>
<li>Share your brand’s key message and facts</li>
<li>Describe your target market</li>
<li>Summarize your brand guidelines</li>
<li>Point out your competitors</li>
<li>Include any references for inspiration</li>
<li>Spell out the timeline and deliverables</li>
<li>State your distribution plan</li>
</ol>
<p>Follow these steps for less back-and-forth with your team and fewer creative revisions—and more time to focus on how to put your amazing creative to use.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Great copy is all around us. Not just in Nike ads or on billboards, but in emails, social media posts, and those delightful little sandwich boards on city sidewalks.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Copywriting-skills-meme-board.jpg" alt="copywriting skills - sandwich board on a city sidewalk" width="497" height="595" class="aligncenter wp-image-73878 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Copywriting-skills-meme-board.jpg 497w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Copywriting-skills-meme-board-480x575.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 497px, 100vw" /><em><a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/funny-chalkboard-signs-v2/ejlinehan" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></em></p>
<p>All those words do some heavy lifting for businesses. They generate awareness, traffic, leads, and conversions. That’s true of sidewalk sandwich boards and seven-figure ad campaigns.</p>
<p>So how do you write copy that converts?</p>
<p>After a decade of professional writing, I’ve found some copywriting skills to be fundamental for choosing words that compel action–whether copywriting is a central focus of your job or just something you dabble in. I’ve listed them here and ranked them, starting with the most important.</p>
<p>Master these skills and your copy will do big things for your business. And if you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;ll enjoy the heck out of writing it.</p>
<h2>1. Curiosity</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/03/copywriting-examples">best copywriters</a> I’ve ever read aren’t always the best “writers.” They’re people who genuinely want to understand how something works and are excited to explain it to others.</p>
<p>Famed adman David Ogilvy was the epitome of curiosity. He obsessed over understanding everything about the products he marketed and the people who bought them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Copywriting-skills-example-ogilvy.jpg" alt="Copywriting skills - copy of a David Ogilvy ad for a car" width="721" height="595" class="aligncenter wp-image-73879 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Copywriting-skills-example-ogilvy.jpg 721w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Copywriting-skills-example-ogilvy-480x396.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 721px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Curiosity is the fuel that energizes every other skill on this list. If you’re curious, you’ll naturally be more empathic. You’ll want to learn marketing strategy. And you’ll be a crazy good interviewer.</p>
<p>You can even <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/10/curiosity-gap">leverage your audience’s curiosity</a> to generate more awareness.</p>
<p>That’s why I consider curiosity to be the most important copywriting skill.</p>
<h2>2. Empathy</h2>
<p>Empathy is an important <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/copywriting-101">copywriting skill</a> because it gives us the power to imagine what a customer is battling with so we can explain our solution in a more relevant way.</p>
<p>With a little empathy, you won’t write that a family SUV has a state-of-the-art entertainment system. Instead, you’ll say it has “enough distraction that no one will ask ‘are we there yet?’”</p>
<p>Molly Maids gets it. They use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/22/power-words">power words</a> like “chaos” and “stress” to empathize with busy parents trying to hold it together during school break.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Copywriting-skills-pyramid-2.jpg" alt="Copywriting skills - screenshot of a Molly Maids ad" width="475" height="595" class="aligncenter wp-image-73880 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Copywriting-skills-pyramid-2.jpg 475w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Copywriting-skills-pyramid-2-239x300.jpg 239w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px" /></p>
<p>Empathy is a <a href="https://www.scn.ucla.edu/pdf/Rameson(2009).pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neurological response</a>, so most of us have it naturally. But you can <a href="https://ideas.ted.com/5-exercises-to-help-you-build-more-empathy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sharpen the skill</a> with practice.</p>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download">Best Words &amp; Phrases for Marketing with Emotion</a></div></div>
<h2>3. Goal setting</h2>
<p>When writing, it’s easy to get lost in turning fun phrases and overusing alliteration. But it’s important to remember that copywriting, by nature, needs a specific goal. It may be to increase awareness of your brand or to have people click a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/20/call-to-action-examples">call-to-action button</a> in an ad.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Copywriting-skills-example-manpacks.jpg" alt="Copywriting skills - ad for ManPack underwear" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-73881 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Copywriting-skills-example-manpacks.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Copywriting-skills-example-manpacks-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Either way, the goal is your destination and copywriting is how you get there.</p>
<p>Goal setting is an important copywriting skill because, without it, you won’t likely be aligned with your organization&#8217;s <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-plan-goals-objectives-for-small-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing objectives</a>. Maybe you write copy targeting the wrong type of customers. Or you might be aiming for clicks when the real need is <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/lead-generation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new leads</a>.</p>
<p>Since the goal determines how you’ll research and write copy, goal setting lands high up on this list.</p>
<h2>4. Understanding marketing</h2>
<p>I’ve yet to be in a situation where something I wrote wasn’t part of a larger <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/02/b2b-marketing-strategies">marketing strategy</a>. The more I learn about other disciplines like <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/ppc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PPC</a> and <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/local-social-media-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media marketing</a>, the more effective I am at writing copy that makes those initiatives successful. That’s how understanding marketing makes its way to the number four spot of important copywriting skills.</p>
<p>Here’s an example. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/01/content-marketing-funnel">Sales funnels</a> are a foundational concept for marketers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Copywriting-skills-marketing-funnel-1.jpg" alt="Copywriting skills - marketing funnel" width="526" height="599" class="aligncenter wp-image-73882 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Copywriting-skills-marketing-funnel-1.jpg 526w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Copywriting-skills-marketing-funnel-1-480x547.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 526px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Once I understood how customers moved through a sales funnel, I was better able to write copy that made each transition smoother. It was especially helpful when I got into <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/25/email-copywriting-tips">writing email marketing copy</a>. I stopped trying to convert every reader and started educating and entertaining people who weren’t ready to buy. Open rates went up and subscriber churn went down.</p>
<h2>5. Applying the four Cs of copywriting</h2>
<p>The four Cs that describe good copywriting are: clear, credible, concise, and compelling. When you apply them to your copy, it naturally gets better.</p>
<p>The real copywriting skill here though is to know in which order to apply the four Cs.</p>
<p>Here’s how I consider it:</p>
<p><strong>Copy should always be clear.</strong></p>
<p>Above all else, a reader needs to understand your message. Whatever else you do, make sure it’s clear.</p>
<p><strong>Copy should be credible, as long as it remains clear.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/03/ad-copy-examples">Copywriting needs to build trust.</a> Add customer stories, mention awards, etc. to show you’re good at what you do.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Copywriting-skills-example-FAB.jpg" alt="Copywriting skills - Marked up ad highlighting social proof and image" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-73883 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Copywriting-skills-example-FAB.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Copywriting-skills-example-FAB-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Just make sure those additions don’t muddy the message.</p>
<p><strong>Copy should be concise, as long as it’s still clear and credible.</strong></p>
<p>You don’t have much time to get your point across. So cut any words or phrases that don’t serve that purpose. That said, you don’t want to remove so many words that people don’t know what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>Copy should be compelling as long as it’s still clear, concise, and credible.</strong></p>
<p>Copy needs to motivate people to think or do something. You can use some power words, a sense of urgency, or analogies to bring it all home.</p>
<p>There’s a thin line between compelling and pushy, though. If you can&#8217;t add more compelling copy without losing credibility (or without making it too long), then trim it down and focus on the other points.</p>
<h2>6. Explaining the complex simply</h2>
<p>There’s a phrase in education and marketing called explain it like I’m five (ELI5). The idea is to break down complex topics and present them in a way a five-year-old could understand. That’s an incredibly useful skill for a copywriter since you’re often the translator between technical people that make a product and non-technical people who use it.</p>
<p>There are lots of ways to use ELI5. You can use a conversational tone, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/16/copywriting-formulas">use copywriting formulas</a>, or add <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/20/copywriting-techniques">bridge phrases</a> to keep readers engaged.</p>
<h2>7. Interviewing like a detective</h2>
<p>There’s an old detective TV show called Columbo. In it, the title character kindly, yet incessantly, asks suspects “just one more question” until he understands exactly what happened on the night of the murder.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Copywriting-skills-meme-columbo-2.jpg" alt="Copywriting skills - meme featuring Columbo" width="677" height="594" class="aligncenter wp-image-73884 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Copywriting-skills-meme-columbo-2.jpg 677w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Copywriting-skills-meme-columbo-2-480x421.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 677px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Interviews aren’t interrogations. But when you approach a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-feedback-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer</a> or subject matter expert with the drive to get the whole picture, you’ll ask that one more question that exposes a killer story.</p>
<h2>8. Applying psychology</h2>
<p>One of my biggest regrets is not minoring in psychology. Not because I want to know how to hack people’s brains to sell more. But to better understand how people process information and to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/21/emotional-ad-copy-examples">write better emotional ad copy</a>. That’s a skill any copywriter would benefit from.</p>
<p>In lieu of registering for formal classes, copywriters can learn about<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/01/psychology-copywriting-tips-examples"> specific psychological principles</a> and practice folding them into their copy. There are also plenty of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/01/13/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing">existing examples of emotional copy</a> to study.</p>
<h2>9. Prioritizing like a journalist</h2>
<p>Are you familiar with the inverted pyramid? It was one of the first principles I learned in my Journalism 101 class. Essentially, it’s how reporters place the most important information at the top of the page, and then add supporting details after.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/inverted-pyramid-structure.jpg" alt="Copywriting skills - Inverted pyramid graphic" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73896" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/inverted-pyramid-structure.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/inverted-pyramid-structure-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In other communication disciplines, it’s called BLUF (bottom line up front).</p>
<p>Either way, it’s a really useful skill for writing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/14/ppc-ad-copywriting">Google Ads copy</a> and anything optimized for small screens where most of your message is below the fold.</p>
<h2>10. Checking your ego</h2>
<p>I learned early in my career that ego is the killer of great copy for several reasons.</p>
<p>First, copywriting is a team sport. The best work happens when people with various experiences collaborate. That means being open to ideas from people who don’t have a writing background.</p>
<p>Second, you sometimes have to delete your favorite bits of copy. The unflattering term is “killing your darlings,” and it means removing really well-written copy that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/16/copywriting-mistakes">doesn’t match the tone</a> or target of the piece.</p>
<p>And finally, you&#8217;ll often <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/15/copywriting-tips">need to write something bad</a> to get to something good. When I first started writing, I would bang away at the keyboard, aggressively hit backspace, then pound the keys even harder while trying a new angle. Eventually, I learned to just let a bad version flow first, even if it hurts my pride. There are always rounds of edits to make it great.</p>
<h2>11. Understanding SEO basics</h2>
<p>We’re getting toward the bottom of the list, but I don’t want to give the impression that SEO isn’t important. Even now in the age of zero-click posts and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/ai-content-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI-powered everything</a>, a lot of traffic comes from those search engine results pages. And often, it’s people in the middle of looking for things you sell.</p>
<p>Copywriting for SEO is its own skill. You need to know <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">how to find keywords</a> and fit them into your copy organically. You also should understand things like page structure and alt tags. It takes a little time to master, but SEO copywriting skills are an important arrow in a marketer’s quiver.</p>

<h2>12. Focusing on value</h2>
<p>I first learned about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/06/how-to-write-copy-that-sells">FAB (feature, advantage, benefit)</a> in a class on sales, years before I started writing. The point of the class was to teach us the difference between a characteristic of a product (feature), how it helps (advantage), and why that will make a customer’s life better (benefit).</p>
<p>The lesson was, to make a product more relevant and valuable, highlight the benefit.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Copywriting-skills-FAB.jpg" alt="Copywriting skills - marked up add highlighting the feature and benefit of a product." width="936" height="348" class="aligncenter wp-image-73886 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Copywriting-skills-FAB.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Copywriting-skills-FAB-480x178.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For example, the feature of a new mop could be its spring-loaded wringer. The advantage is that it needs less force to push dirty water out of the mop head. But we’d lead with the benefit, “less effort, faster cleaning.”</p>
<h2>13. Keeping your attention on detail…</h2>
<p>My first grownup job was as a sales manager for a large retail chain. Our mantra for putting up new displays or stocking shelves was “retail is detail.” While the rhyme falls apart, being detail-oriented is a clutch skill for copywriting as well.</p>
<p>There are dollars behind why paying attention to detail is important. Companies with frequent grammar and spelling mistakes on their website lose <a href="https://martechseries.com/sales-marketing/programmatic-buying/website-speling-grammer-mistakes-cost-us-businesses-millions-lost-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">double the amount</a> of customers than businesses without those errors. Plus, Google Ads with typos get <a href="https://www.agilitypr.com/pr-news/public-relations/website-spelling-and-grammar-errors-are-costlier-than-you-may-think/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fewer clicks and cost more per click</a> than other ads.</p>
<h2>14. …while being comfortable enough to break grammar rules</h2>
<p>Tools like Grammarly and even <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/06/how-to-use-chatgpt-for-small-business-marketing">ChatGPT</a> make getting grammar right pretty easy. The real challenge is adeptly going against the rules when it helps your copy.</p>
<p>As the great Ann Handley put it in her book <a href="https://annhandley.com/everybodywrites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everybody Writes</a>, “I encourage you to safely and fearlessly break those rules and to make those mistakes in writing—but only when doing so lends greater clarity and readability.”</p>
<p>So fire up your spell and grammar checkers. But learn from the things they correct. Then, when the opportunity presents itself, you can blur grammatical lines to write better copy.</p>
<h2>Gain copywriting skills from the experts</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/website-copywriting">Copywriting</a> isn&#8217;t just for full-time, professional marketers. Just about anyone who has to write emails, presentations, or sales flyers for work will benefit from knowing how to do it better.</p>
