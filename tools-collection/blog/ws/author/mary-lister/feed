<div id="small-business-ideas-from-home"></div>
<h2>Small business ideas from home</h2>
<p>Remote work is all the rage, for good reason. Why leave your house to make money when you don’t have to? No more commute, no more expensive lunches and inescapable coworkers. We have the best small business ideas that you can make happen right from the comfort of your home.</p>
<h3>1. Childcare business</h3>
<p>After entire families were stuck at home together for months on end, daycare providers are in high-demand for parents who transitioned to remote work. The best part? If you are a stay-at-home parent, you can offer daycare out of your home and take care of your kids at the same time.</p>
<p>Average yearly salary: $29,000</p>
<h3>2. Virtual fitness trainer</h3>
<p>During and after the pandemic, gyms saw huge drops in membership numbers and influencers had a field day with <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/11/at-home-diy-video">DIY at-home videos</a>. People figured out that they don’t need to go all the way into a gym to exercise. And the rise of video fitness trainers created an interest in a variety of exercise experiences. Which is a fancy way of saying that online fitness training, on YouTube, Instagram, via the MindBody app, and more, is a thriving business model.</p>
<p>Salaries for trainers range from $30,000 &#8211; $70,000 per year, but the money you make online would be dependent on your pricing model.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/best-small-business-ideas-from-home-online-fitness-kayla.png" alt="best-small-business-ideas-from-home-online-fitness-kayla" width="720" height="365" class="aligncenter wp-image-52433 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/best-small-business-ideas-from-home-online-fitness-kayla.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/best-small-business-ideas-from-home-online-fitness-kayla-480x243.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/kaylaitsines" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>Fitness trainer or not, video is the way to go. Follow our tips on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/05/14/how-to-get-more-views-on-youtube">how to get more video views</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/10/youtube-seo-tips">rank higher on YouTube</a>.</p>
<h3>3. Web developer</h3>
<p>Learning to be a web developer does require training and upfront schooling costs. However, there are plenty of boot camps that will get you up to speed. And the best thing about web development is that you can choose a plethora of specialities, from focusing on marketing websites to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/articles/ecommerce-website-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ecommerce websites</a> to blogs&#8230;basically anything you can browse on the internet.</p>
<p>If you’re not looking to actually be a web developer, consider starting a small business to manage them. Freelance web development is in high demand!</p>
<p>Web dev salaries are fairly high, starting around $60,000 per year and going up to $150,000 depending on your skillset and location.</p>
<h3>4. Executive assistant</h3>
<p>As the economy experiences massive growth through tech, there are plenty of up-and-coming c-suite executives who somehow never learned to schedule meetings (shots fired). But really, being an executive assistant can take place from the comfort of your home at a remote company, and if your executive is looking for part-time help, you can take on more than one. And there you have it, a burgeoning small business from home!</p>
<p>Executive assistant salaries start around $60k.</p>
<h3>5. Nonprofit Work</h3>
<p>Starting a small business is a lot easier when you know you’re <a href="/blog/ws/2018/02/22/cause-based-marketing">contributing a net-good to your community</a>. Starting a nonprofit isn’t easy, but it can be done remotely, particularly if you’re looking to run this business yourself. Pick a cause that you feel passionately about and dive right in.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/best-small-businesses-from-home-nonprofit.png" alt="best-small-businesses-from-home-nonprofit" width="720" height="475" class="aligncenter wp-image-52435 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/best-small-businesses-from-home-nonprofit.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/best-small-businesses-from-home-nonprofit-480x317.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>

<div id="unique-small-business-ideas"></div>
<h2>Unique small business ideas</h2>
<p>What do we mean by “good” small businesses? We mean evergreen, stable businesses that provide a service people will always need. Anecdotally, my grandfather heard Hoover promise to put a chicken in everyone’s pot. People will always eat chicken. So he started a chicken business. Don’t worry, these small business ideas don’t require plucking feathers.</p>
<h3>6. Translator</h3>
<p>As the world becomes more global, the need for translation services continues to rise. Some of that involves translating emails, documents, and content, but others are more service-oriented, like accompanying groups or business leaders on international trips. It’s important to note that you’ll not only need conversational translation skills but also grammatical and structural understanding of a language.</p>
<h3>7. Tutor</h3>
<p>If you’re an adult who has graduated from high school and/or college, you likely have something to teach kids. If you have an affinity for teaching, try out tutoring first. Not only can you tutor multiple students, you can dabble in different subject matter, like SATs or remedial Spanish. The time commitment stays according to what you want and small tutoring businesses are in high-demand, even remotely.</p>
<h3>8. Nanny</h3>
<p>People just keep having babies! If you love playing with kids, using your imagination and packing snacks, a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/childcare-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nanny business</a> might be for you. Depending on your level of commitment to one family, sometimes nannying positions offer food, board, and benefits, or you could be a part time nanny!</p>
<h3>9. IT consulting</h3>
<p>This is a small business that is always needed by other small businesses. If you know your way around an IT stack and know how to fix it when it breaks, make a website and start collecting payments because you’re in high demand.</p>
<p>IT professionals are well-compensated by job or by the hour.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/best-small-business-ideas-from-home-technology-consulting.jpeg" alt="best-small-business-ideas-from-home-technology-consulting" width="600" height="427" class="aligncenter wp-image-52438 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/best-small-business-ideas-from-home-technology-consulting.jpeg 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/best-small-business-ideas-from-home-technology-consulting-480x342.jpeg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>10. Online advertiser</h3>
<p>At this point, to say that digital marketing is an ever-growing industry is to say that the sky is blue. It&#8217;s a fact and businesses that want to survive must invest in <a href="/blog/ws/2021/01/04/best-marketing-strategies-2021">online marketing strategies</a>, but small business owners wearing many hats don&#8217;t have time to learn or keep up with the ever-changing platforms. Consider starting an advertising gig for small businesses. You might even end up <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/17/how-to-start-a-digital-marketing-agency">starting your own agency.</a></p>

<p>Why start a business if you’re not sure you’ll make money? We all work to live (hopefully), and these small business ideas will make you the most money to keep your bank account plump and your vacations fancy.</p>
<h3>11. Handyman</h3>
<p>Jack of all trades, master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one. While I am in the process of renovating an old house, I have never appreciated handymen more. If you are handy around the house and like figuring out how to fix things, a handyman business could be for you.</p>
<p>Payment for handymen varies based on the type and length of a job.</p>

<h3>12. Event planner</h3>
<p>This may fall into creative small businesses, but it is also a fairly steady job (despite the pandemic). People will always celebrate birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, holidays, and need help with planning the events. If you are hyper-organized, can herd cats with the best of them, and have attention to detail, consider planning events!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/small-profitable-business-ideas-event-planner.png" alt="small-profitable-business-ideas-event-planner" width="720" height="332" class="aligncenter wp-image-52439 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/small-profitable-business-ideas-event-planner.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/small-profitable-business-ideas-event-planner-480x221.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/vanessamvalerius/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<h3>13. Transcriptionist</h3>
<p>With<a href="/blog/ws/2017/09/15/video-content-marketing"> video content</a> becoming more popular by the year, transcription services become even more important. In fact, I was desperately searching for transcriptions just last week. Now, I’m referring to casual marketing video transcription but for a legal or court transcriptionist or medical, you’ll need certifications that are fairly affordable to get.</p>
<p>Transcriptionists make an average of $52,000 per year.</p>
<h3>14. Movers</h3>
<p>We’ve seen a rash of big moves the past few years with people exiting urban areas to purchase homes in the suburbs—and some migration back to big cities as well. Moving isn’t fun for anyone and small moving companies have made a fortune on this real estate boom. Get in on the action by starting a small moving business.</p>
<p>Movers typically get paid per hour or per job, if it’s a multi-day, out-of-state move.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/good-small-business-ideas-exela-movers.png" alt="good-small-business-ideas-exela-movers" width="720" height="337" class="aligncenter wp-image-52440 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/good-small-business-ideas-exela-movers.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/good-small-business-ideas-exela-movers-480x225.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://exelamovers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<h3>15. Antiquities renovation</h3>
<p>Okay, it’s likely you’ve never heard of this one, and it likely mostly applies to people who live in historic areas. However, there is a niche market for people who are able to restore and reinstall original fixtures in old homes, from cabinet pulls to bricks and old window panes. In fact, I just bought 200 year old bricks specific to my town to place in the house I’m renovating. So if vintage charm is your style, this small business may also be.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f495.png" alt="💕" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Want more tips and ideas?</strong> We&#8217;ve got 130+ for you!

<h3>16. Short-term rental manager</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, my parents rented out half of their house on AirBnb. They made a killing in their little hotel-less town with grandparents visiting family, families in between homes, and business people staying for a consulting project. Eventually they stopped Airbnb because it was too much work for my mom to clean and sanitize after every guest.</p>
<p>Point of the story: rental managers are largely successful and becoming even more so with the rise of home rentals. Reach out to local Airbnb and VRBO hosts to see how you can help manage their rentals acting as a sort-of superintendent for guests.</p>
<p>Rental manager salaries are dependent on where you are located, but most profitable in urban centers.</p>

<h2>Easy small business ideas for teens or adults</h2>
<p>Looking for a side hustle that doesn’t take too much effort? Same. We found the easiest small businesses to start that will also be (we hope) fun too!</p>
<h3>17. Pet care</h3>
<p>Not to disregard the effort that goes into raising pets, taking care of pets can be the best job ever. You can be a dog walker, a cat sitter, check on chickens, feed horses, the list goes on and on. You can choose which jobs you want to take, what hours you want to work, and sometimes you’ll get to house sit as an added bonus.</p>
<p>Pet sitter businesses make between $10-$25 per hour, depending on the number of pets and your location.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/easy-small-business-ideas-pet-care-pebble.png" alt="easy-small-business-ideas-pet-care-pebble" width="720" height="527" class="aligncenter wp-image-52441 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/easy-small-business-ideas-pet-care-pebble.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/easy-small-business-ideas-pet-care-pebble-480x351.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://pebblenaturals.com/pages/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<h3>18. Proofreading/quality assurance</h3>
<p>I’m pretty stoked on this one. Yes, being a proofreader and QA specialist are different&#8230;but also very similar. If you are a <a href="/blog/ws/2017/08/23/self-editing-tips">good writer </a>and have a knack for noticing tiny details, these jobs might be for you. They are always in high demand, because who has time to check their own work these days, and you can easily pick up work on UpWork or a number of other freelance sites until your portfolio is ready to launch your small business.</p>
<p>Proofreaders and QA specialists can get paid up to $80,000 per year.</p>
<h3>19. Notary</h3>
<p>Ever need something notarized and don’t know where to go? Luckily, I know some small business owners who have a notary on-call. Becoming a notary isn’t the easiest process, but it isn’t expensive. And once you’re done, you too can be an on-call notary or offer your services to courthouses and small businesses full-time.</p>
<p>Notary salaries have a broad range from $20,000-$52,000 per year. But being able to choose when to work (or not) while you have a high-demand certification will come in clutch.</p>
<h3>20. Personal shopper</h3>
<p>Being a personal shopper is the dream of so many fashion students. Imagine being able to shop for the perfect jewelry, clothing, furnishings, and not actually having to pay for any of it! With the expansion of <a href="/blog/ws/2021/01/11/increase-online-store-sales">online ecommerce stores</a>, most of this job can be done remotely. And personal shoppers are well-compensated, earning about $60,000 per year.</p>
<div id="creative-small-business-ideas-for-women"></div>
<h2>Creative small business ideas for women</h2>
<p>Want to start a small business to lean into your creative juices? Maybe you work in a corporate environment and excel sheets have dried up your brain. I’m all for having a creative outlet, and if you can make money off of it, even better. Here are our creative small business ideas.</p>
<h3>21. Landscaper</h3>
<p>If I had leaned into the plant-mom craze, I might want to be a landscaper, but I hate gardening. However, if you’re the type of person who gets stress relief from gardening, landscaping might be for you.</p>
<p>This can be one of the most satisfying, creative jobs. You’ll have the ability to transform properties into magic gardens—or at least maintain green lawns, flower beds, ponds, and make people happy.</p>
<p>Landscaper pay can be between $10-25/hour, or you can price your services by project.</p>
<h3>22. Gift kit creator</h3>
<p>Ever receive a box in the mail full of customized snacks, wine, gadgets, and knick-knacks? I’ve been loving the gift boxes I receive now that I’m <a href="/blog/ws/2017/06/16/working-remotely">working fully remote</a>. And you better believe I love working with gift kit creators, who search markets far and wide to curate the perfect batch for their audiences. Gift kit businesses don’t require too much upfront, as you can ask the buyer to pay before purchasing and drop shipping any items.</p>

<h3>23. Travel planner</h3>
<p>This is my dream job. Travel planners get perks galore, from discounted hotel rates to inside info about airlines and tour guides. It can be the most creative small business through planning trips in a niche&#8211;maybe your specialty is South America or Iceland trips for college kids or seniors! Even better, this business can be run from home&#8230;or anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Travel agents typically get paid between $35,000-$67,000 per year.</p>
<h3>24. Influencer</h3>
<p>While some people might not consider <a href="/blog/ws/2021/03/23/how-to-become-a-social-media-influencer">being an influencer</a> a creative business, I certainly think the trendsetters of the world would differ. There are plenty of courses to take that will help train you to be an influencer in this brave new world of social media.</p>
<p>Being an influencer comes with a lot of scrutiny and variable pay; this is truly a pick-your-own-adventure type of gig.</p>
<p>Influencer or not, the fact that influencers exist speaks to the power of <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/local-social-media-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media marketing</a>, so make sure you&#8217;re using it for whatever business you start!</p>
<h3>25. Thrifting reseller</h3>
<p>Thrifting, altering, and upselling vintage goods was the way NastyGal got their start—and has now become somewhat of an online business. If you have an affinity for spotting diamonds in the rough, hit your local goodwill, grab some clothes, make an eBay account, and get selling. You can be your own boss, designer, brand, or whatever you please with this creative small business.</p>

<h2>How do you find the best business to start?</h2>
<p>The most successful businesses solve a problem for a specific group of people. When you’re looking to start a small business, not a big corporation with investor funding, look for a niche that you, and you alone, are the best person to step into.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Doing anything for the first time ever is really hard. I recently helped plan a big event and as a content marketer&#8230;well&#8230;let’s just say it wasn’t my favorite task. That’s why the spirit in the sky created marketing templates.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/marketing-templates-thankful-otter.jpeg" width="300" height="450" alt="marketing templates meme" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>When you&#8217;re starting from scratch and you find a template.</em></p>
<p>I know that I would be lost and alone without so many of these templates. I’ve used them myself, as a constant employee of startups, and I can’t imagine what other marketers do without them. So if you want to be proud of building from the ground up while not reinventing the wheel, take a look!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got templates for big plans, small requests, and everything in between. Many of them are our own, but we&#8217;ve included plenty of templates from others just in case you get sick of us.</p>
<p>Have at it!</p>

<h2><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">What is a marketing campaign?</span></h2>
<p>The term &#8220;marketing campaign&#8221; is quite broad and can mean many things. I&#8217;ve defined it here as a project executed to drive a specific action and carried out through one or a variety of channels. For example, you might be run a giveaway marketing campaign and carry it all out on social media. Or you might send out emails about it, write blog posts on it, have an influencer get the word out, and so on.</p>
<p>Marketing campaigns are designed to drive a specific goal, like <a href="/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">increasing website traffic</a>, boosting sales on a particular product or service, or getting more people to try out a free tool. They also typically have specific time frames assigned to them in order to accurately test, analyze, and optimize.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://www.longitude.co.uk/what-we-do/marketing-campaign-planning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot that goes into a successful marketing campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Who: </strong>Which audience segments are you targeting? New customers? Dormant customers? Users of a particular service you offer?</li>
<li><strong>What</strong>: What are you promoting, and what are the assets needed for the campaign?</li>
<li><strong>Where</strong>: Where will you be carrying out the campaign? Social, email, website, offline?</li>
<li><strong>When</strong>: When do you plan to launch, run, and close the campaign?</li>
<li><strong>Why</strong>: Why are you running the campaign? What short and long-term goals does it target?</li>
<li><strong>How</strong>: How will each piece of content work together to maximize the campaign&#8217;s success?</li>
</ul>

<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">There are plenty of ways to leverage marketing campaigns to drive your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/06/15/marketing-objectives">marketing objectives</a>. Let&#8217;s take a look at some types of marketing campaigns you can run.</span></p>
<h3>1. Launch campaigns</h3>
<p>For those of us who like to work for startups, you’re probably familiar with the hustle of trying to get brand new launches in front of an audience—whether for a new product, service, or feature.</p>
<p>This is the perfect opportunity for a marketing campaign! Depending on the size of your launch, you may want a full-court press on all your marketing platforms. For launches in particular, think about including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press release (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/04/how-to-write-a-press-release">Learn how to write a press release here!</a>)</li>
<li>Press features or sponsorships</li>
<li>Blog post written by stakeholders</li>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2017/02/16/content-syndication">Syndicated</a> content on LinkedIn or Medium</li>
<li>Advertising campaigns on social platforms</li>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2021/03/23/how-to-become-a-social-media-influencer">Influencer</a> or network support</li>
</ul>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/best-marketing-campaigns-apple-ipod.png" width="500" height="549" alt="best marketing campaigns—apple ipod launch" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>The iPod launch campaign did so well, Apple still uses this type of imagery and copy for their wearables.</em></p>
<p>For tips on this campaign type, check out <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">12 Ways to Effectively Promote a New Product or Service</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Sales promotion campaigns</h3>
<p>Thinking about reducing the price of a service for a limited time only? Upgrading your bread-and-butter product? Sounds like a great time to market that through a time-limited marketing campaign.</p>

<p>You’ll need to communicate with your existing customers to update them about the discount or new UX, and you can try to leverage them to spread the word.</p>
<p>You’ll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email communication <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/21/promotional-email-examples">(promotional email examples here</a>).</li>
<li>Blog post (depending on the duration of the campaign).</li>
<li>Network support</li>
<li>Shareable social media assets</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of<a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/13/sales-promotion-examples"> sales promotions </a>you might use for a campaign like this.</p>
<h3>3. Event marketing campaigns</h3>
<p>Conferences are finally making a comeback! This hits close to home, as I am neck-deep in planning conference sponsorships, speaking sessions, and booth designs. Not to mention attending webinar after webinar on “how to” this and “how to” that.</p>
<p>To make sure people attend your webinar, show up to your workshop, or buy tickets to the conference you’re holding, include some of these materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drip emails</li>
<li>One-to-one outreach</li>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2020/02/19/webinar-landing-pages">Landing page</a> with registration form</li>
<li>Shareable social assets</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Lots of other marketing campaigns</h3>
<p>Those are just three of the many types of marketing campaigns. The list goes on and on, depending on your goals, business circumstances, and what you define as a marketing campaign.</p>
<p>For example, here are some more to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reengagement marketing campaigns: </strong>to get dormant or former customers to come back.</li>
<li><strong>Product or service-specifc marketing campaigns:</strong> to promote an existing product or service that needs some extra love.</li>
<li><strong><a href="/blog/ws/2019/09/24/updating-google-ads-for-company-rebrand">Rebranding</a> marketing campaigns: </strong>Nothin&#8217; like showing your new makeover to the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without further ado, let’s get into some examples! You can use these to inspire your next marketing campaign, spark some creativity for the current one, or help you plan a roadmap.</p>
<h2><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">The best marketing campaigns we&#8217;ve seen and what we can learn from them</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Below are five great examples of marketing campaigns done right. I&#8217;ll also talk about how you can apply them to your own campaigns.</span></p>
<h3>1. Two kinds of people (Apple)</h3>
<p>Way back before the Mac was a &#8220;book&#8221; and when personal computers were a luxury, Apple launched the Lisa—the first ever computer with a mouse. Their launch campaign included  a TV commercial starring Kevin Costner.</p>
<p>No, this was not the first <a href="/blog/ws/2015/02/26/influencer-marketing">influencer marketing campaign</a>. In fact, this was a pre-fame Kev.</p>
<p>And no, the Lisa never took off.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the script of this commercial that makes it such a hallmark campaign: <em>&#8220;That&#8217;s why we make the most advanced personal computers in the world. And why soon, there may be two kinds of people: those who use computers and those who use Apples.&#8221;</em></p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/best-marketing-campaigns-kevin-costner-apple.png" width="500" height="374" alt="best marketing campaigns apple kevin costner" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m515f5p5e1w" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Watch the commercial here.</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Takeaway: stay committed to your <a href="/blog/ws/2014/07/31/brand-voice">brand voice</a></strong></p>
<p>As you can see, &#8220;Think different&#8221; may be Apple&#8217;s current<a href="/blog/ws/2021/09/21/advertising-slogans"> marketing slogan</a> but this has been their messaging since the 80s.  encompasses the history of their brand messaging. You can&#8217;t truly <a href="/blog/ws/2021/09/23/how-brand-your-business">brand your business</a> without <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/brand-consistency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistency</a>, and Apple has done their due diligence in this arena for the past three decades.</p>

<h3>2. Operation Santa (USPS)</h3>
<p>I am fascinated by USPS. I mean, how absolutely mind-boggling amazing is it that you can put a cheap, sticky paper onto an envelope, put it in a box outside your house, and it will MAGICALLY end up thousands of miles away?!</p>
<p>But I digress. With Operation Santa, USPS encourages children to write letters to the &#8220;North Pole,&#8221; aka a collection center that posts pictures of the letters online. Participants can then read these letters and answer one or many of the requests in the letter by mailing the child a package.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/best-marketing-campaigns-operation-santa-usps.png" width="720" height="308" alt="best marketing campaigns: usps operation santa" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://www.uspsoperationsanta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>So while this marketing campaign helped to drive more business to USPS, it was in a charitable manner that made everyone feel good.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway: involve a third benefactor with your campaign</strong></p>
<p>All marketing campaigns are technically a win-win: your customers get the valuable offer you&#8217;re promoting, and you get their business. But with a charitable marketing campaign, you can go for a win-win-win. The third benefactor here—children of underserved communities—gives both USPS and its customers incentive to make the best of this marketing campaign. We all love buying products that also have a positive impact on our society.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2018/02/22/cause-based-marketing">Head here for more cause-related marketing campaign ideas.</a></p>
<h3>3. What Agnes Saw (Tokyo Olympic Games)</h3>
<p>This inspiring commercial features the oldest living Olympian (Agnes Keleti) as well as several incredible Olympics moments that have occurred over her lifetime.  &#8220;What Agnes Saw&#8221; represents her seeing the torch light and the thousands of athletes just like her.</p>
<div>
<div class="video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video"><iframe width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ArIftpnnR0c?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0"></iframe></div>
</div>
<p>If this doesn’t tug at your heart strings or make you want to get up and do something, you might not have a heart. I’m going to be honest, I had no plans on watching the Olympic games this year. Mostly because I don’t have cable TV (as opposed to <a href="/blog/ws/2021/09/09/what-ott-advertising">OTT</a>). But after I stumbled upon Agnes’s sweet memories, I stole a login to my parents’ cable plan.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway: try a &#8220;look back&#8221; campaign that shows your achievements, challenges, or even mistakes</strong></p>
<p>The Olympics are an event unlike any other. And each year they are held is so different than the last; locations, cultures, geopolitical events, and athletes all influence the make-up of the games.</p>
<p>What this marketing campaign from the Olympics shows us is how to embrace the different challenges and achievements. Don’t shy away from where you’ve been and celebrate where you’re going.</p>
<p>In practice, that means apologizing for any wrong doing and showing your customers how you are correcting it (<a href="/blog/ws/2021/09/01/psychology-copywriting-tips-examples">acknowledging your mistakes has its benefits, you know</a>). Or maybe it is best illustrated in showing the generations of family that have worked to develop the perfect formula for your business.</p>
<h3>4. Prime Day (Amazon)</h3>
<p>In 2015, Amazon had their first Prime Day as a campaign to get more Amazon Prime subscribers. And oh boy, did it work. So well that they’re still holding multiple days of Prime Day six years later.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/best-marketing-campaigns-prime-day.png" width="500" height="417" alt="best marketing campaigns: amazon prime day" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p><strong>Takeaway: offer a little something extra for loyalty</strong></p>
<p>If you are a subscription-based business, take a page out of Amazon’s book and offer your subscribers a little something extra for their <a href="/blog/ws/2016/11/10/customer-loyalty">loyalty</a>. Something that will make their friends and family so jealous, they’ll want to subscribe to your service as soon as they can.</p>
<p>I always suggest free stuff, because people love free stuff. In fact, the gym I go to recently had a “<a href="https://gagestrengthtraining.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Member’s Day</a>” that focused on fun games and giveaways for their members. They even brewed a signature beer for the event!</p>
<h3>5. Where are my Quays?</h3>
<p>How could we not include an <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/digital-marketing/influencer-marketing-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">influencer marketing campaign</a> in here?  And no, I’m not going to mention a certain weight-loss gummy/tea/supplement…</p>
<p>Where are my Quays is the ultimate influencer campaign. Does anyone remember when Chrissy Teigen absolutely blew up Quay sunglasses in 2019?</p>
<p>Everyone *had to have* a pair of these gigantic sunglasses after the comedian/model/John Legend’s baby mama endorsed them through a series of commercials and social media plugs.</p>
<div>
<div class="video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video"><iframe width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-iFeW4M5zYM?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0"></iframe></div>
</div>
<p>Great move, Quay. Although my child-sized face was unfortunately too small for any of their products, I too fell victim to the campaign. You can find my sunglasses on Poshmark, please take them off my hands.</p>
<h4>Takeaway: seek out genuine endorsement</h4>
<p>First of all,<a href="/blog/ws/2014/09/18/beginners-guide-to-target-markets"> know your audience</a>. Who are you trying to reach? Who is in their sphere of influence? And how can you match the person within their sphere of influence with your product?</p>
<p>Working with influencers isn’t easy. But, in my experience, sometimes the right influencer will fall in your lap (aka send you an email pitch). You want someone who loves your product as much as you do, because genuine endorsement can’t be faked.</p>
<h2>What are the best marketing campaigns you&#8217;ve seen?</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past year, like too many other millennials, I bought a house. And very unfortunately, this house is in need of a lot of TLC. If you haven’t been paying attention, let me break the news: materials are very expensive these days. Headlines screaming about lumber and glass prices and delays in the supply chain mean that I’ve been on the receiving end of plenty of price increase letters.</p>
<p>And to be honest, I don’t mind. We all have to make a living and sometimes, that means price hikes. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/price-increase-letter-example-email-header.png" width="720" height="454" alt="price increase letter example email header" /></p>
<p>So how do you increase prices without losing customers? It&#8217;s all in the delivery. Which is why I&#8217;m going to share with you how to write a perfect price increase letter (or email or announcement). I&#8217;m going to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common justifications for a price increase.</li>
<li>Best practices for communicating a price increase to your customers.</li>
<li>Price increase letter examples and tips to help you write your own.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common reasons to increase your prices</h2>
<p>Let’s say you’re considering a price increase, but you’re not quite sure how to justify it. Your customers, employees, and prospects need to know why costs are going up, when they can expect the change, and any product changes that will accompany it.</p>
<p>Here are three common reasons you might need to increase prices.</p>
<h3>1. You need to meet rising costs</h3>
<p>Just like we all experience cost-of-living increases, the cost of your supplies and workforce will naturally rise over time. God bless inflation?</p>
<p>Make sure you can maintain a healthy ROI over time, after your price increase. While there are plenty more business considerations and market research that go into calculating your price increase, it’s always good to anticipate the rising costs of each item that goes into your product offering.</p>
<p>Is your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/16/grow-your-digital-marketing-agency">company growing</a>? Is the cost of materials or software you use going up? Are you competitors charging significantly more than you?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/email-price-increase-letter-example-materials-cost-increase.png" width="720" height="350" alt="email price increase letter example mentioning rise of material costs"/></p>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://milled.com/pospaper-com/we-need-to-talk-paper-price-increase-0rWLqIfGIm-3Qz2p" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Related:</strong></em> Our friends at LOCALiQ share tips to adapt your business for better <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-during-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing during inflation</a>.</p>
<h3>2. You&#8217;ve pivoted or repositioned</h3>
<p>Businesses evolve over time. Some start as the cheapest option around, but as they get a better sense of their ideal audience and market conditions, they may pivot to serve higher-end customers.</p>
<p>Or perhaps your business is booming and your team can’t handle all the orders, subscriptions, packages, etc. That’s a sign it may be time to increase your prices. This can naturally narrow down your customer base while maintaining the same revenue stream. Even better? You can ditch those nagging clients that you just cannot stand anymore.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, you’ll rebrand yourself as a premium company. Think: high-quality, high-invest, high-reward. The Lamborghini of your industry. Who wouldn’t want that?!</p>
<h3>3. You are (or want to start) selling to retailers</h3>
<p>While I can relate to those who have gotten into the habit of buying *everything* from Amazon, or Grubhub, or Etsy, the reality is that suppliers pay the price of convenience.</p>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">These <a href="/blog/ws/2018/04/02/retail-marketing">retailers</a> take commission from businesses, the price of doing business. And that is understandable for the efficiency factor. If your customers use these retailers, they will understand that you need to increase prices on those platforms. Explain this concept in clear terms, with plenty of heads up, in your price increase letter. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/price-increase-letter-retailer-sites.png" width="720" height="400" alt="channels where online shoppers start their journey"/></p>
<h2><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Price increase letter examples and best practices</span></h2>
<p>No one wants to inform their customers of a price increase, but if you go about it the right way, you can minimize the risk of <a href="/blog/ws/2020/01/08/reduce-churn">churn</a> and/or angry responses. Here are nine tips along with examples to help you get it right.</p>
<h3>1. Communicate the change to your team first</h3>
<p>Make sure that all of your teams know about this adjustment. Increasing your cost will impact every team in the business, whether directly or indirectly. While your customer service team needs to know how to answer questions, your marketing and sales teams will need to understand how to explain the new pricing and sell it to new customers.</p>
<h3>2. Reach out to customers directly&#8230;</h3>
<p>This barely needs an explanation. If you’ve been blindsided by rising costs of memberships (Boston Sports Club, I’m looking at you), you know that it’s <strong>not cool</strong>. Practice the Golden Rule here. And make it crystal clear—in both the subject line and the first few sentences of the letter/email.</p>
<h3>3&#8230;Multiple times</h3>
<p>While you should prioritize the method of communication they&#8217;re used to, you may also want to notify them via direct mail or even phone—depending on your <a href="/blog/ws/2021/06/21/build-client-relationships">relationship with your customers.</a> I recommend using the same branded template that you use for any other company announcement, like a product update, fundraising announcement, event invitation, or <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/13/sales-promotion-examples">discounted offer.</a> It’s familiar and won’t run the risk of getting caught in spam traps. And if sending via email, follow these <a href="/blog/ws/2021/05/25/email-copywriting-tips">email copywriting tips</a> like staying on-brand.</p>
<h3>4. Give plenty of notice</h3>
<p>The best practice here should be about two months from the price increase, particularly if it is a subscription charge. This allows your customers to cancel without violating any of your policies, or adjust their budgets accordingly.</p>
<p>If you can, add the exact dates that your price will increase for each customer. Using a bit of SQL, you can usually insert their subscription origin date and insert the date of the hike.</p>
<h3>5. Segment and personalize</h3>
<p>This is a given for all <a href="/blog/ws/2021/07/01/email-marketing-tips">email marketing</a>, but for a slightly different reason. If the price increase will have different implications for different customers, don&#8217;t send a blanket email where your customers have to dig through and figure out what applies to them. Segment your customers by plan or service so you can personalize the messaging and make the important details crystal clear.</p>
<p>You may also want to segment by how long the customer has been with you so you can provide something special in the name of <a href="/blog/ws/2016/11/10/customer-loyalty">customer loyalty</a> (e.g., extending your current price for another month or giving temporary free access to an upgraded feature).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/example-price-increase-letter-to-loyal-customers-spotify.png" width="600" height="629" alt="spotify price increase email to premium member" /></p>
<h3>6. Be informative but brief</h3>
<p>This is one of our top <a href="/blog/ws/2021/05/25/email-copywriting-tips">email copywriting tips</a>, and it&#8217;s crucial for price increase announcements. Convey the exact increase, why you&#8217;re increasing it, when it will take effect, and if there is any action needed on their part. But don’t get into the nitty-gritty details of the increase. Customers just want to know the facts. Plus, too much explanation starts to sound defensive and apologetic. Be confident and concise with your writing (<a href="/blog/ws/2021/07/06/how-to-write-copy-that-sells">learn how to do that here!</a>).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/price-increase-letter-example-bullets.png" width="600" height="333" alt="example of email price increase letter with bullet points" /></p>
<h3>7. But not too brief</h3>
<p>While Netflix certainly sends very brief emails about price increases, I wouldn’t recommend going with this type of in-app notification:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/example-price-increase-letter-to-customers-netflix.png" width="450" height="476" alt="netflix price increase in-app notification"/></p>
<p>While yes, it <em>is</em> Netflix, so we understand that they are participating in streaming wars, it’s not an excuse to be this&#8230;succinct. It feels a little arrogant to tell your subscribers, “Hey. Your fee is increasing because we’re the best in the biz. Don’t like it? We don’t care. Cancel your subscription. Bye.”</p>
<p>Like I said, don’t do that.</p>
<h3>8. Link to a FAQ page</h3>
<p>Your price increase email will provide the immediate information your customers are seeking: how much, when, and why. But for some businesses, it&#8217;s not that black and white. You may want to create a FAQ page to address hypotheticals, answer follow-up questions you anticipate, and provide any helpful context.</p>
<p>This can prevent an influx of calls and emails, and also demonstrates that you&#8217;ve thought this through and know your customers well.  For example, Adobe created this <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/x-productkb/policy-pricing/subscription-price-increase.html#:~:text=Creative%20Cloud%20for%20individuals%20Single,a%20%243%20per%20month%20increase." target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAQ page</a> that explains the price hike in historical terms and highlights new features.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/example-price-increase-letter-to-customers-FAQ.png" width="719" height="407" alt="price increase FAQ page"  /></p>
<p>Here’s another FAQ example:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/price-increase-announcement-page-with-FAQ.png" width="820" height="305" alt="price increase announcement example with FAQ"  /></p>
<h3>9. Provide a clear way to get support</h3>
<p>Even with a FAQ page, there are still some customers that will just want to talk to a human—whether that&#8217;s to get some reassurance, try to bargain with you, or just complain. Make sure you provide a clear way for them to reach out, and that your support team is prepared.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hulu-price-increase-letter-to-customers.png" width="600" height="665" alt="example of personalized price increase letter to customer"/></p>
<h3>10. Don&#8217;t raise prices more than once a year</h3>
<p>Before you announce your price increase in a letter to customers, ensure that the team is absolutely certain the price will stay the same for as long as possible (ideally, at least a year)—even if this means bumping your increase up a bit to have a cushion. Better to be the bearer of bad news only once. Plus, small increases close together can appear sneaky.</p>
<p>This also makes things less confusing if you have a subscription cycle. As mentioned above, there are plenty of business calculations that go into the exact adjustment, and this is a vital part of them.</p>
<h2>How to write a price increase letter to customers [recap]</h2>
<p>While no one likes to send or receive a price increase letter, use these tips to make the experience as positive as possible for your customers and <a href="/blog/ws/2019/07/18/loyalty-marketing">keep them loyal</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p>With these tips and examples, you&#8217;ll be well on your way to attracting more people to your business that you can convert into customers.</p>
<h2><span lang="EN">What is a lead magnet?</span></h2>
<p>First, let’s define exactly what a lead magnet is.</p>
<p>Lead magnets are an incentivized marketing tool for increasing form fills. Typically, a business offers something free, but valuable, that target <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/26/prospecting-strategies-ppc-agencies">prospects</a> will be willing to obtain in exchange for their information so that you can continue building the relationship. Plus, that information is all <a href="/blog/ws/2021/04/12/first-party-data">first-party data</a>, which is becoming crucial in a cookieless world.</p>
<p>Lead magnets are often associated with the top of the <a href="/blog/ws/2015/05/07/marketing-funnel">funnel</a>, but they can actually be used at every stage. After all, new prospects can slide into your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/marketing-funnel">funnel</a> at any point. Or if they are entering in at the top, you&#8217;ll need a way to keep them engaged and moving along through. So consider lead magnets to be offers that both <a href="/blog/ws/2012/02/22/quick-lead-generation">attract leads </a>to your funnel and keep them there.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/lead-magnet-ideas-full-marketing-funnel-1.png" alt="marketing funnel for lead magnets" width="300" height="347" /></div>
<p>Some of the core categories of lead magnets include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Educational materials</li>
<li>Proprietary data</li>
<li>Prize-based incentives</li>
<li>Time-sensitive information</li>
<li>Free consultations and trials</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, lead magnets can come in all sorts of flavors, and as marketers, it’s our job to pick the right type to attract, engage, and <a href="/blog/ws/2017/04/04/nurture-marketing">convert our prospects</a>. So let&#8217;s look at some examples and ideas.</p>
<h2>Quick note on these lead magnet ideas</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve categorized the ideas by stage of funnel, but I also know that every business has a different funnel and <a href="/blog/ws/2019/11/21/customer-journey-mapping">customer journey,</a> so adapt these ideas accordingly.</p>
<p>Also, many of the content-based lead magnets are versatile. For example, a downloadable checklist could be used at the top of the funnel (wedding planning checklist) and in the middle (questions to ask before choosing a wedding planner).</p>

<h2><span lang="EN">Top-of-funnel lead magnet ideas</span></h2>
<p>Lead magnets are the most fun at the top of the funnel. This gives you the most <a href="/blog/ws/2014/06/12/marketing-ideas">creative</a> leeway to come up with fun ideas to entice your target audience while showing off a fun side of your brand.</p>
<p>These lead magnets can be topically broad compared to your product or service—but related in some sense. Remember, this is the awareness stage of your funnel. Your prospects may not even know you exist!</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll definitely want to put these leads through a nurture flow so that the ones that reach sales reps have <a href="/blog/ws/2014/06/30/commercial-intent-keywords">intent</a> to buy.</p>
<p>For top-of-funnel lead magnets, you don’t need a form requiring details. Just first name, last name, and email will do. Make sure that each lead magnet is properly tagged with a lead source so you can track the ROI down the road.</p>
<h3>1. Giveaways</h3>
<p>First up, giveaways. There is plenty of finesse that goes into planning and executing a giveaway, but we won’t go into all that here. What you need to know is that giveaways are great lead magnets!</p>
<p>Get your prospects in the door with a variety of giveaway options, from free NBA tickets to a discounted annual subscription to your product. Keep in mind that the quality of your leads will vary depending on how relevant your offering is to your product or service.</p>
<p>While <a href="/blog/ws/2017/05/11/instagram-giveaways">Instagram giveaways</a> are a great way to expand your reach and brand awareness, you&#8217;re not going to get any leads unless you have entrants DM you with their email addresses. Instead, create a landing page on your website for the giveaway, and then share that link in your social media posts.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/lead-magnet-ideas-giveaway-1.png" alt="landing page for a giveaway, as a top of funnel lead magnet example" width="450" height="480" /></div>
<h3>2. Face-to-face field marketing</h3>
<p>Field marketers interact directly with potential customers, such as at trade shows, <a href="/blog/ws/2020/02/25/networking-strategies">networking </a>events, and conferences. They employ a mix of sales and marketing expertise to educate, inform, and persuade prospects to engage with your brand. Have your field marketers collect emails to keep in touch! You&#8217;re not likely to get a high volume of leads in this manner, but the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/08/lead-quality">quality of the leads</a> will be excellent.</p>
<h3>3. Influencer collaborations</h3>
<p>Seems like everyone and their mom is trying to <a href="/blog/ws/2021/03/23/how-to-become-a-social-media-influencer">be an influencer</a> these days. Who can blame them, with all the <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/11/advertising-on-tiktok">TikTok</a> and <a href="/blog/ws/2018/09/20/youtube-marketing">YouTube</a> fame being tossed around? This is the perfect time to test out <a href="https://influencers.heepsy.com/instagram-influencers/">lead generation through micro-influencers</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2013/06/21/social-media-influence">Find an influencer in your niche</a>, sponsor a couple posts, and collect your leads. Remember to tag them properly, especially if you choose to pay influencers on a commission or per-lead basis.</p>
<h3>4. Blog post downloads</h3>
<p>Visitors coming to your blog are most likely in the awareness and information-gathering stage, so focus on free and easy offers here. Free and easy for you too! Simply offer to send the post (or an abridged version) to their inbox so they can read later. All they need to do is fill out their email address. How convenient!</p>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/lead-magnet-ideas-downloadable-post-1.png" alt="lead magnet examples—offer to send blog post to email" width="720" height="205" /></div>
<div></div></div></div>
<div>This is a nice way to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-generation-ideas">capture leads</a> without <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/18/gated-content">gating the content</a>.</div>
<h3>5. Free tools</h3>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t already notice, we offer a variety of free tools for business owners and marketers, and it&#8217;s a win-win: They get free professional assistance that will help them <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-increase-sales-for-your-business-on-a-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get more sales</a>, and we acquire leads who might actually increase our sales as well. High-five.</p>

<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>A lead magnet about lead magnets. Whoah.</em></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">Mid-funnel lead magnet ideas</span></h2>
<p>Okay, this is when lead magnets get a little more serious. Prospects entering into the middle of your funnel are aware of and interested in your business. Mid-funnel lead magnets should be at least slightly related to your product or brand, but if you&#8217;re at the mid-to-top level, you can still dance around it a little bit more.</p>
<p>For mid-funnel lead magnets, you may want to ask for more information than just email address. This may include name, company name, email, and whatever qualifiers will help you. For example, I like to ask my prospects to select with compliance framework they are interested in. This informs the content I send their way down the line and helps my sales team pitch more accurately.</p>
<p>And make sure you continue nurturing these leads! Your sales team might be eager to get on the phone with these more <a href="/blog/ws/2019/04/08/lead-quality">qualified leads</a>, but tag them and place them into a nurture stream where they belong. Don’t scare them off with heavy-handed sales tactics.</p>
<h3>10. Webinars</h3>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/05/webinar-marketing">Webinars</a> are all the rage these days. I’m a big fan of virtual lunch-and-learns, particularly featuring how-tos or trending topics. Even better, any webinar can be recorded and reused, or emailed out as part of a nurture campaign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/top-of-funnel-lead-magnet-ideas-website-pop-up-1.png" alt="top-of-funnel lead magnet ideas—webinar popup" width="720" height="477" /></div>
<p>If you’re <a href="/blog/ws/2016/05/03/marketing-webinars">hosting a webinar</a>, make sure to ask your participants what questions they’d like answered during the session&#8211;you can glean more engagement and information from leads that way.</p>
<h3>11. Checklists</h3>
<p>If your product helps streamline a solution or gives your team intimate knowledge into a niche process, checklists give you a high-level, low-effort way to share that know-how. Hot tip: downloadable checklists typically perform well in Google ad campaigns.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/middle-of-funnel-lead-magnet-ideas-checklist-2-1.png" alt="middle-of-funnel lead magnet ideas—checklist" width="720" height="308" /></div>
<h3>12. Free templates</h3>
<p>I’m a sucker for resume templates. I can’t help it; every time I am editing a resume, I need to find a new design. And as a result, a crazy amount of companies hawking resume templates have my email address.</p>
<p>Offer a template for something that you would consider yourself an expert on. For example, how to design a project management flow. Or a notion.io content marketing calendar (I’m in the market for one!).</p>
<p>Templates are more mid-funnel compared to examples, since the prospect is not just looking for ideas anymore, but ready to put pen to paper and get down to it.</p>

<p>13. Original data reports</p>
<p>14. Product comparisons</p>
<p>15. Email courses</p>
<h2><span lang="EN">Bottom-of-funnel lead magnet ideas</span></h2>
<p>These lead magnet ideas are for the cream-of-the-crop prospects. They might already know your brand and trust your content. This is the opportunity to show that your product is right for them.</p>
<h3>16. Case studies</h3>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2017/04/03/how-to-write-a-case-study">Case studies</a> can be a snoozefest. It’s easy to go wrong with these, but if you add a little extra ‘oomph’ to the content, you could have a great download on your hands.</p>
<p>While most companies will share a case study with a title like, “X company helped Y company increase revenue by 50%! See how we did it.” And there is nothing wrong with that. But if you take the time to insert actionable data and insights into your case study, it’ll make it worth an email submission.</p>
<h3>17. Product picker</h3>
<p>This might be my favorite type of lead magnet. I know, you probably thought I was going to say whitepapers were my bread-and-butter but WHEW. I love quizzes.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bottom-of-funnel-lead-magnet-ideas-quiz-1.png" alt="bottom-of-funnel lead magnet ideas—quiz" width="720" height="391" /></div>
<p>Why are they so great? It’s the best time to show off your authority on a niche topic in an engaging way. This is great for leads who are ready to buy, but don&#8217;t know what exactly they want. My company, Laika, has a quiz to see which compliance framework is right for your business.</p>
<h3>18. Partner referral discounts</h3>
<p>You’ll likely need to get any type of discount cleared with your department heads and sales teams. But discounts are powerful hooks; everyone loves to <a href="/blog/ws/2021/05/11/facebook-ab-testing">save money</a>.</p>
<p>I recommend reaching out to your partners to let them know that anyone who submits their information with a specific code or through a certain page will receive a percent off the purchase of your product.</p>
<p>You can also do this with customers who have had a good experience! <a href="/blog/ws/2019/05/06/referral-marketing">Referrals</a> are like <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">good reviews</a>, they hold a lot of weight with prospects doing investigation into a new company.</p>
<h3>19. Event tickets</h3>
<p>Everyone loves free stuff. I had some coworkers who created email addresses specifically to enter contests to win concert tickets. While I hope your prospects won’t do the same, you could run a promotion where those who sign up for a free demo or consultation will be entered into a random drawing for free tickets to a conference.</p>
<p>You decide the event, and let the leads pour in.</p>
<h3>20. Early access</h3>
<p>Releasing a new feature? <a href="/blog/ws/2019/11/25/copy-testing">Testing new copy</a> or UX? Advertise it to prospects. You can learn about their behaviors while shaping your offering to their exact tastes.</p>
<p>Plenty of mobile games and apps already utilize beta versions and early access. If you offer an app in the Google Play Store or the Apple Store, you can enter it onto a list for users to access in beta. Even Disneyland has extended early hours for visitors to get early access to the rides!</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bottom-of-funnel-lead-magnet-ideas-early-access-1.png" alt="bottom-of-funnel lead magnet ideas—early access invitation" width="720" height="556" /></div>
<h3>21. Free trial</h3>
<p>Trial your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">product or service </a>for free, for a limited time only! There are plenty of examples of free trials out there, but the trick is to make yours seem exclusive, urgent, and the best way to get a taste of your amazing company.</p>

<h3>22. Newsletter referrals</h3>
<p>By now, most people have heard of The Skimm. They grew their subscribers in a big way through <a href="/blog/ws/2021/04/14/referral-program-ideas">referrals</a>! You could track how many referrals you had from a unique link and get rewarded along the way.</p>

<h2><span lang="EN">How to create a lead magnet for your business</span></h2>
<p>Assuming you want to start generating more leads, I&#8217;m going to finish off with tips on creating lead magnets for your prospects.</p>
<p>For the actual lead magnet, you’ll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attractive offer</li>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/11/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups">Call-to-action</a></li>
<li>Form</li>
<li>Landing Page</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure your<a href="/blog/ws/2016/08/02/landing-page-copywriting"> landing page copy</a> and design matches the original offer, as well as your CTA. For example, if you’re luring prospects in with a promise of 15% off for subscribing to your email list, your CTA after filling out the form should be &#8220;get my 15% off coupon.&#8221;</p>
<p>I also recommend a website <a href="/blog/ws/2021/04/26/pop-up-strategy">pop-up</a> tool. There are plenty of platforms today that enable you to create tasteful popups and use specific criteria to trigger them—such as page their on, topic of blog post they&#8217;re reading, whether or not they&#8217;re a returning visitor, where they came in from, and more.</p>
<p>And finally, since you&#8217;re going to be generating more leads now, you&#8217;ll first want to invest in <a href="/blog/ws/2021/04/21/cost-effective-marketing-automation-tools-small-businesses">marketing automation</a> software to track, segment, and nurture them. In this remote world, I recommend Marketo, Hubspot, or ActOn.</p>

<h2>Exceptional written content marketing examples</h2>
<p>While I just talked some smack on the writing and blogging side of content marketing, it’s *my* favorite aspect of the job. And I have a few favorite creative ways to consume written content. So let’s talk about some awesome content marketing that goes beyond just blog posts.</p>
<h3>1. Walt Hickey and Numlock News</h3>
<p>If you haven’t heard of Walt Hickey’s <a href="https://numlock.substack.com/">Numlock News</a>, I highly recommend subscribing to this email newsletter. Like many email newsletters, it focuses on news of the day, but through the lens of numbers.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="474d6094-db55-45bc-8791-d39d4949bce8" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/truly-exceptional-content-marketing-examples-numlock-1.png" alt="truly exceptional content marketing example by walt hickey" width="482" height="364" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>I’m a big fan of Walt Hickey’s writing (or his copywriter). The team makes pretty mundane or confusing statistics intriguing and explains it in plain English for those of us who aren’t mathematicians.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="f1e1554f-1543-44b9-98aa-7de89af05826" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/truly-exceptional-content-marketing-examples-walt-hickey-1.png" alt="truly exceptional content marketing example by walt hickey" width="704" height="472" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>This is the type of news I can get behind: by the numbers, short and sweet, and charming to boot.</p>
<p><strong>Why it works</strong></p>
<p>Numlock News offers a simple daily <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/25/email-newsletter-ideas">newsletter</a> and pretty much nothing else. It’s on-time, on-brand, and personable. But the best part: it’s <a href="/blog/ws/2017/03/15/quality-content-defined">high quality</a>.</p>
<p>To apply this to your own <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/13/content-marketing-strategy">content marketing strategy</a>, pay attention to the stories most people think are too complicated or boring to understand. As marketers, our job is to make the mundane seem magical. Walt Hickey certainly achieves this on a daily basis.</p>
<h3>2. Grammarly’s weekly emails</h3>
<p>I recommend Grammarly to everyone I work with. Not only do they offer a great product, but Grammarly impressively manages to gamify the writing process. Each week, Grammarly sends users emails that recap their week of writing. From performance to improvements, they show you how you stack up against other users.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e9cd722d-9781-4c38-8826-e4dc103206f7" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/truly-exceptional-content-marketing-examples-grammarly-1.png" alt="truly exceptional content marketing examples grammarly email" width="636" height="604" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>This keeps me on track, using Grammarly, and determined to improve my productivity.</p>
<p><strong>Why it works</strong></p>
<p>Again, data is powerful. Grammarly collects plenty of proprietary data on your writing habits that you would otherwise have no way of knowing. Leverage the unique information you collect through your offering and tell your audience something they might not know!</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="620a7e31-957b-49ab-9eb0-54b5df31608f" data-langcode="en">

<h3>CDC’s Zombie Apocalypse Plan</h3>
<p>If you haven’t checked out the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cpr/zombie/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC’s plan for the zombie apocalypse</a>, the time is nigh. Simply navigate to their zombie preparedness blog to understand what you’ll need when the big event happens. The CDC is out here saving lives. Need I say more?</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="710e24d8-226f-4ee3-8f5d-0a1f4dd9d894" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/truly-exceptional-content-marketing-examples-cdc-zombie-apocalypse-1.png" alt="truly exceptional content marketing examples cdc zombie apocalypse guide" width="936" height="554" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><strong>Why it works</strong></p>
<p>This started as a spoof marketing campaign that went viral. While the CDC has been top-of-mind for us recently, we generally view the organization as humorless scientists telling us to wash our hands.</p>
<p>The zombie campaign made the CDC more relatable by showing a different side of the center. And they even followed content writing best practices in their <a href="/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post">blog posts</a>! Don’t be afraid to step into the weird zone. You might just catch a renewed interest from your audience.</p>
<h2>Awesome audio content marketing examples</h2>
<p>If you’re a content marketer who hasn’t yet written a script for a podcast or conference&#8230;lucky you. It’s not my favorite activity, but when it’s done well, audio content marketing can be impactful.</p>
<h3>4. BetterHelp’s podcast advertising</h3>
<p>I’ll be honest, I don’t listen to many podcasts these days. But my friends cannot stop talking about BetterHelp. Why? They a<a href="/blog/ws/2018/06/05/podcast-advertising">dvertise all over podcasts</a>. And they should be, the company spent over <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2021/02/26/betterhelp-spent-4-4-million-on-podcast-advertising-in-january-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4MM on podcast advertising in January alone</a>.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="df8a2e29-fbbd-46f0-9d21-8a47feda919b" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/truly-exceptional-content-marketing-examples-better-help-1.png" alt="truly exceptional content marketing examples betterhelp's audio ads" width="800" height="397" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>While this may be a nod to podcasters who can adlib their sponsors, it’s also a hat-tip to BetterHelp for choosing the right podcasts. Finding a perfect match between personality and offering is tricky! But we love to hear genuine recommendations from advertisers we trust.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to hear an open conversation about BetterHelp (and other online therapy offerings), <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy9lMmU1YzQ0L3BvZGNhc3QvcnNz/episode/QnV6enNwcm91dC03MjMzMzcw?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAUQkfYCahcKEwjgmtnRyKbwAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Funny Angles covered it in January</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d rather just read their standard pitch, <a href="https://app.magellan.ai/advertisements/0c552fbd-2003-4e21-aab3-b3520abb8bd3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well here it is</a>—but be warned: it is auto transcribed and therefore slightly mind-bending.</p>
<p><strong>Why it works</strong></p>
<p>BetterHelp leans into mid-roll ads for podcasts, which gives speakers a moment to pause and talk about how different kinds of therapy. Podcasters are already baring their souls to their audiences (or at least give the impression that they are) so this transition can be humorous, profound, <a href="/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotional</a>, or what have you.</p>
<p>By letting your fans and sponsors take the reins and represent your product, it can lead to the best and most honest <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">reviews</a> you’ll have. And I think BetterHelp’s podcast advertising bet paid off during this <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/27/post-pandemic-marketing-strategies">pandemic</a> when we’re all looking for little COVID-safe escapes.</p>
<h2>Impressive visual content marketing examples</h2>
<p>I won’t lie. Any type of <a href="/blog/ws/2020/12/22/visual-marketing-tools">visual</a> content marketing is the most challenging project for me. I’m not a visual learner (I watch TV with subtitles so I can read it), so I struggle to describe how I’d want content designed. Luckily, I work with some pretty awesome graphic designers who somehow manage to turn my brain vomit into something visually stunning.</p>
<p>Here are some of my favorite examples of great visual content marketing!</p>
<h3>5. FiveThirtyEight</h3>
<p>Nate Silver’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fivethirtyeight.com</a> may not be your traditional <a href="/blog/ws/2020/11/23/content-marketing-trends">content marketing</a> gig since it’s leans more into journalism, but I have to call out their political coverage. As a numbers-based publication&#8211;Walt Hickey is an alum&#8211;they have found engaging and <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/04/interactive-content">interactive</a> ways to showcase data.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="965f7a9e-83bc-4119-9649-1468d59fd0b8" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/truly-exceptional-content-marketing-examples-nate-silver-1.png" alt="truly exceptional content marketing example by nate silver" width="734" height="526" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>During and leading up to election years, Nate Silver analyzes a multitude of polls and compiles the data into consumable graphs and written commentary.</p>
<p><strong>Why it works</strong></p>
<p>FiveThirtyEight’s graphics and data visualization are completely interactive. You can mouse over each to understand the numbers from every perspective, but still not get overwhelmed. Every <a href="/blog/ws/2013/02/19/content-marketing-skills">content marketer</a> aims for this level of simplification of abstract ideas.</p>
<p>Recreate the magic by looking at any information you’re presenting from different angles. For example, consider the people who are looking at your <a href="/blog/ws/2016/02/18/ppc-competitor-analysis">competitors</a>. What’s their point of view? How can you relate and get your point across?</p>
<h3>6. Tasty videos</h3>
<p>Very recently, I realized that not every single person in the world knows Tasty. Shocked doesn’t begin to describe it.</p>
<p>I am Tasty’s biggest fan. A relatable and step-by-step cooking channel, I consume their content voraciously. To be clear, I’m also a big fan of the Food Network and Tasty gave me a more millennial-focused way to watch people cook.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="f8ad2ae8-a53f-438f-9aad-9ef9f5dde937" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/truly-exceptional-content-marketing-examples-tasty-1.png" alt="truly exceptional content marketing example tasty's youtube channel" width="798" height="554" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><strong>Why it works</strong></p>
<p>Let’s start by mentioning that Tasty has over 20M subscribers on <a href="/blog/ws/2018/09/20/youtube-marketing">YouTube</a>. That&#8217;s 20 million people addicted to watching dumplings get wrapped, spaghetti get twirled, and cinnamon buns get puffed. Who wouldn’t love that?</p>
<p>The best part about Tasty videos is they are meant to inform your own cooking. Think of it as an aesthetically-pleasing tutorial. Teach your audience something new, that only you know how to do, on your own product, and you’ll have power-users in no time.</p>
<h3>7. Spotify Wrapped</h3>
<p>The most wonderful time of the year is when <a href="https://open.spotify.com/genre/2020-page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spotfiy drops your annual Wrapped hits, stats, and playlist</a>. Spotify creates a website annually to summarize the artists, songs, playlists, and podcasts you’ve been listening to all year. And every year, it goes viral on social media.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="3ba9e9d0-2bee-4573-95b3-d2a453d4a46e" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/truly-exceptional-content-marketing-examples-spotify-wrapped-1.png" alt="truly exceptional content marketing examples spotify's wrapped music summary" width="556" height="558" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><strong>Why it works</strong></p>
<p>Everyone thinks they have great music taste. This gives you a chance to show off to your friends how much you’ve listened, who you’re listening to, and how you’re a tastemaker. The entire website is customized for each Spotify user, complete with links to download and share.</p>
<p>Like Grammarly, show your users what they’ve accomplished over time through proprietary insights. By emphasizing their uniqueness, you also lean into the uniqueness of your product.</p>
<p>Do you have any shining examples of great content marketing? We want to see them! We’re always looking for inspiration and <a href="/blog/ws/2019/10/15/copywriting-tips">creativity</a>.</p>

<p>First, it was Instagram adding IG Stories. Then Facebook did it. Now&#8230;LinkedIn Stories? For why?!</p>
<p>Well, because why not? The more ways to share what you or your organization is doing in a fun and engaging way, the better.</p>

</div>
<p>The most popular professionals on LinkedIn regularly speak to best practices in the workplace, like hiring the right people, tackling scheduling challenges, or fundraising. Think of LinkedIn stories as just another outlet to share your business challenges, accomplishments, and daily fun tasks.</p>
<p>If you’ve been watching others’ stories on LinkedIn and want to join the party, we’ve got the details on:</p>
<ul>
<li>What LinkedIn Stories are</li>
<li>How to create a LinkedIn Story</li>
<li>Ideas for LinkedIn Stories</li>
<li>LinkedIn Story best practices</li>
</ul>
<h2>How do LinkedIn Stories work?</h2>
<p>Like Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram, LinkedIn Stories are pieces of content you can post to your profile that last 24 hours before disappearing.</p>
<p>The maximum length of time for a LinkedIn Story is 20 seconds. You can upload a photo from your library or snap a picture or video in real-time. And you can add multiple photos or videos to your Story at a time for users to tap through.</p>
<p>To view your story, or others’, just tap on the circular profile photos that appear in the top of the LinkedIn mobile app.</p>
<h2>What are the LinkedIn Story specs?</h2>
<p>According to LinkedIn, below are the recommended sizes for adding photos from your camera roll:</p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">Videos</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Resolution: 1080 (w) x 1920 (h) px</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Frame: 30 FPS, square pixels</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Supported file types: H264, MP4</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Aspect Ratio: 9:16</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span lang="EN">Images</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Resolution: 1080 (w) x 1920 (h) px,</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Supported file type: PNG, JPG</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Aspect Ratio: 9:16</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>How do I create a LinkedIn Story?</h2>
<p>You can only add to your (or your organization’s) LinkedIn story from the mobile app. Just open the app, select your profile photo or your organization’s, and allow LinkedIn to access your camera and photos.</p>

</article>
</div>
<h2>What features are available with LinkedIn Stories?</h2>
<p>Like Instagram and <a href="/blog/ws/2018/08/01/facebook-stories-ads">Facebook Stories</a>, you have a few different options for making your Story engaging and authentic.</p>
<h3>Add stickers</h3>
<p>If you want to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/12/20/creative-advertising-ideas">get creative</a>, you can easily add a sticker or text to your photo or video.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="d8c789e9-faa3-4fc0-8fee-294d130c2198" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<h3>Post to &#8220;Today&#8217;s Question&#8221;</h3>
<p>You can also engage your followers by asking the question of the day. The answers your followers provide can help you to gather insights, feedback, and other information so you can better connect with your audience.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="3813e903-d9a0-4113-9a01-243d1ac29d9b" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/linkedin-stories-question-of-day-1.jpg" alt="linkedin story example using question of the day" width="452" height="980" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<h3><strong>Tag users in your LinkedIn Story</strong></h3>
<p>Remember, just like any other <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business">social media platform</a>, users react best to human faces. Don’t be shy to showcase your employees, clients, partners, and investors. You can tag them in the story using their LinkedIn handle.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e2cb1811-0a94-4b77-9212-9dab0f8a4a71" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Right now you can tag individuals in LinkedIn Stories, but not businesses.</em></p>
<h3>Add links to your LinkedIn Story</h3>
<p>And the best part is that you don’t even need to be <a href="https://www.virlan.co/education/how-to-get-verified-on-linkedin-blue-checkmark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">verified</a> to include a link in your story.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="c9a3f4fb-52bb-4d3a-9e7b-c5c4a0b5d6a1" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/linkedin-stories-add-link-1.jpg" alt="linkedin stories—add link to story" width="506" height="204" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<h3>Story insights</h3>
<p>While your story is live, you can view insights via the LinkedIn mobile app. These include unique views, viewers, and link clicks, if you include a swipe-up link in your story.</p>
<p>Navigate to your story, open it, and in the bottom corner, you’ll be able to view insights.</p>
<h2>How do I save, edit, or delete my LinkedIn story?</h2>
<p>To save your Story, you must do so within 24 hours. Simply tap the Story you posted, tap on the More icon in the top right corner, and select the Download icon in that list.</p>
<p>You can delete your story by following the same steps above, but choosing the Trash icon.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can’t edit a Story after it’s been posted.</p>
<h2>What should I post to my LinkedIn Story?</h2>
<p>If you’re anything like me, when planning a social calendar, you sort content into different buckets. Fun, light, casual content gets posted on Facebook or Twitter, while more official news, content releases, and partnership-related events go onto LinkedIn.</p>
<p>However, LinkedIn stories are the platform’s way of getting more friendly and casual, like <a href="/blog/ws/2018/08/09/instagram-marketing-strategy">Instagram</a> or Twitter. Lean into it! Think of it this way: if you are a <a href="/blog/ws/2019/10/17/b2b-lead-generation">business selling to other businesse</a>s, your ideal audience is on LinkedIn. LinkedIn stories give you another opportunity to show a new side of your brand.</p>
<h3>Highlight the hustle</h3>
<p>I’ve said it once (in this post), I’ve said it a thousand times. Humans like to see<a href="/blog/ws/2015/12/23/humanize-brand"> other humans behind the brands</a> they love. Show your employees having fun creating awesome products. While that probably looks like a lot of people in Zoom meetings right now, think of creative ways to highlight your people.</p>

</div>
<p>I’m a big fan of having your employees take candid selfies from home. How many people are wearing pajama pants and a button-down shirt? Who is taking important calls while walking their dog? That’s the type of relatable content we all need right now.</p>
<h3>Real-time updates</h3>
<p>Attending an event? Hosting a <a href="/blog/ws/2018/06/05/podcast-advertising">podcast</a>? Opening a new office? Sounds like the perfect type of content for a LinkedIn story. Give your followers a tour of the event from your perspective.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, real-time updates are *exactly* what stories are made for. Don’t be shy to keep things unpolished in your stories. We want to see the faces behind the business.</p>
<h3>Thought leadership and AMA</h3>
<p>While going <a href="/blog/ws/2017/07/31/facebook-live-guide">live on Facebook</a>, <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/30/instagram-live">Instagram</a>, Clubhouse, or any other platform is fun, it’s not necessarily the platforms your audience is browsing. Once again, LinkedIn for the win.</p>
<p>LinkedIn posts daily questions that you can answer in your stories, but your team should feel empowered to write and answer questions yourselves. What questions do you clients ask you? What conundrums have your team found the answers to?</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="6be99059-b8bf-47af-b813-ab899bc5d71b" data-langcode="en">

<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://thelinkedblog.com/2021/linkedin-stories-the-3-deadly-sins-256/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>Even better, ask your founders or thought leaders in your business to engage in an AMA. Then you get to engage directly with your audience.</p>
<h3>Official news</h3>
<p>Finally, go ahead and give your big announcements an extra push with a special LinkedIn story dedicated to introducing your news. This could be anything from product launches, new partnerships, finishing a round of funding, or reaching an employee milestone.</p>
<h2>LinkedIn Story best practices</h2>
<p>LinkedIn Stories are the platform’s way of getting more friendly and casual, like Instagram or Twitter. Lean into it! Here are some best practices for posting to your personal or professional page stories.</p>
<h3>Share bite-sized updates</h3>
<p>While LinkedIn allows posts of up to 20 seconds, I recommend cutting that down into shorter, engaging pieces. Think about Stories like a flipbook. You want each page, or post, to tell a greater story, and each should build on the one before it.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="fa82d2d3-7381-4bd2-a585-428095a7b2aa" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/linkedin-stories-best-practices-1.png" alt="linkedin stories—bite sized updates example" width="750" height="438" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>For example, break a concept into bite-sized steps. Maybe you want to tell your audience how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The first post should be a shot of all your ingredients and utensils. The second should show two slices of bread with peanut butter on one side, and jelly on the other. You get the point.</p>
<h3>Add color with storytelling and transparency</h3>
<p>Continuing the previous example, try to make that PB&amp;J sandwich making process look as fun, or innovative, or empathetic as possible. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/09/03/storytelling-in-content-marketing">Tell the story</a> within your Story. Show your messy fingers from dropping the knife in the peanut butter! Or your kid enjoying that sandwich with jelly all over her shirt!</p>
<p>This is the fun side of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/04/26/linkedin-b2b-lead-generation">LinkedIn marketing</a>. We all see those lengthy posts about people being <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/25/inspiring-instagram-accounts">inspired</a> by mentors or employees, or a great learning experience. This is your chance to visualize those stories and make them even more relatable to your audience.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="a60309d9-79c3-410b-ae54-407c0e1120dd" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>You can use this feature to lean into graphics, fun stats, and more in a visual way. Which leads us to&#8230;</p>
<h3>Embellish your Story</h3>
<p>The most <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/06/instagram-story-highlights">engaging stories</a> are the ones that paint a picture and keep you hooked. The same goes for LinkedIn. While you may be trying to spice up a mundane corporate topic, there’s nothing that says it can’t be aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>LinkedIn includes stickers, emojis, locations, and more to post on your story. Don’t go overboard, but a few tastefully-placed and relevant stickers can go a long way. It can also make your audience feel like they’re on the inside.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="4abd1cc9-d303-47b0-a86e-0f2e353923b7" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Even better, let your employees do a LinkedIn take-over for the day! Show what happens behind the scenes at your business, like this EY intern.</p>
<h2>Use LinkedIn Stories to strengthen your personal or business brand</h2>
<p>Using personable content isn&#8217;t just for Instagram or Facebook. Ideally, you should have a conversational and relatable tone throughout all of your marketing material. And while LinkedIn is known to be the more formal, professional platform, that doesn&#8217;t mean your Stories won&#8217;t be effective. In fact, they can be a refreshing change for your followers.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve probably heard of CRM software—used it in the past, gotten sales calls about adopting one, wistfully wished your customer data was nicely organized inside one. But if you haven&#8217;t, don&#8217;t worry. I myself was once a wet-behind-the-ears college intern throwing acronyms around like candy without any clear idea what the letters stood for.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/what20is20a20crm-guide20for20small20business.png" alt="what is a crm-guide for small business" width="375" height="354" /></div>
<p>CRM stands for customer relationship management. So do you need CRM? Yes. All businesses need to have an organized way of keeping track of clients and prospects as they move through their customer journey. But do you need CRM <em>software</em>? This depends on your business size, model, industry, customer type, and more. So in this post, I&#8217;m going to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demystify exactly what CRM platforms are and how they help with sales and marketing.</li>
<li>Cover the pros and cons of implementing CRM for small businesses in particular.</li>
<li>Discuss costs and crucial features to look for when considering a CRM for your business.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of this post, you&#8217;ll have a firm understanding of the role a CRM plays in business growth as well as the potential value it could have for your small business.</p>
<h2>What is CRM software?</h2>
<p>CRM stands for <strong>customer relationship management</strong> but it typically refers to a tool or solution that helps businesses track and manage interactions with customers and <a href="/blog/ws/2020/05/27/prospecting-strategies-during-covid-19">prospects</a>. In broad terms, it&#8217;s a database that holds information like first name, last name, email address, company, a log of encounters with your business, and so on.</p>
<p>Your CRM will act as the main place to keep all the information you’ve gathered throughout your <a href="/blog/ws/2021/06/21/build-client-relationships">relationship with your clients</a>. From the first time they read a blog post or <a href="/blog/ws/2014/09/04/best-time-to-send-email-campaign">sign up for your newsletter</a>, to phone recordings of sales calls and lead qualifications, it’ll all be in one central location. CRM even manages the process through to sending <a href="/blog/ws/2020/03/11/business-proposals">proposals</a>, contracts and billing information (with some plug-ins).</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CRM20for20smalll20business-central20location.png" alt="CRM for smalll business-central location" width="800" height="351" /></div>
<p>Think of a CRM platform as a multidimensional map. You have people, companies, and deals all connected through different interactions-—like <a href="/blog/ws/2013/10/28/adwords-impression-share">viewing an ad</a>, opening an email, taking a sales call, or signing a contract. Your team members are connected to action items and can add information to contacts, accounts, and deals as needed. All this information creates a web of insights to help you manage processes and relationships with the people who have decided to do business with you.</p>
<h2><span lang="EN">The pros of CRM software for small businesses</span></h2>
<p>There are a lot of good reasons to have a CRM software platform at your disposal. However, it’s hard work to get it integrated, particularly if you don’t have much infrastructure already built into your business relationships. We&#8217;ll go over those challenges in the next section, but first, let’s get to the good parts of CRM software.</p>
<h3>Organization</h3>
<p>While I can’t profess to be the most organized person (my roommate would argue that I need to stop keeping my books in the kitchen), all <a href="/blog/ws/2020/02/17/digital-marketing-skills">marketers thrive </a>when our files, content, tasks, and communications are all in one place, or at least one organized system.</p>
<p>CRMs help you collect, sort, and filter your prospect and client information according to various criteria, like account type, location, contact person, channel, and company. That means you can group all contacts who work for the same company together, or the internal team that works on a certain account; just think of all the reports you could run!</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/what20is20crm20LOCALiQ20CRM20phone20call20tracking_0-2.png" alt="what is crm LOCALiQ CRM phone call tracking" width="797" height="656" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>From <a href="https://localiq.com/reporting-analytics/client-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LOCALiQ&#8217;s Client Center CRM</a></em></p>
<p>And the more organized and centralized your information is, the easier it is for you to pull up when communicating with a current or potential client and have the context you need in order to have a productive conversation. Also, while it&#8217;s a best practice to have a dedicated account representative for each customer, having the information available to more people allows you to transfer information more easily, such as if that representative leaves or your <a href="/blog/ws/2019/02/27/how-to-scale-an-agency">business starts to scale up</a>.</p>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>At the risk of sounding like a broken record: marketers thrive with <a href="/blog/ws/2020/05/21/client-communication-during-covid-19">better communication</a>. And I don’t just mean having regular meetings with the sales team. CRMs enable seamless communication between your prospects, marketing team, and sales team.</p>
<p>Picture it: a prospect <a href="/blog/ws/2013/07/11/landing-page-conversion-rate-guide">enters their information on your website</a>. Almost instantly, that lead is entered into the CRM so your marketing team can <a href="/blog/ws/2015/01/15/retargeting-ads">retarget</a> them with ads, <a href="/blog/ws/2016/08/30/lead-nurturing-campaign-emails">nurture them with emails</a>, and move them down the marketing funnel. Simultaneously, the sales team can reach out through emails and calls, logging each interaction into the system. By the time the <a href="/blog/ws/2017/04/04/nurture-marketing">prospect is ready to sign a contract </a>or make a purchase, you’ll have a full picture of each touchpoint they experienced.</p>
<h3>Efficiency</h3>
<p>For the aforementioned reasons that we love CRMs, they use streamlined communication and organization to create efficiencies. When it comes time to close the books on a fiscal year, or you get audited, or you need to reference exactly what your sales team promised a customer, it’s all right in your CRM.</p>
<p>Organization, communication, and efficiency are just three of the many positive aspects of a CRM platform that can lead to several benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better collaboration among team members</li>
<li>More movement through your marketing and/or sales funnel</li>
<li>Time and cost savings from maximized productivity</li>
<li>Happier customers, more loyal customers, and of course, more customers</li>
<li>Increased revenue</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/benefits20of20CRM20for20businesses.png" alt="benefits of CRM for businesses" width="797" height="304" /></div>
<h2><span lang="EN">The cons of CRM software for small businesses</span></h2>
<p>As mentioned above, there are some challenges that come with CRM software. Luckily, there are fewer cons than pros.</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>I’m not going to lie to you. CRMs can be quite complicated. In fact, some engineers are exclusively trained in managing, implementing, and integrating CRMs. While that doesn’t necessarily mean that you’ll need to hire a developer to help with your CRM implementation/integration, it may be challenging to do on your own if you’re not familiar with basic SQL, HTML and CSS, and Javascript.</p>
<h3>Cost</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">When you sign up for a CRM, it usually comes with a hefty price tag. There are plenty of open-source CRMs or services where you can pick and choose what kind of add-ons you’d like to include, but the more add-ons or licenses you get, the more expensive it’ll be; and the more upkeep it will require. But <span lang="EN">here’s the good news: if you implement a CRM platform early and commit to best practices, your data should be neat and tidy inside whichever platform you choose, eliminating the need to spend more money on annual fixes. </span></span></p>
<h2>How much does small business CRM software cost?</h2>
<p>As you probably expected, the prices and pricing models for CRM software vary. Many platforms charge per user per month, with that rate depending on the number of contacts you have or the level of functionality you choose. Other CRMs are free but with limitations. For example, <a href="https://www.zoho.com/crm/?zmc=zoho-fa&amp;ireft=ohome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zoho CRM</a> is free but only for three users and doesn’t offer email communication. <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HubSpot</a> has a “free forever” CRM, but the reporting and functionality stays pretty <a href="https://www.newbreedmarketing.com/blog/infographic-pros-and-cons-of-the-hubspot-crm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basic</a> (we’ll cover features to look out for in the next section). And yet other CRMs created by marketing agencies aren’t available as a standalone product, but come free with the services offered by the agency, such as with <a href="https://localiq.com/reporting-analytics/client-center/">LOCALiQ’s Client Center</a>.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/what20is20a20crm-localiq20crm.png" alt="what is a CRM-cost of crm-localiq client center" width="800" height="474" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://localiq.com/reporting-analytics/client-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LOCALiQ&#8217;s proprietary CRM software</a> comes at no extra charge when you sign on with their local marketing solutions.</em></p>
<p>While this information does not give you a clear-cut answer as to how much a CRM would cost your small business, it does clearly show that in order to identify the most cost-effective CRM for you, you need to know the features and functionality you require. Because if you go with a free platform that doesn’t generate the reports you need in order to ensure a return on your investment, well then, your CRM really isn’t free after all. So in this final section, we’re going to cover some key features of CRMS to consider.</p>
<h2>What to look for in a small business CRM</h2>
<p>As we just covered (but in case you skipped it), the various small business CRMs available on the market today all come with their own features and functionalities. When choosing one for your business, remember that price isn’t everything. The right CRM for your business is one that helps you to not only carry out your marketing strategy more seamlessly, but also to gain insights along the way to adjust and refine it—ultimately helping you to win more customers (and revenue) while also saving time and money in the long run. Here are the core features of a CRM designed to help you achieve that:</p>
<h3>Ease of use</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to avoid complexity in any CRM, since it&#8217;s very nature is rather complex—it is housing every interaction and piece of information each of your team members and campaigns gathers on each of your contacts, in one place. But complexity doesn&#8217;t have to equate to difficulty with navigating the platform. A good CRM is intuitive and keeps things as simplified as possible. You&#8217;re looking for a CRM that is not a constant uphill battle, but that has a learning curve that settles out somewhat (not entirely, since there will hopefully be updates and new features to learn).</p>
<h3>Advanced campaign tracking</h3>
<p>Rather than just seeing how you&#8217;re doing overall, it&#8217;s important to be able to view your marketing performance at the campaign level. This way, you can see which methods are most effective in attracting customers and leads to your business, as well as which channels and devices within those campaigns are performing best.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/what20to20look20for20in20a20small20business20CRM20campaign20tracking.png" alt="what to look for in a small business CRM campaign tracking" width="800" height="463" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Detailed campaign tracking allows you to identify the sources and devices to optimize for (<a href="https://localiq.com/reporting-analytics/client-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source: LOCALiQ Client Center</a>).</em></p>
<h3>Analytics</h3>
<p>So you can see which channels or devices are performing best in a campaign, but how well is the campaign doing overall? With analytics, you can identify benchmarks and also see if the numbers you are seeing are an increase or decrease from a previous time frame or condition. This is crucial in a CRM because it empowers you to make data-driven decisions and  know exactly how much you’re getting out of your marketing investments.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/what20to20look20for20in20a20CRM-analyics-sugar.png" alt="what to look for in a CRM-analyics-sugar" width="800" height="445" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Make sure your CRM can reveal patterns and changes in your data (<a href="https://www.sugarcrm.com/platform-features/marketing-analytics/">Image source: SugarCRM</a>).</em></p>
<h3>Real-time data</h3>
<p>You shouldn&#8217;t have to wait until the end of the month or the end of a campaign to see results. A good CRM will have real-time data capabilities so you can get insights on-demand. This allows you to identify and make optimizations during campaigns, seize opportunities the moment they arise, and ensure you’re on track with your goals.</p>
<h3>Customized reporting</h3>
<p>Having advanced campaign tracking, solid analytics, and real-time data are all key considerations for a CRM. But also make sure that you can customize your reports by time frame and other criteria. This way you can keep your marketing strategies the way you intended them, rather than mold them around what your CRM is able to report on. Plus, being able to compare campaigns to previous years, channels, and more will allow you to learn, improve, and refine your marketing strategy into a finely tuned lead generating machine.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/what20to20look20for20in20a20small20business20CRM-custom20reporting20.png" alt="what to look for in a small business CRM-custom reporting " width="700" height="619" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>A good CRM enables you to filter your data for specified date ranges and make projections (<a href="https://localiq.com/reporting-analytics/client-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image Source: LOCALiQ Client Center</a>).</em></p>
<h3>Integration</h3>
<p>Are you using other <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/21/cost-effective-marketing-automation-tools-small-businesses">marketing automation tools</a> or is there any chance you may implement some in the future? Make sure the CRM is compatible with these technologies as well as how complex the integration would be.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/what20to20look20for20in20a20small20business20CRM-integration.png" alt="what to look for in a small business CRM-integration" width="800" height="565" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://www.nimble.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nimble CRM</a> is geared specifically for social media integration.</em></p>
<h3>Support</h3>
<p>Numbers don’t lie, but data can be deceiving (unintentionally, of course). For example, you may become concerned over a decline in your <a href="/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">website traffic</a>. But if this occurs concurrently with increase in conversions, then this actually means that while less <em>overall</em> people may be visiting your site, more <em>qualified</em> visitors who are actually interested in your business are arriving there. In this case, that decrease doesn&#8217;t mean anything bad, but more likely that your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/05/13/smb-seo-strategies-covid-19">SEO strategies</a> are working well and probably can be scaled up. All this is to say that having access to an individual or team of individuals who specialize in small and/or local business marketing can mean the difference between having a CRM to merely keep track of things and leveraging a CRM to grow your revenue.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/what20to20look20for20in20a20small20business20CRM20support.png" alt="what to look for in a small business CRM support" width="700" height="447" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>A good CRM will come with support such as through a knowledge base, but nothing beats 1:1 expert advice (<a href="https://keap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source: </a><a href="https://keap.com/help" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keap</a>).</em></p>
<h3>Scalability</h3>
<p>If your CRM does its job and your client database and sales team expands, can the CRM’s capabilities and pricing plans easily scale with your business? Conversely, if you need to dial things back for a period of time or are going through a slow period, are there flexible downgrade or resource-saving options?</p>
<h3>Communication tools</h3>
<p>Last but not least (and perhaps most important) in the list of CRM features to look for is communication tools. With email integration, you can get notified about new leads and important activity, as well as communicate with your contacts directly from the CRM. This could be an <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/01/automated-email-marketing">automated email </a>that gets triggered when a contact completes a specified action, a prompt response to a form submission, or a personalized outreach or follow-up email to an individual.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em>Email is paramount to lead nurturing and customer communication (<a href="https://localiq.com/reporting-analytics/client-center/">Image source: LOCALiQ Client Center</a>).</em></p>
<h2>Could a CRM be right for your small business?</h2>
<p>As I mentioned at the start, the goal with this post is for you to gain a clear picture of what CRM platforms can do for small businesses as well as the background knowledge you need in order to find the right one for yours, should it be something worth pursuing. Here is a recap of what we covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>A CRM is a central location where all of the information you’ve collected on your leads and customers as you engage with them is stored.</li>
<li>Pros of CRM software include organization, efficiency, and communication, while cons are cost and implementation.</li>
<li>If implemented properly, a CRM can help a business to increase productivity, customer satisfaction, marketing efficacy, and revenue.</li>
<li>CRMs vary in price from free to hundreds of dollars per month, but it&#8217;s important to know what you&#8217;re getting for the price.</li>
</ul>
<p>And most importantly, here are the features to look for in a CRM for your small business:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advanced campaign tracking</li>
<li>Analytics</li>
<li>Real-time data</li>
<li>Customizable reports</li>
<li>Integration</li>
<li>Support</li>
<li>Scalability</li>
<li>Communication capabilities</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a confession. I *very* strongly dislike the phrase, “she wears a lot of hats.” It’s overused, like “these are unprecedented times” or “move fast and break things.” But if you’ve been the sole marketing person (or the sole <em>everything</em> person) at a company, the phrase probably fits.</p>
<p>And if the phrases (and hats) fit, then your to-do list is a foot long: come up with ideas for ad campaigns, write copy and content, direct the go-to-market strategy, design email newsletters, monitor site traffic, perform industry research, go to meetings, and more meetings, and meetings, and—whew. Let’s face it: you need help and automation is the way to do it. In particular,<strong> email marketing automation</strong>. Once you get your flows set up, you can be communicating with customers, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/11/03/lead-nurturing">nurturing leads</a>, and winning over more customers in the background while you&#8217;re running your day-to-day.</p>

<p>Email marketing automation is a huge time-saver, but learning about it is not! So, to spare you the hours of figuring it all out, I&#8217;ve broken it all down into one easy-to-read post so that you can get up and running as quickly as possible. I&#8217;m going to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>What automated email marketing is.</li>
<li>How to set up your email marketing automation.</li>
<li>Tips for testing, lead scoring, and other essentials.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, I&#8217;ll provide examples of various types of emails you can automate, including welcome, reengagement, informational, feedback, milestone, blog share, and demo emails. So let&#8217;s get started.</p>
<h2>What is email marketing automation?</h2>
<p>Don’t worry, this isn’t a silly question. There are two different types of automated emails: transactional, or<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/28/trigger-emails"> triggered emails</a>, and drip marketing campaigns, or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/30/lead-nurturing-campaign-emails">email nurture</a>. Transactional emails are the ones that you don’t need permission to send; like order and shipping confirmations.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>Nurture emails are marketing campaigns, so you do need permission—these marketing emails help <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/21/facebook-funnel">move your prospects through the funnel </a>by automatically sending curated content on a pre-determined basis.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, you’ll need a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/21/cost-effective-marketing-automation-tools-small-businesses">marketing automation platform </a>to get started with automated emails. There are plenty of options out there, and if you’re already running <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/21/promotional-email-examples">promotional emails</a> or one-off email campaigns, your provider likely has an option for drip campaigns as well.</p>

</div>
<h2>How to get started with automated email marketing</h2>
<p>You’ll need to make sure there is a collection point for email submissions on your website. Once you have that set up, you’ll need to follow the steps laid out below to get your automated email nurture program up and running:</p>
<h3>1. Collect Lead Information</h3>
<p>If you’re not already doing this, place lead forms throughout your website,<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/02/12/great-landing-pages"> landing pages</a>, and ads to collect necessary information from your prospects. You can create these landing pages based on the information you want to leverage&#8211;common fields include name, email address, company, budget, industry, and location.</p>
<p>Remember, the more fields you require leads to fill out, the more ways you’ll be able to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">personalize your emails</a>. Bur tread carefully: leads are less willing to fill out a lengthy form and may abandon if it is too robust.</p>

</article>
</div>
<h3>2. Choose a Goal</h3>
<p>Like any marketing campaign, you’ll need to think about what action you want to drive from automated emails. Of course, you’ll want great <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/31/email-subject-lines">open and click-through rates</a>, but do you want them to sign up for a demo of your product? Are you looking for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/19/conversion-rate-benchmarks">conversions</a> or a specific number of purchases? What about calling a number, making a donation, registering for another newsletter, or signing up to volunteer?</p>
<p>Once your goal is set, you can work backward to develop the content needed for your drip campaign.</p>
<h3>3. Set Qualifying Criteria</h3>
<p>Okay, I have *another* confession. Sometimes I waffle between creating content and setting up qualifiers. This is just a note that you can do both at the same time! They should play off of each other to create the perfect waterfall of wonderful marketing messaging.</p>
<p>Back to business. You’ll want to score your leads in order to move them through the funnel and your drip campaign. You can create your own scale, but whichever <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/05/b2b-marketing-automation-tactics">marketing automation</a> system you’re using may already have suggestions. Some simple guidelines: you can disqualify based on location (e.g. outside your delivery range), budget, company, etc. If your lead has the exact job title or political party membership that you’re<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/13/targeted-email-marketing-strategies"> targeting with your email</a>, considering scoring them higher.</p>
<p>In terms of content, less actionable pieces should have a lower score, let’s say 1 or 2. Content that tends to convert <em>and</em> informs a lead about your product is more valuable, so your sales team has to do less leg work on the phone. You could score <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/03/how-to-write-a-case-study">case studies</a>, product marketing materials, and demos 10 out of 10 and push them out of your drip campaign to “completion.” Just depends on what your goal is!</p>

</article>
</div>
<h3>4. Create Content for the Funnel</h3>
<p>Start with the content you already have. What performs well in terms of clicks and opens? What is a big converter? Does your sales team have any particular favorite blog posts, case studies, or product one-pagers that really get prospects on the hook?</p>
<p>Once you have a cache of existing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/01/content-marketing-funnel">content funnel</a>, you can start to fill in the gaps.</p>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>

<h3>5. Test, test, test</h3>
<p>Like any new marketing campaign or channel, you’re going to need to test everything before finding your sweet spot. It’s unlikely that <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-email-marketing/">automated email marketing</a> isn’t going to work for your business, but you’ll have to work to find the right messaging and scoring to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/12/is-email-marketing-effective">effectively</a> move leads down the funnel or convert. Some easy <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/02/26/ab-testing-best-practices">testing tips</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/22/marketing-copy">Write a lot of copy</a>; and a lot of different copy. Instead of having 3 variations on “buy now!” try to have variations that encourage different actions or look at the value proposition from diverse angles.</li>
<li>Design. You should be able to A/B email layouts to find out if longer-form works, plain-text vs. HTML, CTAs above the fold, or basic navigation at the top of your emails.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/03/repurposing-content">Repurpose content</a>; if you saw great engagement with a particular blog post, whitepaper, product line, or promotion, place that into your automated email funnel. You can test new versions against what was sent previously.</li>
<li>Scoring. While you may already know that requesting a demo is a qualifying action, maybe a case study isn’t. Or a whitepaper is more of a branding effort than you first believe. Be flexible and communicate with your sales team to figure out the best way to score your leads.</li>
</ul>

<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/09/04/best-time-to-send-email-campaign">Send times</a>; test time of day, day of the week, and so on to find the optimal time to get engagement.</li>
<li>Subject and pre-header text; like the copy tip above, write variations for each subject line to see which gets opened at the highest rate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>A/B testing send times and subject lines is tricker now with the iOS 15 update. Learn <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/27/email-marketing-ios15">13 post-iOS 15 email marketing strategies here.</a></p>

<h3>6. Monitor Touchpoints</h3>
<p>It’s likely that email is not the only way you’re reaching out to these leads. Remember, your automated email campaign doesn’t live in a vacuum. If these leads are being <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/13/retargeting-ad-ideas">retargeted</a> on ad platforms or emailed outside of the nurture campaign, make sure not to inundate them with your brand. No one likes being digitally stalked.</p>
<h3>7. Analyze and Optimize</h3>
<p>This last one is obvious. After the campaign goes live, set reasonable expectations and success metrics. Adjust as you go. All marketing automation systems have analytics dashboards set-up for you to monitor performance; you should also keep an eye on the number of sends per email. If <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/08/lead-quality">leads are getting qualified</a> before they reach the end of the funnel, great! Consider reducing the number of emails in the queue to get the most relevant content out as soon as possible. The same is true for the reverse; increase the number of emails to qualify prospects until they’re ready to convert.</p>
<h2>Great examples of automated marketing</h2>
<p>If you’re still feeling lost and confused when it comes to the design of your automated emails, I understand. When I first started out, I used *a lot* of templates from Marketo, Hubspot, and Mailchimp. Which is not a bad idea! But I&#8217;ve compiled some more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/01/31/email-marketing-with-buyer-personas">great email examples</a> to help jog your creativity.</p>
<h3>Welcome email</h3>
<p>When you get a new subscriber, you should welcome them to your community, introduce them to your products, and just confirm that yes, they are subscribed to your list. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/18/welcome-email">Welcome emails </a>are truly a time to shine for your brand; these should be fun and creative! It used to be commonplace to offer a discount in your welcome email, which I still recommend, but more often you’ll find a summary of the business with a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/29/great-cta">CTA</a> in the A Spot, followed by a series of category-specific sections and CTAs.</p>
<p>This automated email example from Casper highlights their brand voice, offers a discount at the bottom, and has some helpful tips on why you should choose Casper in the body.</p>

</article>
</div>
<h3>Feedback email example</h3>
<p>Asking for constructive criticism is a great way to engage with your subscribers; they’ll feel important and honored that you asked, and you’ll gain an opportunity to grow from it. Revolution Tea <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">asked for feedback</a> and then! Followed up with the results! And a coupon code!</p>

</article>
</div>
<h3>Blog post email example</h3>
<p>This one is easy: if you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/03/16/find-things-to-write-about">write new content</a>, brag about it. If you have popular content that you want your subscribers to see, email it out. These types of emails are low-risk and high-reward; if your subscribers do click through and read your post, they’re probably far more invested in your brand.</p>
<p>Wistia does this by showcasing some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post">creative posts</a> from guest authors—a great way to give subscribers a variety option to choose from.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0c29b22c-8e88-40fd-9e3e-cf1f67097309" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<h3>Informational email example</h3>
<p>As you move your subscribers down your automated email funnel, you’ll want to show some proof that you’re worth their time. That’s when informational emails come in. This is a great time to explain your (maybe complicated) offering, showcase how your pizza is made with love, or the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/05/customer-testimonials">clients that you’ve helped succeed</a>.</p>
<p>This email from Ritual breaks down exactly what you’re putting into your body when you take their supplements, in one easy infographic.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="5c706f35-edee-4416-8249-8ec786312dfb" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<h3>Re-engagement email example</h3>
<p>Sometimes your subscribers will forget about you. It’s okay, the world is a crazy place right now, don’t take it personally. But take the opportunity to gently remind them that you’re still here and you’re waiting for them to return to the fold!</p>
<p>Airbnb does this by nudging their subscribers toward the magical places they could be staying, complete with a price in the email—similar to emails from airlines on their cheapest flights.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="79bbfdd5-2981-4cd7-aa3a-87b66c199c0a" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<h3>Milestone email example</h3>
<p>Celebrate birthdays! Or annual subscription anniversaries! Or New Years, 4th of July, Thanksgiving, your business’s anniversary, etc. I’m a big fan of half-birthdays, which is why I love Outdoor Voices’ email below! What a great way to celebrate a little event with an exclusive coupon code.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="248a1fcf-f368-4da8-8dda-09d3f63c9511" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<h3>Demo email example</h3>
<p>Finally, the proof is in the pudding. Give your subscribers the opportunity to demo your products (if that’s something you can do) and prompt them with a shiny, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/05/02/persuasive-copywriting-tips">persuasive</a> email. June Oven does this simply: one main message, one CTA, an accurate picture of their product, and a hyperlink within the copy to show off the product further.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the best purchases I ever made was signing up for Spotify Premium in college. I even remember when it happened, in March 2014. I had just signed a job offer for after graduation and Spotify released premium pricing for students. It was beautifully serendipitous and we’ve been in a committed, monthly-fee relationship everx since. In fact, now I pay for a family plan and have gotten all my family members (and maybe some roommates) hooked on it.</p>

<p>Moral of the story: if you market to college students early, they can become your most loyal customers. Look at Apple! The shiny-fruit company consistently gives discounts to college students, creating lifelong Mac users.</p>
<p>If you’re not completely convinced that college students are a valuable market, here are some stats before we dive in…</p>
<h2>Why market to college students?</h2>
<p>College students are a huge demographic in the US, consisting mostly of 18 to 24-year-olds. These young adults have spending power: the <a href="https://www.business.com/articles/marketing-to-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>15M group spends more than $200B annually</u></a>. Not only are they age-stable, but they also are geographically stagnant for 4-5 years. That means you have a lot of time to develop branding and marketing specific to this group to see what will really stick.</p>
<p>While this is most likely already living in the back of your mind, Gen Z is the tech-native generation. They are constantly online (especially during quarantine), consuming content, shopping, and engaging with peers. And they’re cleverer than previous generations when it comes to advertising: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/11/generation-z-avoids-advertising-uses-ad-blockers-and-skips-content.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>almost 70% of Gen Zers use ad blockers</u></a>. But don’t despair; if you do get through to these college students, <a href="https://www.sheerid.com/blog/4-problems-with-edu-college-student-verification-and-how-to-fix-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>94% said an exclusive offer</u></a> would get them to shop at a brand more frequently. Here are our best tips for <a href="https://localiq.com/industries/education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reaching college students through the power of marketing</a>.</p>
<h2>10 effective ways to market to college students</h2>
<h3>1. Leverage trials and samples</h3>
<p>Let’s just address the elephant in the room outright: college kids love free stuff. I can’t tell you the number of events I attended in college because they offered free food. What better way to hook some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/18/loyalty-marketing">long-term loyal customers</a> than offering your product for free?</p>
<p>There are a few ways you can actually get your free samples or trials <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/22/free-marketing-during-covid-19">in front of your audience</a>; try coordinating with residence life to have a move-in kit available for the fall semester or sponsored study break during midterms or finals. If you’re a food service on Seamless, GrubHub, or DoorDash, you can offer a discount for first-time diners; once they get a taste, they’ll keep coming back for more.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20market20to20college20students20grubhub.png" alt="how to market to college students grubhub" width="800" height="417" /></div>
<h2>2. Offer targeted discounts</h2>
<p>Just like <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/23/personalized-video-marketing">personalized</a> ads, discounts specific to your audience are a great way to engage them. Everyone wants to think that their school is the best—what better way to reinforce that than advertising “For a limited time, Villanova students get free fries with every cheeseburger.”</p>
<p>If you want an easier, more direct way to get feet in the door (or online orders), offer discounts if a student provides their student ID at the time of purchase. You can often get those types of deals listed in a coupon catalog handed out in Student Unions or in Move-In Day packets. Free advertising for all!</p>

<h2>3. Write clever copy</h2>
<p>Have you hung out with college kids recently? If you haven’t, you’re missing out. I truly learn new words every time I’m around the youths. Since college came into existence, kids have been creating their own lingo for academia and partying (and I’m really trying to make “groovy” come back into style).</p>
<p>While I wouldn’t recommend trying *too* hard to speak their language, catching students’ eyes with clever marketing and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/01/12/how-to-write-great-advertising-copy">ad copy </a>is a must. Whatever you do, don’t be lame. Not sure where to start? Here are some tips for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/15/copywriting-tips">writing creative copy</a> that may help.</p>
<h2>4. Mind your social accounts</h2>
<p>If you’ve run <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/30/social-media-advertising-tips">social ads</a> before, you probably already know that it is a great way to reach Millennials and Zillennials. When it comes to marketing to college students, make sure you’re leveraging those platforms; even if you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/01/marketing-ideas-for-small-businesses">don’t have the budget</a> to spend on ad campaigns.</p>
<p>There are easy ways to engage college students on social media.</p>
<ul>
<li>Leverage <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/28/user-generated-content">user-generated content</a>; encourage your customers to tag your products in their posts so you can easily re-post.</li>
<li>Spend time liking and commenting on related posts; this will help the algorithms show your account to more potential customers.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">Announce new products</a> or releases on your social accounts; if you’re a big, national brand, think about making an account specifically for the college crowd you’re serving, e.g. “VillanovaDominos” or “MaybellinePHL.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Try out traditional tactics</h2>
<p>Don’t worry about going old school when it comes to advertising. College kids are still pinning coupons to their fridge or digging them out when it’s time to order food. Think about sponsoring on-campus events, or having an on-campus pop-up shop in the middle of the main through-way to get the most out of student foot traffic.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20market20to20college20students20coupons.png" alt="how to market to college students coupons" width="800" height="389" /></div>
<p>I can’t tell you the number of coupons just like this that were stacked in my kitchen drawer in my college apartment. They came in handy when we didn’t want to go grocery shopping or cook, but still needed to stick to a college kid budget!</p>
<h2>6. Host a giveaway, raffle, or competition</h2>
<p>If you’re trying to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/30/social-media-engagement">build up your social following</a> or your email listserv, or simply get a lot of students engaged with your business, host a giveaway. You’ll need to make it tempting enough for college students to actually give away their information and/or money to win. That could be a Sonos speaker system to boost the music at parties, covering the cost of a parking pass on campus, offering a lifetime of free sides (french fries forever!), naming a product after them, the list goes on and on.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20market20to20college20students205k.png" alt="how to market to college students 5k" width="800" height="513" /></div>
<p>You can also pay into the competitive nature of college kids! Just like emphasizing exclusive discounts for colleges, if you have more than one university in your area, make a little friendly competition like this 5K did.</p>
<h2>7. Engage student ambassadors</h2>
<p>Pay attention to the students who are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/11/10/customer-loyalty">loyal patrons of your business</a>. Whether that means engaging with them in your store or restaurant or keeping track of recurring orders online, make sure you’re acknowledging their loyalty. Think of your student ambassadors as nano-influencers.</p>
<p>Make some ambassador kits, including simple pieces of swag like a t-shirt, bottle opener, water bottle, etc. and arm them with materials to give away to their peers. This can work best if they get referral discounts themselves!</p>
<p>While not college-student-specific, Aerie is great at leveraging user generated content on their social accounts. They are regularly #regram-ing content from their customers—which just makes it easier to fill your social calendar!</p>

<h2>8. Consider social causes</h2>
<p>I was in college during KONY 2012. What a movement. And let me tell you, everyone was talking about it. I mean professors, students, residential life, school administrators, food service employees, and more. It was the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/02/facebook-ads-boycott">social justice</a> cause of the year.</p>
<p>By nature, college students are bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to save the world. And this generation in particular is invested in social justice. Reflect on an issue that affects the community your business is in. Not only will it make the world a better place to have another contribution to the plastic-free or BLM fight, but students will also be more inclined to give your brand a second look if their money is also going to a cause they believe in.</p>
<h2>9. Look for college media sources</h2>
<p>Meet college students where they are and with what they’re consuming. Most likely, the students you’re targeting have a student-lead newspaper, weekly newsletters, or even a popular online student forum or app. Reach out to those publications to sponsor a post or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/23/google-display-ads">display ad</a>.</p>
<p>SImilar to reaching out to student ambassadors, look for student-run social media accounts to offer sponsored posts. Most schools will have an instagram account for their mascots or an “overheard at *school name*”. ICYMI, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/22/tiktok-ads"><u>TikTok is taking over the world</u></a>; reach out to student organizations (believe me, the dance team definitely has a TikTok account) and ask to be featured in a video.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how20to20market20to20college20students20tiktok.png" alt="how to market to college students media sources" width="800" height="585" /></div>
<h2>10. Influence their parents</h2>
<p>In the instance that your price point is a little too steep for the average college kid, target their parents. The best time to do this? Move-in day and parents weekend. Yes, this gets a bit complicated during, say, a <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/02/marketing-during-covid-19">pandemic scenario</a>. But it’s not impossible! Do not underestimate the tenacity of college kids to bribe a buck out of their loving parents.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for ways to get to parents, think about care packages! Emphasize how your product will help their child slay their midterms, finals, job interviews, presentations, you name it. Or maybe it will help them stay healthy, or make their tiny college dorm feel like home (my mother bought me *many* <a href="https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/verilux-reg-happylight-lucent-trade-light-therapy-lamp/5324719" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>happy lights</u></a> to make it through the winter).</p>
<p>If you’ve seen success marketing to college students, we want to see it! Even better, if you became brand-loyal to a business that targeted you as a student, tell us what got you!</p>
