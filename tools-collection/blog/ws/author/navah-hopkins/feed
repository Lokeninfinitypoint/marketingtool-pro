										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>Navigating the ever-changing landscape of pay-per-click (PPC) account structure management can be overwhelming. However, you want to iron out your account structure now to avoid future headaches that could leave you feeling like this: </span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ppc-account-structure-management-meme.jpg" alt="ppc account structure - spongebob stressed meme" width="573" height="341" class="aligncenter wp-image-74108 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ppc-account-structure-management-meme.jpg 573w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ppc-account-structure-management-meme-480x286.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 573px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>Given the constant shifts in the rules of audience engagement coupled with economic fluctuations, it&#8217;s essential to have a clear understanding of how to set up and manage your accounts with agility. </span></p>
<p>There are seven fundamental pillars to consider when future-proofing your PPC account structure. Let&#8217;s delve into each!</p>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f913.png" alt="🤓" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Totally new to PPC account structures and not sure where to start? Our free <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLPPC101.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_PPC101_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PPC 101</a> guide can help!</p></div></div>
<h2>How to build a future-proof PPC account structure</h2>
<p>Follow these seven steps to create a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/10/google-ads-account-structure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PPC account structure</a> that can keep up with the demands of your industry now and in the future.</p>
<h3><span>1. Be mindful of your budget allocation</span></h3>
<p><span>An effective PPC account structure strategy should be financially sustainable. It&#8217;s crucial to ensure<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> your budget</a> can support all your campaign initiatives. A golden rule of thumb is to have enough budget to accommodate at least 10 clicks per day for non-branded searches. This helps offset the costs of lower conversion rates often associated with non-branded traffic—since those types of website visitors tend to have less <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/30/commercial-intent-keywords" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commercial intent</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>Although branded traffic generally boasts higher conversion rates and is typically cheaper, budgeting for less than 10 clicks per day could put undue pressure on your campaigns to deliver an impractical 10% conversion rate. Additionally, the advent of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/05/performance-max-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads Performance Max campaigns</a> brings new budget considerations. For example, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/11/16/how-adwords-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads auction</a> prices will<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/26/marketing-channels" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> vary across multiple channels</a>, including display, search, video, and local.</span></p>
<p>In short, you&#8217;ll need to set realistic budget goals for your PPC account. It&#8217;s best to limit your account structure to a few campaigns to start to avoid stretching your budget too thin. On top of that, be ready to flex or reallocate budgets as you go.</p>
<p>Our latest <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/15/google-ads-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads benchmarks</a> can be a helpful starting point when deciding what type of account structure your budget can afford:</p>

Find out the average CPC, CPL, and more for your industry using our <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteGoogleAdsBenchmarks2023.html?cid=Web_WS_incontent_guide_2023benchmarks_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2023 search advertising benchmarks</a> data.</p></div></div>
<h3><span>2. Adhere to current audience engagement best practices</span></h3>
<p><span>Understanding and adapting to the changing rules of audience engagement in PPC advertising can be challenging. However, it's crucial to ensure your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/08/07/how-to-set-up-google-adwords-account" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Google Ads account</a> is always in compliance </span><span>with the latest targeting best practices and policies. </span></p>
<p><span>For example, you may want to structure your account to incorporate placement exclusions for display or video campaigns. First off, this can boost your account's performance since you won't waste any impressions or clicks on someone who might be irrelevant to your business. More importantly, this can stop your ads from showing to sensitive audiences. Your placement exclusions could be a proactive measure using a list of sites or apps you prefer not to show on, or they can be reactive, informed by past data from the "where ads showed" report. </span></p>
<p><span>In another example, Google's upcoming update that will factor search volume into the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/16/google-ads-search-terms-report-changes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search terms report</a> offers an exciting opportunity to gauge the potential reach of a keyword in relation to its cost. This allows you to make informed decisions about which keyword concepts to prioritize within your account's search campaign structure.</span></p>
<h3><span>3. Strike a balance between human control and Google's AI machine learning</span></h3>
<p><span>A contentious issue in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/19/google-ads-for-small-businesses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads for small businesses</a> is striking the right balance between human control and AI (artificial intelligence). As <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/28/ai-for-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI in marketing</a> becomes more popular, both the positive and negative <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/30/ai-impact-on-ppc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impacts AI has on PPC</a> have come to light. </span></p>
<p><span>For example, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/05/generative-ai-in-digital-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generative AI</a> can help you create assets for your PPC account, like images, videos, and ad copy. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/19/google-search-generative-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Search Generative Experience (SGE)</a> may cause ads to show lower on the page, so your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/19/does-quality-score-still-matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads Quality Score</a> should be a priority when considering your PPC account structure. </span></p>
<p><span>Whether you choose a PPC account structure that relies more heavily on AI control or on manual control, know that each side has its merits and drawbacks. It's crucial to find the blend that best suits your specific needs and circumstances. </span></p>
<p><span>However, finding ways to work AI into your PPC account structure to some degree is no longer a nice-to-have option, it's needed. For example, the manual-based single keyword ad group (SKAG) PPC account structure has fallen out of favor. </span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, keywords are no longer the guiding light; they have essentially become an "audience" due to Google's <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/27/google-ads-match-type-update-2021-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated keyword-matching logic</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>Secondly, from a budget allocation perspective, it's challenging to support multiple ad groups with a manual bidding strategy, especially when campaigns have insufficient data to help estimate your bids. A better PPC account structure strategy in this situation would be a few core ad groups under one campaign that uses one of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/19/google-ads-automated-bidding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automatic bidding strategies</a>—which are powered by Google's machine learning. </span></p>

<h3><span>4. Remember the importance of negatives </span></h3>
<p><span><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/negative-keywords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Negative keywords</a> are invaluable in protecting your costs and directing traffic. They can help you narrow in the searches you show for, so that you're only hitting your core keyword terms.</span></p>
<p>You can brainstorm more negative keywords using a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keyword research tool</a>, like this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wordstream-free-keyword-tool-results.webp" alt="wordstream free keyword tool results" width="875" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-72622 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wordstream-free-keyword-tool-results.webp 875w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wordstream-free-keyword-tool-results-480x329.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 875px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An example of how <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordStream's Free Keyword Tool</a> can help you sort through which terms may or may not be relevant to your business. </em></p>
<p><span>Moreover, the use of negative audiences alongside placements is an essential strategy often overlooked. If you only use audiences to target, you miss out on the opportunity to proactively protect your budget from unforeseen variables. </span><span> </span></p>
<h3><span>5. Ignore audiences and placements at your peril</span></h3>
<p><span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/21/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheat-sheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Audiences in Google Ads</a> provide a unique chance to target or exclude potential traffic based on exhibited behaviors or predictive signs of future actions. Audiences can be applied at both the campaign and ad group levels of your PPC account structure as well as baked into <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/03/broad-match-type" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broad match targeting</a>. </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>As keyword targeting becomes less about the syntax of the keyword and more about the implied meaning and associated audiences, the significance of audiences only increases.</span></p>
<p><span>When building your PPC account's campaigns, it's imperative to identify your most critical <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/23/buyer-personas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buyer personas</a> and understand the creative strategies best suited to engage them. As a general rule of thumb, you should have unique <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/03/ad-copy-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ad copy</a> and visual strategies for each primary persona. This could mean having several ad groups per audience so that you can have tailored ads that fit each one accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, audiences and placements play slightly different roles when <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/23/optimize-performance-max-campaigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimizing any Performance Max (PMax) campaigns</a> within your PPC account. In standard campaigns, audiences function as active targets or exclusions, while in PMax, they serve simply as signals for Google to know which placements are best for you. However, we are increasingly being offered more opportunities to exclude incorrect targets.</span></p>
<h3><span>6. Harness the power of first-party data (or, at minimum, pretend to)</span></h3>
<p><span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/12/first-party-data">First-party data</a> plays a pivotal role in determining where your ads serve and who they are served to. If you're unsure whether you can leverage first-party data—that is, having consent from your prospects to track them and hold their emails—consider using algorithmically learned audiences like in-market or custom intent based on search terms in the meantime.</span></p>
<p><span>While these audiences may not perform as effectively as ones sourced from your first-party data, they at least provide a fighting chance compared to not using audiences at all.</span></p>
<h3><span>7. Manage your privacy and conversion tracking practices</span></h3>
<p><span>The final component in future-proofing your PPC account structure lies in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/30/google-ads-conversion-tracking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conversion tracking</a> setup. It's crucial to strike a balance between being <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/30/cookie-consent-banner-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacy-compliant</a> and maintaining visibility into your campaign's performance. </span></p>
<p><span>Consider the pros and cons of using<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/07/google-analytics-4-event-tracking" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> GA4 events</a> or other analytic events versus the native advertising conversion actions Google Ads provides. </span><span>Although native ad platform tracking can capture more information, the moment you use external sources, like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/23/google-analytics-4-vs-universal-analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GA4</a>, you'll have to grapple with some degree of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/15/multi-touch-attribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attribution data modeling</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>However, we saw at <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/23/google-marketing-live" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Marketing Live 2023</a> that Google is rolling out updates to make building and tracking your PPC account's audiences via GA4 more doable:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/google-marketing-live-ga-4-audience-builder.jpg" alt="google marketing live - ga 4 audience builder screenshot" width="936" height="587" class="aligncenter wp-image-72234 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/google-marketing-live-ga-4-audience-builder.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/google-marketing-live-ga-4-audience-builder-480x301.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>Recently, there has been a new development allowing the use of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/17/how-to-set-up-google-ads-enhanced-conversions">enhanced conversions</a> to build a customer-match audience list. If you decide to leverage this intriguing tool, remember that your audiences from enhanced conversions still need to meet minimum targeting requirements—typically at least a thousand people on the list. However, this strategy can be a potent way to build those lists if you didn't have one before, and to back up the data that the ad platform is seeing.</span></p>
<p><span>In conclusion, ignoring audiences and placements in your PPC account structure could be detrimental. Harnessing their potential while considering the importance of first-party data and balancing privacy with conversion tracking will set you up for success in this ever-evolving digital advertising landscape.</span></p>
<h2>Your PPC account structure matters now more than ever</h2>
<p><span>Creating a future-proof PPC account structure may be challenging, but focusing on these seven core pillars will help you navigate the terrain. Remember to continuously review and update your strategies to keep up with evolving trends and changes in the industry. Work on your PPC account structure now, your future self will thank you!</span></p>
<p>To recap, here are the seven components of a future-proof PPC account structure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mindful budget allocation</li>
<li>Engaging the right audiences</li>
<li>Both AI-powered and manual assets</li>
<li>Negative keywords and audiences</li>
<li>Strong audience and placement strategies</li>
<li>Using audiences sourced from first-party data or in-market and custom-intent audiences</li>
<li>Solid privacy management and conversion tracking</li>
</ol>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Learn how to examine your budget, campaign types, and assets to make the right decision for your account!</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/01/is-performance-max-right-for-you">3 Key Questions to Determine if Performance Max Is Right for You</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Performance Max (PMax) launched at <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/14/google-marketing-livestream-2021">Google Marketing Live (GML) 2021</a> and has received a mixed response. Some see great results and others struggle with the mixed-bag performance caused by lack of control.</p>
<p>Understanding whether PMax will serve your account well comes down to these core criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your budget?</li>
<li>Are your individual channels performing well?</li>
<li>Can you provide all creative assets?</li>
</ul>
<p>While there isn’t a definitive yes or no, these questions can help you forecast PMax’s success for your brand. Before we dive into those questions, let&#8217;s do a brief overview of this campaign type.</p>
<h2>What is Performance Max?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-performance-max-pre-launch-optimizations">Performance Max campaigns</a> cover all <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/05/types-of-google-ads">Google Ads types</a> (except Local Service Ads), allocating budget and creative where the algorithm thinks it can do the most good for your marketing objectives. This means that instead of running Search, Display, Video, Discover, Local, or Shopping campaigns separately, you have a single campaign/budget covering all of those channels.</p>
<p>Currently, exclusions require you to work with your Google rep, which means the out-of-the-box campaign doesn’t allow for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/06/negative-keyword-guide">negative keywords</a>.</p>
<p>These campaigns require text and visual creative. If you don’t supply your own creative (images and videos) Google will create them for you. These creatives typically don’t perform as well so it’s important you have visual creatives ready.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/google-marketing-live-2021-performance-max-setup.jpg" alt="google marketing live performance max set up" width="706" height="597" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71339" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/google-marketing-live-2021-performance-max-setup.jpg 706w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/google-marketing-live-2021-performance-max-setup-480x406.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 706px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>How to determine whether PMax is right for you</h2>
<p>Making the right decision on whether or not to run a Performance Max campaign comes down to three things: budget, existing campaigns, and creative.</p>
<h3>What is your budget?</h3>
<p>All <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/29/ad-channels">ad channels</a> have different auction prices. Depending on your budget, you may or may not be able to lean into a channel that would serve you well. As a general rule of thumb, your budgets should allow for at least one <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/25/lead-qualification">qualified lead or sale</a> per day. If your budget can’t support enough clicks to lead to that, you’ll be left with the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raise your budget so you can achieve enough clicks per day.</li>
<li>Adjust your targets/keywords so you’re not entering expensive auctions.</li>
<li>Abandon the channel and go for a different one.</li>
</ul>
<p>For constrained budgets, visually-oriented placements like display and video are typically cheaper than spots on the SERP (search engine result page). By using PMax, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/19/google-ads-for-small-businesses">smaller budgets</a> can snag bargain placements that would otherwise not be achievable.</p>
<p>Bigger budgets can succeed with PMax as well, but PMax can become a bit of a black box for budget allocation, and you also may need to pause your other channels.</p>

<h3>How are your other channels performing?</h3>
<p>All Google Ads channels can empower each other. Paid search can only pick up <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/30/commercial-intent-keywords">transactional traffic</a> if your prospects know to search for what you offer. Brand sentiment alone cannot drive sales if your beloved followers can’t find you. Investing in PMax will ensure your bases are covered, but that also means leaving existing campaigns behind.</p>
<p>If your search campaigns are doing well, layering in PMax could potentially steal traffic. Additionally, if you’re running <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/03/19/why-bid-on-branded-terms-ppc">branded campaigns</a> to protect your brand (and your other campaigns from false positives), PMax might duplicate those efforts.</p>
<p>However, if you’re struggling to afford the auction prices for Google Search, PMax can be a hero.</p>
<p>The biggest risk for cannibalization is YouTube. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/03/how-to-advertise-on-youtube">Youtube campaigns</a> allow for much more control over the pacing of creative and targeting. If your Youtube campaigns are performing, absolutely consider holding on PMax unless all other channels are struggling.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-two-cents-performance-max-campaigns-alex-van-de-pol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a> </em></p>
<h3>Can you supply all the creative?</h3>
<p>PMax is often referred to as a black box campaign because there isn’t as much data on the specific queries or placements. However, this encourages advertisers to focus on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/21/customer-journey-mapping">message mapping</a> creative. Honing the audience signals and creative assets matters more for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/23/optimize-performance-max-campaigns">optimizing your Performance Max campaigns</a> than negative keywords and placements.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it’s vital that any PMax campaigns have visual creative assets. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Images that will work for all Display and Google Discover spots</li>
<li>Video ads for 15 and 30-second spots</li>
<li>High-resolution logos</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re not able to provide all the creative, Performance Max might not convert as well as standalone campaigns. You can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/05/performance-max-tips">learn more things to know before you start a Performance Max campaign here</a>.</p>
<h2>There&#8217;s only one way to find out if Performance Max is right for you</h2>
<p>Google Ads Performance Max campaigns can be a powerful profit generator for brands with rich visual creative and a clear understanding of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/16/engagement-ads">who their target market is</a>. There is no concrete answer on whether PMax will work for your brand—it&#8217;s not without its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/20/performance-max-pros-cons">pros, cons, and polarized perspectives</a>.</p>
<p>The best way to know is to test while ensuring you’re not running redundant campaigns. Consider pausing standalone campaigns while running PMax so there’s no cannibalization of budget.</p>
<p>If PMax outperforms the standalone campaigns, you can free yourself from micromanaging lots of campaigns, focusing on creative and audiences. Should PMax underperform, you’ll still have your standalone campaigns and won’t have the pressure to come up with creative for channels you didn’t intend to run.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most Google Ad strategies and tips revolve around improving failing accounts, but there’s plenty of opportunity to grow and unlock profit when your accounts are performing well, too. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to know when your account is ready for scale and when it would make sense to hold steady—as attempting to scale prematurely can actually backfire on you.</p>
<p>Every account is different and timelines for scale should correlate to spend, so in this post, I&#8217;m going to share with you:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#ready">How to tell if your Google Ads account is ready for scaling</a></li>
<li><a href="#creative">How to scale successful creative</a></li>
<li><a href="#strategies">How to scale successful strategies</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s get started.</p>
<div id="ready"></div>
<h2>How to tell if your Google Ads account is ready to scale</h2>
<p>Before applying any scaling strategies, it’s vital to ensure your account is ready for them. As a general rule, your Google Ads account should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consistently meet<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/07/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead-google-ads"> cost per acquisition (CPA)</a> and return on ad spend (ROAS) goals, with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/08/google-ads-conversion-tracking-mistakes">trustworthy conversion tracking</a>.</li>
<li>Consistently spend campaign budget.</li>
<li>Meet lead/sales quality standards.</li>
<li>Have clear buyer personas and ad creative/audience targeting optimized.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/target-market-vs-target-audience-vs-persona.png" alt="target market vs target audience" width="720" height="489" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61299" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/target-market-vs-target-audience-vs-persona.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/target-market-vs-target-audience-vs-persona-480x326.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Additional positive signs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Above 50% <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/26/search-impression-share">impression share</a> and the majority of the lost impression share is lost to budget.</li>
<li>Good or better ad rating correlating with real-world performance.</li>
<li>Campaigns have been out of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/13/learning-period">learning phase</a> for more than 14 days.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-ads-learning-period-2.png" alt="" width="237" height="130" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15889" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-ads-learning-period-2.png 237w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-ads-learning-period-2-100x55.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/08/google-ads-conversion-tracking-mistakes">Trusting conversion tracking</a> and being able to draw direct lines to profit are a must before you think about scale. While there is no hard and fast timeline, you’ll want to make sure any of your optimization initiatives have at least a quarter to prove themselves out.</p>
<div id="creative"></div>
<h2>How to scale successful creative</h2>
<p>When you know you have winning creative, it’s natural to want to get the most mileage out of it and apply it in multiple ways, such as by creating new campaigns with it or testing out “spinoff” variants of that creative.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re running visual creative (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/23/google-display-ads">display ads</a>, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/13/video-ad-tools">video ads</a>, etc), and seeing conversions, you may decide you want to put those landing pages/creative ideas in your search campaigns. You could do this by creating new assets (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/16/google-ads-extensions-now-assets">formerly known as extensions</a>) or creating entirely new responsive search ads. As a general rule with visual creative, you’ll want to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>High video completion rate (30% &gt;)</li>
<li>High view-through conversion rate and/or assisted conversions</li>
<li>Landing page visits</li>
</ul>
<p>Translating visual creative into assets or search ads means taking the core theme and expressing it within the character limit. For example, this video ad does a great job of putting the brand and product front and center. It also doesn’t push the sale, relying on cheeky language over “try”/”demo” language.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/scale-google-ads-youtube-ad-example.png" alt="how to scale google ads - example of good youtube ad" width="720" height="379" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70844" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/scale-google-ads-youtube-ad-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/scale-google-ads-youtube-ad-example-480x253.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Translating this ad into a text ad or assets would mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using sitelink and price extensions to promote specific variants.</li>
<li>Leaning into the “private parts” language as it’s acceptable for Google and conveys the brand tone.</li>
<li>Honoring that the user may have seen the ad before using YouTube <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/21/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheat-sheet">audience targeting</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s the text ad Lume is currently running for the query, “natural deodorant for women:”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/scale-google-ads-lume-text-ad-example.png" alt="how to scale google ads - example of text ad" width="720" height="200" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70843" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/scale-google-ads-lume-text-ad-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/scale-google-ads-lume-text-ad-example-480x133.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/24/google-ads-examples"><em>More great text ad examples here</em></a>.</p>
<p>Just like visual ads can be converted to text, so too can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/03/how-to-write-exceptional-ppc-ad-copy">great text ads</a> be converted to visual. Taking the core messaging of a text ad and translating it into visuals might seem trickier, but it really relies on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowing your audience and what will grab their attention.</li>
<li>Using the visual (and potentially audio) medium to their fullest.</li>
<li>Maintaining the core tone and language of the text ad.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you use single creative campaigns or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/05/performance-max-tips">Performance Max</a>, leveraging different creative types to communicate with your prospects can help you reach more of your market.</p>

<h2>How to scale successful strategies</h2>
<p>There are many paths to successful campaigns. Knowing that you have a proven <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/10/google-ads-account-structure">account structure</a> can help build confidence to invest in more markets.</p>
<p>Typically in search campaigns, accounts will have one of the following strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Markets as the campaign and services/products as the ad groups.</li>
<li>Services/products as the campaign and different personas as the ad groups.</li>
<li>Auction price/customer value as the campaign and the products/services as ad groups.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/google-ads-account-structure-right-roofing.png" alt="google ads account structure - roofing account example" width="720" height="369" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60973" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/google-ads-account-structure-right-roofing.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/google-ads-account-structure-right-roofing-480x246.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The best structure choice for you will depend on the complexity of the offering, your budget, as well as your desired ramp-up pace.</p>
<p>Once you find the right structure for your campaigns, you can begin applying it to more markets/initiatives.</p>
<p>As a general rule, pick one part of your business to prove out which structure you’ll be testing. Give it at least 30-60 days of optimization time to ensure you’re on the right track to roll it out to the rest of your business.</p>

<h2>Be smart about scaling your Google Ads</h2>
<p>Scaling Google Ad campaigns is equal parts reliant on subjective and objective signals. Knowing that creative or structures are meeting metric goals is absolutely a sign it&#8217;s time to scale. There’s also factoring in timing. Scale should only happen when no operational change can support it.</p>

<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/10/how-to-determine-conversion-value">Why Your Non-Ecommerce Business Should Set Conversion Values (&#038; How to Do It)</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The days of just using individual conversions are long past. All ad platforms now encourage advertisers to embrace and leverage conversion values. Take Google Ads, for example: Max conversion value is one of the only bidding options for PMax campaigns and has been getting a lot of love in account recommendations.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/maximize-conversion-value-google-ads-bidding.png" alt="maximize conversion value bidding in google ads" width="568" height="371" class="wp-image-65325 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/maximize-conversion-value-google-ads-bidding.png 568w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/maximize-conversion-value-google-ads-bidding-480x313.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 568px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you’re in ecommerce, conversion value is nothing new—revenue tracking is at the heart of successful shopping campaigns. However, if you’re in a services industry or one that doesn’t have a set price per engagement, you might struggle to land on a conversion value.</p>
<p>In this post we’ll dive into how to do that. Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>The difference between individual conversions and conversion values.</li>
<li>The benefits of leaning into conversion values.</li>
<li>How to come up with a conversion value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this post will be heavily focused on how Google leverages conversion values, however, the lessons learned can be applied to other channels.</p>
<h2>What’s the difference between conversions and conversion values?</h2>
<p>A conversion is any action you ask an ad platform to track. Conversion actions can range from those on the path to profit (downloading a guide, making a call, etc.), to the completed sale.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/google-ads-conversion-actions.png" alt="google ads conversion action setup" width="600" height="658" class="size-full wp-image-65297 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/google-ads-conversion-actions.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/google-ads-conversion-actions-480x526.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/25/conversion-value">Conversion values</a> are the monetary amount you tell the ad platform to attribute to the completed action.</p>
<p>For example, I might set a conversion action to track all phone calls stemming from my Google Ads ads. Google will track each of them as long as I set the action to a primary action. Whether it values those calls at $1 or $100 or any other amount depends on me adding the conversion value into the action.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/google-ads-conversion-action-details-conversion-value.png" alt="google ads conversion value" width="720" height="409" class="size-full wp-image-65296 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/google-ads-conversion-action-details-conversion-value.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/google-ads-conversion-action-details-conversion-value-480x273.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In short, you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/30/google-ads-conversion-tracking">track conversions in Google Ads</a> without conversion values—however, you are creating data weaknesses for the ad platform as well as internal reporting.</p>
<h2>Why should non-ecommerce businesses set conversion values?</h2>
<p>One of the biggest false positives/negatives in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/07/ppc-reporting">PPC reporting</a> is CPA (cost per acquisition). While a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/cost-per-action">low CPA</a> is a good thing, businesses will often over-fixate on getting that number as low as possible without factoring in the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/08/lead-quality">value of the leads</a> they’re getting.</p>
<p>ROAS (return on ad spend) is a more helpful <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/19/ppc-metrics">PPC metric</a> than CPA in knowing whether your ad campaigns are delivering real-world value.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cpa-vs-roas.png" alt="cost per action vs return on ad spend" width="720" height="386" class="size-full wp-image-65322 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cpa-vs-roas.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cpa-vs-roas-480x257.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Conversion values help elevate the conversation and bring transparency to the true ROI on your ad spend. By setting conversion values, you’re helping Google Ads know which actions you value most and where to invest the budget.</p>
<p>Additionally, factoring in conversion values will help Google come up with more realistic forecasts on what additional investment could yield. This is especially useful if you have campaigns that are getting limited by budget but are bringing in low-value leads. By building in conversion values, Google can become more intelligent about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/21/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheat-sheet">targeting your ideal prospects</a>.</p>
<h2>How to calculate conversion values when you&#8217;re not ecommerce</h2>
<p>Just because we’re bought into using conversion values doesn’t mean they’re straightforward. Unless you’re in a transactional industry like ecommerce, your conversion values will be based on models and data-backed best guesses.</p>
<p>A really useful place to begin is phone leads vs form-fills vs chats.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your sales team is best served by real-time interactions, phone leads might be your best lead type.</li>
<li>If it’s served best by lots of information about the prospect (potentially gained through a bit of content, a form, or other method), you might value your form-fills or chats higher.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of which is the most useful, here&#8217;s what to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate your baseline value (you can adjust this as you operate and see real-world conversions) as 10% of your gross profit from the average engagement.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/03/improve-conversion-rates">conversion rates</a> from each lead type to come up with the conversion value.</li>
</ol>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><p>For example, let&#8217;s say I’m a lawyer, my average case is worth $6500, and my phone leads convert at 50% while form-fills convert at 20%.</p>
<ol>
<li>Baseline value per lead is $6,500 x 0.10 = $650</li>
<li>Phone lead conversion value = $650 x 0.50 = $325
Form fill conversion value = $650 x 0.20 = $130</li>
</ol></div></div>
<p>Be sure to also factor in location. Certain locations might be tougher/easier to service than others. If your margins are impacted by where a customer is based, or if you have insights about retention from certain markets, you may decide to value leads coming from certain regions higher or lower. This can be done through bid adjustments as well as excluding locations from high-value campaigns with higher ROAS goals.</p>
<h2>Know what your conversions are worth</h2>
<p>While it’s not mandatory to use conversion values, they will improve account performance if done correctly (and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/21/google-ads-not-converting"> if you&#8217;re not seeing any conversions in your Google Ads, head to this post</a>). Take the time to audit your lead sources and see where your best leads come from. By valuing them higher than the average lead, you will help Google send you the best prospects and have the best chance for ROI.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is a viable ad network for most advertisers, supporting ecommerce and lead gen businesses alike and helping both B2B and B2C own their customer journey.</p>
<p>But between increasing pressure from privacy compliance and updates forcing more conversion modeling, the targeting options from the early days just aren’t there anymore. We can’t rely purely on native audiences like we once could.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/facebook-ads-detailed-targeting.png" alt="facebook ads detailed targeting" width="720" height="288" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-64092" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/facebook-ads-detailed-targeting.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/facebook-ads-detailed-targeting-480x192.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This leaves us with two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Own that there will be more waste in our Facebook ad spend and build that into our marketing plans, or</li>
<li>Get creative.</li>
</ol>
<ul></ul>
<p>In this post, I&#8217;m going to show you how to get creative—with three easy hacks to set up effective, privacy-compliant Facebook audiences.</p>
<h2>Hack #1: Create content-specific audiences with UTMs</h2>
<p>This first tip is from the amazing Michele Morgan (who offers even more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/facebook-ad-targeting">privacy-friendly Facebook targeting options here</a>). UTM parameters are customizable snippets you can add on to the URLs your ads are pointing to, to track your campaigns&#8217; performance. They can be used to identify your traffic sources and which creatives are getting profitable engagements.</p>
<p>There are five UTM parameters you can add on to the end of the destination URL (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">landing page</a>) in your ad:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Source </strong>is which website or channel you&#8217;re using (example: Facebook, Google, Email)</li>
<li><strong>Medium</strong> is the element within the source site (example: VideoAd, banner, newsletter)</li>
<li><strong>Campaign</strong> is whatever campaign, offer, or product you&#8217;re promoting with that medium (example: AprilPromo)</li>
<li><strong>Content </strong>can be used to identify which link was clicked if the medium has multiple links (example: Button, TextLink)</li>
<li><strong>Term </strong>is used to identify the keyword you&#8217;re targeting if a paid search ad (Example: Dress+Pants).</li>
</ul>
<p>For this hack, you&#8217;ll use a UTM to create audiences based on content users engage with. This will enable you to target categories that have been removed from Facebook native targeting.</p>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><p><strong>It will look something like this:</strong></p>
<p>www.yourlandingpage.com?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign={{campaign.name}}&amp;utm_content={{adset.name}}&amp;utm_term={{ad.name}}</p></div></div>
<p>Before you stress about needing to do a bunch of additional work, remember that Facebook has a handy UTM builder in the ad builder interface.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/facebook-backup-audiences-url-parameters.png" alt="facebook ads UTM builder" width="612" height="802" class="wp-image-63958 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/facebook-backup-audiences-url-parameters.png 612w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/facebook-backup-audiences-url-parameters-480x629.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 612px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>Hack #2: Use in-market segments on other channels to build source audiences</h2>
<p>All too often, advertisers wait on installing tracking code until they start advertising on a channel.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>By getting ahead and placing your code, you’ll be able to start building source audiences for future lookalike and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/17/retargeting-campaign-tips">retargeting campaigns</a>—which is what this workaround is about.</p>
<p>Both <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/17/in-market-audiences">Google’s in-market audiences</a> and Microsoft’s Audience Network can help you to build these source audiences.</p>
<h3>Google in-market segments</h3>
<p>Google allows for the following transactional segments that are a little more restricted on Facebook:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Employment</strong>: <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/16/facebook-ad-not-approved">Facebook will disapprove ads</a> that try to use targeting when focusing on employment. The exception to this is on custom audiences (i.e. folks who have consented to be tracked/targeted by you). Using Google’s in-market and life events audience segments, you’ll be able to build a traffic list that can then be turned into a remarketing or lookalike list.</li>
<li><strong>Real Estate</strong>: Like employment, Facebook considers real estate a special interest category. Often ads get accidentally tagged in this category due to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/07/facebook-ad-copy-examples">ad copy</a> or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/24/design-facebook-ads-free">creative</a>. Using the residential and commercial in-market segment can help curate your Facebook and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/08/instagram-ads-cost">Instagram spend</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Finance:</strong> Facebook has been taking an increasingly critical eye on financial industries, which is why Google’s in-market audiences are so powerful. Audience segments focusing on credit monitoring and lending services are particularly powerful.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/in-market-segments-google-ads.png" alt="google ads in-market segments" width="720" height="520" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-63960" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/in-market-segments-google-ads.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/in-market-segments-google-ads-480x347.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Keep in mind that using these segments still requires a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/30/cookie-consent-banner-examples">cookie compliance plan</a>. This data will only be useful if users are comfortable accepting tracking.</p>
<h3>Microsoft Audience Network</h3>
<p>Microsoft Ads has many of the same in-market and life event audiences. There are some that are specific to Microsoft Ads worth exploring:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Politics</strong>: Political ads face a lot of scrutiny and restriction and politics is one of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/removing-certain-ad-targeting-options-and-expanding-our-ad-controls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeting options Facebook removed due to sensitivity</a>. Being able to build an interest audience through Microsoft Ads topic targeting is a powerful way to get more focused targeting.</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> While there is overlap with Google’s employment targeting, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/09/linkedin-audiences">Microsoft&#8217;s LinkedIn audience targeting</a> is a powerful way to prefilter spend. Whether you’re looking to target by company or by stage in the person’s career, these pre-qualifiers can help build a powerful remarketing or seed audience for Facebook.</li>
</ul>
<p>By using other channels to create audiences you’ll be able to unlock this for yourself on Facebook as well as build in extra communication points with your clients.</p>

<h2>Hack #3: Use greater than 1% lookalike audiences</h2>
<p>One of the big reasons advertisers stress over the loss of special interest audiences is the fear of relying on automation to uncover the right people. We want to be the ones in control. For example, when creating a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-lookalike-audiences">Facebook Lookalike Audience (LAL)</a>, we prefer to go with 1% (if you&#8217;re unfamiliar, the lower the percentage, the closer the match but the smaller the audience).</p>
<p>Yet by opting into the higher (and therefore looser lookalike percentages), we can pick up the audiences we lost without running afoul of the privacy-first web. The signals haven&#8217;t gone went away, they just can’t be actively targeted (here are more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/target-audience-examples">target audience examples</a>).</p>
<p>Akvile Defazio recently Tweeted about this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/facebook-backup-audiences-lookalikes.png" alt="akvile defazio tweet supporting 5% facebook lookalike audience" width="600" height="346" class="size-full wp-image-63959 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/facebook-backup-audiences-lookalikes.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/facebook-backup-audiences-lookalikes-480x277.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Not quite sure what it is about those Facebook 5% lookalike audiences, but they continue to perform super well and better than any other lower %s. </em></p>
<p><em>We love it, clients appreciate it, and our accounts benefit from it. If you aren&#8217;t testing higher LALs, I encourage you to do so.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>While this might seem like a “give up” strategy it’s really just adapting to the times. Ad platforms always bake more signals and values into their automated options than their manual ones. By allowing more automation and ceding some control, you can retain the bigger value add: targeting the right audience and achieving higher ROI.</p>
<h2>Try these privacy-first Facebook audience targeting workarounds</h2>
<p>Despite all of these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/22/customer-data-privacy">customer data privacy</a> updates and changes, there are always paths forward to target your ideal prospects. By using other channels as well as leaning into automation, we can continue to get meaningful value out of Facebooks ads. To recap, here are the three hacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use UTMs to create content-based audiences</li>
<li>Use in-market segments on other channels (like search) to create source audiences for Facebook LAL/remarketing campaigns.</li>
<li>Try creating Facebook LAL audiences with a &gt;1% match.</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All ad networks represent potential value for brands. Where they can fall short is if they are asked to do a job they’re not predisposed to do or behave the way other ad networks behave. Understanding the rules of engagement for each ad network can help you to assign them the right jobs, and more importantly, achieve the highest ROI.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ad-channel-roles.png" alt="ad channel roles" width="720" height="346" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62653" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ad-channel-roles.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ad-channel-roles-480x231.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This post is just going to focus on the four main ad channels:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Paid search:</strong> The Salesman</li>
<li><strong>Display:</strong> The Audience Builder</li>
<li><strong>Video:</strong> The Need Educator</li>
<li><strong>Paid social:</strong> The Impulse Enabler</li>
</ol>
<p>While each ad channel can do some of the others&#8217; jobs, they are best suited to their core function. Let&#8217;s take a look at each one and its core role, along with my top tips for getting the most out of each one.</p>
<h2>Paid search: The Salesman</h2>
<p>Paid search (usually <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/how-to-use-google-adwords">Google Ads</a>) is the default advertising channel for many brands. These are the ads served on the SERP (search engine results page). Google Search sees 5.6 billion searches per day, so it’s understandable brands want access to that visibility. Here are my top tips for using paid search right.</p>
<h3>Have a specific target in mind</h3>
<p>The nature of search means the person already knows what they need. They might be researching to decide which vendor makes the most sense, but for the most part, the product or service has already lodged itself in the user’s mind.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/search-ad-example.png" alt="search ad example" width="720" height="434" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62388" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/search-ad-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/search-ad-example-480x289.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As such, paid search works best when you have a specific target market in mind for your products/services. You understand what those products and services are worth so you can set realistic goals for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/18/search-advertising-benchmarks">average cost per click</a> (CPC), cost per acquisition (CPA), and return on ad spend (ROAS).</p>
<h3>Choose the right keyword concepts</h3>
<p>Since paid search revolves around bidding on keyword concepts, you’ll need to get into the mind of how your best customers search. Bidding on both “attorney” and “lawyer” will cause you to bid against yourself, and each has its own unique <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/14/how-does-google-ads-work">auction</a> price. By choosing the best keyword concept for your target market, you’ll ensure you’re able to speak to your prospect in the way they want to be spoken to.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/free-keyword-tool-results.png" alt="free keyword tool results for attorney keywords" width="720" height="338" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62389" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/free-keyword-tool-results.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/free-keyword-tool-results-480x225.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Divide your headlines into hooks and CTAs</h3>
<p>Ads need to speak to user needs while also being more than keyword formulaic templates. A good way to think about paid search ads is dividing your headline ones into “hooks”and your headline twos into calls to action (CTAs). Descriptions should include additional information the user might value knowing, but shouldn’t be mission-critical to getting their attention. Most users only read the headlines of ads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/RSA-responsive-search-ad-headline-template.png" alt="responsive search ad headlines - template" width="720" height="165" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59787" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/RSA-responsive-search-ad-headline-template.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/RSA-responsive-search-ad-headline-template-480x110.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>

<p>By harnessing the right keywords to target the right audience, search ads are powerful closers. You can use native audiences (in-market, affinity, etc.) or build their own through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/12/first-party-data">first-party data</a> or using custom intent.</p>
<h2>Display: The Audience Builder</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/23/google-display-ads">Display campaigns</a> are far more valuable than &#8220;just <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/17/retargeting-campaign-tips">remarketing</a>” channels. They allow you to communicate with high-impact imagery as well as begin to build a curated audience for your other campaigns.</p>
<p>Display ads can be charged by CPM (cost per thousand users), CPC (cost per click), or CPA (cost per acquisition). Here are some tips for getting the most out of your display ads</p>
<h3>Conduct placement audits</h3>
<p>The key to activating display’s full value is <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/07/google-display-network-placements">placement</a> audits. Some placements will hold more value than others (and in turn have higher auction prices). It’s up to you to unpack whether a placement is worth the premium or not.</p>
<p>While most mobile app placements will be a waste (fat fingering an ad in the middle of a game is the worst kind of wasted spend), some can be useful. Make sure auditing placements is grounded in KPIs and strategic value.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/display-ad-placements.png" alt="display ad placement examples" width="499" height="434" class="aligncenter wp-image-62390" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://medium.com/inside-revenue/what-types-of-display-ads-should-you-run-part-3-35bee584c58c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<h3>Use them to prequalify your leads</h3>
<p>If you find that your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/08/lead-quality"> lead quality has been poor</a>, display ads can be a powerful tool to reach your prospects while they’re researching their needs. You can help them understand if they’re thinking about value/quality the right way, or whether they should even be considering your product/service at all.</p>
<h3>Be creative with your creative</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/09/ad-design">Display ad creative</a> is far more important than it used to be. Users have gotten accustomed to beautiful creative, regardless of whether it’s sponsored. One of the ways Google and Microsoft lighten the load is with their Shutterstock integration. Whether you use Shutterstock or your own creative, you’ll be able to get much more reach (and engagement) out of responsive display ads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/display-ad-examples.png" alt="display ad examples on a hobby website" width="592" height="392" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62391" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/display-ad-examples.png 592w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/display-ad-examples-480x318.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 592px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Both <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/30/best-display-ad-examples">display ad examples</a> on this page have built-in buttons to signal the user to click. However, the World of Warcraft ad has better synergy with the topic of the page. While the Shopify Plus ad makes sense to serve to me (I’m an ideal target), interrupting my hobby time requires more creativity than a straightforward ad.</p>
<h2>Video: The Need Educator</h2>
<p>All ad networks have embraced video ads as a major creative type, and for good reason. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/13/video-ad-tools">Video ad content</a> can inspire need through creative storytelling, alert a prospect on their eligibility to interact with products/services, and build positive sentiment toward a brand. Here are some key tips for creating<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/29/google-ads-video-campaign-settings"> video ad campaigns</a>.</p>
<h3>Prioritize the first 5 seconds</h3>
<p>The best video ads understand users likely won’t see past the first five seconds. While some lean into the six-second bumper ad format (equal part art and science), others attempt to persuade the user to stick around for the full ad.</p>
<p>Pragmatically, advertisers should focus on getting the following information out in the first five seconds:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/08/business-name-ideas">Business name</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/13/call-to-action-examples">Call to action</a></li>
<li>Contact method</li>
</ul>
<h3>Focus on your personas</h3>
<p>Video ads require strategic thinking on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/23/buyer-personas">target personas</a>. If you will be using real people, you need to make sure they match the target demographic you&#8217;re serving to. Using graphics can be a way around this—however, you need to make sure you maintain <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/07/31/brand-voice">brand voice</a> (i.e., if your brand isn’t cheeky in other content, you can’t suddenly have a cheeky cartoon ad).</p>

<h3>Set a frequency cap</h3>
<p>Aside from creative, it’s important to remember video ads interrupt content a user actively chose to engage in. If you serve the same ad (or ads in the same series) to people too frequently, they will eventually tune you out or develop bad brand sentiment. Be sure you set a frequency cap for daily/weekly views. A good place to start is five views per week and adjust from there.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cap-frequency.png" alt="frequency cap setting" width="720" height="402" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62392" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cap-frequency.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cap-frequency-480x268.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>Paid social: The Impulse Enabler</h2>
<p>Paid social refers to ads on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">social media platforms</a> like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok, etc.</p>
<h3>Regularly refresh your creative</h3>
<p>Your social ads require the biggest shift in strategy and creative from search. They revolve around new entities instead of old data, so you ened to refresh campaigns/ad sets/ads to help the algorithm continue to serve them optimally. There are plenty of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/24/design-facebook-ads-free">tools for designing Facebook ads</a>, like Canva.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/design-facebook-ad-creative-free-canva.png" alt="facebook ad templates in canva" width="720" height="364" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50285" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/design-facebook-ad-creative-free-canva.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/design-facebook-ad-creative-free-canva-480x243.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Be aware of privacy restrictions</h3>
<p>Building a good social campaign requires the most work in unpacking personas. Understanding who your people are and how to inspire their desire is key to winning at paid social. While this used to be child’s play with all the native targeting, privacy innovations have forced social ad networks to limit targeting and reporting options.

</ul>
<h3>Use lookalike audiences</h3>
<p>Using customer lists to seed lookalikes has always been a part of social campaigns, and remains a viable way to focus budgets toward ideal prospects.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/facebook-audience-types.png" alt="facebook-audience-types" width="720" height="406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57046" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/facebook-audience-types.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/facebook-audience-types-480x271.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Conventional wisdom holds that 1% lookalike is the best setting, however, in more niche industries, 8% has been starting to perform better. Test both schools of thought to find the best audiences for you.</p>
<p>This means that creative is even more crucial than before. Segmenting out which creative will speak to the user relies on visual queues and demographic matching.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/facebook-ad-example-kiara.png" alt="facebook ad example" width="400" height="558" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62394" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/facebook-ad-example-kiara.png 400w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/facebook-ad-example-kiara-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=all&amp;country=US&amp;view_all_page_id=107241124145440&amp;sort_data[direction]=desc&amp;sort_data[mode]=relevancy_monthly_grouped&amp;search_type=page&amp;media_type=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>View the ad example here.</em></a></p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/14/facebook-video-ad">Facebook video ad</a> does a great job because it highlights various people using the product and also plays into the common obsession some people have with taking care of acne. There’s also a clear call to action (Shop Now) and a relatable <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/28/facebook-ad-headlines">headline</a>.</p>
<p>What makes this ad a great case study in impulse enablement is how applicable it is to a wide group, while also solving a relatable problem.</p>
<h2>Final tips &amp; takeaways</h2>
<p>Each of these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/10/paid-media-strategy">paid media</a> channels have a place in your marketing mix, and each has its own rules of engagement. Here are my two final takeaways for using these ad channels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each channel also has certain budget thresholds for success. If you don’t have the budget for one, you might be able to get comparable value by leveraging another.</li>
<li>The best way to unify their efforts is to use analytics as your main source of truth and collaborate on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/22/cross-channel-marketing">cross-channel messaging</a>.</li>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Managing PPC accounts is a lot like playing a game: Once you understand the rules, you can start getting into creative strategy. Account audits are an important part of understanding the rules—essentially it&#8217;s getting the board ready to play.</p>
<p>While there are different checks to be done in a PPC audit—some weekly, some even daily—many of them can be boiled down to five key questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does your account structure support your business goals?</li>
<li>Do you trust your conversion tracking?</li>
<li>How well does your creative match your target persona?</li>
<li>Are you falling into accidental waste?</li>
<li>Should you be scaling or optimizing?</li>
</ol>
<p>In this post, I&#8217;m going to cover each of these questions and provide tips and rules of thumb to help you address each one. Each of these questions governs a different aspect of PPC management, all of which are applicable to any account. If you’re not asking them at least once per quarter, you’re doing your account a disservice.</p>
<h2>1. Does your account structure support your business goals?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/10/google-ads-account-structure">Account structure</a> is arguably the most important element of an account. A poorly structured account will tank even the best creative and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/20/stop-burning-your-adwords-budget">waste valuable marketing dollars</a> and time.</p>
<p>For example, a common structural error is including too many ad groups in a campaign or too many keywords in an ad group. If a business needs to cover all services/markets/products, it’s understandable why there might be some overstuffing— but an ideal campaign should only have <strong>5-7 ad groups</strong> and no more than<strong> 3-5 keyword concepts</strong>. This is to ensure the budget can support each ad group and that the keywords are grouped by price and relevance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/google-ads-account-structure-feature.png" alt="google ads account structure overview" width="700" height="507" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61001" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/google-ads-account-structure-feature.png 700w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/google-ads-account-structure-feature-480x348.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Understanding which structure will serve you best comes down to the following business questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much is a customer worth?</li>
<li>Are all markets worth the same or are some more valuable?</li>
<li>Do you need to invest in all parts of your business, or can you play favorites?</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions will give context to the existing account setup as well as inform the best path forward</p>
<p>Also, <strong>campaigns should cover one country at most </strong>(ideally one timezone/major market). This is because ads serve in the timezone of the account, not the user. Additionally, it’s challenging for a single budget to support more than one major market. Use Impression Share (and impression share lost to budget) to guide you on if you’re asking your budget to handle too much.</p>
<p>In some cases, there might not be enough budget to go after all the parts of the business. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/01/dynamic-search-ads">Dynamic Search Ads</a> (DSAs) can be a powerful way to cover multiple parts of the business.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ppc-audit-dynamic-search-ads.png" alt="dynamic search ad setup in google ads" width="1198" height="904" class="aligncenter wp-image-61106" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ppc-audit-dynamic-search-ads.png 1198w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ppc-audit-dynamic-search-ads-980x739.png 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ppc-audit-dynamic-search-ads-480x362.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1198px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>However, DSAs can also steal budget from general search ad groups/campaigns if negatives aren’t set correctly.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ppc-audit-dynamic-vs-regular.png" alt="analytics showing both a dynamic and regular ad struggling" width="720" height="148" class="aligncenter wp-image-61105 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ppc-audit-dynamic-vs-regular.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ppc-audit-dynamic-vs-regular-480x99.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Both the regular campaign (top) and DSA campaign (bottom) are struggling due to competing over the same traffic.</em></p>
<p>The easiest way to apply negatives is through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/06/negative-keyword-guide">negative keyword lists</a>, which is why I suggest making DSA their own campaigns. Negative keyword lists can’t be applied at the campaign level only. If you choose to keep DSA in the same campaign, be sure you <strong>add all keywords you’re actively bidding on as exact match negatives</strong>.</p>
<p>A final note on DSA: it is critical that you’ve <strong>set negative targets</strong>. This ensures your DSA doesn’t waste budget going to the homepage or blog content.</p>
<p>Ad extensions can also help provide reasonable coverage for lower profit parts of the business without actively investing marketing dollars. <strong>Use sitelinks, callouts, price extensions, and structured snippets to cover low search volume or expensive keyword concepts.</strong> This will ensure your budget isn’t being set up to fail while also boosting the CTR for your ads.</p>
<p>As you work through your account structure, you’ll be able to identify which parts are aligned and which ones need to be adjusted.</p>
<h3>Takeaways:</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you don’t have budget for all parts of your business, consider using extensions or DSA to cover them.</li>
<li>Overstuffed campaigns with too many objectives will flounder. Check for number of ad groups/keywords, locations targeted, and products/services being covered by a campaign.</li>
<li>Check for campaign/ad group level negatives and if negative keyword lists are being used, ensure there aren’t missing ad group level negatives (to direct traffic).</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Do you trust your conversion tracking?</h2>
<p>Conversion tracking is a crucial part of PPC campaigns. Yet it’s also one of the easiest things to mess up (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/24/google-ads-conversion-tracking">conversion tracking hangups here</a>). When auditing campaigns, it can be easy to fall into false positives/negatives due to bad conversion tracking.</p>
<p>The first and more important check is establishing that conversion tracking is set up and tracking actions your business finds valuable. To do this, go to Tools &amp; Settings &gt; Conversions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ppc-audit-conversions.png" alt="google ads - how to access conversions from tools and settings" width="720" height="377" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61103" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ppc-audit-conversions.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ppc-audit-conversions-480x251.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There, you’ll be able to see which actions are set as primary vs secondary conversion actions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ppc-audit-conversion-actions.png" alt="primary conversion actions in google ads" width="720" height="487" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61107" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ppc-audit-conversion-actions.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ppc-audit-conversion-actions-480x325.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Primary actions will count towards recorded <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/cost-per-action">cost per acquisition</a> (CPA) and act as a signal for bidding. Secondary actions will be noted but will not influence reporting or bidding algorithms.</p>
<p>It’s crucial to ensure the right actions are being tracked and that they’re designated correctly.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ppc-audit-submit-lead-forms-goal.png" alt="ppc audit - goal edit view in google ads" width="720" height="483" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61104" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ppc-audit-submit-lead-forms-goal.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ppc-audit-submit-lead-forms-goal-480x322.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For phone leads, it’s also important that you’re not double-counting conversions with call tracking technology. If you use a call tracking solution, odds are you have an analytics goal for that, and should stick with it as the primary tracking. Google call tracking is useful for call-only ads and extensions if you don’t have any other form of tracking for your site.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s crucial to check that there isn’t duplicate code. Many tools and channels require their own tracking snippet. Make sure your sites don’t have duplicate google tag manager (GTM) on them or tracking hard coded into the header and in GTM. You can check this by using Google Tag Assistant or pressing ctrl/command u to see source code.</p>
<h3>Takeaways:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the right conversion actions are set to primary.</li>
<li>Confirm there are no instances of duplicate code.</li>
<li>If phone leads are important, make sure to use some form of call tracking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. How well does your copy/creative match your target persona?</h2>
<p>Ad accounts are more than structure and bids. A big part of their success is on the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/03/ad-copy-examples">ad copy</a> and creative and how well it is predisposed to land with the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">targeted audience</a>.</p>
<p>As you’re auditing your account, it’s important to check for two critical points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the copy/creative speaking to the unique market demands of the ad group?</li>
<li>Are audiences being used as targets/exclusions to prequalify budget?</li>
</ul>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, you only want <strong>one major creative idea per ad group</strong> (still allowing for A/B tests). If you’re combining too many products/services/personas into one ad group, you won’t be able to speak directly to customer needs, eroding the effectiveness of the creative.</p>
<p>This is especially true with responsive search ads (RSAs), which inherently enable A/B testing on copy/creative.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-responsive-search-ads-work.png" alt="how responsive search ads work" width="720" height="481" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59791" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-responsive-search-ads-work.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-responsive-search-ads-work-480x321.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>Make sure you’ve pinned your “hooks” to headline one (H1), and your calls-to-action (CTA) to headline two (H2)</strong>. Headline three doesn’t always show so that should only be used for “nice to have” creative. You can find more tips in this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/05/responsive-search-ad-copy">responsive search ad copy template</a>.</p>
<p>Be sure to check for audiences (targeted and excluded). If your campaign is using a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/19/google-ads-automated-bidding">Smart Bidding strategy</a>, any Observe bid adjustments will be ignored. It’s good to check for them just in case you are expecting to focus budget towards or away from specific audiences. <strong>Directional audiences should always be on Target and Observe</strong> (or excluded if they’re not ideal).</p>
<h3>Takeaways:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Message map creative so there’s one buyer persona per ad group.</li>
<li>If you’re using smart bidding, confirm observation audiences don’t have bid adjustments.</li>
<li>Save your best creative for headlines one and two in RSAs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Are you falling into accidental waste?</h2>
<p>Important disclaimer: Ad platforms do not have malicious intent and ultimately are invested in helping brands/advertisers succeed.</p>
<p>There are certain settings that are very easy to enable—and also miss opting out of—that can lead to accidental waste. These settings fall under both manual and automated strategies.</p>
<p><strong>One of the biggest settings to look out for is location options.</strong> When you<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/07/google-ads-geotargeting"> target a location</a>, it can be targeting people in + people who show interest in the location, only people in the location, or only people who show interest.</p>
<p>The default is to target everything, which can lead to spend outside the targeted area. Be sure that you check every campaigns’ settings and confirm the location options are correct.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-ads-geotargeting-location-options-presence-interest.png" alt="google ads location targeting - location options" width="500" height="241" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-51042" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-ads-geotargeting-location-options-presence-interest.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-ads-geotargeting-location-options-presence-interest-480x231.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Another slightly insidious bit of waste comes from a mostly helpful part of Google Ads: the Keyword Planner. It’s very easy to accidentally add in a lot of broad keywords to one ad group, as opposed to getting keyword concepts to add to multiple ad groups on the correct match type.</p>
<p>Be sure you’re <strong>adding keywords that won’t be accidental duplicates</strong> or put you in auctions you don’t value/can’t afford.</p>
<h3>Takeaways:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Confirm your location settings are correct.</li>
<li>Make sure keyword suggestions are being added on the correct match-type and to the right place.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Should you be scaling or optimizing?</h2>
<p>Many <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/07/06/ppc-account-audit">PPC audits</a> are focused on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/24/google-ads-optimization">optimizing account performance</a> (i.e. eliminating wasted spend). Yet understanding signs of success and scale are equally important.</p>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-impression-share/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Impression share</a> is a great metric to help you understand where the account is and where it could be. If your impression share is low due to rank, that likely means there are structural issues getting in the way of ROI. Impression share lost to budget points to even more potential profit (so long as business operations can support additional volume).</p>
<p>Another great indicator for optimization vs scale is your click-through rate (CTR) to conversion rate. If your CTR and conversion rate are high, that means you can take that proven method and apply to other markets/add budget into the campaign. If the CTR or conversion rates are low, you know you have a creative or targeting issue (and should remain in optimization mode).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-local-services-ads-for-real-estate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Local Services Ads for real estate</a> = big wins</em></p>
<p>While they are incredibly simple to maintain once set up, they have undergone some changes since they began in 2016, both in how they&#8217;re set up and the markets they work for. So in this post, I&#8217;m going to outline the pitfalls and mechanics to account for, as well as seven tips to get the most out of Google Local Services Ads.</p>
<h2>Local Services Ads 101</h2>
<p>Before getting into the tips, here&#8217;s a brief refresher on Google LSAs. You can learn more in our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/11/google-local-service-ads">Ultimate Guide to Google Local Services Ads</a>, but here are the basics.</p>
<h3>What are Google Local Services Ads?</h3>
<p>Google Local Services Ads are an ad type geared for home service-based businesses. While Google Search Ads are pay per click and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/ad-ranking">Ad Rank</a> is based on factors like bid, ad quality, and more, LSAs are pay per lead and ad rank is based on factors like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">customer reviews</a>, proximity, and hours. The ads appear above regular Google Search Ads and the advertiser goes through an extensive verification process.</p>
<h3>Types of LSAs</h3>
<p>Google has two versions of LSAs: Google Screened and Google Guaranteed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Screened</strong> is for white-collar industries like real estate, lawyers, and accountants.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-google-screened-real-estate-e1649639391162.png" alt="google local services ad - google screened result" width="719" height="520" class="aligncenter wp-image-60049 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-google-screened-real-estate-e1649639391162.png 719w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-google-screened-real-estate-e1649639391162-480x270.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 719px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Guaranteed </strong>is for blue-collar industries like plumbing, housekeeping, and locksmiths. The core difference between the programs is Google Guaranteed will protect customers up to $2000 for problems on the job. Google Screened does not have this protection.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/google-local-services-ads-google-guarantee-hvac.png" alt="google local services ads - google guaranteed result" width="719" height="650" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-65107" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/google-local-services-ads-google-guarantee-hvac.png 719w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/google-local-services-ads-google-guarantee-hvac-480x434.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 719px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul></ul>
<h3>Setting up LSAs</h3>
<p>To qualify for either program, businesses need to meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A minimum 3.0 Google Business Profile rating.</li>
<li>A Google Ads account (potentially an MCC account—more on this later).</li>
<li>Background checks for required team members.</li>
</ul>
<p>When setting up your LSA profile you’ll be prompted to set up a review link, as well as input your credentials.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-setup.png" alt="google local services ads - setup checklist" width="720" height="346" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60041" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-setup.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-setup-480x231.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Google Local Services Ads: 7 tips to improve your ROI</h2>
<p>Google LSAs make it easy for lawyers, real estate agents, and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-home-service-businesses-can-show-up-for-local-google-searches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home services businesses to show up for local searches</a>. Here are some small details that can make a big difference in the ROI of your LSAs.</p>
<h3>1. Know whether to have an MCC vs an individual ad account</h3>
<p class="p1">It’s always easier to establish <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/30/facebook-ads-account-structure">account structure</a> from the outset than fixing it later. Understanding whether your brand is best suited for a manager account (MCC) versus an individual ad account comes down to the following considerations:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"></span>Do you serve more than one major market?</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"></span>Are you a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/franchise-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">franchise</a>?</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"></span>Are you an agency?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">It’s a best practice to limit LSA profiles to three major targets per profile. Otherwise, if you serve more than one location, you are diluting the budget focus and potentially risking the proximity ranking factor. Serving multiple locations can benefit from having multiple Google Business Profiles, with one LSA profile per market.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Essentially, unless you just target one market, you will need more than one profile.  </strong></p>
<p class="p1">Setting up your LSA profiles as an MCC will allow you to easily navigate between them without logging in and out of your account. You’ll also get the benefit of MCC-level billing, reporting, and shared assets.</p>
<p class="p1">As a franchise/agency this is especially important as you only can share login access with a LSA profile with one other email.</p>
<h3>2. Target no more than 3 major markets</h3>
<p>Each Local Services Ads profile should be viewed as a campaign. Just like you wouldn’t ask a campaign to service more than one major market, it’s unrealistic to ask a Local Services Ads to target more than three major markets.</p>
<p>So as just mentioned, in an ideal structure, you’d have each LSA profile focusing on one major market (corresponding to one Google Business Profile).</p>
<p>However if you only have one GBP and serve multiple locations, <strong>be sure the locations you choose to target are in close proximity to your main prospect hubs</strong> (i.e where you’ll have a higher likelihood of benefiting from the proximity ranking factor).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-service-areas.png" alt="google local services ads - service area selection" width="720" height="604" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60042" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-service-areas.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-service-areas-480x403.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Targeting a county or DMA counts as one target. You can exclude zip codes or towns to narrow your focus and bypass competitive auctions.</p>
<p>While there is no official cap for brands in a given market, the average amount of vendors a given geo can support is 35. It’s i<strong>mportant to quickly secure your LSA profile and focus budget on priority markets so you can ensure your dominance on the SERP.</strong></p>

<h3>3. Avoid unnecessary disapprovals</h3>
<p>The most common reason for LSAs to stop serving are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/23/google-ads-disapprovals">disapprovals</a>, and two common disapprovals are for the image to get flagged or certifications to go out of date.</p>
<p><strong>To avoid expired certifications:</strong></p>
<p>When you’re setting up your profile you’ll be asked to input the expiration date of your certifications. However, some certifications don’t need to be renewed—or if they do, they’re not an annual renewal. Be sure to set the expiration date far enough in advance that you won’t need to think about it for 5-10 years.</p>
<p><strong>To avoid flagged headshots:</strong></p>
<p>For your headshot, it’s important that your picture is of more than just your face. <strong>Ideal images will cover down to the elbows.</strong> Here is an example of a headshot that will likely succeed:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-image.png" alt="google local services ads - image" width="500" height="502" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60036" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-image.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-image-480x482.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here is an example of a headshot that will likely fail:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-image-approval.png" alt="google local services ads - acceptable headshot" width="416" height="389" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60037" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-image-approval.png 416w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-image-approval-300x281.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></p>
<p>Profile pictures don’t need to have a plain white background or lack personality. The core difference between one being acceptable and the other not is the visibility of the arms.</p>
<h3>4. Keep your Google reviews up</h3>
<p><span>Keep in mind that reviews on your regular Google Business Profile appear on your LSA profile and impact your ad ranking, but not the other way around. And any reviews you get from your LSAs will go away if you stop advertising, and you won’t be able to respond to reviews that come through your review link. </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also important to know that Local Service Ads require a 3.0 average review rating to remain active. If your Google Business Profile slips below 3.0, your ads will stop serving till your review score clears 3.0.</p>
<p>You can learn <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/16/get-more-google-reviews">how to get more Google reviews here</a>. And make sure your Google Business Profile and other <a href="https://localiq.com/products/listings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">directories</a> are accurate and updated with this <a href="https://localiq.com/free-business-listings-grader/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free business listings grader</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Set higher bids and budgets</h3>
<p>It’s understandable that brands might be wary of setting aggressive bids and budgets on a new marketing channel. Local Service Ads invite the pitfall of underbudgeting and bidding because of their reputation for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/30/cost-effective-ad-types">low-cost leads.</a></p>
<p>When you set up your campaigns, you’re given the option to set a manual bid per lead or opt into <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/19/google-ads-automated-bidding">automated bidding</a>. It’s common for ads to under-serve (or not serve at all) if you opt into auto bidding with a low budget.</p>
<p><strong>As a general rule, you typically want to set a budget 2-3 times what you actually plan on spending</strong> as Google often struggles to spend the budget. So if the goal is to spend $5,000 per month, you’d want to set a budget at $15,000.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-budget-overview.png" alt="google local services ads - budget overview" width="720" height="214" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60040" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-budget-overview.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-budget-overview-480x143.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Though the budget for this account was set to $10,000, Google only spent $3,054.</em></p>
<p><strong>Also, the cap per bid has gone up to $1,000,  </strong>so if you’re struggling to gain traction with auto bidding, you might be running into competitors setting aggressive manual bids. This might be a reason to target a tangential market.</p>
<p>Because you only pay for calls lasting at least two minutes or form fills, your marketing dollars are going to have a much easier conversion rate than <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/paid-search">traditional paid search</a> (which requires you to pay per click). If your leads cost $50 and you have a goal of $500 monthly spend, that means you’re striving for 10 leads per month. Depending on your bandwidth, you might want to strive for more or less leads.</p>
<h3>6. Set realistic hours</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/19/conversion-rate-benchmarks">Conversion rates</a> for LSAs and response times have a strong correlation: the faster you are to respond to leads, the greater the chance you will win the business.</p>
<p>Local Service Ads do not factor response times into ranking, but they do learn what kind of users result in successful calls/form-fills.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-hours.png" alt="google local services ads - business hours view" width="557" height="623" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60043" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-hours.png 557w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-hours-480x537.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 557px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>Make sure your LSA is set to only run when you have the team to respond. </strong>If you can’t support leads 24/7, do not let the campaign run 24/7. This will help Google allocate budget as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-job-types.png" alt="google local services ads - job types" width="720" height="551" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60035" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-job-types.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-job-types-480x367.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>7. Mark your leads</h3>
<p>If a lead turns into business, mark it as closed successfully, and archive leads that aren’t a good fit. Some lead quality issues can be because of services you said you were open to taking (i.e., saying you’ll take rentals but you really only do sales/purchases), but most will be because the prospect just wasn’t right. Archiving the lead communicates that to Google so it can learn where not to invest your budget.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-leads-view.png" alt="google local services ads - leads view" width="720" height="528" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60038" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-leads-view.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-local-services-ads-leads-view-480x352.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>Follow these tips to succeed with Google LSAs</h2>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remarketing (also called retargeting) is a core strategy in PPC, where you take a group of people determined by previous action or behavior (audiences) and target their ads towards or away from that group of people. And there&#8217;s no shortage of statistics that show us why it&#8217;s such a core strategy.</p>

<p>Retargeting can increase ad engagement by 400% and sales by 50%—if you do it right. So in this post, I&#8217;m going to help you to do just that by covering 10 costly retargeting mistakes to avoid so you can get the most out of this ad type..</p>
<h2>10 costly mistakes to avoid in your remarketing campaigns</h2>
<p>The rules of engagement for PPC are always in flux, and it’s important to adapt structures and strategies with the times. Make sure you&#8217;re not making any of these mistakes so that your retargeting <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-marketing-campaigns-of-2024">campaigns</a> are as effective as possible.</p>
<h3>1. Using cookie-based (website visitor) retargeting</h3>
<p>Retargeting people who have visited your website has been a common practice for years, but this strategy relies on third-party cookies which, as you know, are being phased out. This is leading to incomplete data on our website visitors which can lead us to send the wrong messages to the wrong users.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s better to use customer lists or other lists based on first-party data. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/12/first-party-data">First-party data </a>is any information you own that a user has consented to allow you to track/hold. This can include contact info (email, phone number, etc.), on-page behavior, and other data that you secured through user consent. Buying a contact list does not count as first-party data, and should not be used in remarketing (this can actually result in an ad account suspension).</p>
<p>Almost all ad platforms (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.) allow advertisers to target uploaded/synced lists of customer emails/phone numbers. This style of remarketing (be it targeting or excluding) uses first-party data to help advertisers more effectively match their message to prospects.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/zero-first-second-third-party-data.png" alt="zero, frist, second, third-party data" width="720" height="467" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57202" /></p>
<p>These lists can be used <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/17/remarketing-audiences">remarketing audiences</a> or used to seed Similar/Lookalike Audiences.</p>
<p><strong>That being said, it’s important to have a strategy in place to earn customer trust so they will give you their contact info—such as with high-quality <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/15/lead-magnet-ideas">lead magnets</a>.</strong></p>
<h3>2. Avoiding lookalike audiences in favor of more control</h3>
<p>Similar Audiences (used in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-remarketing">Google remarketing</a>) and Lookalike Audiences (used in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/11/16/facebook-remarketing">Facebook remarketing</a>) are powerful prospecting tools. They take people who show desirable traits and use them as models for finding new audiences.</p>
<p>When Similar Audiences first hit the scene, there was fear that they’d be wasteful. Advertisers like control, and giving the algorithm “free reign” can seem scary. Yet<strong> Similar Audiences and Lookalike Audiences often outperform direct remarketing and absolutely trounce not using any audiences.</strong></p>
<p>It’s important to note Similar Audiences and Lookalike Audiences will only be as good as the lists you use to seed them.</p>
<p>Similar Audiences will automatically generate where Lookalikes require you to actively make them in the respective ad manager.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/retargeting-tips-facebook-lookalike-percent-certainty.png" alt="retargeting tips - facebook ad audience size and certainty" width="720" height="181" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58832" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/retargeting-tips-facebook-lookalike-percent-certainty.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/retargeting-tips-facebook-lookalike-percent-certainty-480x121.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Ad networks will allow you to set a percentage of certainty that a user is similar to the seed audience. <strong>Be sure you only opt into 1% certainty as the larger amounts tend to pull in more waste.</strong></p>
<h3>3. Under-excluding</h3>
<p>Audience exclusions are an underutilized tactic to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/21/how-to-save-money-google-ads">save budget</a> and be more targeted with messaging. Setting audience exclusions follows the same logic as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/06/negative-keyword-guide">negative keywords</a> and excluding placements: anyone in the excluded audience won’t be eligible to see your ad.</p>
<p>By excluding a remarketing list that was the seed for a Similar Audience, you can ensure only net new folks see your ad. You can also exclude close but not quite traffic.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re in real estate, searches for commercial and residential can be close if not identical (even though their value is drastically different). By excluding the in-market audience for the sub-vertical the advertiser isn’t interested in, they can protect their budget and ensure they get enough useful volume.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/retargeting-tips-google-ads-in-market-exclusions.png" alt="retargeting tips - google ads in-market exclusions" width="720" height="414" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58833" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/retargeting-tips-google-ads-in-market-exclusions.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/retargeting-tips-google-ads-in-market-exclusions-480x276.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> When using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/19/google-ads-automated-bidding">automated or Smart Bidding</a>, <strong>excluding or outright targeting audiences is the only way to help ad platforms direct your budget.</strong> If you’re using manual bidding or enhanced CPC, you can use positive and negative bid adjustments to direct budget towards or away from particular audiences.</p>
<h3>4. Operating separately from SEO</h3>
<p>One of the biggest benefits of connecting <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/17/google-analytics-audience-reports">Google Analytics</a> to your ad account is being able to sync audiences. Advertisers can identify and combat the reasons organic traffic didn’t convert, budget for segments that historically perform better/worse than others, and leverage other analytics segments in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/15/audience-targeting">audience targeting</a> and creative.</p>
<p>Work with your SEO team to understand which segments they’d find useful to be specifically targeted, as well as which ones would make sense to exclude. Paid campaigns are usually able to get volume quickly, so if the content team wants to run a test, or if there’s interest in seeing the response to a specific layout, Analytics segments can help those collaborative efforts.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-ads-retargeting-tips-audience-segments.png" alt="google ads retargeting tips - analytics segments " width="720" height="418" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58834" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-ads-retargeting-tips-audience-segments.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-ads-retargeting-tips-audience-segments-480x279.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It’s important to note that Analytics segments are sometimes too small to run on their own so be realistic and upfront with your team on what you can and can’t run.</p>
<h3>5. Ignoring nuances in ad copy</h3>
<p>Ad creative should always be engaging and inspire profitable action. Good ads become great when they’re <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/22/advanced-remarketing-strategy">targeted to specific groups predisposed to engage</a>.</p>
<p>By using audiences to target budget towards specific groups of people, you also control the messaging. <strong>Taking the time to analyze whether a group of people uses one variant of a word or another (e.g., &#8220;marketing tools&#8221; vs &#8220;marketing software&#8221;) can help ensure the message lands.</strong> <img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-ads-remarketing-tips-subregions.png" alt="google ads remarketing tips - subregion langauge" width="720" height="291" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58835" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-ads-remarketing-tips-subregions.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-ads-remarketing-tips-subregions-480x194.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Make sure you’re as specific as possible (whether using a native audience or remarketing). Targeting pet owners (without specifying the type of pet), will expose otherwise great creative to waste.</p>
<p>If you’re using a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/05/google-ads-remarketing-lists">remarketing list</a>, use ad copy and creative that honors the conversation prospects have begun with you, ideally overcoming common objections to conversion.</p>
<h3>6. Targeting too-small audiences</h3>
<p>Ad algorithms need data to function, and if a target is too small, your budget will struggle to serve. Regardless of platform, if an audience is less than 1000 people, it will not be able to serve.</p>
<p><strong>If you’re using a customer list as a seed for a Lookalike or Similar Audience, be mindful it can take up to 48 hours to process and you’ll get a “too small to serve” until it fully renders.</strong></p>
<p>This is not say you shouldn’t build an audience to target later. You just might need to keep it on target and observe for a while.</p>
<h3>7. Skipping observation mode</h3>
<p>Audiences can be applied on either target and observe, or just observe. This choice dictates whether the audience you select will actually influence whether the budget is directed towards or away from the audience.</p>
<p><strong>If you choose target and observe, the audience must have enough people to serve so it can make sense to begin with a new audience on observe.</strong> Additionally, if you use Smart Bidding, the algorithm will ignore your observation audiences and just direct budget to those who seem to meet the Smart Bidding objective.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-ads-remarketing-tips-targeting-observation.png" alt="google ads remarketing tips - targeting vs observation" width="720" height="466" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58836" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-ads-remarketing-tips-targeting-observation.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/google-ads-remarketing-tips-targeting-observation-480x311.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>8. Not having a clear brand stance</h3>
<p>Using audiences in your branded and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/14/competitor-targeting">competitor targeting campaigns</a> can be an effective way to focus budget and ensure correct messaging. Setting up these campaigns requires you to opt into one of two strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Branded campaigns with organic traffic excluded, to be protective of those cheaper clicks stealing general service budget.</li>
<li>Branded campaigns designed to go after those already familiar with your brand, with one ad group targeting those on remarketing lists and one ad group excluding them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both paths can be profitable. It’s important to understand why you choose one path or another. If your team has <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/15/multi-touch-attribution">attribution</a> issues, you likely want to go with the first path. If you trust your tracking and all teams are using a single source of truth for reporting, the second tends to be best.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/14/competitor-targeting">competitor campaigns</a>, consider adding your current customer lists on target and observe so you can overcome the reasons they might be thinking about leaving you.</p>
<h3>9. Siloing your remarketing strategies</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to capitalize on remarketing lists is to apply lists from one channel to another as a Lookalike/Similar Audience. This<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/24/cross-channel-marketing-mistakes"> cross-channel marketing strategy</a> will allow you to find ideal customers on different ad platforms you wouldn’t otherwise capture. Additionally, you can feel good about testing budgets on new channels (which is one of our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/10/paid-media-strategy">paid media strategy essentials</a>) because you’re protecting your budget with audience guardrails.</p>
<h3>10. Not budgeting for remarketing campaigns</h3>
<p>A common <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/07/google-ads-mistakes">mistake advertisers make</a> is lumping remarketing budgets in with general service and expecting great results quickly.</p>
<p>Just because a campaign is focused on a more concentrated audience, doesn’t mean it doesn’t need a budget to run. Be sure you’re allocating enough per day for the new campaign to ramp up and achieve its goals.</p>
<p><strong>A good rule of thumb is to allocate 15-20% of your paid campaign budgets to remarketing (at least in the beginning).</strong> Some brands will end up allocating more to the remarketing campaigns due to the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/14/how-does-google-ads-work">auction</a> prices of their industry.</p>
<h2>Get more out of your retargeting campaigns with these tips</h2>
<p>Remarketing is a powerful tool in digital marketing and will yield the best results when grounded in first-party data and collaborative campaigns. Here&#8217;s a recap of the mistakes I covered above in the form of tips:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Use first-party data targeting (customer lists)</li>
<li class="p1">Don&#8217;t shy away from similar audiences</li>
<li class="p1">Exclusions can be just as powerful as active targets</li>
<li class="p1">Use Analytics audiences for better SEO collaboration</li>
<li class="p1">Use the terms your audience is using</li>
<li class="p1">Make sure your audience is large enough to serve</li>
<li class="p1">Know the difference between target &amp; observe and observe</li>
<li class="p1">Have a brand stance</li>
<li class="p1">Use remarketing lists across channels</li>
<li class="p1">Budget for remarketing campaigns</li>
</ol>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>With Google's recent match type changes, using singe keyword ad groups, or SKAGs, is no longer a reliable strategy. Instead, we recommend using single theme ad groups—or as we like to call them, STAGs. Here, we explain why you need to change your SKAGs and how STAGs will help.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/29/single-theme-ad-groups">So Long, SKAGs; Hello, Single Theme Ad Groups</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Google makes a change, there tends to be a period of panic and anger—<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/31/phrase-match-broad-match-modifier-close-variants">and the recent changes to match types were no exception</a>. The internet threw up its arms in justified frustration—account structures and workflows honed over the years just got hosed down by “close variants.”</p>
<p>In my view, single keyword ad groups, or SKAGs, were the most affected. SKAGs thrive on high levels of control over keyword syntax, yielding perfect keyword to ad to landing page relevancy.</p>
<p>There is no “right” way to run an account, and there’s an argument to be made for every paid media perspective. However, when Google changes the rules of engagement, some strategies have to be retired.</p>
<p>It’s time to say goodbye to SKAGs as we’ve known them, and embrace single theme ad groups, or STAGs.</p>

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/keyword-level-last-account-structure-guide.png" alt="keyword research for ppc" width="489" height="436" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>New campaign structure, same concentrated strategy.</em></p>
<p>But before we say goodbye, it’s important to understand why the strategy was so successful for some and how to carry that value into the new “intent” era.</p>
<h2>What are SKAGs? Why did SKAGs work?</h2>
<p>Single keyword ad groups are exactly what they sound like: one keyword per ad group (sometimes on multiple match types).</p>
<p>SKAG account structure follows one of the following formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single ad group per campaign with a micro-budget or shared budgets.</li>
<li>All ad groups in one campaign with a giant budget.</li>
<li>Varied numbers of ad groups (sometimes healthy, sometimes not) per campaign with budgets strategically set in relation to the products or services represented.</li>
</ul>
<p>Traditionally, keywords like “trainer” and “training” would have their own ad group, and negatives would be used to direct traffic. This strategy would allow advertisers to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/01/12/how-to-write-great-advertising-copy">craft ad copy</a> that specifically leveraged language in the ad group and landing page.</p>
<p>In theory, advertisers could improve their quality score, get cheaper clicks, and feel in control of their budget.</p>
<p>In actuality, what would often happen is these structures would concentrate <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/19/bids-versus-budget">budget</a> in a few select ad groups/keywords—depriving important parts of the business.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="b6167eeb-0ee5-4cca-a5d0-b2fa9b8b36e4" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Impression share lost due to rank and budget</em>.</p>
<p>By design, SKAGs need to put all ad groups in the same campaign or have micro-budgets. Advertisers who opt for micro-budgets are susceptible to impression-share loss. Dumping all ad groups in the same campaign (or exceeding the healthy ad group ratio of five to seven) is a recipe for budget misallocation.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="3a67cd3a-b26a-4e67-be18-aa4f569267dc" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>It’s worth noting that dynamic keyword insertion (DKI) often found a home in SKAG accounts because of the focus on keyword to ad to landing page relevance.</p>
<h2>The slow death of SKAGs</h2>
<p>When <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/06/13/close-variants">the first round of close variants hit</a>, misspellings, abbreviations, and varying suffixes—like “ing” “er” “ed”—of keywords began to lose credit for their traffic. Google is predisposed to favor keywords/ads with data, so lower searched terms would struggle to get a shot, while highly searched variants would own budgets (even if they were less predisposed to profit).</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e56d5f04-ab19-4143-9a79-82b4383716cc" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Then, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/20/exact-match-keywords">exact match evolved</a>—order no longer mattered and implied words were allowed:</p>

</div>
<p>“Lawyer” matches to “attorney”; “mowing lawn” matches to “cutting grass.” And mass panic ensues.</p>

</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>SERP for “training” search.</em></p>
<p>Historically, advertisers bid more aggressively on exact match because it meant you had the most protections against wanton matching. Now, “exact” might as well be “broad.”</p>
<p>SKAG accounts had one last hope: phrase match. Up until the change, phrase match locked in the order of keywords and didn’t allow for implied words to take the chosen word’s place.</p>
<p>For all the value they brought, there are three really important reasons SKAGs no longer hold their own against other PPC strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Campaign limits on negatives:</strong> A <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6372658?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search campaign can “only” have 10,000 negatives</a>. Because negatives don’t allow for close variants, but active keywords do, it will be impossible to fully protect a given ad group or campaign from all the negatives needed to protect against waste and direct traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Budget constraints: </strong>If a keyword has an auction price (top of page/average CPC) that exceeds 10% of the campaign daily budget, it makes it challenging to secure value out of the campaign. Over split campaigns won’t have enough fuel for their keywords, and giant campaigns tend to have budget allocation issues. This means important parts of the business starve while high-volume keywords get all the budget.</li>
<li><strong>Time investment:</strong> Healthy ad groups will have three ads per ad group, and the ability to create three unique/interesting ads for SKAGs presents a true challenge for even the most prolific copywriters.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is one use case of SKAGs I heartily support and hope continues on: a single long-tail broad keyword with every other keyword added as an exact match negative.</p>
<p>This strategy allows you to gather data on how your prospects may be searching—and at what auction price you can secure them.</p>

<h2>STAGs: The new solution</h2>
<p>Single theme ad groups focus on themes rather than syntax, ensuring there are three to five similar themed keyword concepts per ad group.</p>
<p>STAG <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/05/02/adwords-account-structure-guide">account structure</a> will follow one of the following formats:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Service/product category as the campaign:</strong> Audience/messaging governing the ad groups.</li>
<li><strong>Location/market as the campaign:</strong> Products/services as the ad groups.</li>
<li><strong>Profit probability as the campaign:</strong> Corresponding products/services as the ad groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>The benefit of running a STAG structure is in the ability to set budgets aligned with profit as opposed to PPC mechanics. <strong>No more budgeting for every variant under the sun</strong><strong>—you can now play favorites and direct budget where it will do the most good</strong>.</p>
<p>While it’s true this structure misses out on perfect keyword to ad to landing page relevancy, it more than makes up for it in the metrics that matter: <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/16/return-on-ad-spend-roas">ROAS</a>, impression share, and conversion rate.</p>
<p>An easy way to make close variants an innovative “hack” as opposed to a frustrating thwarter of structure is to bid on the mistake. For example, the word “oxygen concentrator” usually goes for $7-$8 per click, but by bidding on the variant (in this case, the misspelling), we’re able to secure $4-$5 average CPCs. At scale, this means we can usually fit at least one extra click per day, increasing the odds that our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/19/conversion-rate-benchmarks">conversion rate</a> will secure us a lead.</p>
<p>Audiences have all but killed the need for perfect keyword matching because they allow you to prequalify traffic before you invest in them.</p>
<p>Layering<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/31/in-market-audiences-for-search"> in-market</a> and custom affinity audiences on search campaigns ensures the budget is going where it can do the most good (and protecting against dubious intent).</p>
<p>For example, bidding on the keyword “moving services” can apply to a local mover who will help a renter move to a new apartment, just as much as it can apply to a several hundred thousand dollar deal to relocate an office.  With audiences, you can exclude the intent that isn’t a good fit (and driving up your costs/giving you false positives on cost effectiveness).</p>
<h2>How to migrate from SKAG to STAG</h2>
<p>We’re ready to embrace the new way! Huzzah STAGs! Now, time to restructure your account to reflect this change.</p>
<p>Restructures always come with some risk for disruption to lead volume and short term performance fluctuations, but there are ways to mitigate them. Here are three rules to follow to make your restructuring from SKAG to STAG simple.</p>
<h3>Rule #1: If you trust your conversions, don’t move them</h3>
<p>Restructures almost always mean initiating learning periods and fluctuation in performance. The biggest culprit is often pausing a converting keyword.</p>
<p>Working through a restructure means creating a lot of net new entities—even if the long term will benefit, you still need to protect your short-term KPIs. As a rule, the keyword/ad group/campaign with conversions should get to stay put.</p>
<p>For example, in the below example, we would work on moving “rigging,” “rigger,” and “rig” keyword concepts into the “NJ Rigging” ad group.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="f3124030-8489-43ee-9c92-9fc074bec1ac" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>A big reason for this is you want some stability built into the restructure as opposed to having a complete rebuild.</p>
<p>If you’re faced with multiple keywords/ad groups with good conversion data, then allow auction price to be your guide.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="d69fbbd5-c3f8-4f33-ba55-6400bf0fef8f" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/single-theme-ad-group-cpc.jpg" alt="single theme ad group CPC" width="790" height="362" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>In the above example, we see that the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/29/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks">average CPC</a> for “rigging” concepts is cheaper than “mover” concepts, so there’s a priority on moving those first because mistakes aren’t as costly.</p>
<h3>Rule #2: Not everything will make the cut</h3>
<p>It can be hard to break up with a keyword, but sometimes for the good of the account, sacrifices have to be made. If a keyword is just a variant of another keyword, it likely needs to be paused. Additionally, there may be keyword concepts that just don’t fit the budget. Use this time to take stock of keywords that are truly important versus could be covered by others or highlighted in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/12/automated-ad-extensions">extensions</a>.</p>
<h3>Rule #3: Pause so you can try again</h3>
<p>One of the classic blunders in PPC is changing an ad or keyword as opposed to duplicating them and changing the duplicate. The moment you make a change, the entity is gone, and you need to deal with the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/13/learning-period"> ramp up period for a net new entity</a> without the safety net of going back to your original entity.</p>
<p>It’s also important that you give your new structure the time it needs to prove itself (and that you embark on this restructuring journey at a time when you can handle some flux).</p>
<h2>Time to embrace STAGs</h2>
<p>Abandoning a workflow or process can be scary—humans are incredibly habitual creatures. Yet the data paints an optimistic picture: We will be able to free ourselves of granular mechanics in favor of strategic pragmatism.</p>
<p>Managing an account will now be about what it should always be about: data-driven lead generation governed by profit centers and priority markets. If a campaign is built, it’s built because it directly ties into a business need, as opposed to attempting to game PPC mechanics. This shift is a good thing, and you should embrace STAGs to make the most of it.</p>
