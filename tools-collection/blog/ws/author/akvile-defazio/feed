]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you are an established agency or are just getting started, there is always room to try new strategies to grow your business, your team, and your client roster.</p>
<p>To help, we&#8217;re sharing actionable strategies to grow your digital marketing agency broken down by:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#clients">Client acquisition tactics</a></li>
<li><a href="#employees">Ideas to expand your team</a></li>
<li><a href="#services">Ways to refine your offerings</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These practical ideas will help you focus on the strategies meant to grow your agency this year.</p>
<div id="clients"></div>
<h2>Client acquisition tactics</h2>
<p>Without leads, we don’t have clients, and without clients, we don’t have much of an agency. Straight forward—however, even if you are at capacity, it’s crucial to always feed your funnel with new leads and foster those relationships so they can evolve into clients now or down the road.</p>
<p>While there are many ways to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-get-more-clients-for-your-agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquire new clients</a>, most come from referrals. In fact, according to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/20/state-of-the-internet-marketing-agency-report-2020">WordStream’s State of the Agency report</a>, 51% of surveyed agencies consider referrals their main source of acquiring new clients, followed by upsells from other products or services at 20%.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/state-of-the-agency-client-acquisition.png" alt="state-of-the-agency-new-client-source" width="800" height="534" /></div>
<p>If you’ve been in business for some time, the above sources may be familiar to you. But keep reading as we have some additional ones to share. There just may be some methods you and your team have not yet explored that could be effective in further growing your client roster. If you’re a freelancer or small agency owner looking for more clients to add to your roster, try these lead-generating, client-acquiring tactics.</p>
<h3>1. Be your own publicist</h3>
<p>Unless you are a large agency and already have a publicist on speed dial, that is. Otherwise, it’s worth doing some publicity work. If you&#8217;re not used to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-digital-marketing-agency">promoting your digital marketing agency</a> or yourself regularly, it may take some getting used to, but it&#8217;s well worth it in the long run!</p>
<p>Seek out opportunities to get your name, your team, and your services out there. Here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Submit pitches to speak at events</li>
<li>Attend industry or local business events</li>
<li>Share online that you plan to and want to connect with others</li>
<li>Get in touch with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/20/small-business-podcasts">podcast</a> hosts and offer to share your expertise with their listeners</li>
<li>Contribute to external industry blogs and publications</li>
<li>Be active on social media to build your own <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/08/personal-branding">personal brand</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/grow-digital-marketing-agency-publicist.jpg" alt="grow digital marketing agency - example of promotion via twitter for podcast guest" width="500" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72233" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/grow-digital-marketing-agency-publicist.jpg 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/grow-digital-marketing-agency-publicist-480x574.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /><br />
Do these ideas truly work to grow your digital marketing agency? They certainly do. For example, <a href="https://www.akvertise.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Akvertize</a> has been in business for over five years now, and we heavily rely on these tactics to advertise our agency. They have brought in leads to our funnel and helped us convert many into clients.</p>
<p>Being front-facing, active, helpful, and having your name displayed across various mediums while sharing tactics, tools, ideas, and content can have a rewarding effect.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you’re the CEO, a paid media manager, or a junior-level staff member, it can help your agency tremendously if everyone can act as a publicist on behalf of your agency. Plus it helps you build authority and credibility in your field, which can help you bring in more clients down the road.</p>
<h3>2. Share your availability</h3>
<p>If you’ve tried the above and you still have room for more work, simply share that you are accepting new clients along with the details of your areas of expertise. These types of posts tend to get shared widely on social media.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/grow-digital-marketing-agency-tweet.jpg" alt="tweet promoting agency services - strategies to grow digital marketing agency" width="564" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72235" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/grow-digital-marketing-agency-tweet.jpg 564w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/grow-digital-marketing-agency-tweet-480x509.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 564px, 100vw" /><br />
If there’s room, mention the type of clients and industries you prefer to work with and have experience with.</p>
<p>If you’re possibly concerned about the optics of doing this, as I once was, worry not. The first time I put this out on Twitter, I thought it would come off that we were failing and short on work, however, others told me the contrary, that it looked like we were growing. From time to time, we still do this, and it always brings in leads, whether it’s a light month or we’re looking to scale further.</p>
<p>Don’t be shy—let people know that you’re available to help!</p>
<h3>3. Always take the meeting</h3>
<p><span>At </span>AKvertise<span>, we always take the call, the meeting, or the conversation to talk to a prospect. After all, you never know what can transpire from a conversation until you have it. </span></p>
<p>While this may not always be sustainable, especially if you receive a high volume of leads (lucky you!) or have strict lead scoring in place, it&#8217;s helpful to connect with as many prospects as possible. This can help you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/26/networking-email-subject-lines-templates">build your network</a> or identify ways you can work with specific prospects.</p>
<p><span>If the prospect still isn&#8217;t a match for you after a conversation, you can refer them to a trusted agency that may be a better fit for their needs. (We talk more about partnering with complementary agencies a little later!)</span></p>
<div id="employees"></div>
<h2>Expand your team</h2>
<p>Looking to take on more clients but limited on bandwidth? You could increase efficiency by using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency">AI tools for marketing agencies</a>. Or you&#8217;ll need to expand your team, either by collaborating with other agencies or hiring new talent to join your team as employees. If the latter makes more sense for your agency in the long run, that may be easier said than done. Talent acquisition can be challenging, and it may take several hires to find the right fit. But good, diligent marketers are out there.</p>
<h3>4. Hire more employees</h3>
<p>Posting to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-make-a-job-posting-stand-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">job boards</a> can be effective, but there’s nothing quite like getting a personal recommendation. When we look to add to our team, we’ve found success by reaching out to industry contacts to see if they or someone they know is looking for work.</p>
<p>In addition, we post to our personal and business social channels as it’s an easy way to share that you’re hiring. If you’re looking to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/15/ppc-agency-pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scale your paid search agency</a> and/or paid social team this year, one very effective way to reach marketers and advertisers is via Twitter and using the #ppcchat and #fbadschat hashtags.</p>
<p>Posting publicly to LinkedIn can be fruitful as that platform has significantly grown and increased in activity over the last few years. Have your current team members share details about a position opening and link to a job description on your website so potential candidates can learn more before applying. As an advertising agency, you could also take that a step further and use that audience for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/the-complete-remarketing-toolkit">remarketing ads</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/grow-digital-marketing-agency-hiring.jpg" alt="grow your digital marketing agency - share job listings on linkedin" width="484" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72238" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/grow-digital-marketing-agency-hiring.jpg 484w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/grow-digital-marketing-agency-hiring-480x594.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 484px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There are also a number of job boards out there, such as Indeed. If you’re strapped for time, delegate this process by hiring a recruiter in an effort to help find you the right fit for your digital marketing agency.</p>
<p>If you’re comfortable doing so, expand your search by offering remote opportunities, especially if you’re located in a smaller city where the talent pool may be smaller. According to <a href="https://www.hrmorning.com/news/younger-generations-remote-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HR Morning</a>, 86% of millennials say that having flexibility and working remotely is a priority.</p>
<p><strong>The next step:</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/17/how-to-train-new-hires">Training your new employees</a> so you set them (and your agency and clients!) up for success.</p>
<h3>5. Join forces with other agencies</h3>
<p>Not in a spot to hire employees at this time? Connect with another competitive or complementary marketing provider. If you offer website design services, reach out to other agencies that may be short on bandwidth, and you can offer your expertise to their clients. Some agencies are transparent about this and others may want to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/09/white-label-tools">white label</a> you, so it’s up to your preference on how you want to work.</p>
<p>Connecting with complementary marketing agencies can also bring you exciting new client work. For example, reach out to some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO</a> agencies to see if they have any clients that are interested in paid search or paid social advertising. This can be beneficial to you, to them, and to their clients.</p>
<p>In a sense, you would be delivering a more holistic marketing strategy to the client while being close to a full-service agency and driving more revenue for your business. We’ve found great success in taking this approach over the years and becoming an extension of other agency teams. You can, too, with these types of strategic partners.</p>
<h2>Refine your offerings</h2>
<p>Combining forces with an agency that offers complementary services is a great way to expand your team and your offering while staying competitive with other digital marketing agencies.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/state-of-the-agency-additional-services.png" alt="state-of-the-agency-other-services" width="800" height="537" /></div>
<p>But sometimes it’s worth rethinking your agency’s own offerings to find the best strategy for growth.</p>
<h3>6. Scale back to grow more</h3>
<p>It doesn’t hurt to scale back services in order to grow. If you’re excelling as a full-service agency, keep at it. If you’re smaller, specializing could be a great alternative.</p>
<p>When we first launched AKvertise, we offered paid search and paid social, but around the time of our third anniversary, we decided to scale back on our advertising service offerings and focus on the thing we enjoyed most and thrived in, in an effort to further excel and to distinguish ourselves fully as a social media advertising firm.</p>
<p>There was some hesitation in that we could lose business and have fewer leads coming in; however, we decided that it was worth the test. If it didn’t succeed, we could always revert and offer more services. It’s been more than two years since this refinement and specializing was the best thing we could have done for our business. It’s brought in more clients and helped us grow and could help you as well.</p>
<p>Become the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/16/grow-your-digital-marketing-agency">expert in your specialized field</a> and in turn, you may evolve into a go-to agency for your particular service.</p>
<h2>Set your digital marketing agency up for growth in 2025</h2>
<p>This year, treat your agency like a client campaign. Look at your business objectively, take your own recommendations, test some of the above tactics that you haven’t yet, and see if they work for your digital marketing agency.</p>
<p>Market yourself to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/05/brand-awareness-campaigns"> build awareness</a> for your agency by seeking out opportunities to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/lead-generation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bring in new leads</a>, clients, team members, and partnerships as you scale.</p>
<p><strong>Here are those strategies to grow your digital marketing agency in 2025:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Be your own publicist</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Share your availability</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Always take the meeting</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Hire more employees</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Join forces with other agencies</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Scale back to grow more</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t be afraid to test something new as you can almost always revert. Happy testing, and may this year bring you success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p>When it comes to Facebook advertising, your ad creative is everything. Solid copy gets users to click, but it’s the images and videos that get them to stop and read your ad in the first place.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ad-design-free-low-cost-mockup-1.png" alt="attractive facebook ad design canva mockup" width="400" height="471" /></div>
<p>But what if you can’t afford a designer or fancy equipment? What if you are limited on design skills?</p>
<p>Worry no more. In this post, I’m going to cover six free and low-cost tools you can use to create high-quality, on-brand creative for your Facebook and Instagram ads.</p>
<ol>
<li>Your iPhone</li>
<li>Stock images and videos</li>
<li>Facebook ad templates</li>
<li>Facebook&#8217;s built-in creative tools</li>
<li>User-generated content</li>
<li>Facebook Brand Collabs Manager</li>
<li>Instagram Branded Content Ads</li>
</ol>
<h2>7 budget-friendly Facebook ad design tools you must have</h2>
<p>The success of a Facebook ad depends on all of its elements: the creative, the <a href="/blog/ws/2018/08/28/facebook-ad-headlines">copy</a>, the landing page, and the offer. Let&#8217;s go over six free or low-cost ways of coming up with thumb-stopping visuals.</p>
<h3>1. Your smartphone</h3>
<p>The cameras on most Apple and Android phones and tablets are incredible these days, and can capture quality shots of your products, services, or even background material.</p>
<p>Due to image compression in the name of <a href="/blog/ws/2021/04/02/improve-core-web-vitals">Core Web Vitals</a>, the image below may not do it justice, but the photo was taken with an iPhone.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/design-facebook-ad-creative-free-iphone-1.png" alt="facebook ad design mockup using an iphone image" width="400" height="548" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Would you believe this image was taken with an iPhone?</em></p>
<p>With the right backdrop and lighting, some photos will need no additional editing. But many phone cameras have additional features and effects. This is the easiest and fastest way to design images and videos for your Facebook and <a href="/blog/ws/2017/05/22/best-instagram-ads">Instagram ads</a>.</p>
<p>For tips on this free asset creation method, check out <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/15163633-how-to-capture-high-quality-product-photos-with-your-smartphone">Shopify&#8217;s smartphone product photography guide</a>.</p>
<p>Even if this means upgrading your phone, it&#8217;s a cheaper investment than expensive equipment. Plus, you&#8217;ll be able to do more with your phone.</p>
<p class="color-pc-blue"><em>Speaking of investments, are you getting the highest ROI with your Facebook ads? </em><br />
<strong><em><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-advertising">Use our free Facebook Ads Performance Grader to make sure you&#8217;re not wasting ad spend or missing out on opportunities.</a></em></strong></p>
<h3>2. Stock image and video</h3>
<p>If you prefer to use professional images and videos, use <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/22/best-practices-stock-photos">stock photos</a> and videos to expand your arsenal of <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/02/reasons-to-advertise-on-social-media">social advertising</a> design assets. <a href="https://www.pexels.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pexels</a>, <a href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a>, and <a href="https://pixabay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pixabay</a> not only offer endless photos and videos you can use for free, but their search features also make it easy to search for and discover creative content based on your visual needs.</p>
<p>For example, Unsplash divides their inventory into more than 20 topics where you can filter down to themes that revolve around technology, business and work, nature, and more.</p>
<p>Below is a mockup ad using an <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/FtZL0r4DZYk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash image</a>. Looks good, right?</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Brought to you by Unsplash + <a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/facebook-ads-mockup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook ad mockup generator</a></em></p>
<p>While the images and videos are free, you&#8217;ll need to create an account. Plus, some of them have additional assets for paid subscriptions. Keep in mind that since you will be using these stock creatives for business purposes, you&#8217;ll need to read the website’s license agreement and FAQ page to avoid any infringements and conflicts.</p>
<p>If your competitors are using stock creatives, take a look at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&amp;country=US&amp;media_type=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook’s Ad Library</a> to see what types of ads they are running so that you don&#8217;t use the same creatives in your ads.</p>
<p>This can also help you see how you can make your ads look and read better as the <a href="/blog/ws/2016/10/27/facebook-ad-copy-tests">copy</a> and creative complement one another.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/design-facebook-ads-free-low-cost-facebook-ad-library-1.png" alt="free tool to design facebook ads-facebook ad library homepage" width="720" height="266" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Facebook ad templates</h3>
<p>If you’re looking for other options, try out tools like Canva and Shutterstock that not only offer free and low-cost images, but also provide social media design templates for organic and paid assets.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shutterstock</a> ($49 per month for a single user), offers access to more than 350 million images, videos, and music files, along with templates you can use to easily create anything from <a href="/blog/ws/2017/10/16/facebook-business-page">Facebook Page</a> cover images to <a href="/blog/ws/2019/12/04/instagram-story-hacks">Instagram Stories</a> content. The less you have to worry about proper specs and the easier it is to represent your brand in a good light on <a href="/blog/ws/2020/11/19/paid-social-trends">paid social,</a> the better.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ad-design-free-shutterstock-1.png" alt="shutterstock library of templates for easy facebook ad design" width="720" height="326" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/search/facebook+ads+templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>Canva also offers free access to templates you can use across your paid and <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business">organic social media efforts</a>. If you like what you see and want more features such as Brand Kit, where you can store your logo, brand colors, logos, and more in one place; as well as team management capabilities, workflow tools, and shared editing, you can always upgrade to a Canva Pro account for $30 per month for a single user. You&#8217;ll also have access to a greater variety of images, templates, and design tools.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/design-facebook-ad-creative-free-canva-1.png" alt="canva's facebook ad design template library" width="720" height="364" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://www.canva.com/templates/"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<h3>4. Facebook’s built-in creative tools</h3>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2017/08/22/facebook-ads-manager-vs-power-editor">Facebook Ads Manager</a> offers advertisers a number of free built-in tools and resources where you can easily develop creatives for your ads. In it you&#8217;ll find Facebook’s library of<a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/shutterstock-multiple-image-upload-page-manager"> free stock images</a> as well as their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/660433454318391?id=603833089963720" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Video Creation Kit</a>, which allows advertisers to create video ads by uploading images and animating them.</p>
<p>Subtle motion is a proven way to capture users&#8217; attention as they are scrolling in Facebook and Instagram and get them to stop to view your ad. The Video Creation Kit provides several free templates, including <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/digital-marketing/3-holiday-marketing-campaigns-you-can-start-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holiday marketing</a> templates for <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/13/sales-promotion-examples">special promotions</a>, and allows users to resize and edit their videos all within the platform. Some of these templates also allow you to add your logo, append overlay text, and add thumb-stopping special effects.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em>Via Facebook Ads Manager</em></p>
<p>According to Facebook’s July 2019- Sep 2019 study, one of the simplest, but most powerful tools to capture mobile viewers&#8217; attention is motion. Ads that contain lightweight motion outperform ads that use still images alone, 75% of the time.</p>
<p>To help advertisers create more <a href="/blog/ws/2016/04/25/facebook-video-ads">video ads</a>, Facebook put together a few options in their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/app-store/creative?">Facebook Business App Store</a>. They, too, recommend Canva, as well as Shakr, Boosted, and Vimeo.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/free-low-cost-facebook-ad-creative-tools-apps-adding-motion-1.png" alt="facebook business app store with apps for adding motion to ads" width="600" height="501" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Via Facebook Business App Store</em></p>
<h3>5. User-generated content (UGC)</h3>
<p>Do you have <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/ideas-for-happy-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happy customers</a> that share your products or services on their social channels? If so, leverage this content as it can often be some of the best converting ad creative. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/13/ugc-instagram">User-generated content </a>(UGC) is when customers endorse your brand by tagging your business in images or videos they share with their network.</p>
<p>Before you use any UGC in your ads, be sure to get permission from that user and give them credit (and maybe send them a little something) unless you are using an <a href="/blog/ws/2021/03/23/how-to-become-a-social-media-influencer">influencer</a> and your terms state otherwise.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/design-facebook-ads-UGC-vicidolls-1.png" alt="facebook ad creative with user generated content" width="600" height="388" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CQHabb8AF4p/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>UGC tends to drive more sales as consumers are more likely to trust a <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">customer review</a> than an ad from a brand. Maximize your efforts by encouraging UGC within your organic social community—encourage <a href="/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">hashtag</a> use for your brand so you can better filter through and find content to use, run contests, and get creative with it.</p>
<p>Apparel brand <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aerie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aerie</a> does an excellent job promoting its #aeriereal hashtag and encouraging their fans to use it, which in turn, gets quite a bit of UGC content for them to use. Not much truly beats a customer endorsement.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/free-low-cost-facebook-ad-creative-user-generated-1.png" alt="aerie user generated content on facebook " width="720" height="395" /></div>
<h3>6. Facebook Brand Collabs Manager</h3>
<p>If you are looking to partner with influencers for your ad design efforts, Facebook’s<a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/358181468896035?helpref=search&amp;sr=8&amp;query=branded%20content"> Brand Collabs Manager</a> tool helps advertisers find relevant content from creators and influencers on the platform and collaborate with them on <a href="/blog/ws/2016/05/23/facebook-ad-examples">advertising campaigns</a>. This is not yet available to everyone, so <a href="https://www.facebook.com/collabsmanager/start/group" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apply to join</a> the program to see if your brand can get in.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/design-facebook-ads-on-a-budget-facebook-brand-collabs-manager-1.png" alt="facebook brand collabs manager homepage" width="720" height="224" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/tools/brand-collabs-manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<h3>7. Instagram&#8217;s Branded Content Ads</h3>
<p>On the Instagram side of ad creative, advertisers can use Instagram’s <a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/branded-content-ads-on-instagram">Branded Content Ads</a> which makes it easy for brands to turn organic posts from other brands and <a href="/blog/ws/2015/02/26/influencer-marketing">influencers</a> that tag you, into ads. In order to use Instagram’s Branded Content Ads, advertisers must already <a href="/blog/ws/2013/06/21/social-media-influence">have a partnership set up</a> with the content creator.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/design-facebook-ads-instagram-branded-content-ads-1.png" alt="instagram branded content ads homepage" width="720" height="385" /></div>

<p>Whether you have one dollar or thousands of dollars to spend per day on your Facebook ads, keeping costs low by serving great ads is the name of the game. But what you <em>think</em> is a great ad may not actually <em>be</em> the greatest ad. With A/B testing, you can systematically nail down <strong>what the data says is the perfect ad </strong>for your audience.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="column">
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ab-testing-monkey-in-awe-at-perfect-ad-1.png" alt="facebook a/b testing on a budget monkey in awe at the perfect ad" width="795" height="466" /></div>
<p>But while Facebook A/B testing can help you to lower costs, you may be looking to lower costs precisely because you have a low budget. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re going to focus on how to run effective A/B tests in a cost-effective manner.</p>
<p>Read on to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why Facebook A/B testing is important.</li>
<li>How to carry out Facebook A/B testing the right way.</li>
<li>Types of Facebook A/B tests you can run.</li>
<li>Ways to save time and money with Facebook A/B testing.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Why Facebook A/B testing is important</h2>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2017/04/27/how-to-compete-in-facebook-ads">Competing in Facebook ads</a> means you can&#8217;t just set it and forget it. Once you launch a campaign, it won’t run consistently—you will need to check in on it, analyze performance, test constantly, and continue optimizing in an effort to see success. Here are some other reasons to run Facebook A/B tests.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Facebook is finicky</strong>. What works well for some time may suddenly shift due to algorithmic changes or, quite often, unknown or irrational reasons.</li>
<li><strong>Lower costs. </strong>With testing, we can learn, gain valuable insights about our audiences, find out what does and does not resonate with them, and lower our costs over time.</li>
<li><strong>Reach your whole audience. </strong>What may captivate one user in an audience may not with another, so it’s best practice to always run tests in your campaigns.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, our custom window insert client, <a href="https://indowwindows.com/">Indow Windows</a>, saw a dip in their lead volume and an increase in cost per lead for one lower-funnel ad set.</p>
<p>To see if we could <a href="https://www.akvertise.com/case-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improve performance</a>, we launched a duplicate campaign that optimized for awareness rather than conversions. <strong>Within two weeks, we raised their lead volume for this audience 1800% and reduced their cost per lead 94%.</strong></p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-a3Ab-testing-on-a-budget-case-study-1.png" alt="facebook a/b testing results 1800% increase in leads" width="800" height="92" /></div>
<p>While warmer audiences tend to perform well with lower-funnel campaign objectives, that isn’t always the case, as we can see here. Another added benefit to testing upper-funnel campaign objectives with <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/01/bottom-funnel-conversions">lower-funnel audiences</a> is that you can accomplish your goals at significantly lower costs (more on that later).</p>
<h2>How to carry out Facebook A/B testing (the RIGHT way)</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://adespresso.com/blog/facebook-ads-split-testing-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adespresso</a>, a good split test can increase ROI by 10x. So let’s make sure you know all of the steps of a <strong>good</strong> split test.</p>
<h3>1. Determine your goal</h3>
<p>The basic concept of Facebook A/B testing is to set a goal and then see which ad variation performs best to accomplish said goal. Here are some examples of goals you might be looking to achieve with your testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are looking to<a href="/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website"> <strong>drive more website traffic</strong></a> at a lower cost, test optimizing for <em>link clicks</em> in one ad set and <em>landing page views </em>in another ad set to see which can get you lower CPCs.</li>
<li>If you are looking to <strong>drive more leads at a lower cost</strong>, test out a <em><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/26/facebook-lead-ads">lead generation campaign</a></em> objective versus a <em>website traffic campaign</em> <em>objective </em>(where you are<em> </em>sending people to a dedicated lead generation landing page) to see which can get you more leads at a lower cost.</li>
<li>If your goal is to <strong>drive more video views,</strong> test out several video variations using the same copy or one video with several ad copy variations to see which one audiences watch a longer duration, according to the % watched metrics.</li>
<li>Looking to <strong>improve your CTR</strong>? Test 2-3 ad copy variations using one creative in the first round of testing. If the CTR is low (below 1%), this is typically indicative of your ads not resonating with your audience, so test new ad copy. If that doesn’t work, test a new audience. If your CTR is above 1%, test new creatives to see if you can raise it further to a healthy 2%+.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Determine your variable</h3>
<p>There are dozens of variables to test with your Facebook ads. We’ll go over variables in more depth in the next section, but here is the shortlist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Campaign objectives</li>
<li>Audiences</li>
<li>Optimization</li>
<li>Ad level elements (copy, headline, creative, CTA, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook20ab20testing20example20with20creative-1.png" alt="facebook a/b testing with creative as variable" width="800" height="429" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/facebook-creative-split-testing-test-and-learn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>For this example, let’s say our goal is to increase conversions and our variable is ad copy.</p>
<h3>3. Launch your first round of testing</h3>
<p>In order for us to understand which <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/29/best-facebook-ads">ad copy</a> variation is our winner(s), we will want to launch 2-3 ads that are identical except for the ad copy. If we test more than one variable, then we won’t know if it was truly the ad copy that made a difference.</p>
<h3>4. Use Facebook&#8217;s data AND your own</h3>
<p>As your test runs, check in to see how it’s going in the first few days. Make sure the ad set is out of the “<a href="/blog/ws/2018/09/13/learning-period">Learning Period</a>” before making any optimizations. What you may notice is that Facebook will somewhat quickly choose a favorite one or two of your active ads based on performance. But use your data as well to determine which ad(s) is/are the true winners.</p>
<p>If, for example, Facebook notices fewer impressions with an ad, but your data shows that it has a higher CTR higher or that it’s <a href="/blog/ws/2021/04/20/facebook-dynamic-ads">driving conversions at a lower cost</a>, keep it running! Again, use the data.</p>
<h3>5. Disable underperforming ads and move to the next variable</h3>
<p>Once you run your ads long enough to see how <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-advertising">performance</a> is going, disable the ad(s) that were your underperformers and then determine what you want to test next. Oftentimes, after testing ad copy, we will then test <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/24/facebook-creative-hub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creatives</a>. So we’ll apply the winning ad copy to each of the ads, but change out the creatives to see which combination of copy and creatives are driving the most conversions.</p>
<h3>6. Rinse and repeat</h3>
<p>Continue building with one single variable at a time. The more we test, find winners, and improve our performance, Facebook rewards us with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/16/facebook-ad-costs">lower ad costs</a>.</p>
<h2>What to A/B test in your Facebook ads</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, there are several different variables you can test in your Facebook ads. Just make sure that you’re picking the best one for the metric you want to improve, and that you’re only testing one variable at a time.</p>
<p>Here is a closer look at variables you can test:</p>
<h3>1. Campaign objectives</h3>
<p>Currently, there are 11 campaign objectives to choose from.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ab-testing-on-a-budget-campaign-objective-1.png" alt="campaign objectives you can compare with facebook a/b testing " width="800" height="537" /></div>
<p><strong>Lead gen vs traffic campaign</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps you want to see if you can drive leads using a lead generation campaign and another using the traffic campaign. We do this often for our clients that want to increase sales leads or want to <a href="/blog/ws/2014/08/05/increase-email-signups">acquire more email subscribers</a>.</p>
<p>What we’ve seen from testing this across accounts and verticals is that lead gen campaigns drive higher lead volumes and at lower costs, however, they tend to also have <a href="/blog/ws/2019/04/08/lead-quality">lower quality leads</a>.</p>
<p>On the flip side, traffic campaigns sending users to a lead generation dedicated landing page to complete a form there and off of Facebook, results in fewer leads at slightly higher costs, however, lead quality tends to be higher as people are more interested to learn more and leave the social platform to complete your form.</p>
<p>While this has been our experience, see how it performs for you and whether quantity or quality are your goal.</p>
<p><strong>Website traffic vs conversion campaigns</strong></p>
<p>Another way to A/B test campaign objectives is to see if you can drive more purchases or other conversions through a website traffic campaign versus a conversions campaign. Both can accomplish your conversion goal but in some instances, we’ve seen traffic campaigns <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/13/facebook-ecommerce-tips">drive more purchases</a> at a lower cost. Upper funnel campaigns tend to be lower in cost, so it may be a worthwhile test for you and an effective way to have your budget go further.</p>
<h3>2. Audiences</h3>
<p>Test various <a href="/blog/ws/2014/07/07/native-advertising-examples">native</a> and custom audiences in your ad sets. If your goal is to drive people to purchase a water bottle, some <a href="/blog/ws/2017/11/01/facebook-audiences">audiences</a> you may want to test are people interested in water bottles, another targeting people interested in a competitors water bottle company, and a third may be your customer lookalikes.</p>
<h3>3. Optimization</h3>
<p>Each campaign type has optimization goal settings within its ad sets. For example, if you use the website traffic campaign, you can optimize for link clicks or landing page views. Test an ad set that uses one of each to see which performs better for you. Do you want more people clicking to the site and getting tagged with the <a href="/blog/ws/2016/10/11/facebook-conversion-tracking">Pixel</a> or do you want perhaps fewer people but more interested in <a href="/blog/ws/2020/11/23/content-marketing-trends">your content</a> and allowing the landing page to fully load? Which one is lower in cost and can still accomplish my goals?</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ab-testing-on-a-budget-optimization-delivery-1.png" alt="optimization and delivery facebook ab testing " width="800" height="414" /></div>
<h3>4. Ad-level elements</h3>
<p>There are plenty of other options to test at the ad set level but let’s move down to the ad level as that too, contains a number of variables that can make or break a campaign and impact costs. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/07/facebook-ad-copy-examples">Ad copy</a> length (short vs long)</li>
<li>Headlines</li>
<li>Creatives (single image/video or carousel)</li>
<li>Calls to action</li>
<li>Landing pages</li>
</ul>
<p>Determine which you want to test at a given time with your various audiences and campaigns. Remember, don’t test more than variable at a time, unless, of course, you’re running dynamic ads.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ab-testing-headline-1.png" alt="facebook a/b testing example with headlines" width="800" height="377" /></div>

<h2>3 cost-effective methods of Facebook A/B testing</h2>
<p>We know that testing our Facebook ads will ultimately save us money and increase revenue, but it can get expensive. Here are some tactics you can use to test your ads economically.</p>
<h3>1. Run dynamic ad campaigns</h3>
<p>Manual testing of ads is great, but if you want to move faster in serving ads, testing, learning, and optimizing on a limited budget, dynamic ads are an excellent way to do this.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/10/customize-facebook-dynamic-product-ads">Dynamic ads</a> quickly and effectively test various ad level assets while also saving time and money. By leveraging the system to put together combinations of ad copy and creatives together for you, especially in your prospecting campaigns, can give you quick insights through this system-led testing option.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ab-testing-dynamic-ads-1.png" alt="an example of a facebook dynamic ad for facebook a/b testing" width="600" height="431" /></div>
<p>If you have a product catalog, set up dynamic product ads in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/11/16/facebook-remarketing">retargeting campaigns </a>so users that previously looked at those products and didn’t purchase, can come back more efficiently and complete their purchase.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>The Facebook dynamic ads feature uses automation to test different combinations of ad copy and creatives for you and will then serve those combinations accordingly. </em></strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>2. Test upper-funnel campaign objectives</h3>
<p>If you have a small budget, say $10/day, but your product or service costs much more than that. You may want to test upper-funnel campaign objectives that are less expensive to have your budget go further.</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, if you can’t <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/11/get-more-conversions">drive many conversions</a>, particularly for a higher priced product or service, a conversion campaign is not going to perform well and Facebook will charge you quite a bit.</p>
<p>Instead, try an awareness, reach, or website traffic campaign to re-engage with your warm audiences. While the campaign is optimizing for other goals, people can still convert if you add a landing page URL to your ad.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/facebook-ad-campaign-objectives-funnel-stages.jpg" alt="facebook ad campaign objectives corresponding to the funnel" width="720" height="309" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62080" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/facebook-ad-campaign-objectives-funnel-stages.jpg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/facebook-ad-campaign-objectives-funnel-stages-480x206.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>We implement this tactic quite a bit to cut down on costs or help clients find more success on smaller budgets and we often see higher CTRs and lower CPAs compared to some conversion campaigns.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>We find that upper-funnel campaign objectives help clients to test on smaller budgets, and often lead to higher CTRs and lower CPAs compared to some conversion campaigns.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>3. Use the ad set level budget</h3>
<p>Advertisers can choose from two budget setting options in Ads Manager, one of them being at the campaign level using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/10/common-facebook-ads-issues">Campaign Budget Optimization</a> (CBO) and the other at the ad set level.</p>
<p>CBO can work well for <a href="/blog/ws/2020/05/27/prospecting-strategies-during-covid-19">prospecting audiences</a> that use similar size audiences in the ad sets within, however, it does not work very well for small audiences, as we may see when testing smaller budgets or in retargeting campaigns. When working with smaller budget accounts, we typically recommend using ad set level budget so you have more manual control on how much you spend, how, and where.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>When working with smaller budget accounts, we typically recommend using ad set level budget so you have more manual control on how much you spend, how, and where.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<h2>How much should I budget for Facebook A/B testing?</h2>
<p>You can start with as little as $1/day. Yes, you read that right. Though, there are some caveats. It depends on your campaign type.</p>
<p>With top-of-funnel campaigns such as reach, awareness, and engagement, we have seen success in running ads and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/15/facebook-sponsored-posts">boosted posts </a>to various audiences.</p>
<p>However, if you want to test lower-funnel consideration or conversion campaigns, a budget that small will not do.</p>
<p>The smaller your budget, the slower the testing, learning, and optimizing will be. The more budget you can allocate, the quicker you can get out of the Learning Period, serve impressions, acquire performance data, learn, and take your next optimization steps.</p>
<p><strong>If you can, try to spend at least $10/day to start and as you begin seeing good results and as you’re maxing out on your daily budget, increase your daily budget 10-15% per day. </strong></p>
<p>If you scale too quickly, that can sometimes backfire if Facebook isn’t able to spend your budget that day and then it may lower the quality of your campaign, thus raising costs. This way, you can learn and grow without wasting money and scale forward.</p>
<h2>How to test Facebook ads on a budget: recap</h2>
<p>Facebook A/B testing is important not only because it affords us valuable insights and saves us money, but also because Facebook frequently undergoes algorithm changes. Let’s close off with a brief summary of how to run Facebook A/B tests on a budget:</p>
<p>The basic process of Facebook A/B testing is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine your goal</li>
<li>Determine your variable</li>
<li>Launch your first set</li>
<li>Let data accumulate</li>
<li>Disable underperforming ads</li>
<li>Clone the winner and test a new variable</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the best variables to test on a budget include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Campaign objectives</li>
<li>Audiences</li>
<li>Optimization</li>
<li>Ad level variables</li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to test your Facebook ads on a budget is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run upper-funnel tests</li>
<li>Test upper-level campaign objectives</li>
<li>Use the ad set level budget</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, if you can, try to spend at least $10/day to start and as you begin seeing good results, increase your daily budget 10-15% per day.</p>

<p>Facebook provides advertisers with a wide variety of advertising products. However, few are as efficient at driving sales as dynamic ads, especially if you work in ecommerce.</p>

<p>While dynamic ads tend to be more time-consuming to set up as they come with more requirements than a basic Facebook ad, don’t let that deter you. Once you have gone through the process of setting up your account, Facebook will do the legwork and future campaigns will be a breeze. Read on to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How Facebook dynamic ads work.</li>
<li>When to use them Facebook dynamic ads.</li>
<li>Tips and best practices for ad creative, targeting, and more.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What are Facebook dynamic ads?</h2>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s dynamic ads are an ad format that is designed to serve ads to users that may be interested in similar products, and to users that have already expressed interest in a product you are selling by visiting your website or app.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="5660635d-c368-44a8-a5af-77fd5b0a85e8" data-langcode="en">

</div>
<p>Facebook’s <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/digital-marketing/artificial-intelligence-shaping-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">machine learning technology</a> is incredibly powerful as it helps make it possible for their platform to deliver relevant product recommendations to users based on their interest, intent, or actions. Rather than creating individual ads for the multiple products a brand has in their product catalog, advertisers can upload their <a href="/blog/ws/2021/03/10/customize-facebook-dynamic-product-ads">product catalog</a> and Facebook’s system will determine which products to showcase in your ads based on the person viewing the ad.</p>
<h2>When to use Facebook dynamic ads</h2>
<p>While Facebook dynamic ads are most often used with the Catalog Sales <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/26/facebook-objectives">campaign objective</a>, they can also be used with App Installs and Lead Generation campaign objectives. With them, you can use two targeting options in the ad set level:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broad audiences of users who have not yet purchased a product from your brand or who have visited your website but have shown interest in similar products or services.</li>
<li>Warmer <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/04/facebook-retargeting">retargeting audiences</a> of users who have already shown interest in your specific products on your website or your app.</li>
</ul>
<p>When using the Catalog Sales campaign objective, Facebook will automatically set up your campaign to run dynamic ads. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/397103717129942?id=1913105122334058">Facebook states</a> that if you are sending users to your app or have “several apps you want installed, or products or services you want to sell or generate leads for, add your catalog att the ad set level, which will prompt dynamic targeting options under the audience tab.”</p>
<p>If you have more than ten products in your catalog that you would like to promote, dynamic ads are the most efficient and effective ad format to use. If you have less than ten products, you may want to set up ads in a more manual way using single image or video or <a href="/blog/ws/2018/05/21/facebook-carousel-ads">carousel ads</a> or test our Facebook Shops in addition to your advertising campaigns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="align-center" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-carousel-ads_0-1.gif" alt="facebook carousel ads" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="0bf98775-b651-4837-b3d2-518b36e739cf" /></p>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Facebook carousel ads (like the one above) may be a better option if you have less than 10 products to promote.</em></p>
<p>One of the benefits of using dynamic ads is that Facebook does the work for you because their machine learning system automatically selects the most relevant ad content based on user behavior, so there is no need to run manual tests to determine which products to showcase in your ads.</p>
<h2>How to set up Facebook dynamic ads</h2>
<p>As you begin setting up your first dynamic ad campaigns, come into it knowing that they do take more time to set up and require a higher technical understanding when it comes to creating a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1275400645914358?id=725943027795860" target="_blank" rel="noopener">catalog</a>. Once the setup process is completed and selected the products you want to promote, it will be easier and<a href="/blog/ws/2016/07/25/social-media-management-tips"> less time-consuming</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven’t done so yet and your account is new, you will need to first install the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/10/11/facebook-conversion-tracking">Facebook Pixel</a> in order to run dynamic ads in your campaigns. The Pixel allows Facebook to monitor how users interact with the products on your website. You will then need to create a product catalog of the products you want to promote across Facebook’s advertising network on Facebook, Instagram, the Audience Network, and Messenger ad placements.</p>
<p>When setting up your dynamic ads product catalog, you will need to include certain details such as the product price, location, and availability.</p>

</div>
<p>If you are using a third-party ecommerce platform such as Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce, Magento, or OpenCart, you can easily integrate it with your Facebook Catalog Manager by importing your product catalog using Facebook’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/365831587397584?id=725943027795860" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integration capabilities</a>.</p>
<p>If you aren’t using an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/18/ecommerce-tools-for-local-business">ecommerce platform</a> such as the aforementioned ones, you can manually create a catalog by uploading a data feed file or spreadsheet. As an advertiser, you will need to set up a <a href="https://business.facebook.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business Manager</a> account so you can assign your catalog to your business, to create a new Facebook business Page or connect your existing one to Business Manager, and then head over to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/commerce_manager">Commerce Manager</a> to create your catalog.</p>
<p>To begin <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1275400645914358?id=725943027795860" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creating your first catalog</a>, you’ll need to click “Get Started”, then select “Create a Catalog”. If you already have a catalog created, you’ll see all of them listed in your Commerce Manager. To create a new one, select the “+ Add Catalog” option. Next, you will select the type of inventory you’re selling.</p>
<p>if you select &#8220;Ecommerce products&#8221;, choose how you want to add them into your catalog by selecting “Upload Product Info” to manually add items or select “Connect Ecommerce Platform”. Make sure the correct Business Manager account is appended to your catalog, give it a name, and you’re all set.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>Once your catalog is set up, make sure you have the necessary Facebook Pixel Events and Parameters for your dynamic ads campaigns set up, and that your Pixel is connected to your catalog so that Facebook can show the most relevant products based on user behavior.</p>
<p>Once you’ve completed the above requirements, you can then create a dynamic ad campaign. In Facebook Ads Manager by selecting  “App Installs,” “Lead Generation” or “Catalog Sales” campaign objective as seen in the following “Create a Campaign” window.</p>

</article>
</div>
<h2>Audience targeting options for dynamic ads</h2>
<p>Once your catalog is set up and your campaign objective is selected, you will need to determine which audiences you want to target in your dynamic ads campaign. Facebook dynamic ads have two <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/01/facebook-audiences">targeting options</a> in the ad set level: broad audience targeting or retargeting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Broad audience targeting to reach new audiences that will have personalized ads delivered to them based on their behaviors, such as people who have shown interest in products similar to those you are advertising.</li>
<li>Retargeting to warm audiences of users who have previously visited your website or app. You can also use this option to run cross-selling or <a href="/blog/ws/2018/05/30/cross-selling-upselling">upselling</a> ads to these warmer audiences based on users who have purchased products from you in the past.</li>
</ul>
<p>“When you cross-sell or upsell products with dynamic ads, Facebook automatically selects relevant items from the product set you choose to show in ads,” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1604184966521384?recommended_by=397103717129942">states</a> Facebook. “For example, if customers on your website or app frequently purchase baseball bats and baseball gloves together, Facebook learns to <a href="/blog/ws/2018/05/30/cross-selling-upselling">cross-sell</a> gloves whenever a bat is sold.”</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="da734b6b-e765-4846-a218-810d203e13bb" data-langcode="en">

</div>
<h2>Dynamic ad creative best practices</h2>
<p>When designing images for your dynamic ads, it’s a best practice to showcase your products from a clear and aesthetically pleasing angle. Your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/29/best-facebook-ads">ad copy</a> needs to also be clear, direct, and brief—as most ads are viewed on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/04/23/mobile-paid-search">mobile devices</a> these days—and it needs to complement your <a href="/blog/ws/2018/05/15/facebook-dynamic-creative">creative</a>. If you have any special <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/13/sales-promotion-examples">promotions</a>, mention those, or focus on the launch of a new product line, seasonal styles, benefits, and details of your products that may entice your users to click-through and shop.</p>
<p>While more often than not, a “Shop Now” call-to-action button is used with <a href="/blog/ws/2021/03/10/customize-facebook-dynamic-product-ads">dynamic product ads</a>, if you are targeting broader prospecting audiences, perhaps something such as “Learn More” can be more motivating to click upon first interaction. For your retargeting dynamic ads, use a stronger call-to-action button such as &#8220;Shop now&#8221; so you can close the sale.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="6c265341-4c53-4963-9a8d-5a4b34efa4a5" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-dynamic-nordstrom-1.png" alt="​facebook dynamic ads nordstrom example" width="600" height="431" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>When it comes to your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/11/06/facebook-landing-pages">landing pages</a>, don’t link to general product pages or your homepage. Instead, improve your chances of a conversion taking place by linking a specific product directly to its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/06/01/product-pages">product page</a>. This will reduce time spent looking for a particular product that enticed someone to click your ads, and will help avoid any confusion or frustration that might cause them to leave your website or app without completing the desired action. Make it easy for people to convert and keep things seamless and intuitive, from your targeting to your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/29/best-facebook-ads"> ad copy</a>, creatives, and landing pages.</p>
<h2>Drive conversions with Facebook dynamic ads</h2>
<p>Whether your goal is to reach new audiences and introduce them to your brand and products, or to entice warmer retargeting audiences to return shop products they looked at previously, to cross-sell, or up-sell, give Facebook dynamic ads a test and see how they perform for you. Facebook’s system does an excellent job of serving these ads to the right people, and pairing that capability with your creatives and ad copy should yield you positive results.</p>
<p>And with the power of the Facebook pixel diminishing (due to iOS 14+ and the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/08/google-floc">deprecation of third-party cookies</a>), be sure to implement the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/06/facebook-conversions-api">Facebook Conversions API.</a> to ensure accurate conversion tracking!</p>

<p>Instagram recently celebrated double digits at the tail end of 2020 by turning 10. The visually stimulating and engaging platform may have been around for some time now, but it’s still far from maturity as it continues to evolve in new ways for businesses to expand their organic efforts into paid ones.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/reasons-to-advertise-on-instagram-ad-example-1.png" alt="reasons to advertise on instagram ad example" width="400" height="710" /></div>
<p>With over <a href="https://about.instagram.com/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 billion monthly users</a>, Instagram ranks second after its counter-platform Facebook, when we look at active users. As more users join the network and peruse their Feed, Stories, the Explore tab, and IGTV, its popularity and frequent new feature launches, there is great opportunity for brands of all varieties to get into this space and find ways to find success. After all, with that many people on the platform, your audience is most certainly present.</p>
<p>If the usage stats aren’t convincing on their own, and you&#8217;re still asking yourself if Instagram ads can work for you, read on to learn five great reasons to start advertising on Instagram.</p>
<h2>5 features &amp; benefits to reap from Instagram advertising</h2>
<p>The five key benefits of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/20/instagram-advertising">Instagram advertising</a> that make it a lucrative channel for many businesses are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ever-increasing opportunities.</li>
<li>Build a following for your brand.</li>
<li>Easily create ads.</li>
<li>Showcase your brand through Stories.</li>
<li>Leverage higher engagement rates.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at each one so you can identify if Instagram advertising is something your business should explore, and if so, learn how to leverage all it has to offer for maximum success.</p>
<h3>1. Ever-increasing opportunities</h3>
<p>Sure, there are many people on Instagram as we aforementioned, but what can we expect for actual growth? Let’s take the United States as an example.  Of the <a href="https://www.hootsuite.com/resources/digital2020-q4-update">140 million users</a> in the United States, Instagram saw an 8% increase in users in one quarter, spanning from Q3 2020 to the end of the year. Advertising in Western Europe? That region’s <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/instagram-s-growth-western-europe-will-more-than-3-times-higher-than-our-pre-pandemic-estimate">usage grew 17%</a> in 2020. It’s consistently growing and it’s safe to say that Instagram has a ways to go before getting saturated or outdated. There is still plenty of opportunity left for businesses to get in front of their target audience, to <a href="/blog/ws/2020/11/17/website-visibility">expand their visibility,</a> and to accomplish their various goals.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/reasons-to-advertise-on-instagram-scaling-audiences-1.png" alt="reasons to advertise on Instagram scaling audiences" width="800" height="521" /></div>
<h3>2. Build a following for your brand</h3>
<p>While people go to <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business">social networks</a> to connect with their family, friends, or to see what their favorite celebrities’ are up to, millions check out what brands are sharing. It’s not every platform that users actively do that. In fact, <a href="https://business.instagram.com/getting-started?ref=igb_carousel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">200 million Instagram users</a> visit at least one business profile each day. <a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/how-to-sell-your-products-on-instagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener">81% of Instagram users</a> also use the platform to research products and services. In addition, now that Instagram recently made shopping more prominent on the platform, <a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/how-to-plan-for-holidays-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">130 million users</a> tap on shopping posts every month.</p>
<p>This is your cue to step in and show off what you’re offering in a captivating, visual manner. If done right, brands can <a href="/blog/ws/2016/10/19/get-more-instagram-followers">build a significant following</a> and drive business from the platform, so don’t hold back. Develop a <a href="/blog/ws/2015/01/06/instagram-marketing">strategy</a> for the platform on its own but also consider how it will play in your holistic marketing and advertising strategy. Develop and use visually appealing and compelling content, and see how Instagram fairs for your brand and the <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">products or services</a> you provide.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/reasons-to-advertise-on-instagram-brands-add-value-1.png" alt="Reasons to advertise on Instagram brands add value" width="400" height="663" /></div>
<h3>3. Easily create ads</h3>
<p>If you’ve <a href="/blog/ws/2018/07/02/facebook-marketing-for-small-business">used Facebook for your business&#8217;s</a> organic and paid growth through ads, then it’s easy to further expand your reach and efforts to their sister platform as they are connected through Facebook Ads Manager. With Instagram Ads being integrated with Facebook Ads Manager, you can reap the rewards of most campaign objectives, optimization selections, and targeting options. Simply connect your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/05/promote-instagram-account-free">Instagram account</a> in your Facebook Business Manager business settings, then in Ads Manager, add Instagram to your ad placement targeting at the ad set level, if you haven’t done so yet and see how Instagram’s three ad placements—Feed, Stories, and Explore tab—can work for you. While IGTV doesn’t have ad placements on it, I believe we can expect to see one becoming available in the near future – so keep an eye out for that. Facebook has stretched into a variety of placements across its ecosystem from within itself to Messenger, Audience Network, and Instagram.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/reasons-to-advertise-on-instagram-placements-1.png" alt="Reasons to advertise on Instagram placements" width="800" height="524" /></div>
<p>If this will be your first foray into Instagram Ads, you can easily use creatives that work on Facebook, however, be mindful of specs so that you can make your ads look native to the platform and fit within certain video length limits, as they do vary across platforms and placements. If you don’t yet have images or videos that may be more Stories-centric, in that they are vertical and take up the full screen, you can edit your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/13/instagram-best-practices">creatives</a> in the ad level and crop them to fit the various placements until you do have more sizes of images and videos.</p>
<p>If you don’t yet have <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/03/28/instagram-video-ads">video ads</a> but want to make a more significant impact by capturing the attention of your target audience on Instagram, take advantage of the free built-in tools that Facebook has to offer. In the ad level, upload or select your still image and then use the Video Creation Kit for templates, special effects, and overlay text to <a href="/blog/ws/2020/12/22/visual-marketing-tools">give your images an edge</a> by adding some motion to them. Most features available within Facebook Ads Manager work on Instagram ad placements, too.</p>

<h3>4. Showcase your brand through Stories</h3>
<p>Snapchat may have been the first with ephemeral content, but it’s not the last. Instagram developed its own version after Snapchat declined Facebook’s acquisition offer and quickly surpassed Snapchat&#8217;s userbase. While <a href="/blog/ws/2020/12/16/instagram-stories-analytics">Instagram Stories</a> isn’t new, more brands continue getting into this popular placement and seeing great success. Currently, a <a href="https://business.instagram.com/advertising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">half billion people</a> are watching Stories every day, thus further emphasizing why it’s important to <a href="/blog/ws/2018/08/07/instagram-story-ads">add Stories into your organic and paid advertising strategy</a>. While it’s true across Facebook’s advertising ecosystem, it carries over into Instagram as well, that you can easily connect with target audiences that may not know you exist and that you could add value into their lives. By showing up in front of them, you can quickly captivate using Stories given the brevity of the content and then get people into your funnel. With <a href="https://business.instagram.com/a/stories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than half</a> of users saying they become more interested in a product or service after they see it in Stories, you might as well bet on yourself and see what kind of results Instagram Ads can bring you and your business.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/reasons-to-advertise-on-instagram-stories-1.png" alt="Reasons to advertise on Instagram stories" width="400" height="864" /></div>
<h3>5. Leverage higher engagement rates</h3>
<p>From what we’ve seen in our client accounts and from what we’ve heard around the industry grapevine, engagement rates are typically higher than on other social platforms. While that is the case, make sure your product images and videos are visually engaging and on-brand so they can help drive more purchases. One <a href="https://www.hootsuite.com/resources/digital2020-q4-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media team reported</a> that engagement rates are highest for photo posts, followed by carousels, then videos—which of course, will vary by the content promoted, your industry, and audience targeting.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/31/2020-ecommerce-marketing-trends">Ecommerce marketing</a> platform <a href="https://www.yotpo.com/blog/advertise-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yotpo reported</a> that people are 58 times more likely to engage with branded content on Instagram than on Facebook and 120 times more likely than Twitter. While engagement rates have changed since Yotpo reported those Instagram statistics in 2018, we have seen them slightly decrease over the years as more people join and upload content. Even if that may be the case for others, user engagement rates on Instagram posts and ads are still exceptionally high compared to other platforms.</p>
<p>To begin with strong engagement rates or to boost your existing efforts, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/13/ugc-instagram">leverage user-generated content</a>, or UGC. If you don’t have any <a href="/blog/ws/2014/04/28/user-generated-content">UGC</a> content yet, start a <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/20/daily-hashtags">hashtag</a> trend to encourage your followers to contribute and share it. In addition, ask questions in your posts and then put some advertising budget behind them to expand their reach and visibility to new audiences. Reach out to <a href="/blog/ws/2018/03/21/social-media-influencers">smaller influencers</a> and develop a partnership program. Once you have UGC content, reshare it on your account, whether it is someone wearing or using a product of yours, a <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">review</a> or testimonial, or anything else that people might share that relates to your brand. Some other methods of acquiring more engagement on your Instagram Ads is to <a href="/blog/ws/2017/05/11/instagram-giveaways">create a contest</a> to drive more followers and engagement on your contest posts, which you can also boost as ads. While the possibilities are endless, showcase your product or service in use so that prospective customers and avid fans can better have their expectations managed, as well as be more likely to convert for the first time or again.</p>
<h2>Make Instagram ads a part of your holistic social strategy</h2>
<p>Instagram is a decade old now, but it’s still a cool kid on the block that isn’t going anywhere any time soon. People continue to join and utilize the platform on a daily basis and for businesses, they continue to launch new features that keep our target audiences engaged—be it leaving comments or taking a stronger action such as converting. If you work in ecommerce, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-ad-copy">Instagram ads</a> can be a crucial key to your success as it is undeniable and currently the most shopping-centric social media advertising platform.</p>
<p>Consider Instagram as part of your overall <a href="/blog/ws/2021/01/04/best-marketing-strategies-2021">marketing strategy</a> to expand into this year to see if and how it can be a part of your funnel and help drive your bottom line. It’s not going anywhere any time soon as it continues rolling out new features for brands to find success from.</p>

<p>While Facebook and Instagram advertising work using the same Ads Manager, their respective advertising costs vary. With Facebook being around longer, having more data, and more ad placements compared to its younger adopted sibling platform, we do find that more often than not, Instagram is slightly more expensive than Facebook in some instances. While that is the case, don’t let it deter you from exploring this lucrative and effective visual counterpart in the Facebook ecosystem. With fewer ad placements, increased competition for impression share, you may pay slightly more to use Instagram, but you may also pleasantly see it being much more cost-effective than the results you’re getting with Facebook.</p>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-40642" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/instagram-ads-cost-instagram-ad-examples.png" alt="instagram ads costs: instagram ad examples" width="536" height="376" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/instagram-ads-cost-instagram-ad-examples.png 536w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/instagram-ads-cost-instagram-ad-examples-480x337.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 536px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Paid advertising is a powerful marketing tool on Instagram and complements what brands are able to do in their Feeds, Stories, and Explore tabs. While Reels and IGTV don’t yet have ad placements, we may very well see them added as placement as the platform continues to scale and the need for more impressions comes about. Like Facebook ads, Instagram ads offer advanced targeting and flexibility so as to be accessible for just about any business. If this visual platform is a popular channel for your target audience, you may want to advertise on Instagram. To help you understand the cost, we&#8217;re going to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>How Instagram ads work.</li>
<li>What makes Instagram advertising worth the price.</li>
<li>Factors that influence Instagram ad costs.</li>
<li>Average cost per click, cost per engagement, and cost per thousand impressions on Instagram.</li>
<li>Ways to keep your Instagram ad costs down</li>
</ul>
<p>Read on to learn about the workings, advantages, and cost of advertising on Instagram this year.</p>
<h2>How do Instagram ads work?</h2>
<p>Depending on your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/26/facebook-objectives">campaign objective</a>, ads appearing on Instagram can have up to 18 call-to-action button options, can link to your website, and give users options to download applications or shop online stores.</p>
<p>You don’t actually even need an <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/05/promote-instagram-account-free">Instagram account</a> to <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/15/why-advertise-on-instagram">advertise on Instagram</a>. Since Facebook is its parent company, all you need a Facebook Business Page. However, it is best to have an Instagram account so you can familiarize yourself with content that resonates best with your target audience and complement and amplify your organic Instagram marketing efforts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/20/instagram-advertising">To set up Instagram Ads</a>, use Facebook’s <a href="https://business.facebook.com/">Ads Manager</a> to set up campaigns, ad sets where you select your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/stretch-your-marketing-budget">budget</a>, target audience, ad placements, and optimization options. Similar to Facebook Ads, your ads will run within the selected time frame, budget parameters, audience selection, and optimization goals.</p>

<h2>What makes Instagram advertising worth the price?</h2>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/02/reasons-to-advertise-on-social-media">Advertising on social media</a> brings many benefits, and there are some particular benefits of paying for ad impressions on Instagram rather than simply running campaigns and promotions directly from your business’s account.</p>
<h3>Advanced targeting</h3>
<p>With over <a href="https://about.instagram.com/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 billion monthly users</a>, Instagram ranks second after Facebook. These platforms have an incredibly robust arsenal of targeting data and since Facebook owns Instagram, Instagram advertising utilizes the same comprehensive <a href="/blog/ws/2021/01/28/instagram-demographics-2021">demographic</a> and geographic data. This advanced targeting is what makes Facebook Ads work so well, as you can be incredibly prescriptive when targeting various audiences. Whether you are utilizing Facebook’s native audiences based on interests, behaviors, or other demographics, or utilizing your own <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/27/facebook-custom-audiences">custom audiences</a> that utilize your Pixel or SDK, email lists, or other sources, you can find success in reaching the right people in your <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/26/prospecting-strategies-ppc-agencies">prospecting</a> and retargeting campaigns.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-much-do-instagram-ads-cost-targeting-1.png" alt="How much do Instagram ads cost—custom audience creation options" width="800" height="470" /></div>
<h3>Higher engagement rates</h3>
<p>Instagram is known for its high engagement rates—organically and through paid ads. Images on Instagram receive an average of <a href="https://adespresso.com/blog/instagram-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">23% more engagement</a> than when shared on Facebook. When it comes to organic engagement, brands on Instagram say that they have about <a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/14-04-29-instagram_is_the_king_of_social_engagement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4% of their followers seeing their content</a> compared to the nearly non-existent organic reach that Facebook has today. While it’s better, it’s still wise to pay to play in order to expand your reach and visibility with paid ads.  While any form of visual content can perform well, brands typically see more engagement on video ads—<a href="https://mention.com/en/reports/instagram/engagement/#1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 38% more</a>. As a visual platform, images and videos are powerful in driving more engagement than on other more text-based social platforms.<br />
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40638" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-much-do-instagram-ads-cost-story-polls.png" alt="how much do instagram ads cost: story poll example" width="400" height="864" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-much-do-instagram-ads-cost-story-polls.png 400w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-much-do-instagram-ads-cost-story-polls-139x300.png 139w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-much-do-instagram-ads-cost-story-polls-46x100.png 46w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-much-do-instagram-ads-cost-story-polls-93x200.png 93w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
</div>
<h3>External links</h3>
<p>Instagram does not currently allow clickable links in organic posts. You can include a link in your caption or message, but the recipient has to copy and paste it into their browser or visit the link in your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/09/instagram-bios">Instagram bio</a>. With Instagram advertising, you can include outside links, which enables you to designate a destination URL to your website or another external URL. To be able to better track website traffic from your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-ad-copy">Instagram Ads</a>, it’s recommended to use your own domain as you should have your Pixel implemented there, whereas you may not have it on other website URLs that you don’t control.<br />
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40639" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-much-do-instagram-ads-cost-ad-creative-setup.png" alt="how much do instagram ads cost: ad creative setup" width="500" height="625" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-much-do-instagram-ads-cost-ad-creative-setup.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-much-do-instagram-ads-cost-ad-creative-setup-480x600.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Longer videos</h3>
<p>Instagram Feed and Explore video can be up to 60 seconds in duration and while <a href="/blog/ws/2018/08/07/instagram-story-ads">Stories</a> are typically up to 15 seconds in duration, if you run ads in these three ad placements, you can have up to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/video/instagram-feed/traffic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 minutes of video content.</a> This gives you more opportunity to convey both your brand and the features and benefits of your offer through your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">products and/or services</a>.</p>

<h2>How much do Instagram ads cost?</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the average cost per click, cost per engagement, and cost per thousand impressions on Instagram.</p>
<h3>Instagram cost per click (CPC)</h3>
<p>For all metrics, Instagram cost per click ranges from $0.40-$0.70. This takes into account all clicks that happen on an ad, which includes not only link clicks, but likes/reactions, comments, and shares.</p>
<p>For ads that have a destination URL, Instagram cost per click in ranges from $0.50-$0.95.</p>
<h3>Instagram cost per engagement (CPE)</h3>
<p>Instagram cost per engagement in ranges from $0.01-0.05.</p>
<h3>Instagram cost per thousand impressions (CPM)</h3>
<p>Instagram cost per one thousand impressions in ranges between $2.50-$3.50 for better-performing campaigns and their respective ad sets.</p>
<p>When it comes to CPMs, our findings show that Facebook tends to be higher than Instagram, by nearly 2x but CPCs tend to be lower by nearly half on Facebook compared to Instagram.<br />
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40640" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-much-do-instagram-ads-cost-per-click-by-placement.png" alt="instagram ads cost: cost per click by placement" width="720" height="563" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-much-do-instagram-ads-cost-per-click-by-placement.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-much-do-instagram-ads-cost-per-click-by-placement-480x375.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>

<h2>Facebook vs. Instagram advertising costs</h2>
<p>While Facebook and Instagram advertising work using the same Ads Manager, their respective advertising costs vary (see <a href="/blog/ws/2021/07/12/facebook-ads-cost" data-cke-saved-href="/blog/ws/2021/07/12/facebook-ads-cost">how much it costs to advertise on Facebook in here</a>). With Facebook being around longer, having more data, and more ad placements compared to its younger adopted sibling platform, we do find that more often than not, Instagram is slightly more expensive than Facebook in some instances.</p>
<p>While that is the case, don’t let it deter you from exploring this lucrative and effective visual counterpart in the Facebook ecosystem. With fewer ad placements and increased competition for impression share, you may pay slightly more to use Instagram, but you may also pleasantly see it being much more cost-effective than the results you’re getting with Facebook.</p>
<h2>Factors that influence Instagram ads costs</h2>
<p>Similar to other platforms, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/06/05/instagram-ads-cost" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/06/05/instagram-ads-cost">Instagram ad pricing</a> is influenced by a number of variables.</p>
<h3>Campaign objective</h3>
<p>Campaign objectives can cause your advertising costs to be automatically higher or lower, depending on which you choose and how it relates to where your target audience is in the funnel.</p>
<p>For example, if you select a brand awareness campaign objective, it will be lower in cost than something lower down the funnel and that has a higher value objective, such as conversions. Having broader, colder audiences see your ad to <a href="/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness" data-cke-saved-href="/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">drive brand awareness</a> is a lower-value action compared to targeting a user further down funnel—who are more familiar with your brand and offerings, and ready to open their wallet or take a higher-value action.</p>
<h3>Audience size</h3>
<p>If you are targeting broader audiences, they are typically lower in cost as there is less competition for a group of people. As you narrow your audiences, perhaps by reducing their <a href="/blog/ws/2013/11/13/adwords-geotargeting-local-ppc-guide" data-cke-saved-href="/blog/ws/2013/11/13/adwords-geotargeting-local-ppc-guide">geotargeting</a> or age ranges, you may see the price go up as competition for those eyeballs increases in parallel. Retargeting audiences are typically smaller as well, hence why we often see higher costs in retargeting campaigns.</p>
<h3>Budget</h3>
<p>Budget also influences Instagram ad costs because if you have a small budget, it may take longer to get out of the Learning Phase if your campaign or ad set is starting anew. Costs may be more expensive at first before the system learns and understands your campaign type and optimization goals, and how your audience engages with your ads. If your ads are well engaged with, Facebook and Instagram will reward you with lower costs over time.</p>
<h3>Click-through rate</h3>
<p>If CTR is low, then we may see higher costs as the system thinks there may be some disconnect between your target audience and what you’re messaging in your ads. You want your ads to resonate with your target audience and CTR Is a strong indicator of that. Aim for a healthy CTR which is about 2%. If you have a healthy CTR, you should see your costs decrease.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4da.png" alt="📚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite12SecretsToHigherCTR.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_PPC_HigherCTR_Download">12 Secrets to a Higher Click-Through Rate (&amp; Lower Costs!)</a></p>
<h2>How to lower your Instagram ads costs</h2>
<p>Make the most of your budget by selecting funnel-appropriate campaign objectives to start. If you are targeting colder, broader, prospecting audiences, test less expensive campaigns to introduce your brand to audiences with an awareness, engagement, or better yet, a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/17/facebook-click-to-call-ads">website traffic campaign</a> so that these users leave Instagram and get to your website and tagged with the Pixel so you can later retarget them if they don’t convert on that first click. If you’re new to Instagram Ads, you can drive sales from the first interaction and click, but more often than not, users will need to have several interactions with your brands in order to develop trust, perhaps do some shopping and comparing, and then come back to you through retargeting or other means to open up their wallets. If you have a low-cost product that doesn’t need much research, impulse buys can be successful from Instagram.</p>
<p>Another way to lower your Instagram costs is to use automatic placements in the ad set level and serve across both Facebook and Instagram. By having more placement liquidity, the system can use its algorithm to determine where to best serve your ads, thus giving them more options across both platforms and more ad placements, thus, lowering competition on Instagram’s three current ad placements, thus lowering your costs.<br />

<div class="column">
<div>
<p><span lang="EN">It’s no secret that advertising on social media platforms can be fruitful for businesses of all varieties. Advertising on social media platforms is important as there is more real value beyond what we can get organically these days.</span></p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/reasons20to20advertise20on20social20media20statista_1-1.jpeg" alt="reasons to advertise on social media statista" width="800" height="523" /></div>
<p><span lang="EN">From expanding your reach and visibility to driving the bottom line, this post covers five reasons why brands invest in social media advertising to reach their goals and scale their business—and why you might want to, too. They include:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span lang="EN">Reach new customers</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Low entry cost</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Gain audience insights</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Wide range of formats</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Accomplish more of your goals</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="EN">Now, these benefits can be used to describe a number of marketing and advertising strategies, but in this post we&#8217;re going to dig into each benefit as it relates to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/18/social-media-advertising">social media advertising</a> and cover exactly how it can set your business up for long-term success.</span></p>
<h2>5 benefits of advertising on social media</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Whether you are new to social media ads and are considering the investment, or are already running ads elsewhere, such as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-ads">on Google</a>, the following benefits may encourage you to diversify your efforts and incorporate more social media into your mix. </span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">1. Reach new customers</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Whether you’re considering <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/01/30/facebook-advertising-tips">running ads on Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/20/instagram-advertising">Instagram</a>, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/22/tiktok-ads">TikTok</a>, or Snapchat, social media advertising allows you to reach out to and connect with new people who may benefit from your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">product or services</a>.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Unlike intent-based, mostly keyword-centered <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/21/how-much-does-adwords-cost">search engine ads</a>, social media ads target users based on their interests, behaviors, and other <a href="/blog/ws/2021/01/28/instagram-demographics-2021">demographic data</a>. This gives us the advantage of introducing our brands to new users based on targeting and how our offers match up to those interests and behaviors. People may not know about your brand or that your products or services even exist and by seeing your <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/26/prospecting-strategies-ppc-agencies">prospecting</a> ad, they may realize that it could benefit their life in some manner or that they simply want what you are selling.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">2. Low entry cost</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Compared to traditional advertising, the cost is significantly lower and if you only have a small budget, you can still enter the <a href="/blog/ws/2020/03/24/goal-talk-episode-7">auction</a> and find success. Of course, the more you have to spend for ads, the quicker you can learn what is working and what is not, <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/24/google-ads-optimization">optimize performance</a>, <a href="/blog/ws/2016/10/27/facebook-ad-copy-tests">test more variables</a>, and reach more of your goals, such as <a href="/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">website traffic</a>, signups, and sales. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Most of the social platforms are in line with costs, however, from our experience, we’ve seen lower costs of about $0.13 per click on Pinterest, which makes it an excellent platform to run low-cost campaigns, especially to drive new inexpensive traffic to your website for <a href="/blog/ws/2018/09/04/facebook-retargeting">retargeting</a>. On the opposite end of cost, LinkedIn tends to be more costly, however, if your business can fulfill the needs of its business community through ads and if your audience size and budget are on the larger end, you can see great success there for the investment. As you can see LinkedIn can be a great way for <a href="/blog/ws/2019/10/17/b2b-lead-generation">B2B businesses to generate leads</a>.</span></p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/reasons20to20advertise20on20social20media20linkedin-1.png" alt="reasons to advertise on social media linkedin" width="495" height="500" /></div>
<h3><span lang="EN">3. Gain audience insights</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">With more<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/27/facebook-ad-targeting-options-infographic"> targeting options </a>available to us as advertisers, the more audience testing we can do, and then utilize social platform built-in tools to understand audience breakdowns and how they relate to performance. For example, Facebook breakdown reporting can share details about age ranges, genders, country, region, devices they use, and more. Pairing these breakdowns with your various audiences and the respective <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/05/social-media-metrics">performance metrics</a> can help you better understand which segments of audiences resonate with your ads and you can apply these learnings to update your ad set targeting and use that to <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/24/google-ads-optimization">optimize your campaigns</a>.</span></p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/reasons20to20advertise20on20social20media20gain20audience20insights-1.png" alt="reasons to advertise on social media gain audience insights" width="566" height="862" /></div>
<p><span lang="EN">One other way to gain additional audience-based information is to check out <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/24/facebook-insights">Audience Insights within Facebook Ads Manager</a>. Here, you can view a particular audience’s age and gender breakdown, relationship status, education level, job titles, location, device activity, and more. This tool used to be more robots a few years ago before additional insights were removed when Facebook had to make some changes to audience targeting options for the sake of user privacy and transparency. While it’s limited in insight, it can be helpful to an extent. </span></p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/reasons20to20advertise20on20social20media20gain20audience20insights202-1.png" alt="reasons to advertise on social media gain audience insights 2" width="800" height="602" /></div>
<p><span lang="EN">Another way to gain a better understand of your audiences and their preferences are to run <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/04/instagram-story-ads-polls">Instagram Stories Ads</a><span lang="EN"> with polling stickers. With these, you can get a better understanding of product or service preferences, they can help you gather insights for future product development and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/24/best-instagram-marketing-campaigns">campaigns</a>, they can help you understand a target audiences<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points"> pain points </a>that you can resolve, they can help start conversations around your brand and campaigns, they will increase audience engagement, and they will increase your ad engagement audience size for retargeting.</span></span></p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/reasons20to20advertise20on20social20media20poll-1.png" alt="reasons to advertise on social media poll" width="494" height="850" /></div>
<p><span lang="EN">By utilizing reporting, audience <a href="/blog/ws/2020/12/16/instagram-stories-analytics">insights</a>, and ad placement-specific features, you can gain valuable insights about who is best to target at <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/01/bottom-funnel-conversions">various stages of the funnel</a> and then cater your messaging accordingly. Additionally, take your audience-related learnings and apply them to other platforms to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/18/ppc-money-saving-checklist">save you time and money</a> as you expand your efforts while you better understand your customers. </span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">4. Wide range of formats</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">While <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/05/best-ad-platform">each social platform </a>has its own ad specs, placements, and formats, there are some common denominators across platforms. The beauty of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/30/social-media-advertising-tips">social media advertising </a>is that there is creative freedom and endless tactics and options to showcase your brand in the light you want. From static images to ephemeral and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/10/social-media-video-marketing">long-form video content</a>, from horizontal and vertical rectangular formats to square, utilize every bit of the ad placement space to increase your ad real estate space on a screen so the user focuses on you and it limits outside distractions from other ads and content. One format we have seen quickly take off organically and then with paid ads <a href="/blog/ws/2017/12/14/new-success-reports">across platforms</a> is the Stories format, which can now be found organically and in most instances as an ad placement, too, is on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Tik Tok, and as of recently, Twitter and LinkedIn. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">If you are able to use video creatives and formats to <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">showcase your products, services in use</a>, and your brand story, do so, as video content tends to be more easily digestible by users, typically more impressions are dedicated to <a href="/blog/ws/2016/08/03/video-marketing-ideas">video content</a>, it can help better manage user expectations about your offerings, and it can bring your brand to life. When utilizing video, also be sure to captivate your user in the first few seconds by putting your best foot forward, showing your brand, and make sure your narrative is fast-paced, to the point, and actionable. If you don’t have video content, use static images and apply one of Facebook’s free templates and special effects by using the Video Creation Kit in the ad level of Ads Manager. If you need creatives for other platforms, check into royalty-free stock image and video sites until you are able to <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/11/at-home-diy-video">create your own.</a></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Social media ads provide a wide range of advertising formats and through the various platforms we have available to experiment with, it can bring our brands and clients success through the various placements and mediums we have at our disposal. </span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN">5. Accomplish more of your goals</span></h3>

<h2><span lang="EN">Consider the benefits of social media advertising and diversify your efforts</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">As advertisers, we know that Facebook and its other platforms in their ecosystem, such as Instagram and Messenger, own a significant and larger portion of impression-share as typically, brands put most of their ad budget here. While Facebook and Instagram have robust targeting and keep prices low because of how vast their user base is, keep in mind that your efforts <a href="/blog/ws/2013/10/15/multi-channel-marketing">should not be siloed to one platform</a>. If you have the budget, diversify so that you can reap the aforementioned benefits across platforms in case something does happen.</span></p>
<p>To identify which platforms are right for you, you can learn about the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">most popular social media marketing platforms here</a>, or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/07/facebook-vs-tiktok-ads">compare TikTok vs Facebook advertising here</a>.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">Facebook is notorious for having a clunky advertising interface that will oftentimes throw invalid errors, disable without reason, and glitch. If they go down, as sometimes they do, we don’t want to be left out in the cold as brands and to depend on one network to drive new users into our funnels and to later retreat them to entice a conversion. Keep that in mind and take these benefits to heart in an effort to expand into other platforms. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Whether you are looking to expand into social for the first time or are looking to expand into new channels, consider the above benefits of social media advertising and test to see how and if it works for your goals and for your brand.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Reach customers based on interests and behaviors.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s affordable to start a campaign that can generate enough data to lead to optimization.</li>
<li>Gain audience insights to learn what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not.</li>
<li>Wide range of formats to fit with your brand, platform, and ad creative.</li>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While 2020 certainly threw us for a loop, and we don’t have a crystal ball on hand to predict exactly what will transpire in 2021, there has been a noticeable shift in frequent topics of discussion at our agency and among industry peers. Many of us are beginning to see early trends emerge within their own paid social campaigns and by observing others. Social platforms are continuing to scale given the influx of daily usage and the increase in ecommerce transaction volume this year, as COVID swept the globe and disrupted our lives in many ways. Having a strong digital presence through organic and paid means is more important now than ever before.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42004" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paid-social-trends-2021.png" alt="paid social media channels" width="720" height="405" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paid-social-trends-2021.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paid-social-trends-2021-480x270.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>Image via Interesting Engineering</em></p>
<p>As social platforms continue to grow and provide us with more placements, features, and opportunities, we can also take historical trends into account and infer with a high level of certainty what we are likely to see in the coming year. With brands pivoting quickly to establish a more strategic and increased <a href="/blog/ws/2021/05/17/increase-online-presence">online presence</a> through their social media channels, we can speak with confidence of what may be coming down the pipeline—and start to plan accordingly.</p>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/localiq-grader?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>Speaking of online presence, how strong is yours? Find out fast with the free LOCALiQ Online Presence Grader!</em></strong></a></p>
<p>So how we can align as advertisers and marketers on behalf of our own brands or for our clients as we look ahead to 2021? Let’s discuss three major paid social trends on the horizon and how we can get ahead of these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/22/digital-marketing-trends-2021">trends</a> to give your campaigns the best chance for success right out of the gate.</p>
<h2>1. Plan ahead for new placements on Instagram and more</h2>
<p>It’s only a matter of time until <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/2021-social-media-marketing-trends/">social media platforms</a> develop additional ways to further monetize, and that typically means by providing new ad placements. One channel that we can count on doing this is Instagram. With Stories doing so well ever since their launch to compete against Snapchat, we wouldn’t be surprised to see them open up ad placements within Reels as it is quickly gaining popularity as it competes against <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/22/tiktok-ads">TikTok</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook has scaled so much that they now offer a large number of ad placements within their ecosystem; however, when looking solely at Instagram, we currently only have Feed, Stories, and Explore, so adding in Reels ads to the mix would be a no-brainer. Of course, only time will tell, but begin testing out Reels organically for your brand so you can familiarize yourself with how your brand performs in that placement and how to develop visual content that captivates your followers. If, or more likely when, Reels ads launch, you will be better prepared with a strategy and be able to execute faster.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42003" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paid-social-advertising-trends-reels.png" alt="paid social trends: instagram reels" width="600" height="474" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paid-social-advertising-trends-reels.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paid-social-advertising-trends-reels-480x379.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Facebook is continuing to grow across their platform and Instagram as they look for more options to meet the heightened demand for impressions (especially as more brands went digital this year due to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog?category=166&amp;author=All&amp;camplink=covidresourcepage">the impact of COVID</a> on the economy and how people are shopping). As such, we may even begin seeing the introduction of ads on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/22/instagram-tv">IGTV</a>.</p>
<p>IGTV seems to have made a comeback after its somewhat lackluster reveal back in 2018, as Stories came out around the same time and those took off. Now, many brands are incorporating organic IGTV content by using the Feed to post shorter teaser videos and then linking for longer form visual content on IGTV.</p>
<p>While there isn’t yet a formal plan for ads in this placement, Instagram did unveil a beta program to select creators in May of this year so that they can begin monetizing their IGTV channels.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42002" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paid-social-trends-instagram-IGTV.png" alt="paid social trends: IGTV" width="720" height="405" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paid-social-trends-instagram-IGTV.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paid-social-trends-instagram-IGTV-480x270.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image via Sephora and Adweek</em></p>
<p>One great example we have seen is the athleisure company Lululemon running 20-minute yoga sessions with an instructor, so you too could watch and practice yoga for free. Of course, the instructor was wearing their apparel, and health and wellness are on brand for them, but they did not do a hard sell for their products. The goal is to engage users and develop a relationship with them by offering complimentary, relevant, feel-good content, that also helps with your well-being in real life. People that feel good also tend to be more inclined to purchase something that looks good when they see someone wearing it well on screen.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="align-center aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/202120social20trends20-20lululemon.png" alt="One great example we have seen is the athleisure company Lululemon running 20-minute yoga sessions with an instructor, so you too could watch and practice yoga for free." data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="1441338b-c478-465c-9d51-de29b5fe017e" /></p>
<p>Think of the types of long- and short-form content you can promote here. Test it out and see how it fares for your brand, and start having discussions with your teams and your clients about what ads may look like here, as we can most likely expect Facebook to launch in-stream video ads within IGTV in 2021.</p>
<h2>2. Diversify your paid social channels beyond Facebook</h2>
<p>While this isn’t exactly news, and many of us are already actively testing various paid social platforms, it now seems that diversifying where you advertise is even more important. Earlier this month, Facebook suddenly experienced a mass outage where ad accounts and ads were getting disabled without notice or valid reason. With <a href="https://financesonline.com/facebook-trends/">75% of brands paying to promote Facebook posts</a> and 93% of social media advertisers investing in Facebook Ads, it’s apparent where a majority of social advertising budgets are being utilized.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42001" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paid-social-trends-invest-in-ads.png" alt="paid social trends: eggs in baskets" width="720" height="431" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paid-social-trends-invest-in-ads.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paid-social-trends-invest-in-ads-480x287.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.corporatefinanceinstitute.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>Even if you are working with smaller budgets, go beyond the Facebook ecosystem and test other platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Snapchat, and/or TikTok. Do your due diligence about each platform in terms of their audience targeting options, design specifications, best practices, and associated costs. Talk to other advertisers about their experiences with those platforms, and come into them with an understanding so your expectations can be more closely met.</p>
<p>While Facebook and Instagram Ads serve us very well in terms of lower costs and vast <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/15/audience-targeting">audience targeting</a> reach and options, we should not put all of our eggs into one basket, because if their platform goes down, and on too many occasions lately, there seem to be hiccups, even drastic ones like this outage, and then where does it leave our business? If it’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/18/ecommerce-marketing-strategies">ecommerce</a> holiday shopping season and our ads aren’t running and we have no control, that’s leaving money on the table.</p>
<p>If you’re in the middle of a special promotional campaign or a time-sensitive <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/10/boost-holiday-sales-and-revenue">holiday campaign</a> and ads cease serving without valid reason, that will certainly leave you in a pinch. Talk to your teams and your clients and have back-up platforms to test and to drive additional conversions, regardless of how you define them, so that your brand doesn’t suffer at the hands of one platform.</p>
<h2>3. Invest budget in Pinterest ads</h2>
<p>Piggy-backing off of the diversification trend, you may want to look into Pinterest Ads if you haven’t done so yet. Joining Silicon Valley giants Facebook and Google, analysts say that Pinterest is in the “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/12/facebook-google-pinterest-to-lead-growth-in-online-ads-in-2021.html">top picks to lead 20% growth in online advertising in 2021</a>”.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42000" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paid-social-trends-pinterest-ads.png" alt="paid social trends: pinterest ads" width="720" height="377" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paid-social-trends-pinterest-ads.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/paid-social-trends-pinterest-ads-480x251.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>Image via Pinterest</em></p>
<p>While Pinterest is still up and coming, they are making strides in expanding their advertising platform offerings. It’s an excellent channel for prospecting campaigns, and costs are very low – about $0.13 CPCs from what our clients have seen this year – so if you haven’t had an opportunity to test this platform, regardless of your vertical, your audience may very well be there.</p>
<p>If you are in ecommerce, Pinterest should most certainly be on your roadmap for 2021, if not sooner, pending budget availability through year end. With the surge in digital ad spend and consumer purchasing over retail as a result of COVID, this is the opportune time for brands to get in and learn how this platform can benefit their <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/search-marketing-display-video/7-ways-drive-leads-and-awareness-your-local-business/">brand awareness and bottom line</a>.</p>
<h2>Strategize now for 2021 &amp; win in the long run</h2>
<p>While it is impossible to predict exactly what will happen in 2021 with paid social, we can take into account what we have historically seen large ad networks do in the past and where growing ad networks are heading by following similar growth paths. While currently most budgets and efforts are dedicated to social giant Facebook, it’s important to diversify your advertising efforts by testing out and learning how other platforms work for our brands, so that if anything happens to one, we’re not left stranded without any ads running.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering what channel to test out next and haven’t yet run Pinterest campaigns, I encourage you to give their platform a try as it is low cost, there are many opportunities to get in front of your target audience, and it’s not yet saturated with all the other brands, making it an ideal time to get in before costs rise and competition increases.</p>
<p>Keep a close eye on platforms, case studies, and feature launches, and start strategizing, so you can head into the year with a fresh perspective on the possibilities and opportunities that may be worthwhile.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With 2020 bringing us into uncharted territory as far as the economy goes, consumer behaviors and their buying habits have significantly shifted since the emergence of COVID-19. In August, eMarketer <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/majority-of-us-shoppers-will-turn-digital-holiday-shopping-needs-this-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that they expect total <strong>retail sales to decline by about 11%</strong> this year in the United States due to social distancing measures being in place, but that <strong>ecommerce will likely grow by as much as 18%</strong> by the end of the year.</p>
<p>With these predicted outcomes and with what we are already seeing in many of our own ecommerce social media advertising accounts, it&#8217;s clear that it will be crucial for brands to leverage social media this holiday shopping season.</p>

<p>In this post, I&#8217;m going to cover eight tips, best practices, and strategies to help you maximize your holiday ecommerce advertising success this year—with a particular focus on two awesome social media advertising tools for ecommerce: Facebook Shops and Instagram Checkout.</p>
<h2><strong>The data behind social media and ecommerce holiday advertising success</strong></h2>
<p>It&#8217;s not just paid social professionals who are claiming that social media will be the most important means of connecting with customers this 2020 holiday season. A combination of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/28/google-shopping-holiday-forecasts">ecommerce predictions</a> and conclusions from recent studies are backing this claim.</p>
<h3>Forecasted social media buying behavior</h3>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2020/07/covid19-holiday-readiness-retail-commerce.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a> by Salesforce on holiday 2020 predictions stated that &#8220;<strong>Social media will be the most important emerging platform for engaging with consumers.&#8221; </strong>The following are some of their data-based predictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to 30% of global retail sales will be made through digital channels this holiday season.</li>
<li>10% of mobile orders will take place on social media channels.</li>
<li>As much as 15% of mobile orders will take place during peak shopping days, such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Current social media buying behavior</h3>
<p>Also, the current behavior of consumers helps make the case for ecommerce advertising on social media this holiday season. According to Salesforce&#8217;s <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/salesforceresearch#!/vizhome/SalesforceLeadingThroughChangeDashboard/LTCHome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snapshot Research Series data</a>, 73% of Gen Z consumers have purchased on social media during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Radial, an omnichannel commerce technology platform, underscored Salesforce&#8217;s predictions in a <a href="https://www.radial.com/press-room/press-releases/retailers-get-ready-survey-shows-covid-19-impact-hasn-t-disrupted-consumer">study</a> conducted earlier this summer. Among 1,000 consumers surveyed in the United States about their 2020 holiday shopping plans, 66% reported that they will increase their online purchases this year, and 60% claimed that they plan to shop less in retail stores during the holiday season. In addition, the majority of these consumers said they planned to spend the same amount of money on gifts this year as they did last year.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>66% of consumers have reported that they will increase their online purchases this year, and 60% claimed that they plan to shop less in retail stores during the holiday season.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>It is with this data that we can feel pretty confident in investing our ecommerce advertising dollars into social media. As Salesforce puts it, &#8220;brands must break down the historical friction between inspiration and purchase.”</p>
<h2>How to use paid social for ecommerce advertising success this holiday season</h2>
<p>While these findings can be helpful as we strategize and launch our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/11/29/holiday-google-shopping-campaigns">holiday shopping campaigns</a>, we <em>can&#8217;t know</em> for certain how or how <em>much</em> consumers will spend their money this season until after the fact. What we <em>can do </em>for certain is get prepared, be in stock, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing/what-know-about-seasonal-marketing-strategies/">develop a holistic seasonal strategy</a>, make sure our websites and apps work properly, <strong>and use social to amplify our reach, purchase volume, and revenue.</strong></p>

<p>So how do you use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/30/social-media-advertising-tips">paid social</a> to enhance your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/08/holiday-advertising-best-practices-2020">holiday advertising success</a>? If you work in ecommerce, you’re in luck because both Facebook and Instagram have launched new features this year to help advertisers better utilize their respective ecommerce capabilities. For Facebook, it&#8217;s Shops and for Instagram it&#8217;s Checkout; and with these exciting new tools, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/ways-small-businesses-can-compete-with-big-businesses/">small businesses and big brands</a> alike can create seamless online buying experiences using Facebook and Instagram audiences. In this section, I&#8217;ll go over best practices, tips, and these new tools to help you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/08/holiday-advertising-best-practices-2020">drive more online sales this holiday season</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Prioritize mobile strategies </strong></h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://scontent-bos3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/10000000_295236984955519_1257610628743321202_n.pdf?_nc_cat=103&amp;_nc_sid=ad8a9d&amp;_nc_ohc=ToJ2sccF-1EAX_tVNVP&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-bos3-1.xx&amp;oh=0eaed57b9a55b20a7ef0b67d10c60462&amp;oe=5FADC83C" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook’s Holiday Package report</a>, since the beginning of the pandemic, an average of 72% of Gen Xers and 50% of Baby Boomers are spending more time on mobile as quarantines, shelter-in-place, and social distancing measures were enforced. These facts, paired with Salesforce’s forecast above that as much as 15% of mobile orders will be placed through social media channels this holiday season, translates to an increasing reliance on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/05/instagram-ecommerce">mobile-first ecommerce</a> for consumers across varying demographics.</p>

</div>
<h3>2. Optimize the user experience to prevent losing frustrated mobile shoppers</h3>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/insights/tools/holiday-season" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Holiday Insights Report</a> on last year&#8217;s holiday trends, 82% of global shoppers reported user experience issues when shopping online during the holidays. In addition, 32% of Baby Boomers reported that font sizes were too small on their mobile devices; 25% of Millennials claimed that content did not fit on the screen; and over 25% of all consumers reported that images were not clear. As advertisers, we need to optimize our Facebook and Instagram campaigns accordingly by creating mobile experiences that align with the way users view our branded content.</p>
<h3>3. Perform extra quality assurance checks to ensure engagement</h3>
<p>These are easily avoidable issues. Detect and resolve them now and plan ahead this season, especially before we get to peak shopping days. When launching new Facebook and Instagram campaigns, take the time with your teams or your clients to perform quality checks on ad creatives and your landing pages—especially on mobile. The devil is in the details when it comes to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/30/social-media-advertising-tips">creating effective, engaging social media ads</a>. Focus on producing an optimal mobile experience so that you don’t leave money on the table that your competitors will surely grab.</p>

<h3><strong>4. Expand your ecommerce capabilities with Facebook Shops</strong></h3>
<p>Earlier this year in May, Facebook launched <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/introducing-facebook-shops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Shops</a>, an ecommerce storefront, in an effort to help small businesses expand their ecommerce efforts. This was a very timely launch given the <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/01/cares-act-paycheck-protection-program">economic impact of COVID-19 on small businesses</a>. With Shops, it is now easier for small businesses to adapt to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/25/social-shopping">selling more online</a> and for their target audiences to discover and shop for the products they offer.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image via </em><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/introducing-facebook-shops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Facebook</em></a></p>
<p>Facebook Shops gives brands the ability to create a mobile-first online store that resides on their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/16/facebook-business-page">Facebook Business Page</a> and Instagram profile, and is accessible to users across both platforms. Businesses can use it to upload their product catalogs that Facebook and Instagram users can easily browse to save or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/13/facebook-ecommerce-tips">order products directly in the app</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Try Facebook Shops&#8217; design layouts</h3>
<p>Then in July, Facebook added <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/making-it-easier-to-shop-and-sell-on-our-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new design layouts</a> for Facebook Shops so that brands could feature single products or groups of products. The latest update also includes new insights via Facebook’s Commerce Manager, allowing brands to measure the performance of their Facebook Shops.</p>

<h3>6. Test out your Facebook Shop now, before the holidays hit</h3>
<p>As we quickly approach the holiday season, brands should test out Facebook Shops beforehand to get a better understanding of how it works. They can then later use it to feature popular products that <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-create-a-holiday-gift-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people may want to purchase for holiday gifts</a>. This will help give your products more exposure across Facebook and Instagram and create more accessible online shopping opportunities for audiences.</p>
<h3>7. Utilize Instagram Checkout to drive conversions</h3>
<p>Instagram Checkout was launched over a year ago to a limited number of brand accounts. Since then, it has been slowly rolling out to others and has become one of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/18/ecommerce-marketing-strategies">best strategies for ecommerce advertisers</a>. Checkout makes it possible for users to purchase the brand’s products directly within the Instagram app, thus, creating a seamless and secure payment in-app option. With the <a href="/blog/ws/2020/03/18/covid-19-google-ads-data">heavy impact on businesses this year due to the pandemic</a>, it was with great timing that Facebook announced in August that it was rolling out Instagram Checkout to all eligible United States-based business and creator accounts with a Shops integration – tying together the Shops experience with Checkout’s in-app purchasing capabilities.</p>

<h3>8. Leverage Instagram waived selling fees</h3>
<p>In addition to opening up Checkout access to more brands in recent months,<a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Instagram is also waiving its selling fees through the end of 2020</a> so that more brands, especially small businesses, can take advantage of the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/15/selling-on-instagram"> in-app purchasing feature</a>. Regardless of your brand, if you are in the DTC space, the waived fee is also a major benefit and is worthwhile to leverage this holiday season as it can offer you the opportunity to create a seamless customer journey from product discovery to purchase with little implementation cost.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for some inspiration for your Checkout efforts or to see some examples in the wild, head over to your Instagram app and click the Discover tab and then click the Shop link.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Historically, the only option available for diriving calls directly from Facebook Ads was through Reach campaigns, which worked. However, their primary objective did not necessarily focus on driving more calls. But as of recently, Facebook quietly launched a click-to-call ad option within Website Traffic campaigns, which now allows advertisers to fill their business and client phone lines with a higher volume of calls than ever before.</p>

<p>So in this post, I&#8217;m going to walk you through:</p>
<ul>
<li>A refresher on the &#8220;click-to-call&#8221; call to action for Facebook ad campaigns.</li>
<li>How to set up click-to-call ads using the Reach and Website Traffic campaign objectives.</li>
<li>Recommendations for which campaign to use to achieve your Facebook advertising goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested in driving more calls, read on to learn how to set up click-to-call ads using each of these campaign objectives to get your target audiences to quickly, easily, and affordably, call you.</p>
<h2>What are Facebook click-to-call ads?</h2>
<p>Before we dive in, let’s cover exactly what click-to-call ads are. Facebook click-to-call ads allow a user to click directly on your ad through their mobile device and connect with you by phone. This ad type and “Call Now” call-to-action button option have been available for quite some time through Facebook’s Reach campaign objective. However, the primary goal of Reach campaigns is to reach as many people as possible within your target audience and at the lowest cost; so these users may not always be the most likely to take the desired actions—such as<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/08/12/ad-ctr"> clicking the ad</a> to visit a landing page, calling you, or opening up their wallets to make a purchase—that we may see more often with other <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/26/facebook-objectives">Facebook campaign objective types</a> and optimization settings.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Speaking of Facebook Ad optimization, have you tried out the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-advertising">Facebook Ads Performance Grader</a>?</em></p>
<h2>What&#8217;s new about Facebook click-to-call ads?</h2>
<p>The goal with Website Traffic campaigns, on the other hand, is to drive the highest qualified visitors from your target audience to your website and at the highest quantity, compared to other Facebook campaign objective types. And not long ago, when while setting up a  Website Traffic campaign for a client, a new option under Destination in the ad level appeared: Phone number.</p>
<p>Before, we could only select a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/23/cool-landing-pages">landing page</a> URL or Facebook Event as the Destination for a Website Traffic campaign, but now, we have this exciting third option for Phone Call—in other words, click-to-call ads for Facebook Website Traffic campaigns. You can optimize for link clicks or landing page views just as with Reach campaigns, but at this time, you cannot optimize for calls. We will discuss the details and our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/20/facebook-ad-guidelines">guidelines for Facebook</a> click-to-call ads for each of these campaign types below.</p>
<h2>How to set up Facebook click-to-call ads using the Reach campaign</h2>
<p>If you want to reach the maximum number of people in your target audience with your ads and provide them with an option of clicking the ad to call you, using a Reach objective campaign to stay top of mind in front of your audience and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/16/facebook-ad-costs">at the lowest cost</a>, the Reach campaign objective is for you.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>When you set up your campaign, you will want to adjust device targeting at the <a href="https://hq.wordstream.com/s/article/how-to-create-a-facebook-ad-set">ad set level</a> next. Without doing so, the click-to-call option will not appear in the ad level once you get to setting up your ad. Head over to the ad set level and deselect Desktop and Connected TV from device targeting.</p>

</div>
<p>Once your ad set <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/01/28/facebook-ad-targeting">audience targeting</a> and optimization options are set up to your liking, let’s move on to the ad level where we will want to select to add a website URL for a landing page.</p>

</div>
<p>Once you select this, a call-to-action (CTA) button option will appear. Select “Call Now” from the drop down menu.</p>

<h2>Advantages of Reach campaign click-to-call ads</h2>
<p>Using a Reach campaign objective for your prospecting campaigns can help drive new people into your <a href="/blog/ws/2019/07/22/facebook-sales-funnel">funnel</a> by introducing them to your business and offering them an easy and low-cost way to reach out to you and call you.</p>

<h2>How to set up Facebook click-to-call ads using the Website Traffic campaign</h2>
<p>While you can certainly drive calls through Reach campaigns, we’ve found that in the short time that Website Traffic campaigns have now had this option as well, they drive more calls and at a great cost, too.</p>
<p>Let’s explore this exciting new option to drive calls by beginning with set up. First, create a new Website Traffic campaign.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="78b59ea7-979e-47fc-9ba8-893d7bd09448" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook20click20to20call20ads20create20website20traffic20campaign.png" alt="facebook click to call ads create website traffic campaign" width="674" height="695" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Next, in the ad level, you can (but aren’t required to) deselect Desktop and Connected TV from device targeting, just like we did in Reach campaign setup, in order to view and use the click-to-call ad type under this campaign. With Website Traffic campaigns, you can optimize for a variety of ad delivery options—typically link clicks or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/14/facebook-lead-ads-vs-landing-pages">landing page visits</a>—but in this case, there currently is no option to optimize for click-to-calls.</p>
<p>Feel free to select either, but keep in mind that we have seen more success in driving calls at a lower cost using “Link Clicks”. If you have additional budget, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/14/facebook-split-testing">test them</a> against one another to see which performs better for you. By definition, Link Clicks are delivered to people that are most likely to click your ads whereas Landing Page Views are delivered to people within your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/01/28/facebook-ad-targeting">target audience</a> that are most likely to click the ad, or load your website or Instant Experience.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>Once your audience, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/08/facebook-ad-placement-optimization">placements</a>, and optimization settings are where you want them to be in the ad set level, head over to the ad level and select the “Phone Call” option under the Destination area. Here, you wil select the country code from the drop down and enter your phone number.</p>

<h2>Advantages of Website Traffic campaign click-to-call ads</h2>
<p>If you are able to take on higher call volume, have more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/19/facebook-ads-daily-vs-lifetime-budgets">budget</a> for driving calls, then test a Website Traffic campaign objective with your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/01/facebook-audiences">prospecting audiences,</a> too, if it makes sense for your business and the length of your conversion funnel. For example, if you own a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/05/11/facebook-for-restaurants-during-covid-19">restaurant</a> and want people to call you to book a reservation when they see your ad, then use this. If you are a law firm, have someone call you for a free consultation.</p>
<p>On the flipside, if you decide to use upper funnel campaign objectives such as Reach, and you want to loop back in with them when it may be a more opportune time for them and they now have some familiarity with you, use a Website Traffic campaign with click-to-call ads to get them to call you when they are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/07/marketing-funnel">further down the funnel</a>. For example, if you are a realtor, use this option in your retargeting campaigns to encourage your audience to reach out to you when it’s time for them to buy or sell a property.</p>
<p>Testimonials make for excellent <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/13/retargeting-ad-ideas">retargeting ad copy</a>, so test some out in your Website Traffic campaigns and encourage your audience members to call you now as seen here in this click-to-call ad example from a beauty salon.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="806b1ebe-c859-4e42-ae40-13f8e7fab622" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>If you have <a href="/blog/ws/2016/08/03/video-marketing-ideas">video content</a> that suits your retargeting campaigns and complements the ad copy you have in mind as it relates to your goal of driving calls, test it out as Facebook tends to allocate more impressions to <a href="/blog/ws/2016/04/25/facebook-video-ads">video ads</a> over static ads. Give that a try and see if that improves your call conversion rates.</p>
<h2>Prepare for more calls with Facebook click-to-call ads</h2>
<p>Now that we are familiar with the two click-to-call Facebook ad campaign options, how to set them up, and how to use them, get started by setting up some of your own. Talk with your team and call center staff first to make sure that you can take on a higher volume of calls and still make it a positive experience for the prospective customer and for your teams. If you have a smaller customer support or sales team, start with a lower daily budget in these campaigns, whichever you choose, and assess performance from Ads Manager and your team to make sure you can optimize and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/27/how-to-scale-an-agency">scale</a>.</p>
