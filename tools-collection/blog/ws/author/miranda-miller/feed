										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bing Rewards launched in 2010 as a way to incentivize the use of the Bing search engine. Sure, it seems a bit like Bing is bribing people to use their search engine, but loyalty programs are pretty common in other industries.</p>
<p>With Bing Rewards, members earn credits for searching using Bing, checking out new features, and performing other tasks. As long as you&#8217;re signed in to your Bing Rewards account, you can earn credits while searching on any device.</p>
<p>Bing has steadily increased their U.S. search engine market share in recent years, climbing from 16.3% at the end of 2012 to 18.2% in <a href="http://searchengineland.com/bing-ends-2013-with-all-time-high-in-us-market-share-but-google-also-up-comscore-181876">December 2013</a>. By September 2014, searches on Bing accounted for <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Market-Rankings/comScore-Releases-September-2014-US-Search-Engine-Rankings">19.4% of all U.S. searches</a>. It&#8217;s a trend we&#8217;ve seen across our client accounts at WordStream, as well, with modest but steady increases in Bing search volumes.</p>
<p>Is it because of their Bing Rewards loyalty program? It certainly hasn&#8217;t hurt. But what are Bing Rewards and how can you use them? Use this table of contents to find the information you&#8217;re looking for:</p>
<ul>

<li>Bing Rewards Loyalty Levels: Member, Silver &amp; Gold Benefits</li>
<li>Earning More Bing Rewards Credits</li>
<li>Redeeming Bing Rewards: What Can You Get for Using Bing?</li>
<li>Bing Rewards FAQs</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bing Rewards: Features and Benefits</h2>
<p>The Bing Rewards program allows you to earn credits for searching on Bing, using new Bing features, or trying certain other Microsoft products and services.</p>
<p>Bing Rewards are tracked through a credit counter on your browser (Internet Explorer 7 or later, or the latest version of Firefox, Chrome or Safari), which appears in the top right corner of any Bing.com page you&#8217;re visiting.</p>
<div><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bing-rewards-getting-started.png" alt="Getting started with Bing Rewards" width="500" height="257" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>Alternatively, you can download and install the <a href="http://www.bingtoolbar.com/en-US">Bing Bar</a>, which has a Bing Rewards button and credit counter. Mobile users can also access Bing Rewards through their default mobile web browser.</p>
<p>Bing Rewards members can earn points for using Bing – consider it a frequent flyer program for searchers. It&#8217;s a tiered program, so more credits are available to upper level members.</p>
<h2>Bing Rewards Loyalty Levels: Member, Silver &amp; Gold Benefits</h2>
<p>Bing Rewards offers more perks to those who reach their higher status membership levels.</p>
<p>The first tier is &#8216;Member&#8217; and is the entry-level for new members. Members get credits for using Bing for their searches and for daily offers.</p>
<p>Once a Member completes the Welcome to Rewards tour, redeems their first reward and has accumulated at least 200 credits, they move up to Silver level. With the promotion, Bing Rewards Silver members get a 50 credit bonus.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bing-rewards-tiers.png" alt="Bing Rewards tiers" width="638" height="504" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>The highest Bing Rewards level is Gold, which members can attain once they&#8217;ve earned 750 lifetime credits and are performing 150 qualifying searches on Bing each month. Once a member reaches Gold level, they get up to 10% off their rewards redemptions.</p>
<h2>Earning More Bing Rewards Credits</h2>
<p>Bing Rewards offers members different ways to accumulate credits. Using Bing for searches on your PC gives you 1 credit for every 2 searches, up to a maximum of 15 credits per day.</p>
<p>As you complete the available Bing Rewards credit tasks, you&#8217;ll see them checked off in your dashboard and in the drop-down from your browser credit counter:</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bing-rewards-credits.png" alt="Bing Rewards credits" width="994" height="547" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>Other ways to earn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invite friends to use Bing Rewards and earn 100 credits for each friend who reaches Silver status (for a maximum of 500 credits).</li>
<li>Use Bing for mobile searches and earn 1 credit for every 2 searches, up to a maximum of 10 credits per day.</li>
<li>Complete the tasks in your Bing Rewards dashboard. This is where Bing posts special offers that are typically worth 1 credit each, in exchange for completing a task. For example, as I&#8217;m writing this, Bing is offering 1 credit if you use the MSN Food &amp; Drink App, and another if you explore Bing&#8217;s most popular features on a special web resource they created (see above).</li>
</ul>
<p>Bing also offers special rewards incentives and limited-time promotions. When these are available, you&#8217;ll see the announcement on the <a href="http://blogs.bing.com/search/tag/bing-rewards/">Bing Blog</a>.</p>
<h2>Redeeming Bing Rewards: What Can You Get for Using Bing?</h2>
<p>Bing Rewards offers three different ways to redeem your credits: Shop, Donate or Win.</p>
<p>The filtering options for rewards are pretty much non-existent right now. You can choose Shop, Donate, or Win, but cannot filter by retailer, price or any other parameter. Currently, there are only 41 rewards listed in the Shop section, but if the program grows, filters would definitely be a necessary addition.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bing-rewards-coupons.png" alt="Bing Rewards coupons" width="684" height="467" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>Not surprisingly, many of the Bing Rewards options offered are Microsoft products or those from their other brands, including Microsoft Store credits, discounts on Bing  and Microsoft apparel, subscriptions to Microsoft OneDrive or premium Microsoft Outlook, Skype credit, or Xbox memberships and gift cards.</p>
<p>However, other Bing Rewards currently available in exchange for credits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Points/miles for airline and hotel loyalty programs</li>
<li>Prints and photobooks from Shutterfly</li>
<li>Gift cards for Amazon, Applebee&#8217;s, Burger King, Domino&#8217;s Pizza, Groupon, IHOP, iTunes, Sephora, Starbucks and other businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each item available in the Bing Rewards Shop links to a product page with a description, image and price in points.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bing-rewards-egift.png" alt="Bing Rewards eGifts" width="881" height="256" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>Alongside the price for Members and Silver users, you&#8217;ll see the amount of credits required for Gold users to redeem the reward.</p>
<p>Using the example above, at 525 credits, that $5 Burger King eGift will take you 950 searches to earn over 64 days (as you can only get 15 credits per day and less from mobile search). Is it worth it?</p>
<p>This is where the special offers come into play. If you&#8217;re only using Bing Search to earn rewards points, you&#8217;re probably not going to see much value in the program. But check in regularly to complete the daily deals and you&#8217;ll accumulate points a lot faster.</p>
<p>Of course, if you don’t want the rewards for yourself, Bing encourages members to donate their credits to a worthy cause.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bing-rewards-donate-credits.png" alt="Bing Rewards donate credits" width="544" height="193" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>Bing Rewards lets you support the school of your choice through their Bing in the Classroom program. Sure, it&#8217;s a ploy to get their own products into the educational system, but don’t let that deter you – all the technology kids are doing it.</p>
<p>You can donate your Bing Rewards credits in increments of 50, earmarked for a school of your choice. Once that school has accumulated 30,000 credits, the school receives a shiny, new Surface 32GB tablet with a black Type cover.</p>
<p>Like Bing Rewards itself, this program is only available in the U.S. You can check and see if your child&#8217;s school has earned any donated credits or tablets by visiting <a href="http://bing.com/findyourschool">bing.com/findyourschool</a>. It will take forever to accomplish this on your own, but Bing points out on the reward page that 60 parents participating in Bing Rewards for just a month could earn enough for a Surface tablet for their school. In one year, they say, 125 parents participating in Bing Rewards could earn tablets for an entire classroom. Once your school has 30,000 credits, Microsoft will send out the tablet within 60 days.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bing-rewards-donate-organizations.png" alt="Bing Rewards donate to charity" width="772" height="531" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>Currently, there are five other options for Bing Rewards users who are feeling generous and want to use their credits to help others. The redemption of 100 credits results in a donation of $1 for Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America, Kids in Need Foundation or Teach for America. It can also get you a $ Charity Impact Card. Redeem 500 of your Bing Rewards credits for a $5 gift card from the Network for Good, enabling you to send your donation to any one of 1.2 million charities.</p>
<p>Not feeling altruistic today? That&#8217;s alright – you can use your credits in Bing Rewards sweepstakes for chances to win cool prizes, instead.</p>
<p>The selection under the Win tab is pretty slim right now, but watch for new sweepstakes as Bing Rewards are updated.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bing-rewards-video-games-halo.png" alt="Bing Rewards prize packs" width="578" height="412" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>Currently, there are a total of 8 Bing Rewards sweepstakes options, but only four prize packs. Each one has two different points level options; for example, you can choose to redeem 40 credits (35 for Gold members) for 10 entries to the Microsoft Band sweepstakes, or 20 credits (15 for Gold members) for 1 entry.</p>
<p>The prizes currently offered are the Microsoft Band, three $500 Nordstrom&#8217;s gift cards, three Assassin&#8217;s Creed Xbox One prize packs, and a Halo: Spartan Strike for Windows prize pack.</p>

<h2>Bing Rewards FAQs</h2>
<p>Still on the fence? Here are answers to some common questions about Bing Rewards:</p>
<p><strong>Are Bing Rewards worth it?</strong></p>
<p>Bing has made it pretty simple to participate in their rewards program, whether you&#8217;re on a desktop or mobile device. If you&#8217;re using Bing on a regular basis anyway, it can&#8217;t hurt to earn credits for it. It will take a hella-long time to get anywhere unless you take advantage of the credits promotions, so watch for those regularly.</p>
<p><strong>How do I sign up for Bing Rewards?</strong></p>
<p>You used to be able to sign in with your Facebook account, but Microsoft and Facebook must have fallen out of love because that option has been phased out. Bing Rewards users can only use their Facebook account to login until February 15, 2015. After that, you&#8217;ll need a Microsoft account. <a href="http://bing.com/rewards">Navigate over to Bing Rewards to get started</a>. Remember, it&#8217;s only open to U.S. residents and even then, Americans can&#8217;t earn or redeem credits while traveling abroad (unless they&#8217;re using a proxy server, shhh).</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll have to give your phone number so Bing Rewards can verify the account and VOIP numbers aren&#8217;t permitted.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m searching but not earning credits – what&#8217;s up with that?</strong></p>
<p>Make you haven&#8217;t accidentally signed out. It&#8217;s also possible that you might be over your daily limit for offers. If you&#8217;ve made sure you aren&#8217;t using In-Private browsing, you&#8217;re signed in and you haven&#8217;t exceeded your quota, contact <a href="http://bing.com/rewards/contact">Bing Rewards Support</a> for help.</p>
<p><strong>Who can use Bing Rewards?</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who lives in the United States, is 13 or older, and has a Microsoft account. Each person can have only one account and must provide their real first and last name, complete mailing address (PO boxes are not allowed), a working phone number and their email address.</p>
<h2>Get Started with Bing Rewards</h2>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bing-rewards-banner.jpg" alt="Bing Rewards" width="1366" height="432" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>Ready to give Bing Rewards a shot? It can&#8217;t hurt – browse through the available rewards first and set a goal to earn enough credits to get it (you can do this with the handy goal button on each reward page). See how long it takes!</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Offers can be an incredibly effective conversion tool, and within the next few weeks, all Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords) advertisers will be able to highlight them in their search ads. Google is rolling out a <a href="http://adwords.blogspot.com/2014/09/call-out-what-matters-most-to-your.html">new ad extension called Callouts</a> that enables you to add more text to your ad to spotlight free shipping, discounts, price matching and more.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adwords-callout-extensions-2-1.png" alt="ads extensions for software companies" width="960" height="264" /></div>
<p>Callout extensions are similar to <a href="/blog/ws/2013/07/31/enhanced-sitelinks-guide">sitelinks</a>, but without the links. Google recommends that advertisers use callout extensions to draw attention to <a href="/blog/ws/2014/04/07/unique-selling-proposition">unique selling points</a> and important product details and benefits. You can feature up to four callouts in your ad, each limited to 25 characters each, and must have at least two callouts for them to display.</p>
<p>Callout extensions can be used with other ad formats, like sitelinks, and are created, scheduled and managed within the Ad Extensions tab. You can add callouts at the account, campaign or ad group level, allowing you to use general information at the account or campaign level and specific callouts for each ad group.</p>
<h2>Why Use Callout Extensions?</h2>
<p>Why not? The use of extensions improves the performance of your ads (including <a href="/click-through-rate">click-through rate</a>) and gives you an opportunity to stand out with specific messaging in the search results. Bonus: it doesn’t cost any extra.</p>
<p>Here are a few different reason you should try using callouts:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can promote popular or unique selling points.</li>
<li>Using extensions is an <a href="/blog/ws/2013/10/24/adwords-ad-rank-algorithm">Ad Rank</a> calculation factor and can help your ads appear in higher positions.</li>
<li>You can add them at different levels (account, campaign or ad group) to highlight generic or specific information.</li>
<li>Google offers customized callouts <a href="/blog/ws/2014/08/18/mobile-ad-strategies">optimized for mobile</a> and you can change your messaging to reflect that, or opt out of displaying on specific devices.</li>
<li>You can edit your callouts across the account, campaign or ad group without having to edit each ad.</li>
<li>You can choose the dates, days of the week and time of day for your callouts to display with your ads.</li>
</ul>
<p>Google has made it fairly simple to at least give callouts a try; you can see how many clicks occurred when callouts displayed on your ads and compare summary statistics at the account, campaign or ad group level. You can also edit your callouts without resetting their performance stats.</p>
<h2>Callout Extension Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>
<p>If you decide to give callout extensions a go, keep these things in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Callout extensions are available only</strong> for &#8220;Search Network Only&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="/blog/ws/2014/02/05/search-network-with-display-select">Search Network with Display Select</a>&#8221; campaigns.</li>
<li><strong>You are not allowed to duplicate text in callouts.</strong> This means you can&#8217;t have repetitive text in callouts at the account, campaign and ad group levels, i.e. &#8220;Free shipping&#8221; at the account and campaign level. It also means you can&#8217;t use text in your callout that appears elsewhere in the ad text. &#8220;Customer service&#8221; and &#8220;Customer support&#8221; would be considered repetitive.</li>
<li><strong>Google will generally show your highest performing</strong> <strong>and most useful combination</strong> of extensions and formats, so while you don&#8217;t have control over what shows up where, you don&#8217;t have to guess at which extensions will have the greatest impact on your CTR.</li>
<li><strong>You cannot use <a href="/blog/ws/2014/06/06/dynamic-keyword-insertion-case-study">dynamic keyword insertion</a> </strong>for your callouts text.</li>
<li><strong>Callout text and the content the ad points to must be family-safe </strong>and cannot contain adult content.</li>
<li><strong>You can&#8217;t use gimmicky symbols or emoticons in callouts</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Keep callout text short</strong>; Google recommends a maximum of 12-15 characters per callout, even though the hard limit is 25.</li>
<li><strong>Use sentence case </strong>rather than title case, e.g. “Free shipping” not “Free Shipping.” Google says they have seen better results in testing with sentence case.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Started with Callout Extensions</h2>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t cost anything extra to add callouts to your ads; you&#8217;ll still pay simply for costs per click.</p>
<p>All callout extensions are created within the ad extensions tab in the View: Callout extensions dropdown menu option. There, you can edit existing callouts or create new ones. Simply add the new callout text, choose your device and scheduling preferences, and hit save.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/create-adwords-callout-extension-1.png" alt="create callout extension" width="868" height="572" /></div>
<p>You can choose &#8220;Disable callouts&#8221; if at any point you want to remove ad group-level callouts and hide the campaign callouts for a specific ad group.</p>

</div>
<p>Google AdWords My Client Center (MCC) users have one more accounts management feature to love. Over the weekend, Google announced the rollout of AdWords Consolidated Billing, enabling agencies to combine multiple account invoices into a single one.</p>
<p>Consolidated billing will also allow account managers to create, fund and manage AdWords budgets for new or existing accounts in the interface, without having to contact support. New invoice structuring options enable you to combine everything in one invoice, or create multiple invoices based on segmentation by brand, location, division, etc.</p>
<p>Another improvement is the addition of email delivery for invoices. Users can now choose to have invoices emailed, or download them at the beginning of the month. Previously, download and regular mail were the only options.</p>
<p>Agencies and large brand clients are sure to appreciate the enhanced features and greater control in Consolidated Billing, which is phasing out the Standard (ALO/MDO) billing process.</p>
<p>This latest upgrade to the AdWords My Client Center comes just months after Google took <a href="/blog/ws/2014/05/06/adwords-scripts-for-mcc">AdWords Scripts for MCC out of beta</a>, giving agencies the ability to run scripts across an entire MCC.</p>
<p>The rollout has started and will continue throughout the year until consolidated billing is available to all AdWords MCC accounts. What do you have to do to get it? Wait patiently. Users <a href="https://www.en.adwords-community.com/t5/Billing/AdWords-Consolidated-Billing-for-Agencies/m-p/390765">will receive a notification</a> once their account has been upgraded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yahoo&#8217;s Gemini marketplace for mobile and <a href="/blog/ws/2014/07/07/native-advertising-examples">native ads</a> launched in February and is now the default audience option in the Yahoo self-serve advertising manager. But what is Gemini and how does it work?</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/what-is-yahoo-gemini-1.jpg" alt="what is yahoo gemini" width="571" height="366" /></div>
<p><a href="http://yahoo.tumblr.com/post/72591025021/introducing-the-new-yahoo-advertising">Yahoo Ad Manager</a> launched in January as a simplified platform for advertisers to buy and manage native ad products like Stream Ads, Image Ads and sponsored Tumblr posts. Gemini was added to leverage the power of mobile and native advertising together; their native ads are optimized for tablet and mobile devices.</p>
<p>Yahoo Gemini powers native ads that put sponsored brand content in front of Yahoo&#8217;s 400 million monthly users in contextually relevant ways.</p>
<h2>But First…Why Native Ads?</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re not yet familiar with the format, <a href="/blog/ws/2013/06/04/native-advertising">native advertising</a> is the increasingly popular method of reaching audiences with contextual messaging that appears alongside – or in-stream with – editorial content. Some describe it as a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media-network-outbrain-partner-zone/native-advertising-quality-scalability">subset</a> of content marketing; others as content&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://yahoo.tumblr.com/post/77199231544/introducing-yahoo-gemini">sponsored twin</a>.&#8221;</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/yahoo-gemini-native-ads-1.png" alt="yahoo gemini native ad network" width="511" height="451" /></div>
<p>Whatever your definition, native advertising has proven incredibly effective, especially against more traditional web advertising formats. A <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2013/05/03/study-shows-native-ads-outperform-banners-mostly/">Sharethrough study</a>, for example, found that people were 25% more likely to look at native ads than banner ads and viewed them 53% more frequently. Participants in that study were also more likely to share native ads with their contacts and demonstrated greater purchase intent after viewing them, compared to other types of ads. In the U.S., almost three-quarters of publishers already <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/How-Native-Ad-Campaigns-Shaping-Up/1010064">offer native advertising</a> on their sites.</p>
<p>In their presentation <a href="https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/us/ccs/b2b/Yahoo_Gemini_Webinar_Series_-_Part_3_-_Yahoo_Gemini_Vision_and_Impact.pdf">Yahoo Gemini Vision &amp; Impact</a>, Yahoo shares a number of other stats on native advertising:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perceived effectiveness is fueling marketer investment in native ads, up from $1.4B in 2012 to $3.1B in 2014.</li>
<li>Only 4% of marketers say they&#8217;re completely satisfied with their mobile ad campaigns.</li>
<li>95% of digital advertising pros buy mobile ads.</li>
<li>Investment in native ads is expected to rise to $5B a year by 2017.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite their omnipresence and enthusiasm among advertisers, 85% of consumers have <a href="http://aytm.com/blog/daily-survey-results/native-advertising-survey/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=native-advertising-survey">never even heard</a> of native ads.  The FTC has been clear in <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2013/12/ftc-announces-agenda-panelists-native-advertising-workshop">their position</a> on clearly marketing native advertisements as such, yet only 79% of advertisers understand that native content must be identified as advertisements. Clearly, it&#8217;s a format with opportunity, yet there is much to be learned.</p>
<h2>What Is Yahoo Gemini?</h2>
<p>Yahoo&#8217;s Gemini offering helps advertisers reach mobile consumers in a contextually relevant, effective way: through native ads tailored for mobile. It&#8217;s a marketplace worth considering; Yahoo has more than <a href="http://moneymorning.com/2014/04/15/how-to-play-yahoo-nasdaq-yhoo-stock-after-earnings/">430 million</a> monthly mobile users who average <a href="https://advertising.yahoo.com/Advertisers/Mobile/index.htm">104 minutes per month</a>.</p>
<p>Where Google consolidated desktop and tablet paid search with the <a href="/blog/ws/2017/09/08/how-to-write-an-introduction">introduction</a> of <a href="/blog/ws/2013/07/10/enhanced-campaigns-faq">Enhanced Campaigns</a>, Yahoo is offering advertisers the ability to manage mobile and tablet ads from a separate interface with Gemini. This is an opportunity to get more granular with your search strategy.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/yahoo-gemini-1.jpg" alt="yahoo gemini" width="526" height="419" /></div>
<p>Image from <a href="https://help.yahoo.com/adv/index?page=content&amp;id=SOL2151&amp;actp=search&amp;viewlocale=en_US&amp;searchid=1398653136753&amp;locale=en_US&amp;y=PROD_YAM">Yahoo</a></p>
<p>Gemini advertisers have targeting options including geotargeting, broad and exact match, and <a href="/blog/ws/2014/03/04/negative-keyword-list">negative keywords</a>. They plan to offer sitelink, location and call extensions; phrase match; day parting; and device, language, radius and operating system targeting in the future.</p>
<p>Currently, Yahoo is in the process of <a href="http://www.adotas.com/2014/03/spotlight-on-search-yahoo-gemini-vs-google-enhanced-campaigns/">rolling the ads out</a> to greater audience segments. In March, just 1% of mobile search traffic would see Gemini ads, though they planned to increase in April and beyond. Yahoo plans to have all accounts migrated and set up in Gemini by April 30.</p>
<p>Yahoo&#8217;s native ads appear on the Yahoo homepage and in the following Yahoo products: Mail, Mobile Search, News, Sports, Finance, Celebrity, Movies, TV, Music, Travel, Homes, Autos and My Yahoo. Ads automatically adapt to the device type, whether computer, mobile or tablet.</p>
<h2>How Does Gemini Work With Bing Ads?</h2>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t. Currently, Bing Ads campaigns are incompatible with Gemini, which is proprietary to Yahoo and built on a separate codebase.</p>
<p>Bing offered this explanation of the impact of Yahoo Gemini on Bing Ads:</p>
<p>&#8220;Bing Ads provides search ads on all devices, including mobile devices, across Bing and Yahoo search results pages, as well as our network of partner sites. Only a portion of search ads on Yahoo’s mobile search pages will be provided by Yahoo Gemini instead of Bing Ads. Bing Ads remains the only platform for purchasing mobile search ads on Bing and its network of partner sites and also delivers search ads on the highest performing mobile search placements (i.e., topmost on page) for web searches on Yahoo’s mobile search pages.&#8221;</p>
<p>In case that wasn&#8217;t clear, <a href="http://advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile-gemini-faq">Bing&#8217;s FAQ page on Gemini</a> also says,</p>
<p>&#8220;Bing Ads is the only unified platform for advertisers to manage paid search advertising across all devices including PC, tablet and mobile devices, in order to achieve scale across the entire Yahoo Bing Network.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.adotas.com/2014/03/spotlight-on-search-yahoo-gemini-vs-google-enhanced-campaigns/">Adotas</a>, Gemini ads will appear on more partner sites over time, while Yahoo will work to create parity between Yahoo Search Ads and Bing Ads.</p>
<h2>How Do You Create Ads &amp; Campaigns in Yahoo Gemini?</h2>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Start by signing in</strong> to the <a href="https://admanager.yahoo.com">Yahoo Ad Manager</a>. If you don&#8217;t yet have an account, you can easily create one, or log in using your Google or Facebook account.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Click &#8216;Campaigns,&#8217; then &#8216;Create a Campaign.&#8217;</strong></p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/yahoo-gemini-new-campaign-1.png" alt="yahoo gemini campaigns" width="1567" height="784" /></div>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Create your ad.</strong> For each ad, you&#8217;ll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ad title of up to 50 characters.</li>
<li>An <a href="/blog/ws/2014/04/18/create-winner-text-ad-description">ad description</a> of up to 150 characters.</li>
<li>Your landing page URL.</li>
<li>Your company name, up to 25 characters.</li>
<li>Your display URL.</li>
<li>An image – for text ads, Yahoo recommends that you use a high-quality image with an 82&#215;82 or 1:1 ratio. For image ads, you can either link to an image or click the camera icon to upload one. Yahoo recommends that images for image ads are 1073 pixels wide by 715 pixels high.</li>
</ul>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/yahoo-gemini-create-your-ad-1.png" alt="Yahoo Gemini Ads" width="956" height="793" /></div>
<p>You&#8217;ll be able to preview your ad on the right as you create it. Once you&#8217;ve added the information above, click the checkbox to indicate whether or not you want to use the ad information for additional ads.</p>
<p>Click Save Ad to save it in the My Created Ads section of your dashboard.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Define your audience. </strong>Start by clicking on Advanced Settings, Suggest keywords and &#8216;Modify&#8217; as indicated below, to see all of the options available to you.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/yahoo-gemini-audience-1.png" alt="yahoo gemini help" width="1555" height="456" /></div>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s going to look more like this:</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/yahoo-gemini-define-your-audience-1.png" alt="Yahoo Gemini Audience" width="1554" height="614" /></div>
<p>In addition to targeting people in specific locations (country, state, city or DMA), you can indicate areas where you don&#8217;t want your ads to show.</p>
<p>Yahoo will warn you that Yahoo Gemini native ads and mobile search ads give you maximum reach, but if you want to turn one or the other off for some reason, the option is there.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Set your bids.</strong> By default, Yahoo allows you to set your maximum cost per click – that is, the maximum you are willing to pay for each click. However, if you look to the far right, there is an option for Advanced pricing.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/yahoo-gemini-set-bids-1.png" alt="Yahoo Gemini Budget" width="1560" height="388" /></div>
<p>If you open advanced pricing, you&#8217;ll have the option to set different maximums for Yahoo native and Yahoo mobile search ad formats.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/yahoo-gemini-advanced-pricing-1.png" alt="Yahoo Gemini Advanced Settings" width="1557" height="449" /></div>
<p>You can then set a daily budget, or a budget for the life of the campaign. Choose to run ads immediately, or set a start and end date.</p>
<p><strong>6. Name and save or start your campaign. </strong></p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/yahoo-gemini-save-campaign-1.png" alt="Gemini Campaign" width="645" height="485" /></div>
<p><strong>7. Set up payments. </strong>Before you can start your first ad campaign, you need to fund your account.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll need to add a minimum of $25.00 to your Yahoo advertiser account. On the first page of the set up payment section of the site, Yahoo has Autoload set as the default option; basically, it tops up your account by withdrawing from your credit card or bank account when your balance is below 10% of the reload amount you indicated.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to use Autoload, make sure you turn this off.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/yahoo-gemini-payments-1.png" alt="Yahoo Gemini Electronic Payment" width="709" height="633" /></div>
<p>Follow the prompts to fund your account.</p>
<h2>Yahoo Gemini Reporting Options</h2>
<p>From the Reporting screen, you can access reports for your campaigns, ad groups (Mobile Search), ads, and keywords (Mobile Search).</p>
<p>However, there&#8217;s also a 7-Day Performance Report available within the Campaigns tab. This report will show you:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of times your ads were shown to users.</li>
<li>The number of times users have clicked on your ads.</li>
<li>The install-click rate is the number of installs divided by the number of clicks you received. It indicates how often users install your app after they clicked through the ads. Try comparing it to the install-impression rate to see how effective you ads are overall.</li>
<li>The amount you have spent for the user actions that you have achieved. Please note that this should be used as guidance only as the amount you are charged may differ.</li>
<li>The average cost per click is the average amount you have paid for each click. Compare trends by selecting between the two drop-downs.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Reporting tab, information is stored for 90 days and includes impressions, clicks and CTRs broken down by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Campaigns</li>
<li>Ad Groups &#8211; Migrated Mobile Search Only</li>
<li>Ads</li>
<li>Keywords &#8211; Mobile Search Only</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, these reports are not real-time; there is an 8-hour lag between impressions and reporting in the interface.</p>
<p><strong>Scheduling &amp; Exporting Reports</strong></p>
<p>You can set up automatic reports using the Schedule button in the Reporting tab. Choose to have daily or weekly CSV reports sent to your email.</p>
<p>You can export a report any time by clicking Export within the Reporting tab, selecting CSV, and either opening the .zip file or saving it to your computer.</p>
<p><strong>Bid Landscape Reports</strong></p>
<p>The Bid Landscape report is available in the Reporting tab by clicking Bid Landscape. This is a graph that shows you how changing your bid changes the number of clicks and impressions you would have received over a given timeframe. It&#8217;s designed to help you optimize your bidding strategy by projecting the effect of variances in your bids.</p>
<h2>Good-to-Know Tips on Yahoo Gemini</h2>
<p>Here are a few tips/facts that will help you better navigate the Yahoo Ad Manager and work with their native ad offerings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yahoo recommends that you have fewer than 100 active ad creative at any given time, but there&#8217;s no actual limit.</li>
<li>The Yahoo native ads platform is compatible with IE 9 or higher, Chrome, Firefox and Safari.</li>
<li>You can have multiple accounts associated with the same Yahoo ID and toggle between accounts.</li>
<li>You can use Manage Users to create new user profiles and assign levels of administrative privileges to them.</li>
<li>You can delete items in bulk from the main table for paused campaigns, ad groups (Mobile Search), ads, and keywords (Mobile Search).</li>
</ul>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/gemini-smartphone-apps-1.jpg" alt="Yahoo Gemini Apps" width="577" height="406" /></div>
<p>Yahoo Gemini, designed to offer advertisers a unified marketplace for mobile search and native advertising, is available now through the self-serve Yahoo Ad Manager. New ad formats, placements and platform features will be released as the service evolves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Larry Kim has been sharing a lot of research lately on the traits and features of winning AdWords campaigns, from those with <a href="/blog/ws/2014/02/11/average-click-through-rate">mega-high click-through rates</a> to those with <a href="/blog/ws/2014/01/29/hacking-adwords">best-of-the-best Quality Scores</a>. In the course of seeking out examples of advertisers doing all the right things, we found many more who are getting it oh-so-wrong.</p>
<p>From dynamic keyword insertion abuse to crappy headlines and nonsensical ad copy, we&#8217;ve seen it all. What follows are a few epic fails I refuse to feel bad about pointing out, because someone really should have caught these by now. Is anyone home on the other end of these campaigns?</p>
<p>Come, marvel at the mistakes, the missteps, the wasted opportunities. We&#8217;re not just here to poke fun, though; there are important PPC lessons to be learned from each of the bad ads below. You’ve learned from the best, now let’s see what we can learn from the worst. This is your PPC campaign on drugs.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="060cc11a-eb99-42a0-8b61-c85d63f06e37" data-langcode="und">

</div>
<p><em>Any questions?</em></p>
<h2>Bad Ad Practice #1: Dynamic Keyword Insertion is Your Friend…Unless It&#8217;s Not</h2>
<p>DKI is a really useful feature that allows you to appear as an exact match for a variety of terms by using syntax to tell Google to insert the search term directly into your ad. It can help you achieve higher CTRs, as searchers recognize their exact query in your ad, which strengthens the appearance of a match in intent.</p>
<p>However, like all good things, it can turn very bad if not used properly.  Like this:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="5eb76989-141e-4c2b-adb5-a7c5b36404d1" data-langcode="und">

</article>
</div>
<p>Oops! You should probably look at your AdWords dashboard once in a while and make sure you don&#8217;t see any ads like this. Better yet, preview your ads so wonky syntax doesn&#8217;t actually appear in front of your potential customers.</p>
<p>Even when set up correctly, you have to make sure each of your interchangeable terms makes sense within the ad copy. You don&#8217;t want this to happen:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="f6affedf-1002-471b-b939-37e00adabf9f" data-langcode="und">

<p>What on earth is a wall stickers nursery? Is this where sickly, newborn decals go to be nursed back to good health? Need I remind you:</p>

<p>Reminds me of the time <a href="/blog/ws/2013/03/13/dear-ebay-its-not-adwords-its-you">eBay told me</a> I could buy babies and perpetual motion machines.</p>
<h2>Bad Ad Practice #2: Don&#8217;t Tell Me Not to Click Your Ad</h2>
<p>What is it about this ad that would entice me to click to learn more about what they offer?</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="8888bf8e-e8c2-4695-ad12-76116b4f5269" data-langcode="und">

</div>
<p>So far, all they&#8217;ve told me is that they&#8217;re cantankerous old meanies who don&#8217;t like school dances and frown upon prom.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re supposed to get in front of my<a href="/blog/ws/2017/10/24/subliminal-advertising"> subliminal</a> objections and use this space to convince me to just give you a shot. That is better achieved by sharing a little bit about what you <em>do</em> do, as opposed to what you don&#8217;t. Yes, it can be valuable to qualify your clicks with your copy, but try to stay positive and use the limited space in your ad to explain what you can offer potential customers.</p>
<h2>Bad Ad Practice #3: Let Me Guess…It&#8217;s Called the Mendieta Technique?</h2>
<p>Most of this ad is wasted by telling me the same thing 3 times. The URL appears in the headline and right below, while the headline is the same as the business name, which is also the URL. And what the heck even is it? This ad makes my brain hurt.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="af5b14d7-7a21-435f-9578-42d03584abd6" data-langcode="und">

<p>Elisa Gabbert has been preaching great headlines for years and generic headlines are right up there with wasted characters on <a href="/blog/ws/2010/10/21/ad-headline-writing-dos-donts">her list of &#8220;Don&#8217;ts.&#8221;</a></p>
<h2>Bad Ad Practice #4: Mispellings [Sic]. Spellcheck Saves Lives!</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s another advertiser who has committed the cardinal sin of repeating their business name/URL to the point of ridiculousness, but let&#8217;s forget about that for a minute. We might even be able to overlook the missing period between &#8220;seafood&#8221; and &#8220;Best.&#8221; Unforgiveable, though, is that they failed to capitalize the name of their city…and also spelled it wrong.</p>

<h2>Bad Ad Practice #5: Intent Matters in PPC Targeting</h2>
<p>Sorry Mazda, but this ad is God-awful simply because it makes no sense for me to see it when I&#8217;m looking for brakes for my Ford.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="208b76dd-a4e0-4348-9574-2bf26d0dbc46" data-langcode="und">

<p>When was the last time you went looking for a $35 pair of brake shoes and were convinced to upgrade to a $21,000 car instead? It might have made sense – maybe – if they had targeted &#8220;ford focus breaks,&#8221; but even that is a stretch for <a href="/keyword-intent">gauging intent</a> to purchase a vehicle. Even if you&#8217;re so big you can afford to throw money away, don&#8217;t throw money away like this. There&#8217;s no way this bad ad is getting clicks for this query, so all it&#8217;s doing is dragging their relevance and probably their <a href="/quality-score">QS</a> down.</p>
<h2>Bad Ad Practice #6: Don&#8217;t Bid On Keywords for Items You Don&#8217;t Actually Sell</h2>
<p>Well, this was annoying. I&#8217;m super stoked for Walmart&#8217;s &#8216;Big Brands Event&#8217; now that it appeared in front of me while I was searching for a Black &amp; Decker snowblower. Which they don&#8217;t sell.</p>
<p>Have you ever said something out loud and immediately thought, &#8220;Wow…did I really just have to say that? For reals?&#8221; That&#8217;s how I feel about having to tell an e-commerce and real-world business giant like WalMart that they shouldn&#8217;t pay to advertise things they don&#8217;t sell.</p>
<p>This ad takes me to a power tools accessories product page with 55 items I wasn&#8217;t looking for. My intent as a searcher was crystal clear; I&#8217;m looking for a specific product. This is not the user experience you should be spending money on.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="7463ae73-64fb-44b3-9633-894b9653d262" data-langcode="und">

</article>
</div>
<p>Postscript: After a little digging I found that WalMart actually <a href="http://www.walmart.ca/en/outdoor-living/patio-bbqs/outdoor-power-tools/N-1713">does sell snowblowers</a>, from their Outdoor Power Tools page. Why didn&#8217;t they send me there? (This is one of the <a href="/blog/ws/2014/03/05/landing-page-examples">landing page mistakes</a> that Meg Marrs covered yesterday.)</p>
<h2>But Wait, There&#8217;s More…</h2>
<p>They&#8217;re everywhere. Search for just about anything and you&#8217;ll see extremely bad ads, whether as a result of neglect, carelessness or simply a lack of knowledge. I can&#8217;t go into anymore; they&#8217;re making my brain hurt.</p>
<p>Just make sure these misspelled, lazy, silly, wasteful ads aren&#8217;t in your own campaigns!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Google Rolls Out Active View Metrics &amp; Viewable Bidding to Counter Worthless Display Ad Impressions</h2>
<p>Google seems to be in the process of (finally) launching Active View features average CPM, viewable CTR and viewable impressions. I say “seems to be” as they have not yet made an official announcement, and no supporting material (i.e., help documentation) is yet available.</p>
<p>This is an important change because traditional impression-based bidding charges advertisers based on <em>served</em>  display ad impressions – a misleading figure, since, according to comScore, <a href="http://marketingland.com/the-road-to-understanding-viewable-ad-impressions-33145">31% of display ads are never actually seen by users</a>. These features go some way toward correcting that shortcoming on the Display Network.</p>
<p>Viewable CPM bidding allows advertisers to optimize their bids so ads appear in slots more likely to be viewable, while Active View allows advertisers to pay only for clicks or impressions on display ads that are “viewable,” meaning at least 50% of the ad has been on screen for one second or more. That benchmark is key because <strong>ads that are viewable for at least one second have, on average, 70-93% greater CTRs and 70-88% higher conversion rates than regular ads</strong>, Google shared (based on their <a href="http://ssl.gstatic.com/think/docs/active-view_products.pdf">internal data</a>).</p>
<p>Google has been working on <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/innovations/activeview.html">Active View</a>, their measurement solution to detect viewable display ad impressions, for at least a couple of years. In April this year, they finally won the approval of the Media Rating Council, by way of accreditation for the viewable impressions standard they hope will become a “universal currency” for advertisers.</p>
<p>In addition to its adherence to the 3MS standard, Google says Active View also considers account events that affect the viewability of the page where your ad appears, including browser scroll or resize. “Since we can tell when an ad appears on screen, advertisers only have to pay for these viewable impressions,” they shared on the <a href="http://www.google.ca/think/products/active-view.html">Google Think Insights</a> website.</p>
<p>Here’s what it looks like within the AdWords dashboard:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="74d42fe4-5693-4ee4-a4a0-40a1e8ff0ef2" data-langcode="und">

</article>
</div>
<p>Certainly, those using display ads for brand awareness or recognition will find this a welcome option, though WordStream Founder Larry Kim points out that many are still better off optimizing display ads for conversions or clicks, rather than viewable impressions. “If your ads weren’t seen, they can’t be clicked on or generate conversions,” he notes.</p>
<p>Google itself <a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/14075?hl=en">advises</a>, “If you want to measure performance on the Display Network, we recommend focusing on metrics such as conversions and ROI.”</p>
<p>If you are after impressions, Kim says, you might as well ignore average position. According to Google, “Average position may be less useful in optimizing for performance on the Google Display Network because of the diversity of websites on this network.” This is their way of saying nicely, Kim notes, that average position is near useless, as even the first position might be below the fold, depending on the site.</p>
<p>Active View has been available on Reserve Inventory on Google Display throughout their beta testing period with a select group of advertisers. The new options are available in at least some AdWords accounts, though we cannot confirm whether it is available to all users, or outside of the US.</p>
