										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You likely set out to start your company because you have something to offer—something that makes you, your product, and your company different from the rest. It’s ultimately this difference, not your product or service, that you sell. This is easier said than done unless you master your competitive positioning.</p>
<p>Before diving into finding your competitive positioning and learning how to sell your “difference,” it’s important to understand what competitive positioning is. Then, we can crack the code on your differences and streamline things with a template.</p>

<h2>What is competitive positioning?</h2>
<p>Every successful company has a differentiator that makes them competitive. Competitive positioning is how you market your company to ensure it stands apart from the competition and leverages its strengths.</p>
<p>Competitive positioning ultimately comes down to marketing, branding, and how you talk about your business and your products or services. Even if you’re in a similar space as other businesses, the right competitive positioning will help you stand apart and drive your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/unique-selling-proposition">unique selling proposition</a>.</p>
<p>Several elements typically go into competitive positioning, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The competition and your strengths and weaknesses</li>
<li>Your product’s value</li>
<li>Market likes and dislikes for competitor products or services</li>
<li>Market likes and dislikes for your products or services</li>
<li>Pricing and market trends</li>
</ul>

<div id="why-does-competitive-positioning-matter"></div>
<h2>Why does competitive positioning matter?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.bls.gov/bdm/us_age_naics_00_table7.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50%</a> of businesses fail by their fifth year. There are many reasons businesses fail, but a lack of competitive positioning is a big one. After all, if you can’t express why your products are better and different than the competition’s, how will a customer ever make that choice?</p>
<p>Once you have it nailed down, competitive positioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Differentiates your brand and attracts customers in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a>.</li>
<li>Helps you effectively speak to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/types-of-customer-needs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer pain points</a> and problems.</li>
<li>Informs your branding and marketing.</li>
<li>Allows you to create a more insightful <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/19/customer-journey-map-templates">customer journey</a>.</li>
<li>Makes building <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">brand awareness</a> much easier.</li>
</ul>
<p>The perks of competitive positioning can be summed up by part of the name itself: competitive. Ultimately, when you’re confident in your competitive positioning, you’re signaling to potential customers and other brands that you’re confident in whatever you’re selling. And this is how you stay competitive.</p>

<h2>5 tips to find your competitive positioning</h2>
<p>You probably won’t find your competitive positioning overnight, and it may even change over time. These tips will help you find your competitive positioning now and stay on top of it as it evolves.</p>
<h3>1. Ensure you know the market</h3>
<p>First and foremost, you need to know where you fit in the market.</p>
<p>Start by running a market analysis. Review the landscape and note how many competitors are out there, what the potential market size and customer base look like, and what the average revenue is for businesses in this space. It’s also not a bad idea to conduct a tried-and-true <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/16/marketing-competitive-analysis#_ga=2.182940582.1090122938.1698345807-369991937.1695347762&amp;_gac=1.158025416.1695698446.CjwKCAjw38SoBhB6EiwA8EQVLu7t5v3dzfKLQDhndyDc4IcBctoDyLNeIkf8BMcvXfejZz5caP-EUBoCAG4QAvD_BwE">SWOT analysis</a>.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/competitive-positioning-wordstream-swot.webp" alt="competitive positioning - swot analysis chart." width="787" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-84678 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/competitive-positioning-wordstream-swot.webp 787w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/competitive-positioning-wordstream-swot-480x366.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 787px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is also a good time to start thinking about your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/23/buyer-personas">ideal customer persona</a> (ICP). Who is your ideal customer? What are their likes and dislikes? What are their major pain points? What about your product or service would appeal to them?</p>
<p>If your business is already off the ground, consider <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-feedback-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling your current customers</a> to gain useful insights grounded in reality.</p>
<h3>2. Perform in-depth competitor research</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/why-is-it-important-companies-have-competitors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Knowing your competitors</a> is as important as knowing your own company and market, if not more.</p>
<p>Perform in-depth competitor research to find out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who are the biggest competitors in your space?</li>
<li>What do their customers like about their offerings?</li>
<li>What are the biggest customer complaints about their offerings?</li>
<li>Are there any gaps your product or services fill or could fill?</li>
</ul>
<p>During this phase, pay special attention to customer complaints and any gaps you find. If the majority of competitors are receiving similar complaints about a product or a lack of an offering, this is a golden opportunity for you.</p>
<p>For example, say you run an online shoe store. If your direct competitors are all receiving negative marks about their return policy, you could position yourself as the “customer-centric” shoe store and offer a better return policy with a free trial period.</p>
<h3>3. List out your objectives</h3>
<p>Your positioning isn’t only affected by your company’s current status but also by your future plans and objectives. This is especially the case when fulfilling your objectives could result in your company pivoting in a big way.</p>
<p>For example, if your quarterly goal is to launch two marketing campaigns, this isn’t necessarily a pivotal moment for your company. If you have a fiscal year goal of launching a new product, that is something you should factor into your positioning.</p>
<p>Gather any relevant stakeholders and list out all your short and long-term goals and objectives. Then, review the list and determine which ones have the potential to impact your company’s positioning. Take note of these goals and factor them in as you move forward with the rest of this guide.</p>
<h3>4. Lean into your niche</h3>
<p>A core part of determining what makes you competitive is finding your niche and leaning in on it as much as possible.</p>
<p>Start by reflecting on your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/competitive-analysis"> competitive analysis</a> and your own products and positioning. Then, think about your key differences and list them.</p>
<p>Next, list every problem your target audience has that you intend to solve. Be realistic and only call attention to problems you can solve in the near future without any significant funding or company overhaul.</p>
<p>With your competitor knowledge and list of target problems, now it’s time to identify what makes you different. Figure this out by answering the following questions in as much detail as you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the problems only you can solve?</li>
<li>What is your company strongest at?</li>
<li>What gaps can you realistically fill?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answering the above questions will ultimately help you determine your niche—the position only your company and product(s) can fill.</p>
<h3>5. Use gaps to define your competitive positioning</h3>
<p>Once you understand your customers and competitors, it’s time to use that knowledge to position your brand and products competitively.</p>
<p>You do that by looking for gaps in customer needs that your competitors don’t fulfill.</p>
<p>Here’s an example. Let’s say all of your competitors provide a luxury experience at premium prices that solve the needs of high-income clients. In your customer research, you’ve identified a large segment of buyers who don’t use their service because of the price point but would if it were more accessible. So, you design a simplified “no frills” version and capture an underserved pool of eager buyers.</p>
<div id="what-is-a-competitive-positioning-map"></div>
<h2>What is a competitive positioning map?</h2>
<p>A competitive positioning map is a graph that positions competitors along two variables. It’s designed to help you visualize gaps in the market for those two characteristics.</p>
<p>Creating a competitive positioning map is a three-step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick two variables, like cost (high vs. low), service level (self-serve vs. concierge), or features (full-feature vs. simple design).</li>
<li>Plot where each of your competitors falls for each of those two variables.</li>
<li> Look for the gaps in service.</li>
</ol>
<div id="your-competitive-positioning-map"></div>
<h2>Competitive positioning map example</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of a competitive positioning map you can use to create your own.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/competitive-positioning-wordstream-map.webp" alt="competitive positioning - Template of a competitive positioning map" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-84679 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/competitive-positioning-wordstream-map.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/competitive-positioning-wordstream-map-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>Competitive positioning is a process, not a conclusion</h2>
<p>As you embark on your competitive journey, keep in mind your positioning is unlikely to be set in stone. Audience likes and dislikes change, competitors rebrand and launch new products, and your own products and branding can evolve. Because of this, it’s a good idea to reevaluate your competitive positioning every year or anytime you have a major brand or product overhaul.</p>
<p>While you won’t find your competitive positioning overnight, the aforementioned steps will get you well on your way to knowing where your company stands in the market—a major step toward long-term success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your business needs customers to survive, and that starts by getting eyes on your products or services. If you haven’t started with organic SEO practices already, that’s a great way to build a foundation of future success. But, while organic is great, it takes time to build momentum. This is where ads, and knowing the best advertising platforms, comes into play.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll share the eight best advertising platforms and who should consider running ads on them.</p>
<h2>The best online advertising platforms (+ who should use them)</h2>
<p>No two <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/bandwagon-advertising">advertising</a> platforms are the same, just like no two businesses are the same. What works for one business may not work for you or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">your target audience</a>. But it&#8217;s important to know the best, most popular online advertising platforms and how they might work for your business to figure out where to start.</p>
<p><strong>Here are the best online advertising platforms for 2024:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#google-ads-platform">Google Ads</a></li>
<li><a href="#microsoft-advertising-platform">Microsoft Advertising</a></li>
<li><a href="#linkedin-advertising-platform">LinkedIn</a></li>
<li><a href="#youtube-advertising-platform">YouTube</a></li>
<li><a href="#facebook-advertising-on-meta-platform">Facebook</a></li>
<li><a href="#instagram-advertising-on-meta-platform">Instagram</a></li>
<li><a href="#tiktok-advertising-platform">TikTok</a></li>
<li><a href="#snapchat-advertising-platform">Snapchat</a></li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re feeling overwhelmed, fear not—with a little knowledge of each advertising platform and some <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/local-advertising-ideas-for-small-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original ad ideas</a>, you can start getting some traction ASAP.</p>
<div id="google-ads-platform"></div>
<h3>1. Google Ads</h3>
<p>When it comes to big fish in the search engine sea, Google is about as big as they get with <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/">83%</a> of the global market share. Through the Google Ads platform, you can run different types of ads, including search ads and display ads. Google uses a pay-per-click (PPC) model, meaning you pay only if someone clicks the ad.</p>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-ads-optimization-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google search ads</a> arguably benefit the most from Google’s share. Search ads are the sponsored search results that often appear at the top of the results page whenever you search a term. These text-only ads give businesses a chance to say a bit about their business while blending in with organic search, as seen below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-google-ads.webp" alt="google ads advertising platform example" width="936" height="455" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81030" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-google-ads.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-google-ads-480x233.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Google display ads are shown via the Google Display Network (GDN). The GDN consists of <a href="https://ads.google.com/intl/en_us/home/resources/articles/reach-larger-new-audiences/#:~:text=Key%20takeaways,nearly%20all%20global%20Internet%20users." target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 2 million</a> websites across countless industries. These ads can vary, containing text and images, images only, or videos only.</p>
<p>Google display ads allow you to reach your audience in an organic browsing experience, as the ads will show up on various sites while the person is browsing. You can help determine where your ads show up by using keyword targeting, setting <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/topic-clusters-for-local-seo">topic clusters</a>, or even choosing specific sites. And make sure to catch up on how <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-use-google-bard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Gemini (formerly Bard)</a> can help.</p>
<h4>Who should run Google Ads?</h4>
<p>Google’s massive market share makes it especially enticing, and it’s absolutely at the top of the best advertising platform pack for a reason. But the large market reach of Google does make it somewhat of a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>Yes, you can get your business in front of a lot of eyes using Google Ads, whether you’re using search ads or display ads or both. (You should really try both.) At the same time, the large reach of Google also means you’re often in a more competitive space, especially if you’re in an already crowded and competitive industry.</p>
<p>Still, Google ads are ideal for just about every business out there. Test the waters, set a small budget to start with, and monitor your ad performance closely. If you can hire an ad professional, it can be money well spent. Otherwise, use your best judgment, dig into average ad performance for your industry, and don’t be afraid to halt ads if you’re not happy with the results.</p>

<div id="microsoft-advertising-platform"></div>
<h3>2. Microsoft Advertising</h3>
<p>Microsoft Advertising, formerly Bing ads, come in search and display varieties. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/01/microsoft-ads-optimizations" rel="noopener">Microsoft ads</a> are shown on top of Bing search results, as well as along the sides of the results page. Microsoft ads are also shown within the <a href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/microsoft-audience-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Audience Network</a>, which contains a number of Microsoft-owned businesses as well as partners.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-microsoft-ads.webp" alt="microsoft ads advertising platform example" width="862" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81031" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-microsoft-ads.webp 862w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-microsoft-ads-480x333.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 862px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Microsoft ads don’t have quite the same reach as Google ads, but they do allow you to reach a different audience. This is largely thanks to the other networks your Microsoft ads can show up on, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bing</li>
<li>Yahoo</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/what-is-duckduckgo" rel="noopener">DuckDuckGo</a></li>
<li>AOL</li>
<li>Ecosia</li>
<li>Outlook</li>
<li>MSN</li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft ads also benefit from Microsoft’s recent <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/blog/2023/11/07/come-build-with-us-microsoft-and-openai-partnership-unveils-new-ai-opportunities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnership with OpenAI</a>, which has helped pave the way for AI-powered search. This allows users to ask questions on Bing and get served more results, which means more opportunities for your ads.</p>
<h4>Who should run Microsoft ads?</h4>
<p>Microsoft ads use a PPC model like Google and feature similar ad formats. So, who should use them?</p>
<p>In short: Microsoft ads are a suitable ad platform for most businesses. Many claim the cost-per-click (CPC) is lower with Microsoft than Google for many keywords, so Microsoft can even make for a great testing ground. If something is performing well on Microsoft, consider doubling down and bidding for the same terms on Google!</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Want to know good results for both Google Ads and Microsoft ads?

<div id="linkedin-advertising-platform"></div>
<h3>3. LinkedIn</h3>
<p>LinkedIn, the popular business social network and job platform, has more than <a href="https://about.linkedin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 billion</a> users. Unlike Microsoft and Google, LinkedIn provides the opportunity to focus solely on a business-oriented audience.</p>
<p>LinkedIn ads differ from Microsoft and Google, in that there are a ton of formats:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carousel ads</strong>: Interactive ads with multiple slides users can click through</li>
<li><strong>Conversation ads</strong>: Ads sent via LI messaging that provide users with multiple choices</li>
<li><strong>Event ads</strong>: Ads formatted to promote events</li>
<li><strong>Follower ads</strong>: Ads for promoting your LI business page to grow followers</li>
<li><strong>Lead Gen Forms</strong>: Ads for lead gen that promote a pre-filled form for your content</li>
<li><strong>Message ads</strong>: Ads containing a pre-written message, sent to users directly via LI messaging</li>
<li><strong>Single image ads</strong>: A single image with light copy that appears on the LI feed</li>
<li><strong>Single job ads</strong>: Ads for promoting job postings, targeting candidates</li>
<li><strong>Spotlight ads</strong>: Ads that focus on a specific product or service of your choosing</li>
<li><strong>Text ads</strong>: PPC ads that drive traffic to your site</li>
<li><strong>Video ads</strong>: Video ads that appear alongside or in the feed of LI</li>
</ul>
<p>If your head’s spinning after looking at that list, you’re not alone. But, one of the perks of LinkedIn’s many ad formats, is that you can tailor the ad experience to fit your needs. If you’re not looking to attract candidates or hosting any events, you can immediately cross a few of the above ads off your list and focus on other formats.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-linkedin.webp" alt="linkedin ads advertising platform example" width="428" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81032" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-linkedin.webp 428w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-linkedin-215x300.webp 215w" sizes="(max-width: 428px) 100vw, 428px" /></p>
<p>Unlike other ad platforms, LinkedIn ads can also be targeted using industry and job title filters. This is especially helpful for B2B companies looking to sell to a particular industry. And for those with little-to-no ad experience, LinkedIn is testing a new campaign type, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-begins-testing-fully-automated-accelerate-ad-siddhi-mistry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accelerate</a>, which will help you with targeting and automatically optimize performance over time.</p>
<h4>Who should advertise on LinkedIn?</h4>
<p>LinkedIn ads are ideal for anyone with a professional audience and those looking to find new talent for their company. If you’re in a B2B space, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/05/linkedin-advertising" rel="noopener">LinkedIn ads</a> are especially great, as you can target by industry and job title.</p>
<p>LinkedIn also comes with the added bonus of allowing you to attach your business page or profile to everything. This is great for networking, which goes a long way when you’re a small business trying to grow.</p>
<div id="youtube-advertising-platform"></div>
<h3>4. YouTube</h3>
<p>When it comes to video, YouTube is at the top of the pile. In fact, there are more than <a href="https://www.demandsage.com/youtube-stats/#:~:text=YouTube%20Monthly%20Active%20Users,population%20uses%20YouTube%20every%20month." target="_blank" rel="noopener">2.7 billion</a> monthly users on YouTube. YouTube offers several types of ads:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skippable in-stream</strong>: Video ads that are skippable after 5 seconds</li>
<li><strong>Non-skippable in-stream</strong>: Thirty-second video ads that users can&#8217;t skip</li>
<li><strong>Bumper</strong>: Video ads that are six seconds or less, shown before, during, or after video</li>
<li><strong>In-feed</strong>: Video ads that appear on a user&#8217;s YouTube feed</li>
<li><strong>Outstream</strong>: Mobile-only video ads shown on Google video partner sites</li>
</ul>
<p>Along with a number of ad types, YouTube also offers two payment methods. The first is CPC, in which case you’re only charged when a user clicks on your video ad to go to your site. The other model is cost-per-view (CPV), which only charges you when someone watches your ad in its entirety.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-youtube-ads.webp" alt="youtube ads advertising platform example" width="918" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81033" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-youtube-ads.webp 918w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-youtube-ads-480x313.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 918px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>YouTube is owned by Google and benefits from the same massive network, meaning outstream YouTube ads can show up on a large variety of websites and reach a wide audience.</p>
<h4>Who should advertise on YouTube?</h4>
<p>Much like Google ads, YouTube ads are ideal for most businesses because of their reach and wide-ranging audiences. But, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/youtube-advertising-cost/">YouTube ads</a> do require more effort than typical display ads, as you have to make video. If you don’t have the budget or time for video ads at the moment, YouTube may not be the best option.</p>
<p>However, if you have the resources for videos, YouTube ads are a great way to reach your audience in a multimedia way. YouTube’s flexible payment types also add flexibility other platforms lack. If you’re looking to drive traffic to a particular page, the CPC model is ideal. If you want to build awareness and grow your audience, the CPV model is the ticket.</p>

<div id="facebook-advertising-on-meta-platform"></div>
<h3>5. Facebook</h3>
<p>Meta, previously just Facebook, is home to nearly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/947869/facebook-product-mau/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4 billion</a> monthly users. Meta ads run across Facebook, Instagram, and their Audience Network. You can set a budget and bid, much like Google ads and other advertising platforms. Then, you set whether you want to pay for impressions or conversions.</p>
<p>It should come as little surprise that Meta ads are available in numerous formats:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Photo</strong>: Ads with an image and light text, along with a CTA</li>
<li><strong>Video</strong>: Video ads that vary in length, from brief to six minutes</li>
<li><strong>Messenger</strong>: Ads within the messenger app, focused on conversations</li>
<li><strong>Stories</strong>: Full-screen video ads that appear on Facebook stories</li>
<li><strong>Slideshow</strong>: An in-motion slideshow of images, sound, and text with CTA</li>
<li><strong>Playables</strong>: Playable ads that give users a chance to demo an app</li>
<li><strong>Collection</strong>: Showcase a collection of products in one ad, with purchasing links</li>
<li><strong>Carousel</strong>: Display 10 or fewer images or videos, each with a unique CTA</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the above ad types can vary in effectiveness, depending on audience, industry, and campaign goals. For example, if you’re looking to promote a sale, a carousel of various services or products with discount info can perform far better than a single image ad.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-facebook.webp" alt="facebook ads meta advertising platform example" width="436" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81034" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-facebook.webp 436w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-facebook-219x300.webp 219w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" /></p>
<h4>Who should run Facebook ads?</h4>
<p>Ads across Meta are ideal for most businesses, largely because there’s such a huge audience and variety of ad types. The variety of ad types can also act as a curse, however, as there’s more testing required to figure out which ad type performs the best with your audience/for your use case.</p>
<p>No matter the case, consider testing out Meta ads for your business. Just make sure you take the time to track performance and experiment with other ad types.</p>
<div id="instagram-advertising-on-meta-platform"></div>
<h3>6. Instagram</h3>
<p>Instagram, the popular image and video social networking site, is home to more than <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/183585/instagram-number-of-global-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.3 billion</a> users. Not only is that a lot of cat and food photos, but it’s also a lot of opportunity to find an audience.</p>
<p>Although Instagram ads are run through Meta, we’ve broken it out as its own advertising platform to highlight some of the benefits and opportunities there.</p>
<p>Instagram ads are offered in numerous formats:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Image ads</strong>: In-feed image posts with text and a CTA</li>
<li><strong>Video ads</strong>: In-feed video ads that contain a CTA</li>
<li><strong>Carousel ads</strong>: Multiple images or videos users can swipe through, with CTA</li>
<li><strong>Story ads</strong>: Image or video ads that appear as users scroll through stories</li>
<li><strong>Collection ads</strong>: Image ads that showcase multiple products beneath an image</li>
<li><strong>Shopping ads</strong>: Ads that pull from your Instagram shopping catalog and send users to a product page</li>
<li><strong>Explore ads</strong>: Ads that appear in the Explore section of Instagram</li>
<li><strong>Reels ads</strong>: Short video ads that show while users scroll through Reels</li>
</ul>
<p>Because Instagram is owned by Meta, many of the above ads can even show up on Facebook as well. This allows for an even greater reach, but keep in mind this will eat into your budget.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-instagram.webp" alt="instagram ads meta advertising platform example" width="414" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81035" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-instagram.webp 414w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-instagram-207x300.webp 207w" sizes="(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px" /></p>
<p>Speaking of budget, Instagram ads are priced by <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-cpc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPC</a> model, or cost-per-impression. Pricing varies depending on the industry you’re in, the audience you’re going after, and so on.</p>
<h4>Who should run Instagram ads?</h4>
<p>Instagram ads aren’t quite as wide-reaching or general as Google, but this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t use them. For small businesses and entrepreneurs, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/instagram-advertising" rel="noopener">Instagram ads</a> can come across as genuine and resonate with potential audiences. This is especially true if your audience skews slightly younger, as <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/325587/instagram-global-age-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">61%</a> of Instagram users are 18-34 years old.</p>
<p>Instagram ads are also a great idea if you have an ecommerce store, as the shopping ads can pull straight from your <a href="https://business.instagram.com/shopping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram catalog</a> and give people a quick way to purchase.</p>
<p>Lastly, keep in mind Instagram is primarily accessed via mobile devices. If you want to reach your audience on the go, this is a  prime way to do it. But, if you have an audience that’s not as mobile savvy, Instagram may not be the best way to go.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Get Instagram and Facebook ideas for every month of the year &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite2024MarketingCalendar.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2024MarketingCalendar_Download">The Mega Must-Have Marketing Calendar</a></p>
<div id="tiktok-advertising-platform"></div>
<h3>7. TikTok</h3>
<p>TikTok, the video-based social media platform sensation, has a large user base that’s estimated to be around <a href="https://viralyft.com/blog/tiktok-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.7 billion</a> monthly active users. Home to videos of everything from cats to recipes to alien conspiracies, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/11/advertising-on-tiktok" rel="noopener">TikTok is also a powerful online advertising platform</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-tiktok.webp" alt="tiktok ads advertising platform example" width="300" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81036" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-tiktok.webp 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-tiktok-150x300.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>TikTok is partnered with Shopify, Ecwid, WooCommerce, and BigCommerce, allowing for seamless integration of online purchasing directly into ads and your business profile.</p>
<p>For the ads themselves, you have a variety of formats to choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In-feed</strong>: Video ads up to 60 seconds long, which show up as users swipe</li>
<li><strong>TopView</strong>: Ads up to 60 seconds, shown at the top of the &#8220;For You&#8221; page when users open the app</li>
<li><strong>Branded Effects</strong>: Branded filters created for users to make videos with</li>
<li><strong>Branded Hashtag Challenge</strong>: A branded hashtag created with the intention of users sharing it</li>
<li><strong>Brand Takeover</strong>: A full-page ad, either an image or three-second clip</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are numerous formats, most of the above ads are geared toward video. Keep in mind TikTok is a video-heavy audience, so static images aren’t as expected on the platform.</p>
<h4>Who should run TikTok ads?</h4>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s integration with multiple ecommerce platforms makes it ideal for online B2C shops, as you can not only get eyes on your products, but also give people a quick way to purchase them.</p>
<p>TikTok features more than 100 templates for creators to help streamline the ad creation process. If you&#8217;re not familiar with video content or comfortable handling design, this could make TikTok ads especially enticing.</p>
<div id="snapchat-advertising-platform"></div>
<h3>Snapchat</h3>
<p>Snapchat has more than 750 million monthly active users, with <a href="https://thesocialshepherd.com/blog/snapchat-statistics#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%20the,just%205%25%20of%20the%20platform." target="_blank" rel="noopener">78%</a> of users being Gen Z and Millennials.</p>
<p>As a social media platform, Snapchat primarily focuses on videos and images. While users can share private messages and videos, they can also scroll through story feeds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s in these feeds that brands can have their ads appear in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single image or video ads</strong>: Image or video (3-180 seconds) featured via spotlight placement or between stories.</li>
<li><strong>Collection ads</strong>: Collection of several products with purchase CTAs</li>
<li><strong>Story ads</strong>: Images or videos that appear on the story feed, each with unique CTA.</li>
<li><strong>AR ads</strong>: Branded Snapchat lenses users can engage and post with.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-snapchat-ads.webp" alt="snapchat ads example" width="317" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81037" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-snapchat-ads.webp 317w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-advertising-platforms-snapchat-ads-159x300.webp 159w" sizes="(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px" /></p>
<p>For video ads, you can go up to three minutes in length. But, it’s generally advisable to keep videos much shorter, right around 10 seconds, as this is on par with many videos featured on Snapchat.</p>
<h4>Who should run Snapchat ads?</h4>
<p>Snapchat trends younger, with the bulk of users falling into the 15-35 age range. If your business has a younger audience, Snapchat offers a great way to reach your audience organically.</p>
<p>Snapchat also offers <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/snapchat-business-account/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free business profiles</a>. If you’re not interested in paying for ads at the moment, you can still create a business profile, feature your products and services, and start building a following ahead of any ad campaigns. But <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/snapchat-ad-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snapchat ads</a> are a great way to directly reach your audience and drive engagement.</p>
<h2>Get started with the right advertising platforms for your business</h2>
<p>Finding the best online advertising platform for your business won’t happen overnight, but the above suggestions will have you well on your way. Take your time, take note of what’s working and what’s not, and don’t be afraid to make some mistakes along the way.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s no denying the past year has been a big one for AI. Within the span of a year, generative AI went from a niche interest to a pop culture phenomenon.</p>
<p>It should come as little surprise that marketers are using AI in every facet possible, from content ideation to research and beyond. The growth and change of AI shows no signs of slowing down, so it goes without saying that marketing use cases for AI will shift significantly in the coming months and years as well.</p>

<h2>Top AI marketing trends for 2024</h2>
<p>Get a deeper dive into each AI trend and find out what it means for your marketing strategy this year.</p>
<div id="ai-ad-targeting"></div>
<h3>1. Further refinement of ad targeting</h3>
<p>Many marketers are using AI for improved <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/31/facebook-audience-targeting">ad targeting</a>. Artificial intelligence can parse through large sets of audience data, and then help you tweak your ad targeting and messaging. Expect to see this AI marketing trend continue and evolve in 2024.</p>
<p>This could result in more accurate ads but also a higher bar for what constitutes a successful ad. For marketers, this means focusing more on quality and ensuring your ads aren’t missing the mark.</p>
<h4>What this means for you</h4>
<p>Increased competitor and overall use of AI for ad targeting begs the question: will consumers become more ad savvy and scrutinous?</p>
<p>While you don’t have to use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/30/ai-impact-on-ppc">AI for improved targeting</a> now, keep in mind consumers could become more scrutinous of ads and expect even more refined messaging. Track the performance of your ads even more closely and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/11/copywriting-ab-tests">A/B test</a> messaging until you feel it’s as targeted as possible.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Speaking of ads, want to make sure yours are hitting the mark? Try our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">free Google Ads Grader</a> for an instant audit of your account.</p>
<div id="improved-ai-marketing-automation"></div>
<h3>2. Improved AI marketing automation</h3>
<p>Marketing automation is all the rage, from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/08/write-emails-like-a-human">automated email sends</a> to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/programmatic-advertising">programmatic advertising</a>. Expect to see this technology continue evolving and advancing. This could result in the ability to pivot quicker, run more micro-campaigns, feasibly deliver to smaller segments, and more.</p>
<p>Increased use of AI-powered marketing automation could result in audience demands shifting. People may grow to expect more timely campaigns, more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/04/customer-segmentation-models">niche segmentation</a>, and content that’s even more hyper-personalized.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-prompt-subject-line-personalization.jpg" alt="chatgpt prompt subject line personalization" width="936" height="329" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71554" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-prompt-subject-line-personalization.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-prompt-subject-line-personalization-480x169.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>What this means for you</h4>
<p>Factor the aforementioned audience demand shifts into your content ideation as you brainstorm campaigns in the coming quarters. Automation powered by AI could allow you to pepper in smaller campaigns, so think about any potential <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-pain-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pain points</a> or topics you could target with these size efforts. How could automating social post scheduling or email sends free you up to work on other efforts?</p>
<div id="more-capable-ai-chatbots"></div>
<h3>3. More capable chatbots</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/13/chatbot-examples">Chatbots</a> are capable of so much more than acting as a stand-in lead capture form. (Although they’re great at that, too.)</p>
<p>Recent advances in AI are allowing chatbots to answer more nuanced customer questions, including those about products and services. This makes it possible for chatbots to guide visitors through your site, and ultimately through the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/01/content-marketing-funnel">funnel</a>.</p>
<p>More and more companies will likely start adopting advanced chatbots that can answer more niche questions. If you’re not already, now’s a great time to implement your own advanced chatbot. This will help you stay ahead of the competition and give you a better chance at staying competitive.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-example-live-chat.jpg" alt="brand messaging - example of brand messaging in live chat" width="537" height="634" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76903" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-example-live-chat.jpg 537w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-example-live-chat-480x567.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 537px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>What this means for you</h4>
<p>Think about your content strategy for your chatbot. Not only what your chatbot will say, but also what kind of content you have on your site that it can send to users when they ask certain questions.</p>
<p>Check your chatbot logs as time goes on and see what kinds of questions people are asking, and whether they’re getting the help they need. If there are clear gaps, write content that your chatbot can then guide people to, ensuring those knowledge gaps are filled and people’s needs are met.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f9d0.png" alt="🧐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Are you using AI the right way?

<div id="more-use-of-predictive-analytics"></div>
<h3>4. More use of predictive analytics</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/07/google-analytics-4-event-tracking">Predictive analytics</a> allows marketers to analyze customer data to predict the market, as well as customer actions. While this technology isn’t new, it’s getting more capable each year.</p>
<p>It’s likely AI will continue expanding predictive capabilities, allowing for more accurate predictions, better product recommendations, and more. For example, advanced predictive analytics will allow companies to forecast sales, predict how pieces could perform based on select audiences and terms, and even which products might perform better in a campaign.</p>
<h4>What this means for you</h4>
<p>Rich, historical customer and site data are crucial for accurate predictive analytics. Set yourself up for success and make sure you’re capturing the right data now, whether you’re using predictive analytics or not. This way, you’ll have all the historical data you need to hit the ground running with predictive analytics the moment you find the right solution for your organization.</p>
<div id="improved-research-and-decision-making"></div>
<h3>5. Improved research and decision-making</h3>
<p>For smaller businesses, research is often difficult and time-consuming. This puts smaller businesses at a disadvantage when compared to larger organizations with entire teams dedicated to research. Fortunately, the days of manual research and hindered decision-making are behind us all.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f92b.png" alt="🤫" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Psst. Speaking of research. Want to expedite your keyword research process? Make sure you check out our handy, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">free keyword research tool</a>!</p>
<p>Advanced AI is capable of assisting with numerous forms of marketing research, from answering quick questions about a content topic to quickly describing how various tools perform. This can help smaller companies expedite the research process, make more informed decisions, and even quickly vet <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/17/best-free-social-media-management-tools">various tools</a> they’re examining.</p>
<h4>What this means for you</h4>
<p>It’s a safe bet that AI will continue to advance in these capabilities in 2024. This will make it even more feasible for smaller companies to keep up with larger companies. This is great news for you, especially if you’re running a lean team. But, this also means competition will become fiercer as time goes on, as it will be a truly level playing field.</p>
<p>If you’re not already familiar with AI tools, like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/06/how-to-use-chatgpt-for-small-business-marketing">ChatGPT</a> or Jasper, start learning them ASAP. See how you can use them to help streamline various marketing research processes to keep from falling behind in 2024. And of course, continue to focus on quality above all else, and fact-check anything you get from any AI tool!</p>
<div id="continued-adoption-voice-based-shopping"></div>
<h3>6. Continued adoption of voice-based shopping</h3>
<p>As AI continues to advance, the capabilities of voice-based search will as well. Even in 2022, <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/5406/voice-commerce-in-the-united-states/#editorsPicks">27%</a> of US-based consumers used voice search to make payments. Gone are the days of only using voice to search for the answers to important questions, like, “How do I know when the cheese in the back of the fridge is bad?”</p>
<p>The continued adoption of voice-based shopping and searching will likely force marketers to base much of their strategy around the voice-based experience. If 27% of US-based consumers used voice for payment two years ago, the number will likely go up and up. Before long, voice-based payment and shopping will be the expected norm.</p>
<h4>What this means for you</h4>
<p>Create content focused on even <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/11/07/how-to-find-long-tail-keywords">longer-tail keywords</a> that one would ask out loud in a voice search. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/04/10/voice-search-statistics-2018">Voice SEO</a> is already on the radar for some, but not all companies. Creating content that’s tailored to the voice-search experience now will help set you up for success as AI allows for more and more refined voice-based shopping and searching.</p>
<div id="use-of-multimodal-ai"></div>
<h3>7. More use of multimodal AI</h3>
<p>Multimodal AI combines numerous inputs, including text and visuals, to deliver a more complete experience. This is opposed to other forms of AI that only pull from text or images or voice, rather than a combination. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/05/generative-ai-in-digital-marketing">Generative AI</a> is a prime example of multimodal AI, as many platforms are capable of creating content and visuals in one swoop.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/google-ads-ai-automatically-created-assets.webp" alt="google ads ai automatically created assets example" width="796" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-78265" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/google-ads-ai-automatically-created-assets.webp 796w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/google-ads-ai-automatically-created-assets-480x362.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 796px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Automatically created assets is just one multimodal <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/04/google-ads-ai">AI feature available in Google Ads</a>.</em></p>
<p>As multimodal AI technology grows in capabilities and adoption, more and more companies will be capable of outputting higher volumes of copy and visuals. This technology will also allow companies to have even more refined keyword and ad targeting as well.</p>
<p>The end result? Smaller companies that can compete with larger content teams.</p>
<h4>What this means for you</h4>
<p>Whether or not you’re using multimodal AI, there’s a good chance your competitors are. Don’t hesitate to use generative AI to brainstorm content ideas and supply your team with jumping-off points. But, make sure you have a vetting process that prevents your team from publishing generic, AI-generated content.</p>
<p>Again, focus on quality and what makes your company unique. This will allow you to stand out in a sea of companies using AI to generate copy and visuals.</p>
<h2>Stay on top of these AI marketing trends</h2>
<p>While AI is likely to evolve in capabilities and use cases in the coming years, in ways we can’t even imagine, there’s no denying it’s here for good. Continue to stay on top of the latest AI marketing trends to ensure you’re ready for everything coming your way. Keep up with the headlines, see what your competitors are up to, and stay in the loop as much as possible.</p>
<p>Beyond this, don’t neglect the importance of traditional marketing techniques, either. No matter the direction AI takes, foundational marketing knowledge and a focus on quality will always be paramount to success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To say AI has grown in recent years would be the understatement of the century. A few years back, AI was largely a buzzword, with its use cases predominately limited to predictive analytics and chatbots. (This is grossly simplifying things, but you get the point.) Now, we’ve reached a point where you can ask, “Are there ways to use AI for holiday marketing?” And, voila—this question warrants an entire article. Written by a human, of course.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to answer said question and snag a few generative AI prompts while you’re at it, you’ve come to the right place.</p>

<h2>How AI is used in marketing</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the ways you can use AI for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2024-holiday-advertising-playbook">holiday marketing</a>, it’s important to understand the basics of how AI is used in marketing. (Although if you’d like to skip right to the ideas, <a href="#how-to-use-ai-for-holiday-marketing">feel free to do so here!</a>).</p>
<h3>AI for analytics</h3>
<p>Marketing analytics and AI have gone hand in hand for some time now. In the past, AI played a smaller role in analytics, helping with segmentation and even suggesting <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">keywords to target</a>.</p>
<p>Today, AI powers real-time insights for social posts and ads, allowing marketers to pivot ad spend or ad copy on the fly.</p>
<p>Current AI also allows for more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/17/google-ads-location-targeting">improved targeting</a>. Using AI-powered platforms, you can analyze your current audience groups and demographics, and weigh them against your competitors, past campaign performance, and more.</p>
<p>These emergent uses of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/15/ai-marketing">AI in analytics</a>, coupled with good old-fashioned historical analytics data, can result in more refined decision-making and the ability to pivot on a dime.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f916.png" alt="🤖" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Get practical tips to use AI the right way &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteAIinMarketingGuide.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_AIMarketing_Download">The Emergency Guide to AI in Marketing</a></p>
<h3>AI for chatbots</h3>
<p>Using AI, chatbots can deliver more advanced responses to site visitors. This enables more timely, helpful support, as the chatbot can either resolve the issue or route the person to the correct department.</p>
<p>Advanced AI-powered chatbots can take support even further, answering product questions and making recommendations. This opens up the door to more cross or upselling opportunities.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-example-live-chat.jpg" alt="brand messaging - example of brand messaging in live chat" width="537" height="634" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76903" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-example-live-chat.jpg 537w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brand-messaging-example-live-chat-480x567.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 537px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Personalized recommendations with AI</h3>
<p>For years now, online stores have used machine learning algorithms to recommend products and services to shoppers. Now, modern AI can pull from browsing data to serve recommendations in real time.</p>
<p>Coupled with historical shopping habits, this allows for a more personalized, tailored shopping experience.</p>
<h3>Generative AI</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/05/generative-ai-in-digital-marketing">Generative AI</a> is all the rage right now, with companies like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/06/how-to-use-chatgpt-for-small-business-marketing">ChatGPT</a> and Jasper becoming borderline household names. Generative AI is a form of machine learning that uses natural language processing (NLP) to learn from large sets of structured data and then create a deliverable to the best of its predictive ability.</p>
<p>Generative AI is largely thought of as a way to generate blogs and school papers, but it’s capable of much more. Generative AI can help you brainstorm marketing campaigns, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/30/business-email-templates">email copy</a>, social media posts, and virtually any other campaign asset.</p>

<h2>8 ways to use AI for holiday marketing</h2>
<p>Now that you’re an AI expert, it’s time to use this impressive and terrifying power for some holiday good.</p>
<h3>1. Tailor holiday ad copy</h3>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with handling your ad ideation and copy by hand. But, if AI is available, why not squeeze a little juice out of it?</p>
<p>There are a number of AI tools that allow you to utilize your current data to improve segmentation. Coupled with your funnel and customer journey knowledge, you can use AI to help you create holiday ad copy that’s ready to meet your customers wherever they’re at.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ai-holiday-marketing-ad-copy.webp" alt="ai holiday marketing - example of prompt for holiday facebook ad copy" width="936" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77704" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ai-holiday-marketing-ad-copy.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ai-holiday-marketing-ad-copy-480x205.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For example, you could use AI to help you create several variations of ads for the same <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/holiday-promotions-and-marketing-campaign-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holiday-themed campaign</a>, each one targeting those at different stages and from different audience segments. You can then take things a step further and use AI to help you reshape some of these ads to offer product recommendations in line with the shopper’s previous habits.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f381.png" alt="🎁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Want ideas for your holiday campaigns? Get the guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite2023HolidayMarketingGuide.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2023HolidayMarketing_Download">Holiday Promotions, Campaigns &amp; Social Posts to Unwrap</a></p>
<h3>2. Personalize product recommendations</h3>
<p>The holidays are a time of joy and cheer&#8211;and a ton of shopping. Using AI you can help streamline shopping for your customers, delivering more accurate and timely product recommendations based on their browsing of your store.</p>
<p>Amazon is a prime example of using AI to make accurate product recommendations. Not only do they suggest products on a product page, they also have a “Top picks” section where they offer even more suggestions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ai-holiday-marketing-personalized-recommendations.webp" alt="personalized recommendations on amazon using AI" width="936" height="520" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77703" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ai-holiday-marketing-personalized-recommendations.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ai-holiday-marketing-personalized-recommendations-480x267.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you’re not already using it, implement AI-powered product recommendations before the holidays and help your customers find gifts they didn’t even know they were looking for.</p>
<h3>3. Optimize cross-channel holiday campaigns</h3>
<p>The holidays are a sales-packed, hectic time for many shoppers. During this time of year, it’s not uncommon for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/19/customer-journey-map-templates">customer journeys</a> to be condensed or expedited, as many people are in crunch mode and skimping on research. With the right AI-powered tools, you can keep up with the wildest of holiday journeys.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use advanced analytics to monitor campaign and ad performance in near real-time.</li>
<li>Make tweaks to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">landing pages</a>, emails, ads, etc. on the fly to counter <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/07/reduce-bounce-rate">bounce rates</a>.</li>
<li>Pair AI with any number of AI personalization tools to deliver customized page experiences for shoppers based on their behavior.</li>
<li>Leverage <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/13/chatbot-examples">AI-powered chatbots</a> to support customers during hectic holiday campaigns.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ai-holiday-marketing-chat.webp" alt="ai holiday marketing - ai chat during holiday marketing season from anthropologie" width="936" height="559" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77705" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ai-holiday-marketing-chat.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ai-holiday-marketing-chat-480x287.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>With all the above efforts combined, you can quickly alter your campaigns during the holiday season. If people aren’t resonating with a certain piece of your campaign or a particular discounted holiday special isn’t performing as planned, course correct on the go!</p>
<h3>4. Improve customer support routing</h3>
<p>Customers are bound to need help during the holiday hustle and bustle. With the right AI chatbot and routing systems, you can help customers get the help they need during what should be a fun, not stressful, time of the year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up chatbots to not only offer help with sales but also offer product recommendations.</li>
<li>Make sure your chatbot can direct people to the right department and that someone is available when they’re redirected.</li>
<li>Utilize AI-powered call routing that looks at previous call history and sentiment to ensure people get in touch with the right person at the right time.</li>
<li>For bonus points, set your chatbot to include fun <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/28/christmas-holiday-greetings-wishes">holiday greetings</a> or language in the introductory chat.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ai-holiday-marketing-chat-routing.webp" alt="ai holiday marketing - ai chat routing for sales" width="860" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77706" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ai-holiday-marketing-chat-routing.webp 860w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ai-holiday-marketing-chat-routing-480x335.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 860px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.warriorsforlight.com/tx/plano/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>There are a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/chatbots">number of AI chatbots</a> and call routing systems, so shop around and find the one that fits your budget and needs.</p>
<p>Most importantly: test any chatbots and call systems you put in place. The last thing you want is an AI-powered chatbot that’s sending people to a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/11/23/best-404-error-pages">404 page</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Simpler sales forecasting</h3>
<p>The days of manually poring over historical data are over. Well, not over, but hopefully simpler, thanks to AI.</p>
<p>The last thing you want is for products to go out of stock during the holidays. Before the holiday rush, couple your noggin with one of the many AI-powered sales forecasting platforms. Then, use the tool to examine your previous sales and predict which products are most likely to go out of stock, which are less popular, and so on.</p>
<p>If you don’t have previous holiday data on a particular product, or your company is new, don’t fret! Many AI tools are capable of looking at any available historical data, as well as market data and trends, to help you get an idea of how a product might perform in the future.</p>
<h3>6. Real-time ad placement</h3>
<p>People are bound to hop around during the holidays, going from one site to another. Fortunately, there are a number of AI-powered ad platforms that are capable of serving up your ads where they make the most sense.</p>
<p>Pair this real-time ad placement tech with your many holiday campaign optimization tricks from earlier, and you can collectively pivot all your holiday assets with ease and maximize your ROI.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ai-holiday-marketing-ad-placement.webp" alt="ai holiday marketing - example of holiday display ad in holiday gift ideas post" width="662" height="597" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77712" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ai-holiday-marketing-ad-placement.webp 662w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ai-holiday-marketing-ad-placement-480x433.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 662px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This holiday ad showed up perfectly within a post about holiday gift ideas.</em></p>
<h3>7. Streamline hashtags for social</h3>
<p>The right <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">hashtags</a> go a long way, increasing the chances your posts are seen by users exploring various trends. The wrong hashtags, on the other hand, can result in your content getting lost in a sea of unrelated posts.</p>
<p>There are a number of AI platforms made just for this task. With one of these tools, you can enter your audience and campaign information, then generate swaths of hashtag suggestions based on the market.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ai-holiday-marketing-hashtag-generator.webp" alt="ai holiday marketing - hashtag generator example for holiday lights install post" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77713" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ai-holiday-marketing-hashtag-generator.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ai-holiday-marketing-hashtag-generator-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.hootsuite.com/social-media-tools/instagram-hashtag-generator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>While you should still manually investigate each hashtag before posting anything, these tools can save you precious time—time you can spend monitoring and altering your campaigns.</p>
<h3>8. Campaign brainstorming</h3>
<p>Generative AI is great for brainstorming individual marketing assets or even entire campaigns, including upcoming holiday efforts. In a few quick steps, you can find the right generative AI platform and start crafting holiday campaign content today.</p>
<h4>Find the right platform</h4>
<p>There are a number of generative AI platforms, so do your due diligence and see which ones fit your budget and use cases the best. Some platforms charge based on use, while others offer tiered pricing based on the number of seats.</p>
<p>Many platforms will perform similarly, typically using OpenAI to power their generative wizardry. But, take note of any templates or niche features the tools offer. Some platforms are focused more on expediting blogs, while others are focused on content as a whole and offer a number of useful templates.</p>
<h4>Feed your generative AI</h4>
<p>Once you’ve landed on an AI platform, give the AI thorough brand and audience information to ensure the results are as accurate and tailored as possible.</p>
<p>Some platforms give you the option to submit any links or blog posts you’re comfortable sharing, giving the AI the chance to learn your brand’s voice. This feature can be especially valuable, saving you the time of having to train the AI and resulting in more on-brand results sooner.</p>
<h4>Collaborate on campaign ideas</h4>
<p>Finally, come up with some high-level campaign ideas, input them into the AI, and watch the magic happen. Some platforms will give you the option to generate ideas for every element of a campaign—blog topics, emails, social posts, and more—while others will simply generate themes for your campaign.</p>
<p>Keep in mind you should always treat AI-generated content as a jumping-off point, not the final copy. You, the person, should always oversee the AI. You know your brand better than any AI or machine learning ever could. Use whatever it gives you as inspiration and write something original that will wow your audience!</p>
<div id="holiday-ai-prompts"></div>
<h2>15 holiday AI prompts for marketing</h2>
<p>Generative AI can help you whether you’re in a creative rut or looking to produce marketing content more quickly. But you need effective <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-prompts-for-social-media">prompts</a>, otherwise, you’ll get generic results that don’t even function as jumping-off points or inspiration.</p>
<p>Put holiday cheer into your generative AI journey with these prompts, broken down by content type. Also, be sure to tweak these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/website-copywriting">prompts</a> with any modifiers you want. (Much like generative AI results, these are just jumping-off points.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s “winging it,” and then there’s “cluelessly flailing about until you’re fired.” The former sounds cool, feels cool, and works a lot of the time. But, without any kind of foresight or planning, the latter can quickly become your reality.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-meme.webp" alt="30-60-90-day plan meme dog working" width="901" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76413" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-meme.webp 901w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-meme-480x319.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 901px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Especially when you’re starting a new job. This is why it’s important to know how to write a 30/60/90-day plan.</p>
<p>Realistic expectations go a long way. When you’re a new employee, or even a manager onboarding a new employee, it’s easy to be overzealous. This can result in overpromising and underdelivering.</p>
<p>“By month two I can absolutely increase our leads by 200%.”</p>
<p>“By month two I expect you to increase our leads by 200%.”</p>
<p>No matter which end you’re on, manager or employee, these kinds of incorrect expectations set everyone up for failure. With a proper 30/60/90-day plan, you can create realistic goals, set yourself up for success, and safely “wing it” without all the flailing.</p>

<h2>What is a 30/60/90-day plan?</h2>
<p>A 30/60/90-day plan is used by both employees and employers alike. Typically, a 30/60/90-day plan outlines goals and expectations during the first 30, 60, and 90 days.</p>
<p>The idea behind a 30/60/90-day plan is to add structure to onboarding, with goals around learning the basics, meeting people critical to success, developing an actionable strategy, and eventually executing said strategy. You can also use a 30/60/90-day plan for new projects.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-example.webp" alt="30 60 90 day plan example for social media management" width="840" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76414" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-example.webp 840w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-example-480x343.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 840px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://fanbooster.com/blog/30-60-90-day-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>A 30/60/90-day plan should also include metrics for success. In other words, it’s important your goals are something you can measure with tangible metrics.</p>
<p>Things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete X of Y tasks</li>
<li>Finish X training modules</li>
<li>Develop a strategy for Q3 with X deliverables</li>
<li>Pitch X ideas for Y</li>
</ul>
<p>While the best 30/60/90-day plans are the ones you can stick to, it’s worth pointing out that a plan can change. If you realize a few weeks in that some of the goals aren’t realistic, revisit your plan, tweak the goals or timelines, and ensure everyone else is on the same page.</p>

<h2>How to write a 30/60/90-day plan for an interview</h2>
<p>While not definite, some companies will mention a 30/60/90-day plan during the later stages of an interview. Some may bring up a 30/60/90-day plan ahead of an interview and ask you to prepare one, while others might have you lightly touch on a plan right then and there.</p>
<p>It’s unlikely you need a fleshed-out plan for an interview unless explicitly asked for ahead of time, but it doesn’t hurt to have some of the higher-level points covered. Before putting the plan together:</p>
<h3>Carefully review the job description and the company itself</h3>
<p>Look at the company’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/02/how-to-write-a-business-mission-statement">mission statement</a>, what they call out on their homepage, what they emphasize on the job description, etc. Think about what bigger role the position you’re applying for plays in the company and them reaching their goals.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://www.warbyparker.com/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warby Parker About page</a> serves as a great distillation of their mission: to inspire and impact the world with vision, purpose, and style.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-mission-statement.webp" alt="warby parker mission statement example from website" width="773" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76415" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-mission-statement.webp 773w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-mission-statement-480x373.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 773px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Think about what goals matter to this position</h3>
<p>What might their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/07/agency-profitability-metrics">KPIs</a> be? Metrics of success? Given the company’s size and audience, what types of <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">metrics</a> and goals make sense?</p>
<p>For example: You wouldn’t want to say you can drive 500 leads in 90 days via your marketing role if their audience is smaller and a good quarter is more like 5 qualified leads.</p>
<p>Bonus: Before the later stages of an interview, ask about the metrics of success for the position. Not only is this a great way to see if the role sounds realistic and aligns with your expectations, but it’s also great for informing your 30/60/90-day plan.</p>
<h3>Be realistic and don’t oversell yourself</h3>
<p>What can you feasibly do in 30/60/90 days? Keep in mind you’re new this entire time, so you’re also busy learning about the company, audience, and product or services.</p>
<p>When mapping out realistic goals, don’t neglect time spent on meeting people as well. You’re going to do a lot of meet and greets in your early weeks, and possibly some interviewing or shadowing.</p>
<h3>Emphasize the role of learning and training</h3>
<p>Pay attention to learning, training, and shadowing in your proposed plan. If you’re mapping out specific goals, write down the titles of potential stakeholders you’d want to partner with for these goals.</p>
<p>Learning is an essential part of any job and it shows you’re excited to grow. It’s also a great way to meet your team and those outside your own department as well.</p>
<p>For example, if your role involves Google Ads and you’re not very experienced, call out some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/21/google-skillshop">Google Ads courses</a> you’d take right out of the gate.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-learning-goals.webp" alt="ppc 101 homepage from wordstream" width="578" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76416" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-learning-goals.webp 578w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-learning-goals-480x498.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 578px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Even if a 30/60/90-day plan isn’t asked for during your interview, having a rough idea of one ready to go on a moment’s notice can’t hurt. If you’re really excited about one you put together, you could even mention sending it to the interviewer after your call’s concluded.</p>

<div id="howto"></div>
<h2>How to write a 30/60/90-day plan for a new job</h2>
<p>The 30/60/90-day plan for a new job is similar to that of an interview, only you have the luxury of in-house resources and actually knowing (to some extent) what it is you signed up for. And even if you’re not asked to create one, it’s a good idea to make one yourself to stay on track.</p>
<h3>Days 1-30: Learning, learning, learning</h3>
<p>Typically, the first 30 days of a 30/60/90-day plan are all about learning. You’re new to the company and the role. You need to establish a foundational knowledge of the company, products, audience(s), and of course, your responsibilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Base your goals around learning and growing in your role</li>
<li>Who will you interview?</li>
<li>What training will you need?</li>
<li>Any courses you’d like access to?</li>
<li>Certifications?</li>
<li>Additional resources you’d like?</li>
</ul>
<p>As you embark on your first 30 days, take note of questions you have the moment they arise and follow up on them. This is your chance to learn all you can, and filling in any knowledge gaps as early as possible can save you a ton of confusion down the road.</p>
<p>Also, as you map out goals for your first 30 days and beyond, make sure they’re concrete, measurable ones. Both you and your prospective manager should be able to ask and answer the question, “Is this goal complete?”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/smart-goals-e1685648679235.jpg" alt="" width="936" height="561" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76423" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/smart-goals-e1685648679235.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/smart-goals-e1685648679235-480x288.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Make sure the goals you outline in your 30/60/90-day plan are SMART goals.</em></p>
<p>For example, you could state that by day 60 you want to complete X courses on Y topic, or have published four blogs and interviewed two in-house experts.</p>
<h3>Days 31-60: Strategy and further learning</h3>
<p>During your first 30 days, you’ve hopefully learned what you need to know to start thinking about strategy and upcoming tasks. So, your next 30 days should focus on strategy and further learning. Yes, more learning.</p>
<h4>Get a feel for what people and the department need to succeed</h4>
<ul>
<li>How can you help your department and company reach their goals?</li>
<li>In order of quickest wins/impact, what tasks make the most sense?</li>
<li>What support do you need to make these tasks happen?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Set realistic targets you can hit during this period</h4>
<ul>
<li>What kind of projects can you start working on?</li>
<li>What kind of progress can you expect to make on any projects?</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind you’re still learning at this stage, so you won’t be running at 100% speed in most cases.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-days-31-60.webp" alt="30/60/90-day plan example for days 31-60" width="471" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76424" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-days-31-60.webp 471w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-days-31-60-236x300.webp 236w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px" /></p>
<h4>Map out additional training, resources, certifications, etc.</h4>
<p>You can’t cram all your learning into the first 30 days, so you’ll likely have more to do in the second 30 (and maybe the final, too).</p>
<ul>
<li>Think about what kind of knowledge gaps you might have at this stage, based on the job description, the department goals, and so on.</li>
<li>If you can’t nail down a few concrete topics or knowledge gaps, put in some generic filler space to remind yourself that you’ll likely have more training to do as those 30 days get closer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Days 61-90: Putting it all into motion</h3>
<p>You’ve learned, interviewed, learned some more, strategized, and continued learning, so now it’s time to execute.</p>
<h4>Map out every project, campaign, strategy, etc. that you plan on rolling out at this stage</h4>
<ul>
<li>What will you need to make these executions go smoothly?</li>
<li>Who needs to be involved? Who are the stakeholders?</li>
<li>What could go wrong here and how can you plan for it?</li>
<li>What kind of support do you need for these things to happen?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Plan to present your work thus far</h4>
<ul>
<li>What kind of reporting needs to be in place ahead of time?</li>
<li>What are the main KPIs or metrics of success for your projects or initiatives?</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, think about how you’ll present your work to your leads and show the impact and progress you’ve made.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-progress.webp" alt="30 60 90 day plan progress chart" width="936" height="493" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76425" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-progress.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/306090-day-plan-progress-480x253.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://monday.com/blog/project-management/30-60-90-day-plan-template/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<h4>Set aside some time to review how things went</h4>
<p>What good is all this action if you don’t stop to reflect?</p>
<p>While not something you can always plan ahead for in 100% detail, think about how you might go about revisiting your first 90 days, filling in any knowledge gaps, learning from mistakes, and ensuring your next 90 days are even better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A picture is worth a thousand words. But, are words always worth the effort you put into them? You can write the most compelling copy your mind can imagine, but fail to get any traffic via Google, or even conversions from traffic you’re paying to send to the content. Without content optimization, your content is just kind of…there.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Content-optimization-example-intro.jpg" alt="Content optimization - screenshot showing your content at the top of a search page" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76027 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Content-optimization-example-intro.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Content-optimization-example-intro-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Where optimized content ends up</em></p>
<p>With the right content optimization strategy, you can increase the chances your words drive results for months and years to come, making them worth all the effort and then some. But first, it’s important to understand the basics.</p>

<div id="what"></div>
<h2>What is content optimization?</h2>
<p>Content optimization is the act of refining your content so it performs well with your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a> and gets the results you’re after. In other words, it reduces the chances you’re spending precious time writing content nobody will read—a fate worse than death for any writer!</p>
<p>Oftentimes, content optimization is thought of in <a href="https://localiq.com/products/search-engine-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search engine optimization</a> (SEO) terms. In this case, content optimization involves keyword research, on-page optimization, and more with the goal of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/09/google-ranking-factors">ranking in search engines</a> for relevant queries. But there’s also content optimization for social media, sales enablement, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/11/increase-conversion-rates">general conversions</a>.</p>
<p>No matter the type or reason for optimizing content, the end objective is often the same: tweak your content in a way that helps you reach your goals.</p>
<div id="why"></div>
<h2>Why content optimization matters</h2>
<p>Time is money, as the old saying goes. When you’re not optimizing your content for one goal or another, you’re increasing the chances you’re wasting time (and money). On the other hand, when you optimize content, you’re setting yourself up for success with multiple benefits.</p>
<h3>Your content is more likely to rank</h3>
<p>There’s always a chance a quality piece of content with absolutely no attention paid to optimization ends up performing well on Google. If you optimize your content, though, you’re increasing your chances of ranking.</p>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="👋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </strong>Content optimization is one way to drive more traffic. This guide will give you <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSContentDLWebBlogInContentTextLinkTrickstoClicks.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_TrickstoClicks_Download">10 more tricks to get more clicks</a>.</div></div>
<h3>You can get more mileage out of old content</h3>
<p>Content optimization also allows you to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google">reoptimize content</a> that’s no longer performing well. Google algorithms change over time and competition can shift. This can result in your content that was once dominating page one, falling into oblivion.</p>
<p>An added perk, content reoptimization, or content refreshes, are often much quicker than writing a piece from scratch. Who doesn’t want to save time and possibly land a nice spot on Google?</p>
<h3>You can get your content in front of the right people</h3>
<p>You likely know who your audience is, as well as what it is they want. By optimizing your content—targeting the right keywords, using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/06/on-page-seo">on-page SEO best practices</a>, etc.—you’re setting your content up to get in front of the audience that needs it (and, in turn, your business!) most.</p>
<h3>You can tailor content for specific goals</h3>
<p>You might publish top-of-the-funnel content to attract new visitors to your website. Or maybe you share <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics">conversion-focused</a> content meant to turn leads into paying customers. No matter what <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/17/content-marketing-kpis">marketing KPI</a> you’re attempting to hit, optimized content will have a better chance of achieving it.</p>
<div id="strategies"></div>
<h2>9 content optimization strategies</h2>
<p>No two pieces of content are the same, just as no two brands are the same. There are a number of content optimization strategies you can launch, but keep in mind some of them may make more sense for your content or brand at your current stage.</p>
<h3>1. Use keywords strategically</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword">Keywords</a> help search engines match your content to the queries people enter. To make sure Google and its competitors know that your content will answer their users’ questions, you’ll need to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">research which keywords</a> to target, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/keyword-mapping">map your keywords</a>, and add them to your content.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Content-optimization-example-keyword.jpg" alt="Content optimization - keyword placement" width="872" height="595" class="aligncenter wp-image-76029 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Content-optimization-example-keyword.jpg 872w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Content-optimization-example-keyword-480x328.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 872px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As you write, ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the keyword in the intro paragraph?</li>
<li>Is the keyword in at least one major header?</li>
<li>Is the keyword in the title?</li>
<li>Is the keyword in the meta description?</li>
<li>Is the keyword contained in the page URL?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Avoid keyword stuffing! SEO has come a long way since the dark ages of the 2010s. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/03/21/dangers-of-keyword-stuffing">Keyword stuffing</a> is obvious to readers and isn’t doing your SEO any favors. Make your keyword mentions organic, but never excessive.</p>
<h3>2. Include meta descriptions and title tags</h3>
<p>Like keywords, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/meta-tags">meta tags</a> are an important part of on-page SEO. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/meta-description">Meta descriptions</a> and title tags are types of meta tags that show up on search engine results pages.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Content-optimization-example-meta.jpg" alt="Content optimization - screenshot of meta data on google" width="930" height="215" class="aligncenter wp-image-76030 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Content-optimization-example-meta.jpg 930w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Content-optimization-example-meta-480x111.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 930px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Since they’re visible to searchers, these meta tags are critical to content optimization. Make sure your meta titles and meta descriptions include target keywords and are engaging enough to get people to click on your search entry.</p>
<h3>3. Ensure your site is technically sound</h3>
<p>All the optimization in the world won’t save your articles from a site that’s not technically up to par. This is where technical optimization, the cousin of on-page and off-page, comes into play.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Content-optimization-example-technical.jpg" alt="Content optimization - diagram of the three components of SEO" width="686" height="599" class="aligncenter wp-image-76031 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Content-optimization-example-technical.jpg 686w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Content-optimization-example-technical-480x419.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 686px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Technical SEO is (surprise, surprise) far more technical than on-page optimization. To get started, do a general checkup of your site and run it through a tool like <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/?utm_source=psi&amp;utm_medium=redirect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google PageSpeed Insights</a>. This will tell you if your site loads quickly, and if there are any glaring issues.</p>
<p>You also need to consider if your site is indexed, crawlable by Google, and more. Cover all your technical bases with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/28/technical-seo">our technical SEO audit guide</a>, and get your site up to technical speed in no time.</p>
<h3>4. Create internal links to relevant content (and vice versa)</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/link-building">External links</a>, those from other websites, are great for helping your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/12/domain-authority">domain authority</a> and chances of ranking. As you create <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/15/quality-content-defined">quality content</a> and build your brand, these links will come. But, it’s still important to build out <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/04/internal-linking">internal links</a> between your content.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Content-optimization-example-links.jpg" alt="Content optimization - screenshot showing an internal link" width="936" height="450" class="aligncenter wp-image-76033 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Content-optimization-example-links.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Content-optimization-example-links-480x231.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Whether you’re creating a new piece from scratch or performing a refresh, go through your site and include links to your new piece within older content (from a relevant spot). Then, do the same for your new piece and link out to other pieces you have, using relevant copy as anchor text.</p>
<p>Internal linking not only helps your SEO, it also provides a better experience for your readers. If someone has a question about something you’re covering, and you have the term linked to a helpful guide, they can easily get the information they need.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Create a spreadsheet that tracks your articles and target terms with a column that indicates whether you’ve linked from one relevant article to another. It’s easy to lose track of what pieces are linking where, and a spreadsheet goes a long way.</p>
<h3>5. Break up the copy for a better reading experience</h3>
<p>Nobody likes clicking a link only to find themselves face-to-face with a wall of text. Massive articles with no visuals or breaks in the copy will likely drive your audience away, and quickly. This hurts your bounce rate and ultimately your chances of ranking.</p>
<p>Here’s an article we recently published about the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/15/youtube-algorithm">YouTube algorithm</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Content-optimization-example-breakup.jpg" alt="Content optimization - screenshot of a blog post " width="355" height="576" class="aligncenter wp-image-76035 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Content-optimization-example-breakup.jpg 355w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Content-optimization-example-breakup-185x300.jpg 185w" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px" /></p>
<p>Notice how the text is broken up by headers, images, and callouts? That’s so our readers can get a break from reading. It also lets people skim an article and jump into the parts that interest them the most.</p>
<p>Again, whether you’re writing a new article or refreshing an old one, make sure you’re giving the reader breaks in the copy. Images are a great way to keep an article flowing, and they provide their own <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/benefits-of-seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO benefits</a>. You can also use bulleted lists, numbered lists, block quotes, and more to keep the article flowing.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Break up your text with bulleted lists, images, videos, or even block quotes like this one. See how easy that is?”</p>
<p>— John Shieldsmith, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Complete Hack</span> Writer</p></blockquote>
<p>As an added bonus, breaking up the copy simply makes your content more pleasant to read.</p>
<h3>6. Double-check search intent before writing</h3>
<p>Just because a keyword looks promising, doesn’t mean the intent is the right fit for your brand. This is why it’s important to search a term on Google before you start targeting it in a piece, otherwise, you risk wasting precious time writing an article that won’t perform well.</p>
<p>For example, say you want to educate your audience about pepperoni, seeing as you run an online frozen pizza company. While “best pepperoni” might sound ideal, especially considering you’re writing a guide on how to make the best pepperoni, this isn’t the case. Searching the term brings up a number of commercial articles, all ranking the best pepperoni brands.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Content-optimization-example-intent.jpg" alt="Content optimization - screenshot of a googe results page" width="442" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-76036 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Content-optimization-example-intent.jpg 442w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Content-optimization-example-intent-221x300.jpg 221w" sizes="(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px" /></p>
<p>By proceeding with the guide and using that term, you’re setting the article up to disappoint readers who click the link, as they’d likely be looking for the best pepperoni brand. This will hurt your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/07/reduce-bounce-rate">bounce rate</a> and again, torpedo your chances of ranking.</p>
<p>Make sure your intent is in line with your audience before you write a single word, using our well-intentioned <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-intent">expert guide on keyword intent</a>.</p>
<h3>7. Use relevant images</h3>
<p>Images keep your articles engaging but also help your chances of ranking. This is especially true when you use the right images, as they’ll keep your audience engaged. But <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/08/image-seo">image best practices</a> don’t stop there.</p>
<ul>
<li>Include your own screenshots when possible, as these build credibility with your audience and further establish you in the space.</li>
<li>Don’t use an image for the sake of using an image. Images should help drive home a point, further inform a reader, or entertain at the least.</li>
<li>Keep an eye on your number of images. Too many images can bog down your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/24/page-speed">page speed</a> and impact your SEO.</li>
<li>Compress images using one of the many free tools available. Images should stay right around 100kb, ideally. Anything over that risks slowing your site down. However, your hero image can be a bit larger, along with infographics, as these are top-priority images.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Run your page through the aforementioned Google PageSpeed Insights and see how quickly it loads. If you’re not happy with the speed, make sure your images are compressed and that you’re not using too many.</p>
<h3>8. Use attention-grabbing videos</h3>
<p>Follow the same image best practices and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/10/social-media-video-marketing">include relevant videos</a> when you can. Videos further break up your copy while appealing to other learning and engagement styles.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that if you’re using a video player and not auto-playing a video, you don’t have to worry about the file size. If you’re embedding the video and loading it straight from your own server, file size can come into play.</p>
<h3>9. Prioritize your audience above all else</h3>
<p>At the end of the day, your audience is the most important element to consider when writing and optimizing. Put yourself in your reader’s shoes and ask yourself if the article answers whatever question or questions they had when searching the term. Will they walk away from the piece, their life better in some way?</p>
<p>When you’re finished with your piece, ask yourself if the article is something you’re proud to have your name, or your brand, on.</p>

<li><a href="#cost">Website maintenance cost</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<div id="what"></div>
<h2>What is website maintenance?</h2>
<p>Simply put: website maintenance is the practice of ensuring your site is safe and secure, running well, and delivering a great user experience.</p>
<p>More specifically, website maintenance is an umbrella term for several activities that play a part in the overall functionality and success of your website.</p>
<p>Some of these activities include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security updates: </strong>Regularly checking for plugin and content management system (CMS) updates to ensure your site is free of security risks.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic metrics: </strong>Checking your site’s traffic to look for major dips and sudden increases in bounce rate that indicate problems with technical aspects of your site or the content itself.</li>
<li><strong>Content review: </strong>Reviewing your site for missing pieces of content, broken HTML code or images, and pages that take particularly long to load.</li>
<li><strong>Design audits: </strong>Checking your site’s design to see if it’s causing slow load times, difficult to navigate on any devices, and accessible for all your customers.</li>
<li><strong>Technical audits: </strong>Monitoring overall site uptime, checking for broken links, ensuring all pages are crawlable, and more to keep technical issues from holding you back.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-components-umbrella.jpg" alt="website maintenance components in an umbrella image" width="699" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73720" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-components-umbrella.jpg 699w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-components-umbrella-480x412.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 699px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There are countless additional activities that fall under website maintenance, many of which depend on the type of site, the platform it’s running on, your industry, and more. For example, ecommerce companies tend to have more in-depth website maintenance measures, as they have to worry about cart functionality, accepting payments, etc.</p>
<div id="why"></div>
<h2>Why website maintenance is important</h2>
<p>Website maintenance carries with it a number of benefits, beyond the obvious perk of, “your site simply works.”</p>
<ul>

<p>Remember the aforementioned great product, service, brand, and so on? When your website maintenance is in great shape, you’re not only free to focus on delivering the greatest product and experience—your products and brand are able to truly shine.</p>
<div id="how"></div>
<h2>How to do website maintenance</h2>
<p>Websites have many, many moving parts. So, it should come as little surprise that website maintenance entails many, many processes. Fortunately, you don’t have to tackle website maintenance all at once, allowing you to break it up.</p>
<p>Take a deep breath and follow this website maintenance checklist to give your customers, brand, and products the platform they deserve.</p>
<h3>Backup your site</h3>
<p>First and foremost, it’s important your site is simply alive. (Alive <strong>and</strong> well can wait.) What begins as a simple plugin update or article edit can turn into blank pages and broken websites in no time. Regular site backups prevent these hiccups from turning into countless hours of lost work.</p>
<p>Your host or CMS should have automatic site backups in place. Make sure these are active, preventing any kind of sitewide catastrophe. It’s also a good idea to download copies of your site to a secure hard drive.</p>

<h3>Check site speed</h3>
<p>How quickly your site loads plays a huge role in your overall online success. (Remember: conversion rates are higher for quick-loading sites.)</p>
<p>Use a tool, like <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s PageSpeed Insights</a>, to check your site’s load times. If things are slow, it’s time to perform a technical audit and determine what’s holding you back. Also, remember to <strong>check your page speed on a number of devices and browsers</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-pagespeed.jpg" alt="website maintenance checklist - google pagespeeds report for wordstream july 2023" width="868" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73683" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-pagespeed.jpg 868w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-pagespeed-480x331.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 868px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/23f0.png" alt="⏰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong><strong> How often:</strong> Monthly + After major site changes</p>
<h3>Perform security updates</h3>
<p>Your website’s performance means little if your site’s not secure. When your security falls behind, you put your customers and your brand at risk.</p>
<p>Make it a monthly habit to check that your site platform/CMS is up to date. Also, don’t neglect to check for plugin updates, as outdated plugins can have security vulnerabilities that put your entire site at risk.</p>
<p>After running any updates, make sure your site still functions on all devices and browsers, and that your load times weren’t impacted.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/23f0.png" alt="⏰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong><strong> How often: </strong>Monthly</p>
<h3>Delete unused plugins</h3>
<p>Speaking of plugins, delete the plugins you’re no longer using. By clearing out unused plugins you’re not only reducing your potential security issues via outdated plugins, you’re also making your CMS cleaner and easier to navigate on the backend.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/23f0.png" alt="⏰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong><strong> How often: </strong>Monthly</p>
<h3>Check content analytics</h3>
<p>Use an analytics tool and regularly review the performance of your content to check:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall site traffic</li>
<li>Top-performing pages</li>
<li>Lowest-performing pages</li>
<li>Pages with the highest bounce rate</li>
<li>Month-over-month trends</li>
</ul>
<p>If you notice a general decline in traffic, it’s possible a technical issue is impairing your SEO. Similarly, if you notice a page or article is suddenly performing far worse than it used to, look for broken elements on the page itself.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-content-performance.jpg" alt="website maintenance checklist - google search console to measure content performance" width="936" height="469" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73684" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-content-performance.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-content-performance-480x241.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You can use tools like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/23/google-analytics-4-vs-universal-analytics">Google Analytics 4</a> or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/16/how-to-use-google-search-console">Google Search Console</a> to dig deeper into content performance and URL performance metrics.</p>
<p>While content analytics plays a role in website maintenance, it’s also something your marketing specialists can check. Regardless of who checks analytics, encourage cross-departmental communication so both your content/marketing team and tech team know what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/23f0.png" alt="⏰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong><strong> How often: </strong>Monthly</p>
<h3>Hunt down broken links</h3>
<p>Broken links lead to a negative user experience, which in turn impacts your bounce rate, SEO, and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/brand-reputation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand reputation</a>. As part of your website maintenance routine, use a tool to check for broken links.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://ahrefs.com/broken-link-checker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ahrefs</a> offers a free broken link tool that will quickly show which links lead to 404 pages on your site.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-ahrefs-broken-link-checker.jpg" alt="website maintenance - ahrefs broken link checker example from content marketing institute" width="936" height="477" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73685" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-ahrefs-broken-link-checker.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-ahrefs-broken-link-checker-480x245.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>Review browser compatibility</h3>
<p>It’s possible your site flies on Chrome but crashes and burns on Edge or Safari. The same goes for mobile and tablet devices, too.</p>
<p>Run the aforementioned speed tests on your site while using major browsers and mobile devices (including tablets). Make sure your speed is consistent for each experience, and note the overall user experience. Is site navigation as easy on a phone as it is on a desktop? Are all elements displaying correctly?</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/23f0.png" alt="⏰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong><strong> How often: </strong>Quarterly + After major site changes</p>
<h3>Test site forms</h3>
<p>Contact forms and lead forms only help if they’re working. From newly-launched landing pages for gated assets to ancient contact forms, all site forms need your attention from time to time.</p>
<p>Use a test email and complete any forms on your site. Make sure the response not only goes through to your company inbox, but that the form also <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/27/landing-page-forms">captures all the correct information</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-test-forms.jpg" alt="website maintenance - test forms - example of information capture form from localiq website" width="315" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73713" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-test-forms.jpg 315w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-test-forms-158x300.jpg 158w" sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You would want to make sure your test pulled in all the relevant fields from your form.</em></p>
<p>Run the same test on a variety of browsers and devices as well, as some forms may not display properly on a mobile device or tablet right out of the gate.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/23f0.png" alt="⏰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong><strong> How often: </strong>Quarterly/Whenever you launch a new landing page</p>

<h3>Perform a content audit</h3>
<p>It’s important to audit all the content on your site, from your blog to your press releases to your various landing pages. Content with missing or outdated information can impact your bounce rate, while bloated images can slow site speed.</p>
<p>Set up a spreadsheet and go through all the content on your site, looking for the following and more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broken links</li>
<li>Broken images</li>
<li>Missing/outdated information</li>
<li>Large images/files</li>
<li>Dated design or branding</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally, you should perform a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/10/content-audit">content audit</a> every quarter. If this isn’t realistic for your organization, make sure it happens at least once every year.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/23f0.png" alt="⏰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong><strong> How often: </strong>Quarterly/Yearly depending on resource constraints</p>
<h3>Reduce image file size</h3>
<p>Large file sizes often translate to crisp hero images, but at the cost of page speed. In fact, one large image can be enough to hurt your overall <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9205520?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Core Web Vitals</a> score.</p>
<p>During the aforementioned audit, take note of any images greater than 1MB. Then, run these images through a compression tool, of which there are many. After compressing the image, reupload it to the page and make sure it still looks up to par.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-image-compression-tinypng.jpg" alt="website maintenance audit - tinypng homepage" width="936" height="417" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73712" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-image-compression-tinypng.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-image-compression-tinypng-480x214.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://tinypng.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One</a> of our favorite image compression tools.</em></p>
<p>If you have an infographic, ebook, or other visual-heavy piece, fear not! Offer a small preview on your site, then give your audience a way to click it and expand it into a separate tab, where they can view it in all its &gt;1MB glory.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/23f0.png" alt="⏰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong><strong> How often: </strong>Quarterly/When publishing new articles</p>
<h3>Update/add more visuals</h3>
<p>As you publish new content and revisit the old, look for opportunities to spruce things up with (responsibly-compressed) visuals.</p>
<p>Adding in a variety of visuals can keep your content interesting and engaging, help with SEO, and act as a way to break up text-heavy pieces and potentially <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/07/reduce-bounce-rate">lower bounce rate</a>—all of which play into overall <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/31/website-graders">website performance</a>.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/23f0.png" alt="⏰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong><strong> How often: </strong>Quarterly/When publishing new articles</p>

<h3>Update your header and footers</h3>
<p>It’s easy to forget about header and footer copy, but it’s typically where we house some of the most important information about our organization:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact information</li>
<li>Terms of service</li>
<li>Privacy policy</li>
<li>Copyright info</li>
<li>Certifications</li>
<li>Important links</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-update-footer.jpg" alt="website maintenance - footer update - wordstream footer" width="936" height="446" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73714" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-update-footer.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-update-footer-480x229.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For example, our own footer (above) may look sleek, but it still houses very important info. (Click the legal button, we dare you.)</p>
<p>While much of the above information can stay the same year after year, it’s important to ensure it’s always accurate and up to date. If your organization goes through any major legal shifts, like a new copyright, or if you move offices, it’s likely your header needs to change. You may also want to swap links that you&#8217;re featuring in your footer (or at least test that they all go where you want them to!).</p>
<p>Otherwise, make checking your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/27/website-header-examples">header</a> and footer part of your yearly website maintenance routine. It’s a good idea to involve your legal team, just in case there’s any legalese they need to finesse.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/23f0.png" alt="⏰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong><strong> How often:</strong> Yearly/Following major changes</p>
<h3>Create a 404 page (if you don’t have one)</h3>
<p>Nothing’s ever totally foolproof, and links are no exception. It’s inevitable that people will enter the wrong URL or a link will break. When this happens, a helpful <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/11/23/best-404-error-pages">404 page</a> should greet your audience.</p>
<p>If you don’t have one already, make a 404 page that informs your audience they’re not on the right page. Then, give them links to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resource-center">helpful resources</a> and popular pages on your site. This allows them to (hopefully) find what they’re looking for and keeps them from bouncing. It’s also a great way to build some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/04/internal-linking">internal links</a> and help boost your SEO.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-404-page.jpg" alt="website maintenance - wordstream 404 page example" width="872" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73715" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-404-page.jpg 872w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-404-page-480x329.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 872px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Not to toot our own horn, but use our above 404 page for inspiration. We’ve linked out to some of our most popular resources and used the page as a place to showcase our fun voice.</p>
<p>Lastly, make it a point to check your 404 page during your annual website maintenance. You likely have new resources to include and old ones to swap out.</p>

<div id="cost"></div>
<h2>Website maintenance cost</h2>
<p>Website maintenance cost, like the maintenance itself, varies across the board. The scale of your website, whether you deal with ecommerce, and the industry you’re in can all impact website maintenance costs.</p>
<p>Because of the many factors influencing website maintenance costs, estimates vary. Still, some experts estimate annual website costs at anywhere from <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/how-much-website-cost#:~:text=The%20average%20cost%20of%20maintaining%20a%20website%20ranges%20from%20$400,in%20a%20major%20website%20redesign." target="_blank" rel="noopener">$400 to $60,000 every year</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the many factors in the cost of website maintenance, there are some common elements that you can prepare for, regardless of industry or platform.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain renewal: </strong>$10-100/year</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/09/what-is-an-ssl-certificate">SSL certificate</a>: </strong>$0-200/year</li>
<li><strong>Premium plugins/Extensions: </strong>Varies</li>
<li><strong>Site redesign: </strong>$0-75,000</li>
<li><strong>Secure email hosting: </strong>$2-25/monthly per-person</li>
<li><strong>IT specialist: </strong>~83,000/year salary</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-types-of-ssl-certificates.jpg" alt="website maintenance cost - factor the type of ssl certificate you need" width="895" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73716" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-types-of-ssl-certificates.jpg 895w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/website-maintenance-types-of-ssl-certificates-480x322.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 895px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Different types of SSL certificates</em></p>
<p>Keep in mind the above is by no means an exhaustive list. If you’re in ecommerce, you have to worry about the added challenges an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/01/11/increase-online-store-sales">online store</a> presents. And if you’re in a heavily-regulated industry, like health or security, you will have added security certification costs, and so on.</p>
<h3>Mastering website maintenance—regardless of budget</h3>
<p>There’s no hiding the fact that a lot goes into website maintenance. And yes, maintenance can eat up a sizable budget. But it doesn’t have to.</p>
<p>Regardless of the size of your organization, you’ve gotten where you are because you have expertise. Leverage the resources you have and you can keep your site running safe and sound, all year round.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No/limited IT team? </strong>Leverage tools and automation to counter IT limitations. Automate your backups through your provider or platform, streamline broken backlink hunting with tools, and set security updates to run automatically.</li>
<li><strong>Limited design budget? </strong>Take advantage of the many design tools available online and utilize any templates they offer. If you can’t afford an in-house designer, find a reputable freelancer who can tackle your major site overhauls and batches of content as needed.</li>
<li><strong>Lacking SEO or content expertise? </strong>While there’s no substitute for true content specialists, there are ways to reap the site maintenance benefits of content even if you lack a team. Interview your subject matter experts and turn their transcripts into blogs, then hire a freelance editor to clean things up or use one of the many great <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/14-essential-writing-and-editing-tools-to-polish-your-website-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online editing tools</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally, you can clear out every item covered in this maintenance checklist. Even if you can’t, use whatever internal resources you have, take your time, and stay organized while working through the list.</p>
<h2>Getting the most out of a well-maintained website</h2>
<p>Having a <a href="https://localiq.com/products/websites-landing-pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-maintained website</a> is no small feat. Being the case, you should take advantage of your site and get as much value out of it as possible.</p>
