										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the resident International Customer Success rep here at WordStream, I have seen my share of multilingual campaigns. It’s a small world after all!</p>

</div>
<p>But diving into international waters can be a great challenge, so here are some of my tips on how to identify if you are ready to expand and how to set up your first experimentation for success.</p>
<p>So&#8230;why go international?</p>
<p>PPC is just like Disney World…expensive and overcrowded. Have you ever been on New Year’s? I have and even for the most dedicated Disney Freak it’s a true nightmare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="11743af5-79ef-4d45-9c5b-d532dce12cd7" data-langcode="en">

<p>International PPC is like having the most amazing fast pass to the front of the line. Advertisers tend to stay away from exploring new countries or new languages for fear that there is no volume, which could not be farther from the truth.</p>
<h2>Should You Try Creating Campaigns in a New Language? 7 Questions to Ask</h2>
<h3>Can you even service customers in another language? Are you doing it already?</h3>
<p>Consider if a potential client walks in the door and tries to communicate with you in another language. Do you have the ability to service them? Does anyone in your company speak that language and can they help you communicate or close the sale? Are you already serving client calls, contact request forms and sales in different languages? If the answer to any of the ahove questions is YES, then you should probably be advertising in that language already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="464949c2-273d-4059-8c6a-38fc7e10af9d" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/international-ppc-i-speak-whale.jpg" alt="multilingual ppc campaigns" width="493" height="383" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>If the answer is no, that is ok. Bilingual PPC can still be a strategy for you, but remember that when you open the door to this new market you might need to adjust your normal sales pitch. Many people can be potentially searching in a different language but are still able to communicate in English. According to a Google study, only 1 in five Hispanic searchers will look for a Spanish site when they land on an English site (<a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/new-research-shows-how-to-connect-with-digital-hispanics-online.html">Think with Google</a>, 2015).</p>
<h3>Are you ready to ALSO serve the international crowd?</h3>
<p>One thing to remember is that <em>multilingual</em> does not always mean <em>international</em>. In the US alone, over 300 languages are spoken. So if your plan includes not only advertising to many languages, but also to many countries, make sure your landing pages have the following information to serve your new audience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>International Pricing</strong></li>
<li><strong>International Shipping Options</strong></li>
<li><strong>International Phone Numbers </strong>(or at least the appropriate international dialing code to call you)</li>
<li><strong>Your Hours of Operation</strong> within your Time Zone</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you are not quite ready to start a full scale international invasion, great places to start venturing out to are Canada, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These countries are used to dealing with online purchases in the US so you won’t have to make many or any changes to your site.</p>
<h3>Are you located in a culturally diverse area?</h3>
<p>Then consider advertising in the major languages spoken around you. I am looking at you, Texas and Florida. If you’re not optimizing AdWords for Spanish you are probably losing out on an untapped market.</p>
<p>For my fellow geographic nerds, enjoy <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2014/05/language_map_what_s_the_most_popular_language_in_your_state.html">these maps</a> of the languages other than English most commonly spoken in each state. You might be surprised by how people around you are communicating.</p>

<h3>What does your Search Query Data tell you?</h3>
<p>The Search Query report gives you the real data of how potential leads are searching for your own ads. If you are starting to get relevant searches to your business in different languages, then crafting a new campaign is the next logical step to growing your account.</p>
<h3>Do your reports say you are ready?</h3>
<p>There are two reports you want to check out to see if you are already showing up for locations you may not have expected. In the AdWords Dimension tab, check out <strong>User Locations</strong>. This report will let you know exactly where the people who click on your ads are located. It might surprise you that even though you set location targeting within the US, some clicks can be coming from other locations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>The second report you want to look at is in <strong>Google Analytics</strong>. Check out what countries your website traffic is pulling in.</p>
<h3>Does keyword research indicate there is good traffic?</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/adwords-keyword-tool">AdWords Keyword Tool</a> allows you to find out search volumes for words within specific locations. Before you go out and create a test campaign, compile a list of a few important keywords for your business in the language you want to test and check out the volume. If there is not much happening there you might want to stop before diving deep into the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/06/international-google-ads">international PPC </a>experiment.</p>
<h3>What does Google Trends say about search volume?</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/">Google Trends</a> tool provides the complete search volume history of all terms Googled since 2004. It’s a great tool to check out volume trends of potential keywords and which locations they are most popular in.</p>
<p>Below is an example of the search term “lawyer” in English and Spanish (which I chose because it is one of the notoriously <a href="/articles/most-expensive-keywords">most expensive keywords</a> of all time). If you look at the English term, it has stayed pretty stable throughout the years, with some peaks in volume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="a241d598-e2eb-421f-9dd2-79b6c44bda0c" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Now if you look at the Spanish term’s volume, you can see it has constantly been growing over time – and, more specifically, in states like Florida and Texas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="6d0989bc-44b6-4040-b76b-227ad43b031c" data-langcode="en">

<p>Now that we have explored some questions you should ask yourself, here are a few tips on getting your bilingual or international PPC experiment started on the right foot.</p>

<p>You are ready young Padawan.</p>
<h2>Bilingual and International PPC Best Practices</h2>
<h3>Always, Always, Always Separate Your Campaigns by Different Languages!</h3>
<ul>
<li>Any AdWords experiment needs to be separated out from your regular PPC campaigns so we can test it without affecting you current efforts.</li>
<li>Different languages and regions can also have drastic differences in CPCs, so you don’t want to lump it all under the same budget.</li>
<li>Start with a smaller test budget, unless your bank account looks like this:</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</article>
</div>
<h3>Turn on Multiple Languages in Your Campaign Settings</h3>
<p>Maybe diving full scale is not your thing and that is ok. Simply switch on more languages that you want to focus on:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="529522fc-0c7c-47bc-9be6-ab5638e3cdd1" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<h3>Remember Keyword Research Is Not One Size Fits All</h3>
<p>A common language most marketers in the US will start experimenting with in PPC is Spanish. It’s the second most commonly spoken language in the US with about 41 million native speakers plus 11 million who are bilingual. The difficulty here is that Spanish speakers have many dialects and for search this means we need to figure out the most appropriate terms to target.</p>
<p>Let’s take a simple word like <em>bus</em> to demonstrate the differences in dialects. These are all the variations of this <strong>one word</strong> in 6 different Spanish speaking countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="bfb2541b-37d3-4da5-98ce-d9f8a6796f35" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bilingual-spanish-speaking-ppc-campaigns.png" alt="spanish ppc" width="660" height="335" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Google Translate goes a long way in helping you craft a keyword list, but when in doubt try having a native speaker on hand to help you come up with new suggestions.</p>
<h3>When Doing Ad Scheduling Remember the Time Zones!</h3>
<p>AdWords always defaults to the time zone where the account was created. This is something you cannot change EVER! So always consider your account time zone and the targeted location time zone when doing any <a href="/blog/ws/2014/07/30/ad-scheduling">time scheduling</a> or bid adjustments.</p>
<h3>Mobile is KEY</h3>
<p>Most international users don’t have access to desktops but they readily have access to phones. In fact 68% of Hispanics who are searching on Google do it <a href="/blog/ws/2015/09/24/mobile-ppc-charts">on a mobile device</a>. Bidding higher on mobile, crafting mobile-specific ads and creating <a href="/blog/ws/2015/11/11/call-only-campaigns">Call-Only campaigns</a> could prove very successful as an international strategy.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordStream recently launched a call tracking initiative and naturally we have been asked tons of questions about how our new service offering compares to Google AdWords’ existing Call Extensions and Call Forwarding features. (These services are different from Google’s new Website Call Conversions feature; learn more about that <a href="/blog/ws/2014/08/19/website-call-conversions">here</a>.) It is easy to be confused since all these offerings focus on tracking potential leads, so it is important to understand the differences and benefits of each service.</p>
<p>First, let’s break down what each of these service offerings do and how they work.</p>
<h2>WordStream Call Tracking</h2>
<p><em>WordStream Call Tracking</em> allows you to see through the software which campaigns, ad groups, ads, match types and keywords are driving leads to call your business. How it works is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Customer searches on Google and finds your ads.</li>
<li>They see a unique phone number on your <a href="/landing-page-optimization">landing page</a> (and any other subsequent pages on the site).</li>
<li>The call rings through to your business.</li>
<li>The WordStream software uses that unique number to track back what efforts in your account (down to the keyword) triggered that conversion.</li>
</ol>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="af99a60b-319c-43db-91d8-e23b87ba91c2" data-langcode="und">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ws-call-tracking-process-1.png" alt="WordStream Call Tracking process" width="883" height="534" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Traditionally, when a person clicks on your ad and arrives at the landing page, that is the end of the information trail that AdWords provides to you. If that visitor calls you instead of filling out a form on your landing page, you have no way of knowing that your ad was connected to that call. With call tracking, you can follow those potential conversion interactions with your company’s web presence further. WordStream’s <a href="/adwords-call-tracking">AdWords call tracking software</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uses unique numbers placed on your landing page, with each number tied back to the corresponding keyword, ad, landing page, etc.</li>
<li>Allows you to see which campaign, ad group, ad, match type and keyword drove the visitor to that landing page.</li>
<li>Records received phone calls so you can listen back to understand why leads are reaching out to your business and maintain quality control.</li>
<li>Notifies you when an incoming call is from PPC, eliminating the guess work in knowing if your paid campaigns are driving calls to your business.</li>
</ul>

<h2>AdWords Call Extensions</h2>
<p><em>AdWords Call Extensions</em> allow you to show your business number in your ad, since Google no longer allows advertisers to put their phone numbers in the ad text. Call extensions are the only way available to display this additional information and to give customers more reasons to click on your ad over others. The call extension is displayed as a clickable call button on mobile devices so potential leads can call directly from the Google search results.</p>
<p>The call extension:</p>
<ul>
<li>Displays your business phone number with your ad</li>
<li>Costs the same as a click to the ad</li>
<li>Has a Click-to-Call button on mobile devices</li>
</ul>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="ddcfcbf4-34f5-4a0c-8335-103eebe36226" data-langcode="und">

</article>
</div>
<h2>AdWords Call Forwarding</h2>
<p><em>AdWords Call Forwarding</em> is a feature within call extensions that reports the calls received. It tracks calls received through the ad and it provides information like area code, the time the call was placed, how long the call lasted, and if the call was connected. There is no other lead detail information provided with this offering.</p>
<p>Call forwarding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reports the calls received through call extensions</li>
<li>Allows you to see caller area code, call start, end time, duration and whether the call was connected</li>
<li>Uses a unique forwarding number</li>
<li>Reports a call as a conversion (if it hits the time limit you set as a conversion)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Do we recommend you use all these service offerings in your PPC account?</h3>
<p>Absolutely! Using these offerings in your PPC campaigns will only help you be more visible to potential leads, provide the most complete information possible on who is calling your business and let you know which of your PPC efforts are most profitable. If your business receives incoming calls it is absolutely critical to use some or all of these features to make the most educated decisions when it comes to your PPC account.</p>
<h3>What are the benefits of Call Tracking?</h3>
<p>Following the entire customer PPC cycle and interactions with your online presence is essential to understand what areas of the account are bringing in the most business and which areas can be improved. Knowing which triggers in your account are leading to call conversions will give you the most accurate measure of your PPC ROI and allow you to make improvements based on real data.</p>
<p>Implementing Call Tracking will give you access to the lead report where you can learn more information about how potential customer are reaching your business and the type of clients your business is converting. Likewise with the call recording feature you can assess the quality of the calls coming in, allowing you to optimize your accounts to better serve your converting customers, and it’s also an effective tool for training purposes.</p>
