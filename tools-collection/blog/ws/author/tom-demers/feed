					<description><![CDATA[<p>It's not obvious, but branded searches are actually big business, for both Google and for brands. How much are they worth, and how will the move to mobile change the way we think about brand searches?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I initially started working in SEO, I was working for then-unknown start-ups (including this one), and branded searches seemed to me to be the most boring part of SEO and PPC. Those searches are already there (they get created by other channels), you’re almost certainly going to rank for them in organic search, and you likely have to “defend” them in PPC. So who really cares about branded searches?</p>
<p>But as I did more work in SEO and PPC with companies of varying shapes and sizes, I quickly learned that <strong>for many sites branded searches make up a majority of their organic and paid traffic</strong>. Beyond that, for very large brands that traffic can be worth millions and millions of dollars.</p>
<p>I also learned that there are different variations of “branded searches” (e.g. “{brand name} reviews,” “{brand name} coupons,” etc.) that are valuable and can be trickier than one might expect for a brand itself to rank for and defend.</p>
<p>The one thing that’s particularly jumped out at me recently, though, is what an amazing growth opportunity branded searches are for Google as a company.</p>

</div>
<p>Many people (though <a href="http://www.digitalexaminer.com/google-consumer-confidence-report/">not most</a>, it turns out) know that a vast majority of <a href="/articles/google-earnings">Google’s (and Alphabet’s) revenues</a> come from AdWords, and specifically paid search. And the assumption is of course that that spend is because of the efficacy of search advertising. Lots of insurance companies want to be in front of people who are actively searching for things like “best life insurance plans.”</p>
<p>I own a search marketing consulting company, and I also own multiple web properties whose traffic is driven primarily by search, so I certainly believe in the power and value of unbranded search traffic. I also think that <strong>not everyone realizes just how much of Google’s revenue is driven by branded search</strong>.</p>
<p>And I further think that not everyone realizes that a general move to <em>mobile</em> searches represents a large opportunity (in the very least in the short term) for Google to grow revenues aggressively on branded searches.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<h2>The Relationship Between Mobile and Brand Searches</h2>
<p>The number of people searching on mobile devices varies by industry and topic, but according to Google statements and Hitwise data mobile is now <a href="http://searchengineland.com/report-nearly-60-percent-searches-now-mobile-devices-255025">responsible for more than half of all Google searches</a> (and likely more like 60%+). It’s not controversial to assume that that number will continue to grow.</p>
<p>Given all of this, I wanted to look into two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much are branded searches <em>actually worth</em> to Google (and to the brands in question and their competitors)?</li>
<li>What do Google search results for some of the most valuable branded terms look like on mobile versus desktop?</li>
</ul>
<p>So in this post I’ll walk through some estimates on the actual value of branded searches, as well as take you screenshot-by-screenshot through what appears to be in the billions of dollars worth of branded searches on desktop versus mobile to show you why I suspect much of the search traffic on those specific terms will be shifting from organic to paid (thus generating lots of advertising revenue for Google).</p>
<h2>How Much Are Branded Searches Actually Worth?</h2>
<p>To start with, I looked at the branded traffic and clicks available for each of the top five advertisers in <a href="/articles/google-earnings">Google’s most profitable industries</a>, according to a WordStream study from a few years ago. This obviously doesn’t give us a comprehensive picture of every brand search on Google, and there are likely some other brands who have more <a href="/blog/ws/2017/01/23/keyword-search-volume">search volume</a> and potentially <a href="/blog/ws/2017/06/27/most-expensive-keywords">higher costs</a>, but I thought it was a good starting place to begin to get a sense of the opportunity here.</p>
<p>Here is the projected estimated data for branded searches for these 50 companies:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="82a1d412-642a-4288-afe9-41463dd7cf61" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-much-are-branded-searches-worth1.jpg" alt="cost value of brand searches on google" width="800" height="1613" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Estimated costs for top brand searches</em></p>
<p>A few notes on the data here:</p>
<ul>
<li>These are all exact match forecasts from Google’s Keyword Planner, so the global branded search volume for modified versions of these terms would likely be quite a bit higher.</li>
<li>These are of course very rough estimates, for example with Gifts.com the tool had some difficulty estimating branded traffic given that much of that would wind up as type-in traffic.</li>
<li>The brands themselves would likely have much lower costs per click on these terms (as they’d have very high <a href="/quality-score">Quality Scores</a>), and to get a sense of the global market we ratcheted bids and budget up to extremely high levels. The brand would get most of the clicks, so the numbers here are almost certainly inflated.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of that said, I found the numbers interesting. Over $171 million <strong>per month</strong> for just 50 brands – that’s over $2 billion annually. For a company that makes <a href="http://marketingland.com/goog-26-billion-q4-revenue-beats-expectations-earnings-204809">90 billion</a> that’s just a few percentage points of total annual revenue, but think of the aggregate market for brand searches across every consumer brand, Fortune 500 company, local business, etc. Seems like a potentially significant piece of a pretty large pie.</p>
<p>So we understand that these branded searches are potentially big business for Google. Now let’s take a look at how searchers are experiencing them (and what it may mean for these brands).</p>
<h2>What Do Branded Searches Look Like on Mobile Versus Desktop?</h2>
<p>Now let’s look specifically at the <a href="/serp">SERP</a> layout for the branded search result for the company in each of Google’s top spending industries (again according to the above-linked WordStream study) that was spending the most on paid search (with a few exceptions where the branded search had a URL as the brand name – e.g. Booking.com – in which case I grabbed the second result).</p>
<p>Let’s go screenshot-by-screenshot through what I’m seeing on my personal laptop and my personal phone (so of note is that some of the search results will be based on my search history and obviously this isn’t a boil-the-earth, comprehensive review of every possible screen size or device, etc.).</p>
<h3>State Farm</h3>
<p>First up is State Farm.</p>
<p>Their desktop branded search is really pretty good – they’re having to spend to have their ad (which takes up a good chunk of real estate) featured on the SERP, but they also have their site, a site search bar, and a description of their company (including their URL) featured prominently.</p>
<p>When I look at their mobile branded result, meanwhile, their ad is literally the only thing I can see on my screen. If I’m a typical user trying to get in touch with State Farm or navigate to their site, it seems pretty unlikely I’d make my way down to their website without making Google some money in most instances.</p>

</div>
<h3>Amazon</h3>
<p>Amazon is probably getting the best deal of the lot in the move from desktop to mobile! Their desktop result is relatively good as well (again featuring company info and getting to their organic listing quickly), but their mobile result (for me anyway) is completely organic! As we run through the rest of the branded searches we’ll see that this is not the norm.</p>

</div>
<h3>Expedia</h3>
<p>Expedia is effectively the inverse of Amazon here on my screens, moving from a very organic-friendly desktop layout (with a big organic result, company info, and stories about the company) to a single big branded ad.</p>
<p><strong>Desktop:</strong></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e7815bef-9e0d-4973-8c3f-544df337e52e" data-langcode="en">

</div>
<h3>University of Phoenix</h3>
<p>The University of Phoenix probably has the toughest before/after on the list, where they’re going from a big organic result, a company Twitter account, and a local campus listing to…a competitor’s ad!</p>
<p>Below the competitor’s ad is another listing from an affiliate site that compares different colleges. Not exactly where you want to be driving all of the people who have seen or heard all your TV and radio commercials.</p>

</div>
<h3>Lowe’s</h3>
<p>Lowe’s is getting one of the better deals of the ten sites I looked at with the move from desktop to mobile. While their desktop result is very good (lots of organic real estate, nice company info, and a list of stories about the company), the mobile result also only features a map and the local Lowe’s locations nearest to me.</p>
<p><strong>Desktop:</strong></p>

</div>
<h3>Hewlett Packard</h3>
<p>HP’s desktop result is fairly ad-heavy and features two reseller/competitors, but I can at least see the organic listing and some general company info here. In their mobile result I’m getting virtually all ad, with the tip of some news results: here again it seems likely that many mobile searches will navigate to the site through paid search clicks.</p>
<p><strong>Desktop:</strong></p>

<h3>Autotrader</h3>
<p>Autotrader’s desktop search allows me to quickly see the organic site (along with multiple site links) and information about the company in addition to the prominently displayed ad. The immediately visible portion of the mobile SERP? All ad.</p>
<p><strong>Desktop:</strong></p>

</div>
<h3>AT&amp;T</h3>
<p>AT&amp;T’s desktop search once again has a large ad from the brand, but allows me to quickly see the organic listing, a site search box, and sitelinks as well as general company info in the right nav.</p>
<p>Mobile? Just an ad.</p>
<p><strong>Desktop:</strong></p>

</div>
<h3>Uline</h3>
<p>Uline continues this trend with a prominent organic listing below the paid listing, organic site links, a site search bar, and company info.</p>
<p>Juxtaposed against the visible part of the mobile SERP: only their ad.</p>
<p><strong>Desktop:</strong></p>

<h3>1-800-Flowers</h3>
<p>1 800 Flowers is another victim of the move to mobile on my devices: they go from an ad-heavy desktop SERP (complete with shopping results and a couple of competitor ads) that at least has a sliver of above-the-fold organic hope, to an above-the-fold experience where nothing but a <a href="/blog/ws/2017/08/01/facebook-competitive-advertising">competitor ad</a> is featured.</p>

<p>Now 10 sets of screenshots is obviously not a comprehensive look at all branded searches on desktop versus mobile, but given how much money these brand searches represent, it’s striking that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only <strong>one</strong> of these brands saw their above-the-fold branded result get less ad dense (Amazon)</li>
<li>Only <strong>one</strong> even saw the result stay effectively neutral (Lowe’s)</li>
<li>The <strong>other eight</strong> effectively moved from having their organic listing visible on desktop to having their entire above-the-fold experience be an ad on mobile, and two of these brands actually have competitors taking up almost the entire above-the-fold area on mobile searches!</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the same number of brands that effectively lost their branded search to competitors as those that saw a neutral to positive change in ad-real estate when looking at desktop versus mobile.</p>
<h2>What Does All of This Mean for the Brands Themselves?</h2>
<p>So it seems pretty clear that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Branded searches are increasingly moving from desktop to mobile</li>
<li>These branded searches are a big business for Google and very valuable for brands themselves (and their competitors)</li>
<li>Some of the largest brands in the world have much more ad-heavy mobile results for branded searches than they enjoy on desktop</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the idea that these brands are suffering from less advantageous search results as branded traffic moves from desktop to mobile, it also occurred to me that even if they can protect their branded queries and get mobile searchers to their sites, this could be a major issue for these brands beyond simply having to pay more for the same branded traffic.</p>
<p>Why? Well for many sites, the mobile versions of their websites aren’t as well built and well maintained as the desktop version, and in many instances <strong>mobile traffic doesn’t monetize as well as desktop traffic</strong>, even for <a href="/blog/ws/2014/06/30/commercial-intent-keywords">high-intent terms</a> like branded searches.</p>
<p>We obviously can’t peak behind the scenes at how effectively each of these companies are monetizing different types of traffic, but I thought it would be interesting to look at how Google’s own tools view the performance of these different brands on mobile and desktop. So I ran each of the sites through one of <a href="http://searchengineland.com/9-time-money-saving-seo-tools-pay-17-use-free-271883">my favorite</a> SEO tools, <a href="http://www.digitalexaminer.com/url-profiler-review-features-tips-pricing/">URL Profiler</a>, and got the Google Page Speed Insights mobile and desktop page speed scores for each site.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Mobile vs. desktop page speed scores for top brands</em></p>
<p>These scores clearly aren’t definitive proof that these sites are or aren’t monetizing mobile traffic less efficiently than desktop traffic (and Google Speed Scores generally <a href="https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/why-trying-to-get-95-on-google-pagespeed-insights-will-drive-you-mad/">are an imperfect measurement</a>), but Google has certainly dialed up the <a href="http://www.digitalexaminer.com/101-page-and-site-speed-optimization-tips/">impact of page speed and usability</a>.</p>
<p>All of that said: 40 of the 48 sites listed here (the other two had been acquired or moved to other URLs) have page speed scores that are lower on mobile than on desktop, and in some cases significantly so.</p>
<h2>So what’s the takeaway from all of this?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately I don’t think there’s much that most companies can do about Google’s more aggressive ad placement in mobile SERPs, but one area that companies in this predicament can focus is to <strong>seriously consider investing more in the performance and user experience of your site for mobile users</strong>.</p>
<p>Take a look at your analytics and see how traffic by device is trending over the last 12-24 months, look at your profit/revenue per user by device, look for <a href="http://www.digitalexaminer.com/slow-website-improve-page-speeds/">low-hanging fruit for improving page speed</a>, and then think about how much time, energy, and money you dedicate to development for desktop versus mobile. Based on this data it seems like there’s a strong chance you may want to reallocate some of those efforts.</p>

<a id="what_is_seo"></a></p>
<h2>SEO Basics Part 1: What is SEO and why is it important?</h2>
<p>You’ve likely heard of SEO, and if you haven’t already, you could obtain a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">quick Wikipedia definition</a> of the term, but understanding that SEO is “the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a search engine&#8217;s unpaid results” doesn’t really help you answer important questions for your business and your website, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you, for your site or your company’s site, “optimize” for search engines?</li>
<li>How do you increase your site&#8217;s organic search visibility, so it&#8217;s easy for your content to be found?</li>
<li>How do you know how much time to spend on SEO?</li>
<li>How can you differentiate “good” SEO advice from “bad” or harmful SEO advice?</li>
</ul>
<p>What’s likely interesting to you as a business owner or employee is how you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/01/seo-case-study">actually leverage SEO</a> to help drive more relevant traffic, leads, sales, and ultimately revenue and profit for your business. That’s what we’ll focus on in this guide.</p>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><p><strong>Free guide</strong> <strong>&gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website</a></strong></p></div></div>
<h3>Why should you care about SEO?</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/">Lots and lots of people</a> search for things. That traffic can be extremely powerful for a business not only because there is a lot of traffic, but because there is a lot of <strong>very specific, high-intent traffic</strong>.</p>
<p>If you sell blue widgets, would you rather buy a billboard so anyone with a car in your area sees your ad (whether they will ever have any interest in blue widgets or not), or show up every time anyone in the world types “buy blue widgets” into a search engine? Probably the latter, because those people have <a href="/blog/ws/2014/06/30/commercial-intent-keywords"><em>commercial intent</em></a>, meaning <strong>they are standing up and saying that they want to buy something you offer</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/keyword-intent-four-types.png" alt="the four types of keyword intent" width="720" height="441" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61610" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/keyword-intent-four-types.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/keyword-intent-four-types-480x294.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>People are searching for any manner of things directly related to your business. Beyond that, your prospects are also searching for all kinds of things that are only loosely related to your business. These represent even more opportunities to connect with those folks and help answer their questions, solve their problems, and become a trusted resource for them.</p>
<p>Are you more likely to get your widgets from a trusted resource who offered great information each of the last four times you turned to Google for help with a problem, or someone you’ve never heard of?<a href="https://localiq.com/localiq-grader?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em></em></strong></a></p>
<h3>What <em>actually</em> works for driving traffic from search engines?</h3>
<p>First it’s important to note that Google is responsible for <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Market-Rankings/comScore-Releases-February-2015-US-Desktop-Search-Engine-Rankings">most</a> of the search engine traffic in the world (though there is always <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/02/02/time-to-panic-yet-yahoo-took-more-u-s-search-share-from-google-in-january/">some flux</a> in the actual numbers). This may vary from niche to niche, but it’s likely that Google is the dominant player in the search results that your business or website would want to show up in, and the best practices outlined in this guide will help position your site and its content to rank in other search engines, as well.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/seo-basics-search-engine-market-share.png" alt="seo basics - search engine market share" width="600" height="506" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56021" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/seo-basics-search-engine-market-share.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/seo-basics-search-engine-market-share-480x405.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<article></article>
</div>
<p>Regardless of what search engine you use, search results are constantly changing. Google particularly has updated <a href="http://searchengineland.com/library/google/google-penguin-update">lots of things</a> surrounding <a href="http://searchengineland.com/library/google/google-panda-update">how they rank websites</a> by way of <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-hummingbird-172816">lots of different animal names</a> recently, and a lot of the easiest and cheapest ways to get your pages to rank in search results have become extremely risky in recent years.</p>
<p>So what works? How does Google determine which pages to return in response to what people search for? How do you get all of this valuable traffic to your site?</p>
<p>Google’s algorithm is extremely complex, and I’ll share some links for anyone looking to dive deeper into how Google ranks sites at the end of this section, but at an extremely high level:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google is looking for pages that contain<strong> high-quality, relevant information</strong> about the searcher’s query.</li>
<li>They determine relevance by “crawling” (or reading) your website’s content and evaluating (algorithmically) whether that content is relevant to what the searcher is looking for, mostly based on the keywords it contains.</li>
<li>They determine “quality” by a number of means, but prominent among those is still the number and quality of other websites that link to your page and your site as a whole. To put it extremely simply: If the only sites that link to your blue widget site are blogs that no one else on the Web has linked to, and my blue widget site gets links from trusted places that are linked to frequently, like CNN.com, my site will be more trusted (and assumed to be higher quality) than yours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Increasingly, additional elements are being weighed by Google’s algorithm to determine where your site will rank, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How people engage with your site (Do they find the information they need and stay on your site, or bounce back to <a href="/blog/ws/2015/03/09/google-search-page">the search page</a> and click on another link? Or do they just ignore your listing in search results altogether and never click-through?)</li>
<li>Your site’s <a href="/blog/ws/2011/08/23/page-speed-conversion-rate-optimization">loading speed</a> and “mobile friendliness”</li>
<li>How much unique content you have (versus very “thin” low-value content or <a href="/blog/ws/2017/10/06/duplicate-content">duplicate content</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are hundreds of ranking factors Google’s algorithm considers in response to searches, and they are constantly updating and refining their process.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/moz-ranking-factors-seo-basics.gif" alt="google ranking factors seo" width="1163" height="1038" /></div>
<p>The good news is, you don’t have to be a search engine scholar to rank for valuable terms in search results. We’ll walk through <strong>proven, repeatable best practices</strong> for optimizing websites for search that can help you drive targeted traffic through search without having to reverse-engineer the core competency of one of the world’s most valuable companies.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in learning more about how search engines work, there are a ton of great resources available, including:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Now, back to SEO basics! Let’s get into the actual SEO tactics and strategies that will help you get more traffic from search engines.</p>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><p>Check your website against Google ranking factors with the <a href="https://localiq.com/localiq-grader?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free LOCALiQ Website Grader!</a></p></div></div>
<p><a id="keyword_targeting"></a></p>
<h2>SEO Basics Part 2: Keyword research and keyword targeting best practices</h2>
<p>The first step in <a href="https://localiq.com/products/search-engine-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search engine optimization</a> is really to determine what it is you’re actually optimizing for. This means <strong>identifying the terms people are searching for (also known as “keywords”)</strong> that you want your website to rank for in search engines like Google.</p>
<p>Sounds simple enough, right? I want my widget company to show up when people look for “widgets,” and maybe when they type in things like “buy widgets.” Onto step three!</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/seo-basics-search-volume-trends.png" alt="search volume for seo keywords" width="1137" height="262" /></div>
<p>Unfortunately it’s not quite that simple. There are a few key factors to take into account when determining the keywords you want to target on your site:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Search Volume</strong> – The first factor to consider is how many people (if any) are actually searching for a given keyword. The more people there are searching for a keyword, the bigger the audience you stand to reach. Conversely, if no one is searching for a keyword, there is no audience available to find your content through search.</li>
<li><strong>Relevance</strong> – If a term is frequently searched for that’s great: but what if it’s not completely relevant <em>to your prospects</em>? Relevance seems straightforward at first: if you’re selling enterprise email marketing automation software you don’t want to show up for searches that don’t have anything to do with your business, like “pet supplies.” But what about terms like “email marketing software”? This might intuitively seem like a great description of what you do, but if you’re selling to Fortune 100 companies, most of the traffic for this very competitive term will be searchers who don’t have any interest in buying your software (and the folks you do want to reach might never buy your expensive, complex solution based on a simple Google search). Conversely, you might think a tangential keyword like “best enterprise PPC marketing solutions” is totally irrelevant to your business since you don’t sell PPC marketing software. But if your prospect is a CMO or marketing director, getting in front of them with a helpful resource on evaluating pay-per-click tools could be a great “first touch” and an excellent way to start a relationship with a prospective buyer.</li>
<li><strong>Competition</strong> – As with any business opportunity, in SEO you want to consider the potential costs and likelihood of success. For SEO, this means understanding the relative competition (and likelihood to rank) for specific terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>First you need to understand who your prospective customers are and what they’re likely to search for. If you don’t already understand who your prospects are, thinking about that <a href="http://offers.hubspot.com/free-template-creating-buyer-personas">is a good place to start</a>, for your business in general but also for SEO.</p>
<p>From there you want to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>What types of things are they interested in?</li>
<li>What problems do they have?</li>
<li>What type of language do they use to describe the things that they do, the tools that they use, etc.?</li>
<li>Who else are they buying things from (this means your competitors, but also could mean tangential, related tools – for the email marketing company, think other enterprise marketing tools)?</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve answered these questions, you’ll have an initial “seed list” of possible keywords and domains to help you get additional keyword ideas and to put some search volume and competition metrics around.</p>
<p>Take the list of core ways that your prospects and customers describe what you do, and start to input those into keyword tools like <a href="/keyword-tool-google">Google’s</a> own keyword tool or tools like <a href="http://ubersuggest.org/">Uber Suggest</a> or <a href="/keywords">WordStream’s keyword tool</a>:<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/best-free-keyword-research-tools-wordstream-free-keyword-tool.png" alt="best keyword research tools: wordstream free keyword tool" width="720" height="406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49521" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/best-free-keyword-research-tools-wordstream-free-keyword-tool.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/best-free-keyword-research-tools-wordstream-free-keyword-tool-480x271.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /><br />
You can find a more comprehensive list of keyword tools below, but the main idea is that in this initial step, you’ll want to run a number of searches with a variety of different keyword tools. You can also use competitive keyword tools like <a href="http://www.semrush.com/">SEM Rush</a> to see what terms your competitors are ranking for. These tools look at thousands of different search results, and will show you each search term they’ve seen your competitor ranking in Google for lately. Here’s what SEM Rush shows for marketing automation provider Marketo:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/sem-rush-data-seo-basics.png" alt="SEMRush Keyword Data" width="783" height="726" /></div>
<p>Again: this doesn’t just have to be something you look at for competitors. You could look at related tools that are selling to the same market for <a href="/blog/ws/2015/02/12/blog-topic-generators">content ideas</a>, and even look at the major niche publishers who talk about your topic (and that your prospects are reading) and see what kinds of keywords those sites are driving traffic for.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you have an existing site, you’re likely getting some traffic from search engines already. If that’s the case, you can use some of your own keyword data to help you understand which terms are driving traffic (and which you might be able to rank a bit better for).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Google has <a href="http://www.notprovidedcount.com/what-is-not-provided/">stopped delivering a lot of the information about what people are searching for to analytics providers</a>, but you can use SEM Rush (or similar tools, such as <a href="http://www.spyfu.com/">SpyFu</a>) <strong>on your own site</strong> to get a sense of the terms you’re ranking for and their estimated search volume. Google also makes a bit more of this data available in their free Google Search Console interface (if you haven’t set up an account, this is a very valuable <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/17/amazon-seo">SEO</a> tool both for unearthing search query data and for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/20/seo-audit">diagnosing various technical SEO issues</a> – more on <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6001104?hl=en">Google Search Console here</a>).</p>
<p>Once Google Search Console is set up, you can navigate to <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/top-search-queries">this link</a> when logged in and see the search queries that are driving traffic to your site:<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/seo-basics-google-search-console-query-report.png" alt="seo basics: google search console top queries report" width="800" height="547" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56022" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/seo-basics-google-search-console-query-report.png 800w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/seo-basics-google-search-console-query-report-480x328.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw" /><br />
These could be good terms to focus additional content promotion and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/04/internal-linking">internal linking</a> around (more on each of those topics later), and could also be great “seed keywords” to help you get more great ideas about what to target.</p>
<p>Once you’ve taken the time to understand how your prospects talk and what they search for, have looked at the keywords driving traffic to your competitors and related sites, and have looked at the terms driving traffic to your own site, you need to work to understand <strong>which terms you can conceivably rank for</strong> and <strong>where the best opportunities actually lie</strong>.</p>
<p>Determining the relative competition of a keyword can be a fairly complex task. At a very high level, you need to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>How trusted and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/12/domain-authority">authoritative</a> other entire sites that will be competing to rank for the same term are (in other words: how many links does the whole site get, and how high quality, trusted, and relevant are those linking sites?)</li>
<li>How well aligned they are with the keyword itself (do they offer a great answer to that searcher’s question)</li>
<li>How popular and authoritative each <strong>individual page</strong> in that search result is (in other words: how many links does the page itself have, and how high quality, trusted, and relevant are those linking sites?)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can dive deeper into the process of determining how competitive keywords are in <a href="http://backlinko.com/keyword-competition">Backlinko’s in-depth guide</a> or by using WordStream founder <a href="/blog/ws/2014/08/06/keyword-research-tips">Larry Kim’s competitive index formula</a> (tip number 3).</p>
<p>There are also a variety of different tools (most of them paid) that offer keyword difficulty scores:</p>

</ul>
<p>And while it’s more advanced in nature, Nick Eubanks’ <a href="http://www.seonick.net/rank-potential/">post about understanding rank potential</a> offers a great in-depth look at not only understanding but creating an actionable formula for determining keyword competition and your own site’s actual likelihood of <a href="/blog/ws/2012/11/14/how-to-rank-for-a-keyword">ranking for a term</a>.</p>

<h2>SEO Basics Part 3: On-page optimization</h2>
<p>Once you have your keyword list, the next step is actually implementing your targeted keywords into your site’s content. Each page on your site should be targeting a core term, and a “basket” of related terms. Here&#8217;s what a page optimized for on-page SEO looks like:</p>

Let’s look at a few critical, basic on-page elements you’ll want to understand as you think about how to drive search engine traffic to your website:</p>
<h3>Title tags</h3>
<p>While Google is working to better understand the actual meaning of a page and de-emphasizing (and even punishing) aggressive and manipulative use of keywords, including the term (and related terms) that you want to rank for in your pages is still valuable. And the single most impactful place you can put your keyword is your page’s title tag.</p>
<p>The title tag is <strong>not</strong> your page’s primary headline. The headline you see on the page is typically an H1 (or possibly an H2) HTML element. The title tag is what you can see at the very top of your browser, and is populated by your page’s source code in a <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/79812?hl=en">meta tag</a>:<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/seo-basics-title-tag.png" alt="seo basics - title tag vs page title example" width="800" height="475" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56023" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/seo-basics-title-tag.png 800w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/seo-basics-title-tag-480x285.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw" /><br />
The length of a title tag that Google will show will vary (it’s based on pixels, not character counts) but <a href="http://moz.com/blog/new-title-tag-guidelines-preview-tool">in general 55-60 characters is a good rule of thumb here</a>. If possible you want to work in your core keyword, and if you can do it in a natural and compelling way, add some related modifiers around that term as well. Keep in mind though: the title tag will frequently be what a searcher sees in search results for your page. It’s the “headline” in organic search results, so you also want to take <a href="/blog/ws/2014/07/17/headline-writing">how clickable your title tag is</a> into account.</p>
<h3>Meta descriptions</h3>
<p>While the title tag is effectively your search listing’s headline, the meta description (another meta HTML element that can be updated in your site’s code, but isn’t seen on your actual page) is effectively your site’s additional ad copy. Google takes some liberties with what they display in search results, so your meta description may not always show, but if you have a compelling description of your page that would make folks searching likely to click, you can greatly increase traffic. (Remember: showing up in search results is just the first step! You still need to get searchers to come to your site, and then actually take the action you want.)</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a real world meta description showing in search results:</p>
<div></div>

<div></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><em>The meta description for our Google Ads Grader is a concise description of the tool, with clear benefits and a call to action — like good ad copy!</em></div>
<h3>Body content</h3>
<p>The actual content of your page itself is, of course, very important. Different types of pages will have different “jobs” – your <a href="/blog/ws/2017/10/23/cornerstone-content-guide">cornerstone content</a> asset that you want lots of folks to link to needs to be very different than your support content that you want to make sure your users find and get an answer from quickly. That said, Google has been increasingly favoring certain types of content, and as you build out any of the pages on your site, there are a few things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thick and Unique Content</strong> – There is no magic number in terms of word count, and if you have a few pages of content on your site with a handful to a couple hundred words you won’t be falling out of Google’s good graces, but in general recent <a href="http://searchengineland.com/library/google/google-panda-update">Panda updates</a> in particular favor longer, unique content. If you have a large number (think thousands) of extremely short (50-200 words of content) pages or lots of <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2015/03/an-update-on-doorway-pages.html">duplicated content where nothing changes but the page’s title tag</a> and say a line of text, that could get you in trouble. Look at the entirety of your site: are a large percentage of your pages thin, duplicated and low value? If so, try to identify a way to “thicken” those pages, or check your analytics to see how much traffic they’re getting, and simply exclude them (<a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/93710?hl=en">using a noindex meta tag</a>) from search results to keep from having it appear to Google that you’re trying to flood their index with lots of low value pages in an attempt to have them rank.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement</strong> – Google is increasingly weighting engagement and <a href="/blog/ws/2014/07/22/content-marketing-metrics">user experience metrics</a> more heavily. You can impact this by making sure your content answers the questions searchers are asking so that they’re likely to stay on your page and engage with your content. Make sure your pages load quickly and don’t have design elements (such as overly aggressive ads above the content) that would be likely to turn searchers off and send them away.</li>
<li><strong>“Sharability”</strong> – Not every single piece of content on your site will be linked to and shared hundreds of times. But in the same way you want to be careful of not rolling out large quantities of pages that have thin content, you want to consider who would be likely to share and link to new pages you’re creating on your site <em>before you roll them out</em>. Having large quantities of pages that aren’t <a href="/blog/ws/2014/06/19/social-sharing">likely to be shared</a> or linked to doesn’t position those pages to rank well in search results, and doesn’t help to create a good picture of your site as a whole for search engines, either.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Alt attributes</h3>
<p>How you mark up your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/08/image-seo">images</a> can impact not only the way that search engines perceive your page, but also how much search traffic from image search your site generates. An alt attribute is an HTML element that allows you to provide alternative information for an image if a user can’t view it. Your images may break over time (files get deleted, users have difficulty connecting to your site, etc.) so having a useful description of the image can be helpful from an overall usability perspective. This also gives you another opportunity – outside of your content – to help search engines understand what your page is about.</p>
<p>You don’t want to “<a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66358?hl=en">keyword stuff</a>” and cram your core keyword and every possible variation of it into your alt attribute. In fact, if it doesn’t fit naturally into the description, don’t include your target keyword here at all. Just be sure not to skip the alt attribute, and try to give a thorough, accurate description of the image (imagine you’re describing it to someone who can’t see it – that’s what it’s there for!).</p>
<p>By writing naturally about your topic, you’re avoiding “over-optimization” filters (in other words: it doesn’t make it look like you’re trying to trick Google into ranking your page for your target keyword) and you give yourself a better chance to rank for valuable <a href="/long-tail-keywords">modified “long tail” variations</a> of your core topic.</p>
<h3>URL structure</h3>
<p>Your site’s URL structure can be important both from a tracking perspective (you can more easily segment data in reports using a segmented, logical URL structure), and a shareability standpoint (shorter, descriptive URLs are easier to copy and paste and tend to get mistakenly cut off less frequently). Again: don’t work to cram in as many keywords as possible; create a short, descriptive URL.</p>
<p>Moreover: if you don’t have to, don’t change your URLs. Even if your URLs aren’t “pretty,” if you don’t feel as though they’re negatively impacting users and your business in general, don’t change them to be more keyword focused for “better SEO.” If you do have to change your URL structure, make sure to use the proper (301 permanent) type of redirect.

</ul>
<h3>Schema and markup</h3>
<p>Finally, once you have all of the standard on-page elements taken care of, you can consider going a step further and better helping Google (and other search engines, which also recognize schema) to understand your page.</p>
<p>Schema markup does not make your page show up higher in search results (it’s not a ranking factor, currently). It does give your listing some additional “real estate” in the search results, the way ad extensions do for your <a href="/blog/ws/2015/04/21/adwords-ads">Google Ads (formerly known as AdWords) ads</a>.</p>
<p>In some search results, if no one else is using schema, you can get a nice advantage in click-through rate by virtue of the fact that your site is showing things like ratings while others don’t. In other search results, where everyone is using schema, having reviews may be “table stakes” and you might be hurting your <a href="/blog/ws/2016/05/10/google-ctr">Google CTR</a> by omitting them:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/learn-seo-basics-schema-markup.png" alt="schema for seo" width="745" height="404" /></div>
<p>There are a variety of different types of markup you can include on your site – most probably won’t apply to your business, but it’s likely that at least one form of markup will apply to at least some of your site’s pages.</p>

<h2>SEO Basics Part 4: Information architecture and internal linking</h2>
<p>Information architecture refers to how you organize the pages on your website. The way that you organize your website and interlink between your pages can impact how various content on your site ranks in response to searches.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that search engines largely perceive links as “votes of confidence” and a means to help understand both what a page is about, and how important it is (and how trusted it should be).</p>
<p>Search engines also look at the actual text you use to link to pages, called <a href="/anchor-text">anchor text</a> – using descriptive text to link to a page on your site helps Google understand what that page is about (but in a <a href="http://searchengineland.com/library/google/google-penguin-update">post-Penguin world</a> especially, be sure not to be overly aggressive in cramming your keywords into linking text).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/seo-basics-anchor-text.png" alt="seo basics - anchor text example" width="720" height="163" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56216" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/seo-basics-anchor-text.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/seo-basics-anchor-text-480x109.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In the same way that a link from CNN is an indication that your site could be important, if you are linking to a specific page aggressively from various areas on your site, that’s an indication to search engines that that specific page is very important to your site. Additionally: the pages on your site that have <strong>the most external votes</strong> (links from other, trusted sites) have the most power to help the other pages on your site rank in search results.</p>
<p>This relates back to a concept called “PageRank.” PageRank is no longer used in the same way it was when initially implemented, but if you’re looking to understand the topic more deeply here are some good resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.portent.com/blog/seo/pagerank-without-math.htm">A good math-free explanation of PageRank</a></li>
<li><a href="http://moz.com/blog/how-pagerank-works-why-the-original-pr-formula-may-be-flawed">A detailed breakdown of how PageRank works (from several years ago) with a number of helpful visuals</a></li>
<li><a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html">The original academic paper published by Google’s founders</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s walk through a quick example to help you understand the concept of how link equity (or the number and quality of links pointed to a page) impacts site architecture and how you link internally. Let’s imagine we have a snow removal site:</p>
<ol>
<li>We publish an amazing study on the impact of snow on construction in the winter in cold weather climates. It gets linked to from all over the web.</li>
<li>The study is published on our main snow removal site. All of the other pages are simple sales-oriented pages explaining various aspects of our company’s snow removal offerings. No external site has linked to any of these pages.</li>
<li>The study itself may be well-positioned to rank well in search results for various phrases. The sales-oriented pages much less so. By linking <strong>from</strong> our study <strong>to</strong> our most important sales-oriented pages, however, we can pass some of the trust and authority of our guide onto those pages. They won’t be as well positioned to rank in search results as our study, but they’ll be much better positioned than when they had no authoritative documents (on our site or on other sites) pointing to them. An important additional note here: in this example our most-linked to page is our fictitious study. In many cases, your most linked to page will be your home page (the page that people link to when they talk about you, when you get press, etc.) so <strong>being sure to link strategically to the most important pages on your site from your home page is very important</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Information architecture can be an extremely complex topic – particularly for larger sites – and there are a number of great additional resources below with more specific answers listed at the end of this section, but at a high level the most important things to keep in mind are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You want to understand</strong> <strong>your most linked-to pages</strong> (use tools like Ahrefs, Majestic SEO, or Moz and look at “top pages” reports to determine these).</li>
<li><strong>Keep your most important search pages (the pages you are using to target your most valuable keywords) “high up” in your information architecture</strong>: this means linking to them often in navigation elements and linking to them whenever possible from your most linked-to pages (e.g., make sure your home page and your site’s version of our hit snow study are linking to the most valuable pages on your site from a search perspective – your “money pages”).</li>
<li><strong>In general you want to have a “flat information architecture” for your site</strong> – meaning that you keep any pages that you want to have rank in search engines as few clicks as possible from your home page and most linked-to pages. See <a href="http://moz.com/blog/whiteboard-friday-flat-site-architecture">this older video</a> for a more in-depth explanation of how to flatten your site’s structure</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/seo-audit-website-architecture-example.png" alt="seo audit - website architecture" width="650" height="433" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55650" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/seo-audit-website-architecture-example.png 650w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/seo-audit-website-architecture-example-480x320.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></p>

<h2>SEO Basics Part 5: Content marketing and link building</h2>
<p>Since Google’s algorithm is still largely based on links, having a number of high-quality links to your site is obviously incredibly important in driving search traffic: you can do all the work you want on on-page and technical SEO, if you don’t have links to your site, you won’t show up in search results listings.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to get links to your site, but as Google and other search engines become more and more sophisticated, many of them have become extremely risky (even if they may still work in the short-term). If you are new to SEO and are looking to leverage the channel, these riskier and more aggressive means of trying to get links likely aren’t a good fit for your business, as you won’t know how to properly navigate the pitfalls and evaluate the risks. Furthermore, <strong>trying to create links specifically to manipulate Google rankings doesn’t create any other value for your business in the event that the search engine algorithms shift and your rankings disappear.</strong></p>
<p>A more sustainable approach to developing links is to focus on more general, sustainable marketing approaches such as creating and promoting useful content that also includes specific terms you’d want to rank for and engaging in traditional PR for your business.</p>
<p>The process of creating and promoting content that will get you links and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/20/social-signals-for-seo">social shares</a> is a labor-intensive one. Once again you’ll find more detailed step-by-step guides to various aspects of content marketing below, and there are a lot of different ways to effectively create content, help it to get discovered, and rank well in search results. Most approaches, however, will require you to walk through some variation of the following three core steps:</p>
<p><strong>RELATED:</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/20/seo-audit">How to Do an SEO Audit in 10 Easy Steps</a></p>
<h3>1. Identify and understand your linking and sharing audience</h3>
<p>The first thing you need to do in working to get traction for your content, is understand <strong>who</strong> is likely to link to and share your content. There are several tools to help you identify influencers within your niche who might share your content, but probably the most powerful is BuzzSumo:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/buzzsumo-seo-basics.png" alt="buzzsumo for seo" width="666" height="510" /></div>
<p>Similar tools include <a href="https://followerwonk.com/">FollowerWonk</a>, <a href="http://www.getlittlebird.com/">Little Bird</a> and <a href="https://ahrefs.com/">Ahrefs</a>. More detailed tutorials on using these tools to better understand your niche are included below.</p>
<p>The idea in leveraging these tools is to first identify the thought leaders and potential linkers in your space, and then <strong>understand what they share and link to</strong>. Find out what their problems are, what types of content they typically share, and start to think about how you can create something they would find valuable and want to share with their audience (who would also find it valuable).</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/influencer-marketing-advocates-vs-influencers-infographic.jpg" alt="Influencer marketing influencers versus advocates infographic" width="400" height="476" /></div>
<p>As you work through this process, start to think about what you can do for these influencers. How could you help them with their own projects? What can you do (unsolicited) that would help them achieve their own goals or what could you create or offer that would be of value to the audience <em>they</em> are creating content for and trying to help? Do you have access to unique data or knowledge that would help them do their jobs better? <strong>If you can consistently be of use to smart content creators in your niche, you’ll start to build powerful relationships that will pay dividends as you’re creating content</strong>.</p>
<p>Before you create a major piece of content, you should have already thought about how that content will get shared: who will share it, and why would they?</p>
<h3>2. Determine what content you can create and how you can promote it</h3>
<p>Next you have to try to understand what your own capabilities are, and what kind of content you can create that will be likely to be shared and promoted by others. A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/10/content-audit">content audit</a> may help with this.</p>
<p>A number of different types of content assets will be shareable:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create something that solves your prospects’ and your customers’ problems. </strong>In his post on <a href="http://www.matthewwoodward.co.uk/tutorials/how-i-built-a-top-100-blog-in-12-months/">how he built a top 100 blog</a>, Matthew Woodward outlines a good process for listening in on social media and forums to help find great blog topics.</li>
<li><strong>Reverse engineer what already works</strong>. By looking at what already works and creating something that’s a <a href="http://backlinko.com/skyscraper-technique">level or two better</a> in some way, you can help mitigate risk and make your content <a href="http://pointblankseo.com/fail-proof-content">as fail-proof as possible</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Make others look good.</strong> Highlight <a href="/blog/ws/2014/07/28/free-content-marketing-tools">great tools you use every day</a>. Get <a href="/blog/ws/2012/03/14/ppc-bid-management-guide">answers from smart folks in your niche to difficult questions</a> and share that content (while positioning them as experts). When you’ve highlighted someone or their product as a valuable resource, they’ll be likely to help you share and promote that content.</li>
</ul>
<p>Focus on creating different content assets that will be of real value, have a plan for promoting those assets, and don’t be shy about letting people who you’ve featured or whose audience would benefit from your resource know that it exists.</p>
<h3>3. Map your assets to specific keywords</h3>
<p>Finally, don’t forget about your keywords! This doesn’t mean that every time you create a great resource you need to cram in a keyword that doesn’t fit: it means that <strong>you can use keyword research as a means for discovering pain points </strong>(if people are turning to search engines to look for things, they want content that provides a great answer to their question!), and that as you create new assets you want to look for the different ways you can incorporate the language your prospects and customers are using into your assets: particularly those that will actually get linked to and shared (as you will increasingly need to get some sort of distribution for pages where you want them to rank for valuable keywords).</p>

<p>While <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/10/goal-talk-episode-5">basics</a> of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/23/seo-for-startups">SEO</a> like the most efficient ways to build links to drive search engine rankings have changed in recent years (and <a href="/blog?field_taxonomy_tid=183">content marketing</a> has become increasingly important) what many people would think of as more “traditional SEO” is still incredibly valuable in generating traffic from search engines. As we’ve already discussed, keyword research is still valuable, and technical SEO issues that keep Google and other search engines from understanding and ranking sites’ content are still prevalent.</p>
<p>Technical SEO for larger, more complicated sites is really its own discipline, but there are some common mistakes and issues that most sites face that even smaller to mid-sized businesses can benefit from being aware of.</p>

<p>Search engines are placing an increasing emphasis on having fast-loading sites – the good news is this is not only beneficial for search engines, but also for your users and your site’s conversion rates. Google has actually <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">created a useful tool</a> here to give you some specific suggestions on what to change on your site to address page speed issues.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/increase-traffic-to-your-website-pagespeed-insights.png" alt="increase traffic to your website - pagespeed insights score example" width="600" height="419" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54394" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/increase-traffic-to-your-website-pagespeed-insights.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/increase-traffic-to-your-website-pagespeed-insights-480x335.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Mobile friendliness</h3>
<p>If your site is driving (or could be driving) significant search engine traffic from mobile searches, how “mobile friendly” your site is will impact your rankings on mobile devices, which is a fast-growing segment. In some niches, mobile traffic already outweighs desktop traffic.</p>
<p>Google recently announced an algorithm update focused on this specifically. You can find out more about how to see what kind of mobile search engine traffic is coming to your site along with some specific recommendations for things to update <a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/small-business-owners-guide-googles-april-21-mobile-friendly-algorithm-update/129535/">in my recent post</a>, and here again Google offers <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/">a very helpful free tool to get recommendations on how to make your site more mobile-friendly</a>.</p>
<h3>Header response</h3>
<p>Header response codes are an important technical SEO issue. If you’re not particularly technical, this can be a complex topic (and again more thorough resources are listed below) but you want to make sure that working pages are returning the correct code to search engines (200), and that pages that are not found are also returning a code to represent that they are no longer present (a 404).</p>
<p>Getting these codes wrong can indicate to Google and other search engines that a “Page Not Found” page is in fact a functioning page, which makes it look like a thin or duplicated page, or even worse: <a href="http://www.hmtweb.com/marketing-blog/hidden-seo-danger-wrong-header-response-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can indicate to Google that all of your site’s content is actually 404s</a> (so that none of your pages are indexed and eligible to rank). You can use a <a href="http://tools.seobook.com/server-header-checker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">server header checker</a> to see the status codes that your pages are returning when search engines crawl them.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/server-header-checker-seo-basics-guide.png" alt="seo basics header check" width="493" height="461" /></div>
<div></div>
<h3>Redirects</h3>
<p>Improperly implementing redirects on your site can have a serious impact on search results. Whenever you can avoid it, you want to keep from moving your site’s content from one URL to another; in other words: if your content is on example.com/page, and that page is getting search engine traffic, you want to avoid moving all of the content to example.com/different-url/newpage.html, unless there is an <em>extremely strong business reason</em> that would outweigh a possible short-term or even long-term loss in search engine traffic.</p>
<p>If you do need to move content, you want to make sure that you implement permanent (or 301) redirects for content that is moving permanently, as temporary (or 302) redirects (which are frequently used by developers) indicate to Google that the move may not be permanent, and that they shouldn’t move all of the link equity and ranking power to the new URL. (Further, changing your URL structure could create <a href="/blog/ws/2010/06/02/how-to-find-and-fix-broken-links">broken links</a>, hurting your <a href="/blog/ws/2014/07/23/referral-traffic-links">referral traffic</a> streams and making it difficult for visitors to navigate your site.)</p>
<h3>Duplicate content</h3>
<p>Thin and duplicated content is another area of emphasis with Google’s recent Panda updates. By duplicating content (putting the same or near-identical content on multiple pages), you’re diluting link equity between two pages instead of concentrating it on one page, giving you less of a chance of ranking for competitive phrases with sites that are consolidating their link equity into a single document. Having large quantities of duplicated content makes your site look like it is cluttered with lower-quality (and possibly manipulative) content in the eyes of search engines.</p>
<p>There are a number of things that can cause duplicate or thin content. These problems can be difficult to diagnose, but you can look at Webmaster Tools under Search Appearance &gt; HTML Improvements to get a quick diagnosis.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/seo-basics-guide-duplicate-content.png" alt="duplicate content issues seo" width="710" height="493" /></div>
<p>And check out Google’s own <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66359?hl=en">breakdown on duplicate content</a>. Many paid SEO tools also offer a means for discovering duplicate content, such as <a href="http://moz.com/blog/how-to-defeat-duplicate-content-next-level">Moz analytics</a> and <a href="http://searchenginewatch.com/sew/how-to/2207433/how-to-quickly-identify-duplicate-content-with-a-site-crawl">Screaming Frog SEO Spider</a>.</p>
<h3>XML sitemap</h3>
<p>XML sitemaps can help Google and Bing understand your site and find all of its content. Just be sure not to include pages that aren’t useful, and know that submitting a page to a search engine in a sitemap doesn’t insure that the page will actually rank for anything. There are <a href="https://code.google.com/p/sitemap-generators/wiki/SitemapGenerators">a number</a> of <a href="https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/">free tools</a> to generate XML sitemaps.</p>
<h3>Robots.txt, meta noindex, and meta nofollow</h3>
<p>Finally, you can indicate to search engines how you want them to handle certain content on your site (for instance if you’d like them not to crawl a specific section of your site) in a <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062608?hl=en">robots.txt file</a>. This file likely already exists for your site at yoursite.com/robots.txt.</p>
<p>You want to make sure this file isn’t currently blocking anything you’d want a search engine to find from being added to their index, and you also can use the robots file to keep things like staging servers or swaths of thin or duplicate content that are valuable for internal use or customers from being indexed by search engines. You can use the <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/93710?hl=en">meta noindex</a> and <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-explains-the-noindex-nofollow-noarchive-nosnippet-meta-tags-10595">meta nofollow</a> tags for similar purposes, though each functions differently from one another.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>Site security is key for technical SEO. In addition to keeping your site maintained in terms of plugins and comment spam, you&#8217;ll also want to make sure your site is served over https, rather than just http. To do this, you need an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/09/what-is-an-ssl-certificate">SSL certificate</a>. There are a number of ways to get one, such as through <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/cms/ssl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HubSpot&#8217;s SSL certificate</a>.</p>

<a id="tracking"></a></p>
<h2>SEO Basics Part 7: How to track and measure SEO results</h2>
<p>So once you start writing your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/03/seo-copywriting">awesome SEO content</a> and putting all of these steps into motion, how do you actually track how well it’s working?</p>
<p>On its face this question has a fairly straightforward answer, with some key <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/27/seo-metrics">SEO metrics</a> to focus on, but with each metric there are some key factors to consider as you measure your site’s SEO performance.</p>
<h3>Keyword rankings</h3>
<p>Looking at where your site ranks for a list of keywords certainly isn’t a final destination – you can’t pay your staff in rankings, things like personalization in search results have made them variable across different locations, and therefore hard to track, and of course all they indicate is where you show up in search results. Some would <a href="http://www.marketingprofs.com/articles/2015/27359/these-six-stupid-marketing-metrics-need-to-die">even go so far as to declare them dead</a>. But getting a rough idea of where your site ranks for core terms can be a useful leading indicator of your site’s health. High rankings across a range of keywords is a strong indicator of organic search visibility.</p>
<p><strong>This doesn’t mean you should get overly obsessed with rankings for any one term</strong>. Remember: your ultimate goal is to drive more relevant traffic that drives more <strong>business</strong> – if you sell blue widgets, is it more important that you rank for “blue widgets” or that you outline and execute an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/10/seo-service-and-help">SEO strategy that helps</a> you sell more blue widgets in the most cost-efficient way possible? Use rankings as a general health check, not a course-charting KPI.</p>
<p>A number of tools can help you check your rankings. Most offer fairly similar functionality but features like local or mobile rankings are sometimes unique in some of the tools. If you’re a small business or just getting started with SEO, I’d recommend picking a free and easy-to-use tool and just keeping an eye on a handful of the core terms you want to track to help you gauge progress.</p>
<h3>Organic traffic</h3>
<p>Organic traffic is a much better leading indicator of the health of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/05/seo-strategy">SEO efforts</a>. By looking at the organic traffic to your site, you can get a gauge for the actual volume of visitors coming to your site, and where they’re going.</p>
<p>You can measure your organic traffic easily with most analytics tools – since it’s free and the most-used, we’ll look at how to get this information in <a href="/blog/ws/2014/05/15/google-analytics-tips">Google Analytics</a>.</p>
<p>For a quick check, you can simply look at your site’s main reporting page and click on “All Sessions” to filter for organic traffic (traffic from search engines that excludes paid search traffic):<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/seo-basics-organic-traffic-google-analytics.png" alt="seo basics - tracking organic seo traffic" width="900" height="636" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56028" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/seo-basics-organic-traffic-google-analytics.png 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/seo-basics-organic-traffic-google-analytics-480x339.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /><br />
You can also drill down to look at the specific pages driving traffic and goals by creating a custom report and designating users and goal completions as your metrics, and landing pages as your dimension:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/seo-basics-custom-report.png" alt="basic seo reporting" width="550" height="642" /></div>
<p>Note: Make sure once you view this report that you’re selecting the organic traffic segment again, or you’ll be looking at all of your traffic by page rather than just unpaid traffic driven by search engines.</p>
<p>This can be powerful for sites just getting started with SEO, because frequently most of your site’s traffic will be driven by what’s known as “branded queries,” or searches that contain your company’s brand name (for instance a branded search for WordStream might be “WordStream PPC” versus a non-branded search term, which might be “pay-per-click software”). You clearly want to have people searching for your brand, and of course you want them to find you when they do, but unless your site has been penalized by Google, you will almost certainly rank for your brand and have that branded traffic come to your site’s home page. What most of your ongoing SEO efforts should be centered around is driving incremental traffic to the site (people who might not have found and engaged with you otherwise).</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the keyword section of the guide, unfortunately Google has made it difficult to get data around the actual keywords people are searching for, but by looking at page-level traffic (outside of your site’s home page) you can start to glean insight into your overall SEO progress. Looking at rank data and using the tactics mentioned in the keyword section of this guide will also help you to get more insight into the actual terms that are driving traffic (and whether your SEO growth is being driven by optimization efforts rather than off-line marketing).</p>

<h3>Organic leads and sales</h3>
<p>Obviously the primary way to measure your search engine optimization results should be actual leads, sales, revenue and profit. Like with any business activity you need to answer: how does the activity help to move your bottom line?</p>
<p>The simplest path here is to set up goals or e-commerce tracking in a tool like Google Analytics. You can use the above report to look at organic traffic and goals (or different e-commerce metrics) by landing page, which means that you are specifically looking at who converts among the people who are landing on your site from an organic search (versus people who may have come to your site from PPC or another channel within the window that your analytics tracking can track, then searched for you, then converted).</p>
<p>This seems pretty straightforward, and generally for most businesses is a good initial way to measure the success of your SEO efforts, but again there are a few caveats and things to keep in mind with this data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Web-based analytics is always imperfect</strong>. If you’re transitioning from billboards or newspaper ads to online marketing, you’ll likely be impressed by the volume and precision of the data available, but there can frequently be a variety of different tracking issues that can make the data you’re seeing anywhere from slightly to wildly off – always have a degree of skepticism about data that doesn’t seem to add up, and do what you can to have some checks in place to make sure that your analytics information is synced to your actual revenue and spend data.</li>
<li><strong>Your system might create gaps in tracking</strong>. If you have a back-end system that you can’t quite tie to analytics for some reason, you might have some gaps between what you can track as goals and actual sales.</li>
<li><strong>Attribution and life-time value metrics can be tricky.</strong> This is more of a business and web metrics problem than something specific to SEO, but figuring out how you attribute sales to different channels and factoring in life-time value to your site’s traffic can be tricky. Make sure you’re applying the same types of tough questions and attempting to measure SEO the same way you would with any other marketing endeavor.</li>

<h2>SEO Basics Part 8: Additional SEO considerations</h2>
<p>For many businesses, getting the technical aspects of SEO right, understanding the keywords you want to target, and having a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-strategy">keyword strategy</a> for getting your site’s pages linked to and shared is really all you need to know about SEO. There are, however, some specific cases and business types that need to be concerned with specific <em>types</em> of search. A few types of search environments that require unique approaches include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>International SEO</strong> – There are a number of benefits and trade-offs to different approaches to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/26/international-seo">ranking sites in different countries</a> and in different languages. Aleyda Solis has an outstanding <a href="http://moz.com/blog/the-international-seo-checklist">guide to international SEO best practices</a> if you’re trying to reach customers in a variety of international markets, and Google also offers some recommendations and best practices in <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/189077?hl=en">their own guide</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Local SEO</strong> – For <a href="/blog/ws/2015/04/06/local-business-marketing">small businesses and franchisees</a>, getting local rankings for different variations of {your location} + {your service} (e.g. “Boston pizza shops”) is really the most valuable organic search traffic available. While getting links and shares, doing keyword research, and ensuring your site doesn’t have technical issues helps with localized rankings, there is a <a href="http://moz.com/local-search-ranking-factors">separate set of ranking factors</a> local businesses should be aware of. <a href="http://searchengineland.com/local-seo-rank-local-business-218906">Matthew Barby has an excellent guide on the topic</a>.</li>
<li><strong>App Store Search Engines</strong> – If you have an app – either as the core product offering for your company, or as a means for enabling mobile users to be able to interact with your business – having your app show up in searches on various app stores can be extremely valuable. Justin Briggs and Stephanie Beadell have <a href="http://moz.com/blog/mobile-app-search">written</a> <a href="https://www.briggsby.com/a-disconnect-in-app-store-seo-going-beyond-aso/">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.briggsby.com/app-store-listing-guide/">outstanding</a> <a href="https://www.briggsby.com/how-to-optimize-your-android-app-for-google-play/">posts</a> on the topic.</li>
</ul>
<h2>SEO Basics: Recap and next Steps</h2>
<p>Alright, so the SEO basics are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understanding the importance of SEO</li>
<li>Keyword research and targeting</li>
<li>On-page optimization</li>
<li>Information architecture</li>
<li>SEO content and link building</li>
<li>Technical SEO</li>
<li>Tracking and measuring SEO results</li>
<li>SEO miscellaneous (mobile, international, local)</li>
</ol>
<p>So if you’ve gotten this far, you should know a lot of information about how search engines rank websites and about how you can position your own site and business to generate more search traffic from search engines like Google. What should you do next?</p>
<p><strong>Prioritize</strong>. No site does a perfect job of executing against every single aspect of search engine optimization. Think about the things you do well, have budget and resources for, and that will give your business the best return for your investment – this will be at least slightly different for every business and site.</p>
<p>If you’re great at creating and promoting content, determine which keywords to go after and focus your efforts there.</p>
<p>If you have a large and complex site, focus on getting the technical SEO right (or hire someone who can).</p>
<p>If you’re a small business that would benefit from ranking for very specific geo-focused terms but not much else, shore up your <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/seo/">local SEO efforts</a> (and then maybe focus on other marketing efforts once you start to see diminishing returns from your efforts there).</p>
<p>Always remember that the ultimate objective with any search engine optimization efforts is to get more exposure and traffic for your business or your site’s content.  Look for ways that search engine traffic can help your business and site: don’t just chase after the latest SEO buzzwords or jump every time Google makes a recommendation that might improve your search rankings while hurting your overall business.</p>

<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/07/09/tumblr-ads">Tumblr Ads: Learn About Paid Advertising Options on Tumblr</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We recently highlighted the different advertising options available via <a href="/blog/ws/2012/06/25/twitter-advertising-promoted-tweets">Twitter’s paid ads and promoted tweets platform</a>. Another massively popular social site has also been introducing new advertising options of late: Tumblr. For many businesses, Tumblr’s currently available advertising options may not be a great fit yet, but it’s always worth understanding what’s available with a given advertising channel before you dismiss it, and by following how a popular platform with a lot of visitors evolves their ad products you’ll know when they start to offer solutions that you can get the most out of.</p>
<p>Currently, Tumblr offers four separate ad products:</p>
<h2>Tumblr Highlighted Posts</h2>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" src="http://8.mshcdn.com/wp-content/gallery/tumblrs-growing-ad-suite/tumblr-highlighted-post-640.png" alt="Tumblr highlighted post" /></strong></p>
<p>Highlighted posts allow users to designate their own Tumblr posts to be highlighted in your followers’ dashboards. The price is currently $2 but was $1 upon launch. If you have active Tumblr followers and content you’d like to get additional exposure for, this can be an interesting way to do it.</p>
<h2>Tumblr Spotlight for Brands</h2>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" src="http://8.mshcdn.com/wp-content/gallery/tumblrs-growing-ad-suite/tumblr-spotlight-640.png" alt="Tumblr Spotlight" /></strong></p>
<p>The pricing for this product isn’t publicly disclosed, but the idea here is a brand can sponsor a spotlighted topic page like fashion or sports and have their ads shown to anyone who visits that page. Many Tumblr users view content this way so it can be a way for brands looking for high-volume exposure on social sites to get access to large numbers of visitors.</p>
<h2>Tumblr Radar</h2>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" src="http://4.mshcdn.com/wp-content/gallery/tumblrs-growing-ad-suite/tumblr-radar-640.png" alt="Tumblr Radar" /></strong></p>
<p>Tumblr Radar allows brands to buy display units in the right rail of users&#8217; dashboards. Similar to Facebook ads promoting Facebook pages, these ad units allow users to like, follow, and reblog brands’ content.</p>
<h2>Tumblr Pinned Posts</h2>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" src="http://7.mshcdn.com/wp-content/gallery/tumblrs-growing-ad-suite/tumblr-pinned-post-640.png" alt="Tumblr Pinned Post" /></strong></p>
<p>Pinned posts are the newest paid advertising product from Tumblr, announced in late June. Similar to Tumblr highlighted posts, with pinned posts for $5, users can pin posts to the top of followers&#8217; dashboards. Highlighting the post simply puts a marker next to it in followers’ dashboards, where as pinning the post means that it hovers at the top of your followers’ dashboards for 24 hours.</p>
<p>The spotlight and radar products are geared more towards brands and require a $25,000 commitment, but the pinned posts and highlighted posts are both available to advertisers self-serve, so if you already have an active Tumblr account with followers this might be a viable advertising option. Regardless of the tactic you choose it’s definitely important to take into account that with a young advertising platform like Tumblr’s you won’t be able to get access to the level of targeting features and analytics you might be used to with Google AdWords, or even <a href="/blog/ws/2012/05/15/ipo-facebook-vs-google-display-advertising">Facebook advertising</a>. That said depending on your audience and your company’s own use of Tumblr, Tumblr ads could be worth investing in.</p>

</ul>
<p>In this post we’ll walk through how to get the most out of the Google Keyword Tool within your AdWords campaigns.</p>
<h2>What Is the Google Keyword Tool?</h2>
<p><a href="/keyword-tool-google">Google’s keyword tool</a> is designed to give advertisers information about which keywords they can add to their campaigns. The Google Keyword Tool has some important advantages and disadvantages to understand before acting on the data.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It Leverages Google’s Own Data</strong> – One of the big advantages to using Google’s keyword tool is you have access to Google’s massive data set. This is an advantage for the Google tool because no single source has access to the amount of search query information that Google does. However, this advantage is mitigated somewhat because Google makes its keyword tool data available via an API, so keyword tools like WordStream’s which aren’t Google property can actually leverage a combination of Google’s own data and additional, third-party sources to create a more comprehensive keyword database.</li>
<li><strong>It’s Google-Specific</strong> – If you’re optimizing for multiple campaigns or looking to leverage <a href="/adwords-keyword">AdWords keyword</a> data in your SEO efforts this can be a disadvantage, but as we’re covering AdWords tools specifically this can be useful – you’re getting data specific to AdWords.</li>
<li><strong>Integration within AdWords</strong> – The Google Keyword Tool allows you to quickly add keywords to your AdWords account because it is integrated within your Google account.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Suggestions Often Benefit Google </strong>– As is the case with <a href="/blog/ws/2011/09/12/google-adwords-location-targeting">many default settings</a>, specific <a href="/blog/ws/2011/08/11/google-adwords-express-review">services for small businesses</a>, and <a href="/blog/ws/2010/11/29/adwords-opportunities-tab">optimization suggestions</a>, Google’s tools often make recommendations that favor Google more than they favor your business. Google’s keyword tool doesn’t always show you every possible variation people are searching for – often the data skews towards more commercial and higher competition terms and fails to show you better, more specific opportunities you could add to your account that would actually be more profitable for your business. Third-party keyword tools such as WordStream’s <a href="/wordstream-for-seo">Keyword Research Suite</a> are designed specifically to bridge this gap and get advertisers this actionable information, as their concern is just building tools for advertisers (not maximizing Google’s revenue and profits).</li>
<li><strong>Estimations are Very Rough &amp; Often Inaccurate – </strong>As is the case with any keyword tool, the numbers you see in AdWords are just rough approximations of the traffic available for a specific search term. It doesn’t show you how different positions get traffic for the term, and obviously the tool can’t tell you how a keyword will actually convert for your business, which is why using and reacting to your own data is extremely important.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the tool is obviously far from perfect, there are still insights to be gained by leveraging it for your AdWords accounts.</p>
<h2>How to Use the AdWords Keyword Tool in Your PPC Campaigns</h2>
<p>When you turn to the AdWords keyword tool for keyword ideas within your campaigns, you have a few options, which are represented by the input fields below:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e9e26d2b-7016-4407-bc59-f3895b95dda6" data-langcode="und">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-adwords-keyword-tool.gif" alt="Find Keywords" width="473" height="255" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>You can look for keywords based on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A Word or Phrase</strong> – This allows you to input a specific keyword into the keyword tool and get a list of suggestions based on a seed keyword (such as “pet supplies” above).</li>
<li><strong>A Website</strong> – Here we could give Google our own site’s content and get keyword ideas based on that information – alternatively we could input a competitor’s URL and get information on the terms Google deems relevant for that site.</li>
<li><strong>A Category </strong>– Google has a number of pre-set categories that we can drill down into to get topical keyword suggestions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Typically your best results will be from inputting a keyword or keywords to get results back – categories will frequently give you suggestions that are far too broad to be really actionable (though if you’re completely at a loss for how to structure your campaigns, this might be an OK starting point for different broad-level campaign ideas).</p>
<p>Within keyword selections as you can see we can further filter results based on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ideas Closely Related to Search Terms</strong> – This will give you highly related terms rather than a broader array of different ideas: if you’re looking to create a tightly related ad group around a specific term, this filter is very useful, but it will exclude some variations that you might find useful if you’re looking to get a wider array of ideas for keywords to target.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Filters</strong> – You can also filter based on the areas and devices you plan to target; country, language, desktop vs. mobile, etc. as well as filtering out terms that don’t meet a certain threshold of search volume.</li>
</ul>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="4198540a-80b9-4498-be9e-8b1e509658c0" data-langcode="und">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-adwords-keyword-tool-advanced-options.gif" alt="AdWords Keyword Tool Options" width="535" height="259" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Once you’ve settled on an actual term to get information about, you’ll be presented with a number of possible keywords to add to your campaign – you can add the keywords directly or export them to develop your keyword lists outside of AdWords before adding them to the appropriate campaigns later:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="416b8ded-f1eb-49e4-a998-bd71da1d145e" data-langcode="und">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adwords-keyword-tool-data.gif" alt="Keyword Ideas" width="640" height="422" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>As you can see you have several options for what to do with these suggestions across the top row of options, as well as some metrics to help you evaluate the keywords:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competition</strong> – This is a rough metric showing you how many advertisers there are on a given term and how aggressively they bid for the term.</li>
<li><strong>Global Monthly Searches</strong> – The global monthly average based on the last 12 months of data for each term you’re looking at.</li>
<li><strong>Local Monthly Searches</strong> – This shows you the local monthly average for each search term based on countries you selected (so in our case, this would be the data for US only searches).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the standard keyword tool, AdWords now also offers a beta version of an ad group ideas tool to help make suggestions for clusters of keywords you might want to group into specific ad groups:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0e60ea96-28f2-4f67-8f90-cf60cf31a00d" data-langcode="und">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-adwords-keyword-tool-ad-group-ideas.gif" alt="Ad Group Ideas" width="334" height="607" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>From here you could incorporate these lists into already existing ad groups, or use them as a starting point for creating a new ad group.</p>
<p>Ultimately these keyword suggestions can be a nice starting point and directionally indicative of which keywords may be a fit for your campaigns, but it’s important to take the recommendations with a grain of salt and constantly be monitoring your campaigns, <a href="/blog/ws/2011/10/13/when-to-pause-keywords">pausing keywords</a>, <a href="/keyword-expansion">adding keywords</a>, and <a href="/blog/ws/2012/02/21/easy-adwords-bid-management">adjusting your bids</a> at the keyword level over time.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Learn about the components in the Google AdWords Shared Library, including audiences and campaign negative keywords, and how to use them in your campaigns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent weeks we’ve been creating a series of guides to various components of the Google Ads interface to help advertisers understand all of the features and functionality available to them within Google Ads (formerly known as AdWords). This is the first installment in our series on how to make the most of the <a href="/blog/ws/2012/02/23/google-adwords-left-navigation-guide">Google Ads left navigation</a>, and we’ll be focusing on the Google Ads Shared Library.</p>
<h2>What Lives in the Shared Library, and What Purpose Does it Serve?</h2>
<p>Within the Google Ads Shared Library are three core elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Audiences</strong> – These are specific segmentations based on interest and the way people have interacted with your site (for more information on audiences check out our <a href="/blog/ws/2012/02/02/google-adwords-audience-tab-guide">AdWords audience tab guide</a>) that you can leverage within your display campaigns.</li>
<li><strong>Campaign Negative Keywords</strong> – These are negative keyword lists that you can leverage across your campaigns.</li>
<li><strong>Campaign Placement Exclusions</strong> – These are excluded or negative placement lists that you can leverage across your campaigns.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the overall theme with these options is that you’re able to leverage the same component (audiences, negative keywords, and placement exclusions) in multiple areas of your account:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="756b043b-9f51-46f5-a209-a568e3c1281c" data-langcode="und">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-adwords-shared-library.gif" alt="AdWords Shared Library" width="202" height="111" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Let’s look at each of the specific options and how you can make use of them within your campaigns.</p>
<h2>Shared Google Ads Audiences</h2>
<p>This represents the master list of your Google Ads audiences – you can <a href="/blog/ws/2012/02/09/how-to-create-adwords-audiences">create Google Ads audiences</a> that target specific topic areas, <a href="/google-remarketing">Google remarketing</a> audiences (based on whether people have come to your site and how they’ve interacted with it), or a combination of the two. From there you can reference all of those audiences within the shared audiences library, or you can create a new audience from here as well.</p>
<p>This is a very helpful section for identifying the different audiences that are available in an account, and if you’re working on an account that you’re not familiar with you can access the code for the account’s retargeting campaigns to ensure that the proper code is installed on the proper pages.</p>
<h2>Campaign Negative Keyword Lists</h2>
<p>These are a great starting point and tool for most campaigns because they make setting a number of common negatives across a large number of ad groups very quick and easy. For most accounts you’ll have a lot of common negative keywords you want to exclude across your campaigns – some good examples might be “jobs” if you don’t have a job board on your subject, or “news” if you’re a product company and don’t want to drive traffic for people looking for news content, or you might want to create a <a href="http://www.chadsummerhill.com/negative-keyword-list-branded/">branded negative keyword list</a> or <a href="/blog/ws/2011/03/01/fight-ppc-ad-poaching-with-negative-keywords">use negative keyword lists to better direct PPC traffic to the appropriate ad group</a>.  Whatever you include in it, once you’ve created a list, you can then very quickly apply it to any of your search campaigns:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="8782f142-e6c4-4fbd-835b-b63a587daa1f" data-langcode="und">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/negative-keyword-shared-library.gif" alt="campaign negative keywords" width="330" height="478" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<h2>Campaign Placement Exclusions</h2>
<p>Similarly, when you’ve <a href="/blog/ws/2012/02/13/adwords-quick-wins-2">pulled a placement report and found thousands in wasted spend</a>, you may often want to set those poor performing placements as negatives throughout your campaign. You simply create a list of placements you want to exclude:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="abb5bcc6-8827-4df8-be7e-34015591263b" data-langcode="und">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/placement-exclusions-shared-library.gif" alt="Campaign Placement Exclusions" width="343" height="363" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>And you can then push the exclusions to various campaigns in the same way you would with shared negative keyword lists.</p>
<h2>Why Is All This Valuable?</h2>
<p>The main utility of the shared library is in saving you time, particularly as your campaigns grow. As more and more advertisers use the program and Google continues to try to balance power (for the <a href="/articles/google-earnings">bigger AdWords spenders</a>) with ease of use for small businesses, Google Ads is becoming a pretty complex, bloated product, so it’s necessary for them to layer on tools like shared libraries to help advertisers make changes across multiple campaigns, and being aware of where these features live and how to make use of them can mean significant time savings as you try to manage your Google Ads campaigns.</p>

In this post, we’ll focus on the topic of how Google defines an “audience” as it pertains to Google Ads (formerly known as AdWords) display campaigns, and some of the strategic ways you can make use of audiences within your display campaigns.</p>
<h2>What Constitutes a Google Ads Audience?</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="721c0df9-e916-455a-a3a3-5965ccb37e50" data-langcode="und">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/what-is-adwords-audience.gif" alt="Add audiences" width="430" height="414" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>An audience within Google Ads is a means of segmenting or targeting your display campaigns. With audiences you can do either of two options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Target all audiences</strong> and adjust bids for different audience types</li>
<li><strong>Target only specific audiences</strong> and exclude others (using audiences as a targeting mechanism in the same way you would placements, keywords, or other means of targeting specific visitors or searchers)</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Types of Audience Can We Target?</h2>
<p>The actual “audiences” or segmentation options available to you include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Specific Category Interests</strong> – Think <a href="/blog/ws/2014/10/28/niche-marketing">niche markets</a> such as sports versus games versus comic books. As the <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads blog</a> points out: <em>our system looks at the types of pages a user visits, taking into account how recently and frequently those pages have been visited, and then associates their browser with relevant interest categories.  Using these categories, you can show ads to the people most likely to purchase your products or services, and you can reach them across all types of sites in the Google Display Network in addition to contextually relevant sites.</em></li>
<li><strong>Remarketing Lists</strong> &#8211; Such as site visitors who have seen a specific page, have seen one page but not another like a landing page but not a thank you page, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Demographic Targeting</strong> &#8211; This actually lives outside the audiences tab and lives in the Google Ads campaign settings tab, but allows advertisers.</li>
</ul>
<p>You determine the type of targeting you want to do (target all audiences and manage bids for certain segments such as demographics versus targeting or excluding only specific types of audiences) within your <a href="/blog/ws/2011/12/29/adwords-networks-devices-settings">Google Ads networks and devices campaign settings</a> when you designate your campaign as having a broad or specific reach:</p>
<p>In addition to the simple ability to manipulate bids and exclude or narrow to include only certain segments, obviously one of the more interesting and potentially powerful options surrounding these combinations of audience types is how you can mix and match things like remarketing lists, keyword targeting, placement targeting, and interest types to create highly relevant and tightly themed display campaigns.</p>
<p>In the next two posts on the audiences tab, we’ll take a look at how to manipulate and interpret the reporting available through the audiences tab, and finally we’ll focus on specific strategies for creating these custom segmentations to help you get the most out of the many options available to advertisers by creatively combining audiences in specific ways for specific purposes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the first post in our series on the <a href="/blog/ws/2011/12/05/adwords-settings-ultimate-guide">Google Ads settings tab</a>, where we’ll be looking at various options and best practices surrounding settings within your <a href="/adwords-campaign">Google Ads campaigns</a>.</p>
<p>In this post we’ll be focused on the general idea of what you actually designate as a campaign, and how you settle on a naming convention. For a lot of first time advertisers this seems pretty straightforward, but there are actually a lot of considerations that go into making a sound decision about how to organize your campaigns and even how to name them so that as your account grows your campaign structure can easily scale with it.</p>
<h2>Creating a Google Ads Campaign Structure: What Do You Need Categories For?</h2>
<p>In thinking about your Google Ads (formerly known as AdWords) campaigns you want to consider: what actually deserves its own campaign? Obviously campaigns are collections of ad groups, which house ads and keywords, but when do you need to create a new campaign versus just putting all of your ad groups into the same campaign you already have? There are really two high-level reasons you might create a new campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Staying Organized</strong> – You might create a new campaign purely for organization and measurement: you could create a campaign structure based on taxonomy and semantics: all of the keywords in your campaign that contain the word “shoes” are in one campaign, and everything that contains the term “footwear” is in another. You might also segment your campaigns based on product lines so that you can quickly report on performance broken down by product line, and easily monitor this from your campaign tab on a daily basis.</li>
<li><strong>Settings Drive Campaign Structure</strong> – This is really the most common reason for creating a new campaign: there is a specific setting that is controlled at the campaign level that you want to set one way for one collection of ad groups and another way for another collection of ad groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>Important to note here: most of the time you’ll want settings that are truly critical to the success of your campaigns to trump an organizational approach to organizing campaigns. Here’s an example:</p>
<p>Let’s say we sell shoes. We want to break our campaigns out by product names, and then include all of the different variations of that product in various ad groups. This would let us see the product performance at a quick glance.</p>
<p>But obviously we want to create separate search network and content network campaigns for each of these products. OK, so maybe we do something like Product Name – Search and Product Name – Content. This is a little messier but we can still probably manage it.</p>
<p>Now what if we find that the sales process on mobile is a bit suboptimal with our shopping cart? While the dev team works on it we want to split out mobile traffic into its own campaign so our <a href="/blog/ws/2011/09/08/content-network-cost-per-click">content network costs won’t be so high</a>. Now we have three versions of each product campaign, and things are starting to become a bit messy.</p>
<p>Your campaign structure could become downright unmanageable as you run into issues with different campaigns requiring different budgets, location targeting issues, etc. As with anything these types of things are much easier to think about and architect around “in the hangar” rather than in mid-flight, so as you create your campaigns sit down and map out the various considerations you’ll have to take into account:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Locations &amp; Languages</strong> – Are your campaigns going to be geo-targeted? If your business is highly local this will be an obvious concern, but you’ll want to consider the value of breaking out non-obvious campaigns to target different geographies with the same keywords but different messaging, for instance.</li>
<li><strong>Networks &amp; Devices</strong> – Consider how you’ll be setting up both search network campaigns and content network campaigns, and if you have data about how existing campaigns or traffic sources perform on mobile versus desktop and laptop devices that would suggest you’d want to handle those sources differently consider that as well.</li>
<li><strong>Bidding &amp; Budget</strong> – Are there campaigns you’ll want to use conversion optimizer on? Are there specific budgeting considerations that would cause you to put groups under specific campaign umbrellas (i.e. different departments within a company having very specific budgets allocated to AdWords campaigns, for instance).</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the items you want to think about in mapping your campaign structures. Think about each item you’d want to be able to create different campaigns around and make sure that they are incorporated in your campaign structure, and also think about how expanding with new products, services, or strategies might affect that structure.</p>
<h2>Naming Your Google Ads Campaign</h2>
<p>You also want to think about how you’re naming your groups. In the example above naming campaigns by product might work well, but you might even want to try to create campaign names that align more closely with your site’s categorization. Basically in choosing a naming convention you’ve already decided how to actually order your campaigns (based on settings and potentially some organizational factors) and you’re thinking about data analysis: how can you best order the campaigns to segment the data? So here we might want to do something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Running Shoes – Product Name – Content Network</li>
<li>Basketball Shoes – Product Name – Search Network</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now when we’re filtering in Excel or just customizing a view in Google Ads we can quickly pull a report for all of our running shoes or for a few different products, or just for performance for a specific product across some of the different campaign segmentations we’ve created.</p>
<p>Again the real focus here is to be sure you’re considering the right factors in creating a campaign structure and naming convention, and to consider the best way to have all of this set up to scale well as your account expands. One thing that can help in mapping this out is making sure you understand each of the “levers” available to you in your campaign settings, which is precisely what we’ll be covering in the next few installments of this series.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Learn two situations in which it's a good idea to pause keywords in AdWords to save money and improve Quality Scores across your account.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sadly, not every keyword you attempt to target in your Google Ads (AdWords) accounts will work. The good news is, because PPC offers a fountain of immediate feedback in the way of data points, it’s possible to identify poor choices in your initial targeting and take swift action.</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll walk through the two major examples of keywords you’d be better off pausing, as well as some potential pitfalls to consider in thinking about actually shutting down these keywords.</p>
<h2>Keywords that Spend Money but Don’t Convert</h2>
<p>This is probably the most immediately obvious and intuitive example of a keyword that should be paused: keywords that are costing you money but not converting into a lead or a sale. But even within this classification of keyword, there’s a bit more nuance than meets the eye.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine we sell paid search software and every lead is worth $100 to us based on both the number of those leads that turn into sales, and our company’s margins. Obviously once a keyword spends something like a thousand dollars it seems pretty clear that keyword should be paused, but what if:</p>
<ul>
<li>The keyword is sending visitors to a poor landing page?</li>
<li>The keyword could convert better with a different (lower) bid?</li>
<li>The keyword has poor, untested ad text associated with it?</li>
<li>The keyword has spent and not converted in the last 30 days, but generated a lot of business for us in the past at an acceptable cost?</li>
<li>The keyword is an informational term that drives a lot of later stage conversions?</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of the above could mean that you’re leaving money on the table in pausing a keyword, so before you decide that a keyword is something that spends but doesn’t convert, you want to look at:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Different Date Ranges</strong> – Even though the term hasn’t performed in a 7- or 30-day window, it might have done well previously. If this is the case: what changed (bids, ad text, landing pages, something in your market/niche?)?</li>
<li><strong>Landing Page Effectiveness</strong> – How effective is the associated landing page overall? This is something you can drill into on the <a href="/blog/ws/2011/10/11/google-adwords-dimensions-tab-guide">Google Ads dimension tab</a>, and what you want to confirm is that the landing page this keyword drives to <strong>performs well when paired with other keywords</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Ad Text Efficacy</strong> – The same holds for ad copy – does the associated ad copy convert well from a CPA standpoint overall? This may well be a reason for a recent drop in effectiveness – maybe the ad copy you initially wrote has become stale and a new test would jolt your ad performance.</li>
<li><strong>Assists</strong> – Google’s new <a href="/blog/ws/2011/08/25/google-analytics-multi-channel-funnels">multi-channel funnel reports</a> allow you to drill down to see not only last click attribution but also whether a term is driving a lot of conversions by acting as an earlier touch in the conversion process, so you can avoid cutting off a term that is helping to drive conversions that are being attributed to other keywords or channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see there are a lot of moving pieces to analyzing all of the pertinent data points before deciding to “kill” a keyword. This is a lot of work and analysis to perform if you’re looking keyword-by-keyword in even a mid-sized PPC account, so it’s probably more practical to either restrict this type of deep dive to higher-volume terms you’re looking to pause, or to <a href="/pause-keyword-alerts">apply automation to the process</a>.</p>
<h2>Keywords that Don’t Spend Much, Don’t Convert, and Have Low Quality Scores</h2>
<p>“Hard costs” in a PPC campaign aren’t the only costs – keywords that underperform on other metrics can also have “soft costs” in the way of negative account-wide Quality Score impact.</p>
<p>While it’s true that <a href="http://www.rimmkaufman.com/blog/quality-score-rant-3-more-requests/26092011/">low Quality Scores don’t mean you can’t advertise profitably on a keyword</a>, there may be keywords that have low Quality Scores and click-through rates, don’t convert well, and slipped through the cracks of our analysis as we attempted to find good candidates for keywords that spend but don’t convert.</p>
<p>Extending the example above, let’s imagine we have a handful of keywords that are all driving very little spend but not converting – call it $10 per keyword over an extended period of time. In theory these keywords probably wouldn’t be “pause ready” as they haven’t yet demonstrated that they aren’t profitable (if conversions are worth $100 to us, they could spend five times the current amount for a conversion and be extremely profitable), but these keywords – particularly in aggregate – may be costing us money indirectly.</p>
<p>Among the factors in determining Quality Score is your historical, account-wide CTR and Quality Score, so having keywords in your account that aren’t helping drive your business directly (via conversions) and also hurt your account-wide CTR has a very real soft cost in that it drives down Quality Scores and subsequently drives up costs and makes it expensive to push out new keywords and ad groups.</p>
<p>But, not unlike with keywords that spend but don’t convert, these terms may also be suffering from low Quality Scores due to factors you could potentially correct, such as poor ad copy and keyword segmentation.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure of whether you should be pausing keywords to help improve Quality Scores, one good approach is to run your account through the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">AdWords Grader</a> to see how your Quality Scores are in general (you’ll see this as part of your report), and assuming your Quality Scores need work account-wide you can start to home in on keywords that are in groups with otherwise reasonable Quality Scores.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We recently concluded our series on <a href="/blog/ws/2011/09/15/adwords-ad-extensions-guide">AdWords ad extensions</a>, and thought we’d take a similar approach to a series of reports that live under the Google AdWords Dimensions Tab. Many people rely on the main AdWords tabs for their standard reports – at the campaign, ad group, keyword, and ad level – but there are a series of <a href="/blog/ws/2014/10/02/adwords-reports">AdWords reports</a> that offer a ton of great data all rolled up under the dimensions tab.</p>
<p>In this guide to using the AdWords dimensions tab, we’ll be breaking out each of these reports and showing you:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to pull the report and manipulate the data</li>
<li>Why this report is (or in some cases isn’t) important</li>
<li>When the data will be helpful and actionable (and in some cases: when it won’t be)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Available Reports in the AdWords Dimensions Tab</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="7ea9615d-9205-4fb2-925b-13b5011ef467" data-langcode="und">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adwords-reporting-dimensions-tab-1.gif" alt="Geographic Report" width="552" height="167" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Below is a brief explanation of each of the reports – click the heading to find more detailed information on each report:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2011/10/18/adwords-dayparting"><strong>Time</strong></a> – This is dayparting information – the drop down allows you to slice and dice your data by day of the week, hour, etc. to gain insights about when your campaigns are the most successful. Click here for more information on <a href="/blog/ws/2011/10/18/adwords-dayparting">the time report and dayparting</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2011/10/20/adwords-conversion-report"><strong>Conversions</strong></a> – This gives you some additional information around your conversions – specifically a breakdown by conversion name or purpose.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2011/10/31/adwords-destination-url-report"><strong>Destination URL</strong></a> – This report shows you how specific destination URLs within your campaign are performing.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2011/11/03/adwords-demographic-reporting"><strong>Demographic</strong></a> – This applies to certain sites on the content network that collect demographic data, and shows you the breakdown of how different demographics are responding to your campaigns.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2011/11/07/adwords-geographic-report"><strong>Geographic</strong></a> – This report lets you slice and dice data by geography so you can better allocate your funds across different countries, states, etc.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2011/11/17/adwords-search-term-report"><strong>Search Terms</strong></a> –  This is effectively a search query report, and shows the same data you would get via a query report in the keywords tab.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2011/11/21/automatic-placement-report"><strong>Automatic Placements</strong></a> – This report shows you the placements your site is being placed on on the content network – it’s a bit like a search query report for content and display campaigns.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2011/11/28/adwords-free-clicks-report"><strong>Free Clicks</strong></a> – The free clicks tab is something Google calls the <a href="/blog/ws/2011/01/24/new-adwords-features">ad interactions report</a>, and shows you how people interact with different components of your ad, such as “get directions” or the <a href="/blog/ws/2011/09/22/adwords-product-extensions-guide">product extensions</a> ad plusbox.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2011/12/01/adwords-call-details-report"><strong>Call Details</strong></a> – This report shows you actual data from the call metrics feature assuming you’ve enabled it, such as durations and area codes of calls.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again we’ll walk through each of these in greater detail as the series continues. Stay tuned!</p>
