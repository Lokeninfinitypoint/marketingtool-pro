										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In boxing gyms, you’ll hear all sorts of expressions: “He’s walking on his heels.” “Hits like a mule.” “Cut the ring.” “Hands up.” “Stay off the ropes.”</p>
<p>After a sparring session, you might hear this: “<em>Don’t get greedy</em>.” This last one also applies to your <a href="/blog/ws/2017/05/15/state-of-the-internet-marketing-agency">marketing agency</a>.</p>

<p>Most agencies we speak with struggle to <a href="/blog/ws/2014/01/16/get-more-clients">find new clients</a>. Put another way, they struggle with sales. This article will explain how your business proposals can help solve this problem.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/07/proposal-generator">Your proposal</a> is more than just a list of deliverables. It’s part of a process. Here is your strategy for using your proposals to win more business.</p>
<h2>Addressing the Key Objection: <em>Just Send Me A Quote</em></h2>
<p>First, do no harm.</p>
<p>A proposal can also be a “false-objection.” In sales, the prospect will often push you off indirectly. When they abruptly ask for a quote, it could just be a way of getting off the phone. The rookie mistake is to spend time drafting a quote with an email and sending it. That’s a waste of your time. Instead, push back.</p>
<p>Say: “<em>I’m happy to do that, but I don’t want to waste your time. Can you just let me know if you’re not interested in these services or maybe we can chat later?”</em></p>
<p>It’s not rude to ask this question. You’ll even find that more than likely they are interested. They’re just busy. In this case, don’t let them go without a follow-up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>[<a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSContentDLWebBlogInContentTextLink11WaystoClients.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_11WaystoClients_Download">Free Guide: 11 Mistakes that Keep Your Agency from Growing</a>]</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Emphasize Urgency</h2>
<p>Your quote is your opportunity to shorten your <a href="/blog/ws/2015/01/26/sales-cycle">sales cycle</a>. Agencies are busy with creative, business development, administrative work and worst of all…collections. Whether you’re waiting for a signed agreement to get started or a deposit, waiting on a proposal will slow everything.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/11/business-proposals">effective business proposal</a> is your opportunity to shorten your sales cycle and get paid. Whether you tell them verbally, in the body of an email or in the proposal itself, let them know the lead-time. They need to know that they’re slowing their own results.</p>
<p>First, it’s good business to set expectations.</p>
<p>Second, it creates urgency. Instead of saying, “Did you get the quote?” You could lead with: “Before we can begin drafting your copy, setting up keywords and showing your ads on Google, we need your signed agreement/deposit. There’s about a three-week lead time before your ads can even show, so please get back to me on that proposal at your earliest convenience.”</p>
<p>Too often we fall into the “people-pleasing trap.” Rather than just telling the client how much harm they’re causing themselves and their business, we want to please them. Don’t.</p>
<h2>Closing As A Favor</h2>
<p>This is a strategy that’s great if you work for someone else at your agency.</p>
<p>You’ve built rapport with your prospect. They’re sold on your services. They have your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/13/marketing-proposal">marketing proposal</a>…but haven’t signed and your boss wants to know where it is. In this situation, your job title is irrelevant: You’re a sales rep.</p>
<p>Don’t hesitate to share this with your prospect. It’s honest and people like to help. “Hey, I know you’re busy, but my boss is asking for the paperwork. We’re onboarding three more clients and we don’t want you waiting. Can we get a signature today?”</p>
<p>Again, it’s true, and it usually works.</p>
<h2>You’re Not Done: Pick Up the Phone</h2>
<p>The proposal is part of a closing process. The phone and email work with it.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Always Be Following Up</em></p>
<p><a href="https://getphound.com/">GetPhound</a>, a Pennsylvania-based agency, is client-centric in their proposals. They helped with this article and recommend offering small, medium and large packages so clients feel empowered to choose a tailored solution.</p>
<p>Also, don’t be afraid to follow up to earn their business.</p>
<p>The follow-up is the critical part. If you’re offering multiple packages or have multiple quotes, you can reach out to inquire about which option they’d prefer. Following up to answer any questions they have is very effective and also helps the client make a choice.</p>
<p>In this scenario, the proposal is your reason for another contact with the client and another chance to close. Let them hear your voice.</p>
<h2>Don’t Get Greedy</h2>
<p>Finally, don’t get greedy.</p>
<p>In boxing, fighters get greedy after they land one or two punches. They stay too long and keep swinging. Unfortunately, this gives their opponent a great opportunity to counter-punch.</p>
<p>In agency sales, sometimes you should start small. PPC is perfect for that. Offer to manage or build their paid search account. From there, you can upsell as you build rapport. Send multiple quotes, but don’t be discouraged if they decline the biggest one…</p>
<p>Remember: Your proposal is much more than a document. If used properly, it can lead to more transactions and more clients.</p>

<p>A few years back, I took an evening class to study up on fundraising for non-profits I support. The classes were at the end of the day … the time when you’re really tired and only thinking about going to bed.</p>
<p>One night the instructor, contrasting non-profits and their for-profit counterparts, made a comment that I never forgot. It was so simple that I felt stupid: <em>For-profit companies exist to make money</em>.</p>
<p>It seems like a simple idea, but it’s a revelation that can have serious implications for your <a href="/blog/ws/2017/05/15/state-of-the-internet-marketing-agency">marketing agency</a>.</p>

<p>If you Google “wealth strategies,” you’ll quickly find the concept of multiple revenue streams. Usually, these articles recommend buying property and generating rental income. But for the modern marketing agency, there’s a simpler way.</p>
<p>Your agency has an advantage over most other companies in that you can, and likely do, offer multiple services. And PPC advertising can be your next revenue stream … if you ask the right questions.</p>
<p>Today, I’ll outline <strong>five things you should say to your prospects as well as your agency’s new and existing clients to introduce them to PPC</strong>. Importantly, these questions will also help you overcome some of the most common objections to adopting paid search as a channel.</p>
<p>With a little extra work, you can add boost your agency’s profits without having to become a landlord.</p>
<h4><a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSContentDLWebBlogInContentTextLink11WaystoClients.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_11WaystoClients_Download">[Free Guide: 11 Ways to Gain &amp; Retain More Clients]</a></h4>
<h2></h2>
<h2>1. “Let’s revisit your growth strategies.”</h2>
<p>This question is for your existing clients, and there’s a reason it comes first. In business as in fundraising, <strong>the most important clients are the ones you already have</strong>.</p>
<p>Selling your existing clients on PPC is easier because you already have a relationship. Plus, if you’re new to paid search advertising yourself, you’ll have an easier time with their accounts since you are already familiar with them. For your first few, you can easily offer your PPC services free of charge in exchange for a <a href="/blog/ws/2017/07/19/customer-testimonial-examples">testimonial</a>. (Check out my tips for <a href="/blog/ws/2015/07/15/ppc-agency-pricing">pricing a new PPC offering</a>.)</p>
<p>And if you’re already a seasoned PPC manager, not connecting with your existing clients is like leaving money on the table.</p>
<p>Regardless, it’s good business practices to engage your clients regularly as a check-in. They’re every bit as concerned about growth as you are, and this is a great way to open a conversation about new marketing channels that will help them grow.</p>
<h2>2. “My other auto dealer had this problem – what about you?”</h2>
<p>This isn’t about auto dealers. That’s just an example. The point is, two things happen when you use anecdotal stories about other clients: First, <strong>you build credibility</strong>. Second, you learn.</p>
<p>By building <a href="/blog/ws/2016/02/29/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks">industry knowledge</a> and listening to your specific client needs, you become an expert.</p>
<p>This question will get your clients listening because we’re naturally interested in <a href="/blog/ws/2017/09/05/how-to-compete-with-big-budgets-adwords">what our competitors are doing</a> and how we can learn from them. If you have multiple clients in the same industry, you should be using your learnings from one account to influence how you manage the others.</p>
<h2>3. “You’re looking for phone calls, right?”</h2>
<p>Too often, we assume that everyone speaks marketing. Most of us working in the agency world came from marketing. We drop marketing-bombs like “conversion.” Most of your prospects will think you’re trying to save their soul.</p>
<p><strong>Do your research before the call</strong> and make some assumptions. We know that <em>most </em>lawyers and contractors want phone calls. We know most retailers want foot-traffic. We know that online-retailers want an ecommerce purchase. Always ask, but don’t hesitate to assume and make that assumption part of the opener.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>Once you get that “of course” you’re expecting, you can explain how your clients are <a href="/blog/ws/2015/04/22/call-tracking-industries">using PPC to drive calls</a>.</p>
<p>So what do you say when you get the inevitable pushback? The “We’re doing just fine”?</p>
<h2>4. “You said you were doing fine, but&#8230;”</h2>
<p>Most likely, if you hear “We’re doing just fine,” you’re not talking to a decision-maker. This is when we should go back to their website or LinkedIn and find someone with more authority.</p>
<p>But what if this is the owner? Then we should assume they’re just busy. Turn the “no” into a “maybe” and ask for a follow-up date…or just call back later. But when you do, <strong>arm yourself with research</strong>. What are they doing to generate business? Are they using AdWords? Are their <em>competitors</em> using AdWords? Lead with this:</p>
<p>“You mentioned last time we talked that you’re doing fine, but I noticed that your competitor popped up when I Googled ‘St. Louis roof repair.’ Does that mean you’re not doing PPC?”</p>
<p>So what do you say if their response is, “PPC is expensive, so we do SEO…”</p>
<h2>5. “What’s been your experience with PPC?”</h2>
<p>This is actually a great objection. It means they’re somewhat savvy and have a <a href="/blog/ws/2016/10/26/marketing-budget">marketing budget</a>.</p>
<p>This leads to a great follow-up: “Have you ever tried PPC and if so, what happened?”</p>
<p><strong>PPC complements SEO</strong> so well that you have a great opportunity with them. Most likely, they got burned on PPC in the past or their current agency just doesn’t offer it. Either way, you can offer to set up their account for a fee and then manage it for a few months at a discount or offer a free month. Then prove to them that <a href="/blog/ws/2015/05/12/does-google-adwords-work">AdWords works</a> if done right.</p>
<p>However, don’t feel obligated to do too much for free. At my first sales job, they said to never use the word “free.” It leads people to undervalue what you’re offering.</p>
<h3>In conclusion</h3>
<p>Adding a new revenue stream is a highly effective way to grow your agency. Armed with these questions for prospects and clients, you’re well on your way.</p>
