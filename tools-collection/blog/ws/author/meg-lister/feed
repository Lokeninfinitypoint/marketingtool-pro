					<description><![CDATA[<p>What keywords demand the highest bids and costs per click (CPC's) in the ZAR currency? Check out the top 25 most expensive AdWords keywords, South Africa Edition!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As WordStream’s website manager, I occasionally stumble upon forgotten web pages crafted in the days of yore. For example: I recently read <a href="/blog/ws/2009/10/02/google-wave-invites-user-adoption">this one from 2009</a>, where Elisa told us Google Wave might just be the next big thing. Our readers probably have a similar feeling of nostalgia when they find our original Most Expensive Keywords post from 2011 (“Insurance keywords at only $25 per click? Those were the days!”)</p>
<p>As you might have guessed, the paid search landscape has changed just a little, teensy bit since 2011. So have we: our product and free tools are light years ahead of where we were then, and it was high time to update our <a href="/blog/ws/2017/06/27/most-expensive-keywords">Most Expensive Keywords data</a>.</p>
<p>This time, not only did we update the data, but we created currency-specific iterations of the infographic. They each have their charms: I’ve learned a lot about <a href="/blog/ws/2017/06/28/most-expensive-keywords-uk-edition">gambling in Great Britain</a> and the <a href="/blog/ws/2017/07/03/most-expensive-keywords-australia-edition">litigiousness of our Australian friends</a>.</p>
<p>Today, we’re bringing you the Top 25 Costliest Keywords, South Africa Edition!</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="1bed8297-0852-4336-81b7-7f8843249051" data-langcode="en">

<p>While there’s some overlap between the ZAR dataset and our other datasets (USA, Canada, United Kingdom, and Australia), there are a few significant differences. Though business services, software, loans, and finance all broke into the top 25, the “money category” (as Allen called it) was much smaller and lower on the list than in other countries.</p>
<h2>Car insurance takes the cake</h2>
<p>Insurance was the most expensive category in ZAR, by far. Car insurance was particularly prevalent in this data set, which included branded searches for Hippo Insurance (a popular South African insurer.) Interestingly, car insurance isn’t compulsory in South Africa, as it is in many other nations. (Norway, the UK, and the US all legally require drivers to carry third-party insurance.) Some statistics indicate that the majority of cars in South Africa—<a href="https://businesstech.co.za/news/motoring/147543/7-tips-to-help-you-save-on-your-car-insurance-premiums/">up to 65%</a>—are uninsured, which means the cost of a vehicle crash could be alarmingly high for all parties involved.</p>
<h2>…But you might not have that car for long</h2>
<p>Pawn services came in at #12 on our list, at an average of R24.77/click. Interestingly enough for this bike-riding writer, people were almost as eager to pawn their cars as they were to insure them. Many of the keywords in the “pawn services” category dealt with cars – including “pawn and drive,” “pawn my car,” and “pawn my car title.”</p>
<h2>Moving</h2>
<p>South Africa was the only region where “moving” was on the list – and it came in quite high, at #4! Popular keywords in this category were focused around home moves, particularly in Durban, South Africa’s third-largest city in the province of KwaZulu Natal. The province as a whole had the highest estimated inward migration of any province in South Africa over the past 5 years (2011-2016 saw an <a href="http://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/P0302/P03022014.pdf">influx of 1.1m in-migrants</a>) – keeping movers busy!</p>

<p><em>Beautiful downtown Durban</em></p>
<h2>Image-conscious categories: Jewelry, Health &amp; Fitness, Cosmetics, and Decorations</h2>
<p>The categories that rounded out the last 20% of the list were largely image-focused: jewelry, health &amp; fitness, cosmetics, and decorations! In the “decorations” category, South Africans were searching for flags and banners of all shapes and materials – feather banners, outdoor banners, popup banners, and teardrop banners!</p>
<p>Perhaps you’re getting ready to celebrate a spate of engagements – the jewelry category was full of searches for diamond rings, wedding rings, and engagement rings. Luckily, your wedding guests are going to look fit &amp; gorgeous – we saw lots of searches for skin creams, hair salons, and treadmills and home exercise equipment. I’m sitting at my desk full of FOMO thinking about all the fun South African parties I’m missing out on.</p>

<h2>There’s more where this came from:</h2>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2017/06/27/most-expensive-keywords">Most Expensive Keywords in the USA</a></p>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2017/06/28/most-expensive-keywords-uk-edition">Most Expensive Keywords in the United Kingdom</a></p>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2017/07/03/most-expensive-keywords-australia-edition">Most Expensive Keywords in Australia</a></p>
<h2>About the data:</h2>
<p>Here’s how we got the list: We pulled all the data collected from anonymous AdWords Performance Grader reports across all industries between June 1, 2016 and June 12, 2017, then looked at the top 1000 most expensive keywords seen during that time period and categorized them by core intent.</p>
<p>For example, we lumped the keywords “fitness course” and “personal trainer” into a single category since the core intent is the same. Likewise, keywords involving different types of lawyers (which happens to be the most expensive grouping in our AUD data set) or insurance were grouped together. We used a similar methodology when we created our first “Most Expensive Keywords” infographic back in 2011 so as to avoid featuring too many specific long-tail or local keywords that wouldn’t have broad applicability to a large number of businesses. We separated distinct services (pest control vs. termites) as much as possible.</p>
<p>We also filtered out keywords with less than 100 clicks from our data set. We only looked at advertisers bidding in USD, AUD, CAD, and ZAR, and analyzed different currencies separately. We also eliminated non-English ads and duplicates (where both the keyword and the CPC were exactly the same) from that set. The results you’re reading about in this article are in ZAR.</p>
<p>(Thank you to everyone who helped compile, analyze, and illustrate the data, including our data analyst Josh Brackett and our designer Kate Lindsay!)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A/B tests are like eating your vegetables. You know they’re good for you, and they’re something you’re <em>supposed </em>to do, right? The trouble is that they can be intensely time- and money-consuming. You’re probably already envisioning a process filled with negotiations with graphic designers and engineers, time-consuming integrations, maybe even difficulty convincing your manager that this is the right move. Never fear! With the right tools and some preparation, you’ll be running A/B tests with ease.</p>

</div>
<p><em>A recent A/B test that we ran on the WordStream.com homepage</em></p>
<p>I recently joined WordStream as a Senior Optimization Specialist and have been running lots of A/B tests, from home page tests to <a href="/blog/ws/2016/10/12/mobile-testing">mobile testing</a>, to increase conversion rates at key points in our user journeys. Our website gets a ton of traffic, but since we’re still in startup mode, we make a point to run our tests as frugally and efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>Based on our personal experiences, here are our <strong>top 5 tips to guide you through the A/B testing process if you’re also a small business or working on a budget</strong>.</p>
<h2>Tip #1: Find Your Biggest Pain Points &amp; Get Real Feedback</h2>
<p>You probably already have a good idea of what needs improvement on your website. Does a particular page have an insanely high bounce rate? Are your conversion rates on a specific section of your site falling behind? That&#8217;s your <a href="/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points">pain point</a>!</p>
<p>When deciding where to run a test, make sure that you’re running on pages with enough traffic to actually get real, actionable results. Sure, changing the imagery on <a href="/blog/ws/2010/09/28/about-us-page-conversion-rate">your “About Us” page</a> may slightly improve your conversion rates – but you’ll likely have to wait months to see any real results. Make sure that your test is running on a page that has a high traffic volume and is integral to the conversion process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="b105251e-ad80-4d4c-b81b-271e96f8ec92" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ab-testing-tips-product-page.png" alt="AB testing tips product pages" width="1119" height="979" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Your product page likely has the traffic volume and impact on the conversion funnel that makes it perfect for an A/B test. For example, you could test moving the CTA above the fold on this page.</em></p>
<p>Once you’ve identified the page or section that you’d like to test, it’s time to get some real, honest feedback. It’s hard for many marketers to look objectively at their own websites – that’s like calling your own baby ugly! You could reward some of your customers for completing a survey about their experience and asking them to identify specific points in the conversion path where they felt confused or couldn’t find the information they were looking for. In a <a href="http://lp.lavi.com/files/Why-We-Wont-Wait-Guide.pdf">survey by the Rockefeller Corporation (PDF)</a>, 68% of users reported abandoning a website experience because “they think it doesn’t care about them.” What’s worse, you’ll only ever hear from 4% of unsatisfied customers – the other 96% just abandon without submitting any feedback to your business. If you don’t have the resources to devote to user testing, you could call in a favor from a fellow marketer and ask for their unbiased evaluation.</p>
<h2>Tip #2: Think Big!</h2>
<p>Big problems require big solutions. Changing the color or size of your button may be an easy fix, but it’s not going help you achieve the long-term improvement you’re looking for. Instead, think about the <a href="/blog/ws/2015/02/20/call-to-action-buttons">call to action (CTA)</a> featured in the button or the offer itself. Is your CTA confusing, or is it not presenting enough value? <a href="/blog/ws/2015/04/08/persuasive-landing-pages">Revise the copy</a> with clear, action-driven language. Is your page not converting because the offer isn’t presented clearly enough? Think about adding a graphic or a video to demonstrate the value of the offer. <a href="/blog/ws/2014/03/17/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate">Perhaps the offer itself isn’t appealing</a> to your current audience. Instead of urging your user to buy your product now, you could test a free trial offer, or offer different contract lengths.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Think bigger! This likely won’t have the big impact on conversion rate that you’re looking for.</em></p>
<h2>Tip #3: Form a Realistic, Actionable Hypothesis, and Identify KPIs</h2>
<p>Once you’ve identified what your test will look like and where it will run, set some time aside to develop a hypothesis. Your hypothesis should take the form of a simple if/then statement (remember these from 7th grade science?): <em>If</em> I change the text of the CTA on my homepage, <em>then</em> my click-through rate will improve significantly. Refer back to this hypothesis when you’re analyzing the results of your test!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="f1533a9e-a765-445d-86d3-854ff9430e0a" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ab-testing-tips-grader-ab-test.png" alt="AB testing tips blog sidebar test" width="725" height="408" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>A recent test we ran on our blog sidebar.</em></p>
<p><em>The hypothesis was: “<strong>If </strong>we include an image of the AdWords Grader Report, <strong>then</strong> users will be more likely to complete the Grader.”</em><em> </em></p>
<p>After you’ve developed a hypothesis, choose some key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor your test. In the example above, the main KPI would be <a href="/click-through-rate">click-through rate</a>. You’d also want to pay attention to conversion rate. Develop a daily or weekly tracker where you can keep an eye on these metrics. Many <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/11/copywriting-ab-tests">A/B testing</a> services will monitor them for you, and if you’re running a test using two unique URLs, you can isolate these two pages in your reporting software. Also, if you’re presenting multiple offers on the same page, make sure that you’re tracking all of them so that you’re able to hone in on the results of your test! You may find that you’ve cannibalized one offer by optimizing the other.</p>

<h2>Tip #4: Be Patient!</h2>
<p>Doing nothing may be the most difficult part of your test! Make sure that you run your test for at least 7 days and that your results achieve statistical significance – at least 95% is recommended. Most A/B testing services will compute the significance of your results for you, but you can also find a calculator online (<a href="https://www.optimizely.com/resources/sample-size-calculator">here is a good one from Optimizely</a>). Be aware that if you’re testing a low-traffic page, or if your website doesn’t have a high number of conversions, you’ll need to run your test for a few weeks or more.</p>

</div>
<p><em>Sample from Optimizely’s free sample size calculator. Take advantage of this even if you’re not an Optimizely customer!</em></p>
<h2>Tip #5: Choose the Right Testing Partner &amp; Invest in Your Own Training</h2>
<p>There are several good A/B testing platforms on the market right now! You’ll find that almost all platforms offer the same basic A/B testing features, including a visual WYSIWYG editor so that you can move, resize, and edit different elements of your page without calling in development resources (a big timesaver!). They also offer basic reporting features, visitor segmentation (would you like to only show your test to new visitors? Desktop visitors?), the ability to set custom goals, and run tests across multiple pages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="060cc90f-af25-4669-b3f0-b65d90194b99" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>An example of Optimizely’s visual editor in action.</em></p>
<p>Optimizely has been around for a while and has set the standard for A/B testing tools. They also offer a suite of training lessons geared towards specialized users. However, their pricing may be prohibitive for many small businesses. Some other options to consider are Convert, Marketizator, and Visual Website Optimizer (VWO).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="96f63f25-58b7-4501-b16d-63d395d00b02" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Heatmap tracking may be a value-add for your A/B test.</em></p>
<p>Convert has the most competitive pricing and integrates goals, segmentation, and tracking easily with Google Analytics, Crazy Egg, and other CRO software. Marketizator is also cost-competitive, especially when signing a longer-term contract. They include additional survey and personalization features to deliver banner ads when your users load, scroll, or exit a page. Visual Website Optimizer aims to serve as an all-in-one conversion optimization platform, offering heatmaps and advanced targeting and personalization features on top of standard A/B testing.</p>
<p>Finally, after you’ve chosen a testing partner, take the time to master the tool and make sure that you’re fully trained on how to set up and run tests. Any good software partner will take the time to offer you training resources and help you get your first test set up.</p>
<p>You’re all ready to start setting up your first (or your best) A/B tests! Let us know how it goes.</p>
