					<description><![CDATA[<p>Learn the basics of brand awareness, how it facilitates your broader marketing goals, plus 18 brand-building strategies (with examples) to help you build brand awareness for your small business.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">18 Sneaky Ways to Build Brand Awareness</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you need a tissue, do you ask for a tissue, or for a Kleenex? When you’re ordering a drink at a fast-food restaurant, do you ask for a cola, or a Coke? What about when you cut yourself? Do you look for a plastic bandage, or a Band-Aid?</p>
<p>These terms are known as proprietary eponyms, and they’re the apex of <strong>brand awareness</strong>. These brands have become so well-known, they’ve replaced the generic terms for similar products in our language.</p>
<p>For a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/17/direct-to-consumer-marketing">brand</a> or product to become a proprietary eponym is pretty much the pinnacle of brand awareness (sorry, Pepsi).</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/comparative-advertising-pepsi-coke.jpg" alt="Coke and Pepsi cans image" width="768" height="432" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12480" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/comparative-advertising-pepsi-coke.jpg 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/comparative-advertising-pepsi-coke-480x270.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 768px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Although you might not achieve this with your small business, that doesn’t mean you can’t do a lot more to boost awareness of your brand. So in this post, we&#8217;re going to equip you to do just that.</p>

<h2>What is brand awareness?</h2>
<p>Brand awareness is the extent to which a brand is recognized by potential customers and correctly associated with its particular product or service. In the case of a small business, their level of brand awareness may not reach eponym status (e.g. asking for a Kleenex instead of a tissue), but simpler forms are counted as success. This could mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumers having knowledge of what your business is known for.</li>
<li>A social media user knowing your ad is going to be funny when they come across you in their feed.</li>
<li>Customers choosing your brand specifically over others, even if there are cheaper options.</li>
<li>Search engine users typing your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/23/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name">business name</a> or other <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/03/19/why-bid-on-branded-terms-ppc">branded terms </a>into search.</li>
</ul>
<p>ThriveHive is now a part of the WordStream family, but you can see in the example below that one of the top queries that led to their site traffic was their brand name. This is good brand awareness.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/what20is20brand20awareness20branded20searches_2.png" alt="what is brand awareness branded searches" width="637" height="346" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When your consumers have brand awareness, they often learn more about your business because they know it exists and are actively seeking out information on it, rather than discovering it in a Google or Yelp search.</p>
<div id="brand-recognition-vs-brand-awareness"></div>
<h2>Brand recognition vs. brand awareness: What&#8217;s the difference?</h2>
<p>Brand recognition is the extent to which a consumer can correctly identify your brand based on visual indicators such as logo and colors. For example, if you see the Dunkin Donuts pink and orange letters up ahead, before even making out the words, you’d automatically recognize it as Dunkin Donuts.</p>
<p>Brand awareness takes brand recognition a step further. It involves recalling not only the business name <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/08/business-name-ideas">(ideas for creative business names here!)</a>, but also the general feeling of the business, information about its products and services, and other experiential details. When a business has a level of brand awareness, their marketing and <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/13/best-advertising-campaigns">advertising campaigns</a> mean something to their audience. They elicit feelings and emotions in the consumer.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Brand awareness is all about what the mind state your ideal clients enter when they see or hear your company’s name.</strong></p></blockquote>

<h2>The importance of brand awareness</h2>
<p>No matter the quality of your products and services, no matter how <a href="/blog/ws/2015/05/21/how-much-does-adwords-cost">much you spend on advertising</a>, and no matter how much you <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business">post to social media</a>, your business isn&#8217;t likely to get very far if it doesn&#8217;t have a brand to set itself apart. Your brand packages up your company name, logo, offerings, and content into an experience for your audience and customers. It is the aspect of businesses that consumers come to trust, that places businesses ahead of their competitors.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/brand20awareness20benefits.png" alt="brand awareness brand benefits" width="800" height="624" /></div>
<p>Yet simply having a brand is not enough. It&#8217;s important to be consistently building that brand and strengthening its associations in the minds of your target audience. The more familiar people are with something, the more they <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/27/trust-signals">trust</a> it and gravitate to it. The more familiar your target audience is with your brand, the easier it will be to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/02/promote-your-business">Promote your business</a> across multiple channels.</li>
<li>Successfully introduce <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">new products or services</a>.</li>
<li>Build a strong <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/growth-lab-reputation-management/recipe-reputation-success-real-business-owner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business reputation</a>.</li>
<li>Find and <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/13/marketing-agencies-retention-strategies-covid-19">retain loyal customers.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, brand awareness is important because it helps pave the way for achieving a variety of your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-plan-goals-objectives-for-small-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small business marketing goals and objectives</a> like staying ahead of the competition, building an audience, and <a href="/blog/ws/2012/02/22/quick-lead-generation">generating more leads</a>. So how do you build a level of brand awareness that facilitates this kind of success?</p>
<div id="how-do-you-build-brand-awareness"></div>
<h2>How to build brand awareness</h2>
<p>Sure, you can plaster your business name on every <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/26/out-of-home-advertising">billboard</a> in town, but most business owners don’t have the budget for high-priced advertising. Plus, increased exposure doesn’t necessarily equate to increased brand awareness. For some simpler yet effective ways of building brand awareness, you may want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a custom <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/20/daily-hashtags">hashtag for Instagram.</a></li>
<li>Participate in or sponsor local events.</li>
<li>Post regularly to social media using your brand voice.</li>
<li>Run display ads on the <a href="/blog/ws/2014/11/18/google-display-network-tips">Google Display Network</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the Kleenex and Dunkin Donuts examples above, here are some more companies that have a high level of brand awareness.</p>
<ul>
<li>Coca Cola</li>
<li>Johnson &amp; Johnson</li>
<li>Visa</li>
<li>Nike</li>
<li>Google</li>
</ul>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/what20is20brand20awareness20nike.jpg" alt="what is brand awareness nike" width="800" height="366" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://clubhouse.swingu.com/gear/11-best-nike-commercials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>Most people can identify these brands and feel their unique atmospheres from merely catching a quick glance at their logo or a snippet of their jingle. Using eye-catching visuals, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/05/best-ad-platform">advertising in the right places</a>, and developing a distinct voice in your content, you too can build brand awareness for your company. The key is to be consistent so that you can strengthen your image in the eyes of your audience with every encounter.</p>

<div id="brand-awareness-strategies"></div>
<h2>Brand awareness strategies and examples</h2>
<p>Traditionally, online marketers use the display network to build brand awareness. You can generate thousands of affordable impressions on Display, and when you create enticing display ads, you give yourself a good chance of generating affordable clicks as well. But today, we&#8217;re going to talk about some brand-building techniques that you can use aside from or in conjunction with the display network.</p>
<p>While there’s no quick fix for becoming a household name, here are 18 <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/01/brand-strategy">brand-building strategies</a> to help launch (and continue) your efforts. You may not become as well-known as Coca-Cola, but it can’t hurt to try, right?</p>
<p>Here are our best pieces of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/20/social-listening">brand-building advice</a>.</p>
<h3>1. Referral programs</h3>
<p>Users will gladly spread word of your product or service when they know they’ll get an added perk. Dropbox is a great example of how smart referral programs can <a href="/blog/ws/2015/06/02/growth-hacking">growth hack</a> a business. Dropbox gives existing users 500 MB of extra storage space for every friend they refer (up to 16 GB). Back when Dropbox was still new, this referral program helped generate tons of <a href="/blog/ws/2014/06/26/word-of-mouth-marketing">word-of-mouth</a>, delivering a huge number of sign-ups and saving Dropbox countless advertising dollars.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/how-to-generate-leads-referral-marketing.png" alt="how to generate leads - referral program example" width="500" height="605" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67971" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/how-to-generate-leads-referral-marketing.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/how-to-generate-leads-referral-marketing-480x581.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></div>
<h3>2. Impressive guest content</h3>
<p>Another great way to get your brand known on the web is to deliver ultra valuable, gorgeous looking content to share on other blogs. Guest posting (despite what some might tell you) is still a powerful way to get your name known in your industry.</p>
<p>However, run-of-the-mill content won’t cut it – you need to be guest publishing high-quality stuff. Create memorable, valuable content and you’ll be introduced to new audiences and make a lasting impression.</p>

<h3>3. Infographics</h3>
<p>Infographics are a bright and colorful way to display interesting marketing data and statistics. These content powerhouses often get shared far and wide, making them a great tool for brand building and thought leadership.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/november-marketing-ideas-shoplocal-infographic-sonoma.png" alt="small business saturday - reasons to shop local" width="410" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-65703" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/november-marketing-ideas-shoplocal-infographic-sonoma.png 410w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/november-marketing-ideas-shoplocal-infographic-sonoma-120x300.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px" /></div>
<h3>4. Freemium with credit</h3>
<p>Many awesome online products allow users to choose from a free version, which includes a watermark or credit line, or the option to upgrade to the paid version, which allows users to remove the mark or replace it with their own logo. While many users will opt for the free version, they’ll also be promoting your brand to others users. Some of those new users who see your product will go with the paid version! Providing a freemium product means getting yourself in front of more eyeballs, building your brand and bringing in paying customers.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/brand-awareness-newsletter-signup.png" alt="Brand awareness newsletter signup" width="655" height="277" /></div>
<h3>5. Local partnerships</h3>
<p>Another great brand building strategy is to get involved with local partnerships (this is <em>tremendously </em>important for <a href="/blog/ws/2015/04/06/local-business-marketing">local-oriented businesses</a>, but can be applied for other businesses as well). <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/26/partner-marketing">Partner with other local businesses</a> to hold join intro seminars or festivals. Sponsor local sports teams and donate to charity events. Getting your brand plastered around festivals and events will do big things for your brand.</p>
<h3>6. Car wraps</h3>
<p>A classic tried-and-true strategy for building your brand is getting a car wrap! Car wraps are customized designs that can cover your entire car (don’t worry, you can still see through the windows)! They can attract a hefty amount of attention, and it’s a great way to ensure that wherever you go, people are becoming more familiar with your brand. Wrap your company car or even your own personal vehicle!</p>
<h3>7. Freebies</h3>
<p>Everyone loves free stuff! Put your brand name on koozies, pens, Frisbees, etc, then give away your items at local festivals.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/brand-awareness-giveaways1.jpg" alt="Brand awareness giveaways and freebies" width="450" height="450" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Koozies from Philly Phaithful</em></p>
<h3>8. Social media contests</h3>
<p>Run a social media contest in which contestants submit a photo or video, with other users voting for their favorites. Contestants will share the link with friends and family to get more votes, building your brand awareness as a result.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Instagram-hashtags-example-contest.png" alt="Instagram hashtags - Instagram giveaway post" width="720" height="401" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76202" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Instagram-hashtags-example-contest.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Instagram-hashtags-example-contest-480x267.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>9. Social media marketing</h3>
<p>With the number of social networks constantly increasing, trying to do active <a href="/social-media-marketing">social media marketing</a> on all of them is a fool’s errand. If your business is best suited to a particular network, then don’t be afraid to put the majority of your energy into a few sites.</p>
<p>For example, photo-heavy sites might focus on Instagram and Pinterest. <a href="/blog/ws/2014/09/23/ppc-for-b2b-software-companies">B2B companies</a> often do best on Twitter, whereas small businesses in creative industries (like <a href="/blog/ws/2015/11/12/etsy-marketing">craft marketing</a>) can do well on Instagram. Know where your audiences hang and focus on those networks. You won’t want to totally abandon the other social sites, but save your biggest efforts for what you <em>know</em> works. Not sure about your core network? Start digging into analytics to see where your <a href="/blog/ws/2014/07/23/referral-traffic-links">referral traffic</a> is coming from.</p>
<h3>10. LinkedIn publishing</h3>
<p>We already talked a bit about the value of guest posting, but there are also other methods to get published and spread your name across the web. Recently, LinkedIn began letting all users publish posts right to LinkedIn via the publishing tool. If your posts get enough attention, it could wind up in the LinkedIn home stream for many users. As an added bonus, having posts attached to your LinkedIn account also helps <a href="/blog/ws/2015/07/09/influential-ppc-expert-traits">establish you as a thought leader</a>! Of course you can also always set up your own company blog and post there – just make sure you share and promote your posts after publishing.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/brand-awareness-larry-kim-inc-magazine.png" alt="Brand awareness get published" width="604" height="509" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<h3>11. Pro storytelling</h3>
<p>Want to be a memorable brand? Start with stellar storytelling. If you can create emotionally moving, compelling stories that connect deeply with users, they won’t soon forget your name. <a href="/blog/ws/2014/12/05/business-storytelling">Here are some storytelling tips</a> to get you started</p>
<h3>12. Developing a unique brand personality</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.envato.com/blog/branding-trends/">Branding trends</a> come and go, but giving your brand a fun, unique brand identity is a timeless strategy. If you work in an industry where a little dose of comedy or personality is appropriate, being outrageous can make your brand extremely memorable.</p>
<p>A few major examples of businesses who inject humor and comedy into brand promotion include Old Spice, Poopouri, and Dollar Shave Club.</p>
<div>
<div class="video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video"><iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JGgpPQvXUE0?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
</div>
<p>Not only did these hilarious ads leave an impression with audiences – they also became viral sensations, shared across the web and driving sales.</p>
<h3>13. Podcasts</h3>
<p>Starting your own industry podcast where you interview industry experts is a great way to build your brand while also developing relationships with others in your field. Some industries, like marketing, already have a hefty number of podcasts that would be tough for a beginner to compete against. (Here are a few of <a href="/blog/ws/2015/06/10/best-marketing-podcasts">our favorite marketing podcasts</a>.)</p>
<p>However, for niche industries where there isn’t much on the airwaves, you could easily make yourself a household name. You could also <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/05/podcast-advertising">try podcast advertising</a>!</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/brand-awareness-podcasts.png" alt="Brand awareness podcasts" width="824" height="410" /></div>
<h3>14. PPC advertising</h3>
<p>With SEO becoming more competitive every day, while organic Google real-estate shrinks, PPC is a smart solution for getting your brand seen on Google. With targeted keyword research, you could be <a href="https://thrivehive.com/how-to-get-to-the-top-of-google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showing up at the top of Google</a> for relevant searches. Even if users don’t end up clicking on your PPC ad, seeing your name at the top of the search results makes an impression and is incredible for building brand awareness.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/google-ads-real-estate-example-ads.webp" alt="google ads for real estate ads example in serp" width="703" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76236" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/google-ads-real-estate-example-ads.webp 703w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/google-ads-real-estate-example-ads-480x409.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 703px, 100vw" /></p>
<div><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4d7.png" alt="📗" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Free guide:</strong> <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLPPC101.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_PPC101_Download"><strong>PPC 101: The Beginner&#8217;s Guide to PPC</strong></a></div>
<h3>15. Remarketing campaigns</h3>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2013/12/04/adwords-remarketing-best-practices-guide">Remarketing</a> is a pro strategy for boosting that good ol’ brand awareness. Why? Remarketing involves showing ads to users who visited your site, but left before converting. Remarketing ads are placed all across the web on sites your customers visit. Soon they’ll be seeing your business everywhere – on their favorite blogs, while shopping online, etc. This gives the impression that your brand is much larger (and has a much bigger ad budget) than it really is. And it&#8217;s a great way to increase your conversion rate.</p>
<h3>16. Paid social advertising</h3>
<p>Organic social marketing is becoming more difficult by the day, leading more businesses to turn to paid social advertising. Facebook and <a href="/blog/ws/2015/04/28/twitter-ads">Twitter ads</a> are relatively cheap and help get your brand seen on social. Whether or not users convert immediately, every added piece of familiarity counts when users finally are ready to make a purchase.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/brand-awareness-paid-social.png" alt="Brand awareness paid social" width="842" height="494" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<h3>17. Controversy</h3>
<p>While this strategy isn’t for everyone, one way to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/13/get-your-website-noticed-on-google">get your brand noticed</a> is by <a href="/blog/ws/2014/05/19/contrarian-content-marketing">being controversial</a>. Take an unlikely stance on a hot industry topic, and you may find yourself attracting quite a bit of attention. <a href="/blog/ws/2017/06/19/most-controversial-ads">Whether it’s good or bad attention</a> depends on the subject matter and your approach. Then again, there’s no such thing as bad press (so they say anyway).</p>

<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/06/24/landing-page-tools">6 Landing Page Tools to Save Your Conversion Rates</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Landing pages allow you to deliver ultra-relevant messages to hyper-targeted audiences, speaking to specific user needs and improving conversions. In fact, <a href="http://www.ioninteractive.com/interactive-content-blog/2013/11/20/18-mind-blowing-landing-page-stats-infographic">companies with 30+ landing pages</a> get 7x as many leads as companies with less than 10 landing pages.</p>
<p>Good marketing is all about good landing pages, and the right gear can make your mission much easier. With templates, tracking, and testing, and these landing page tools are real lifesavers.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong><a href="http://www.crazyegg.com/">1. Crazy Egg</a></strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.crazyegg.com/">Crazy Egg’s</a> main claim to fame is its heatmap tracking reports, showing where visitors are clicking on your pages. Crazy Egg lets you see exactly which parts of your page are attracting user attention (and you may be surprised by what you find).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/crazy-egg-landing-page-tool.png" alt="crazy egg landing page tool" width="971" height="437" /></div>
<p>With Crazy Egg, you can run heatmap, scroll map, confetti reports, and more, providing valuable user experience insight at a pretty reasonable price. Don’t worry, there’s no weird hardware to install, and Crazy Egg promises a quick and painless setup process.</p>
<p>Crazy Egg notes that many customers end up discovering that website visitors are clicking on elements of the webpage that aren’t even links! Remedying these design mishaps will greatly improve your landing page’s engagement and conversion rates.</p>
<p>Crazy Egg pricing starts at $9/month, with higher tiers allowing for more page testing and more visitor traffic.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="http://unbounce.com/">2. Unbounce</a></strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://unbounce.com/">Unbouce</a> is one of the most well-known landing page tools on the web. Unbounce lets you build and test a wide variety of landing pages, no IT help required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unbounce-landing-pages.png" alt="unbounce landing pages" width="762" height="269" /></div>
<p>Use Unbounce’s large selection of templates, or simply test and compare your own. Unbounce also integrates with other common <a href="/blog/ws/2015/08/24/online-marketing-tools">marketing tools</a> like MailChimp, Salesforce, Marketo, and more. Unbounce provides you with all the A/B testing tools you need to evaluate which of your landing pages are working best, and help you craft and hone the perfect page.</p>
<p>Unbounce starts at $49/month (with a 5,000 unique views traffic limit), with higher tier options for added features and more traffic.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.optimizely.com/"><strong>3. Optimizely</strong></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.optimizely.com/">Optimizely</a> provides a very similar offering to Unbounce – create and test landing pages with a visual editor, no coding required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/optimizely.png" alt="optimizely" width="970" height="549" /></div>
<p>Optimizely was co-created by Dan Siroker, who also served as Director of Analytics for Obama’s 2008 campaign, so you know your data is in good hands.</p>
<p>The major difference between Optimizely and Unbounce is that Unbounce provides some gorgeous built-in templates for you to use, while Optimizely does not.</p>
<p><strong>Optimizely has a free offering with basic features</strong> for a single website. Enterprise business plans vary depending on your needs – talk with them to get a quote.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="http://paths.ioninteractive.com/apps/site/score-your-landing-pages">4. Ion Interactive Landing Page Assessment</a></strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="http://paths.ioninteractive.com/apps/site/score-your-landing-pages">ion Interactive Landing Page Assessment</a> asks you 13 multiple choice questions about your landing page (covering classic topics like relevancy, above-the-fold content, trust factors, etc).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/landing-page-tools.png" alt="landing page tools" width="600" height="150" /></div>
<p>At the end, you’ll get an overall score with recommendations for approval. This assessment relies on self-reporting, which isn’t the most accurate evaluation. Still, it’s a decent free tool if you’re still new to the fabulous world of landing page optimization.</p>
<h2><a href="https://vwo.com/landing-page-analyzer/report/"><strong>5. Landing Page Analyzer</strong></a></h2>
<p>Visual Website Optimizer has a free <a href="https://vwo.com/landing-page-analyzer/report/">Landing Page Analyzer</a> tool that reviews and evaluates your landing page based off of 21 questions. Provide answers about your landing page, with questions inquiring about the number of offers on your landing page, the availability of product screenshots, landing page length, and more.</p>
<p>While the tool asks you to input your URL, it seems like most of the tool’s assessment stems from your answers to the 21 yes or no questions.</p>
<p>After answering the questions, you’ll get an overall grade, plus a score on specific areas that relate to overall landing page greatness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/landing-page-analyzer.png" alt="landing page analyzer" width="1000" height="544" /></div>
<p>The Landing Page Analyzer also provides a detailed feedback section, giving you suggestions on areas to improve upon. Again, the tool relies heavily on self-assessment, so obviously you’ll want to be truthful about your answers.</p>
<p>The Landing Page Analyzer is a solid free tool that lets you make sure you’re following the industry best practices for good landing pages. Ultimately you probably won’t learn anything you couldn’t have found out by reading up on best practices, but it’s certainly a more fun and engaging way to learn what your landing page needs.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="https://usabilityhub.com">6. Usability Hub Tests</a></strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://usabilityhub.com">Usability Hub</a> allows you to create and test quick experiments. Have testers choose between two button colors and see which they prefer. Have them show you where they’d naturally click on your page to add an item to a shopping cart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/landing-page-tests.png" alt="landing page tests" width="600" height="316" /></div>
<p>Choose from four different styles of mini-tests and then evaluate the results and make larger landing page design choices based on what you learn. You can either pay to run tests, or earn karma by being a part of other users’ tests. Earned karma can then be used to run your own tests!</p>
<p>I love how nifty Usability Hub’s little tests are. Not only can you gather great intel from them, they are also tons of fun to play with as a tester. I would gladly test and earn karma all day!</p>

<p>Let’s dig in and find out! We’ll start with a basic definition of growth hacking – what the heck is it?</p>
<h2><strong>What Is Growth Hacking?</strong></h2>
<p>Growth hacking concerns outside-the-box marketing strategies used to get the <strong>maximum number of users with minimal spend</strong>. It’s substituting billboards and TV ads for unconventional thinking and user psychology.</p>
<p>Growth hackers think up non-traditional solutions to gaining new users. The keyword is <strong>growth</strong>, and oftentimes growth hackers are hunting as much growth traction as they can get their hands on, even if solutions are only temporary.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/blog/ws/2015/01/12/startup-marketing">Startups</a> are the main followers of growth hacking</strong>. They are forced into innovative marketing techniques since tight budgets prevent traditional practices. Growth hackers deal in a wide range of areas including SEO, content marketing, social media, and email marketing.</p>
<p>Growth hackers experiment, test, and are always pushing limits with unconventional acquisition strategies. Growth hackers are often dancing with the devil<strong>,</strong> frolicking in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/gray-hat-seo">grey hat</a> territory where more established companies tend not to wander. They aren’t afraid to work around the system, hence the title “hacker.”</p>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Breakin’ rules</em></p>
<p>Growth hackers are similar to marketers, but also inherently different. There’s a single-mindedness and desperation to growth hackers as they focus solely on <strong>growth, no matter what the means</strong>.</p>
<h2><strong>Growth Hacking Marketing Resources: What You Gotta Know</strong></h2>
<p>So you’re ready to be a growth hacker?</p>

<p>Check in regularly with Growth Hackers to keep tabs on the hottest growth hacking news!</p>
<h2><strong>Growth Hacking Examples</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Dropbox</strong> is often cited as a classic example of how to utilize growth hacking. Instead of spending big bucks on advertising, Dropbox thought up an entirely new and ingenious way to get more users.</p>
<p>Dropbox, a cloud storage service, started <strong>offering extra storage space to existing users who refer friends.</strong> Their referrals shot through the roof, and they barely had to work for it.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="7cc3ab5b-999e-405e-b9f6-09b5e8471024" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Dropbox shows that a little unconventional brainstorming can lead to some pretty remarkable growth.</p>
<p>Another <strong>great example of growth hacking comes from Airbnb</strong>.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="36d2cc8d-f170-4785-84eb-78023cffba32" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/airbnb-growth-hacking.png" alt="airbnb growth hacking" width="337" height="150" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Airbnb realized they could get a ton of property views by utilizing Craigslist, so they added a “Post to Craigslist” feature in their listing options menu.</p>
<p>This was short lived, as Craigslist eventually pulled the plug, but that temporary growth hack gave Airbnb the boost they needed to eventually become the powerful hotel-crushing business they are today!</p>
<h2><strong>14 Effective Growth Hacking Techniques</strong></h2>
<p><strong>1. Automate like no one’s business.</strong> Automation and repetition are key to growth hacking success. Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/08/24/online-marketing-tools">software and tools</a> to help you do your job faster. See what works and then streamline it.</p>
<p><strong>2. Double-sided referrals.</strong> Provide referrals that benefit both parties (the individual doing the referring and the individual being referred).</p>
<p><strong>3. Abandoned cart emails.</strong> If you run an ecommerce business, consider setting up emails to send to users who <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/17/shopping-cart-abandonment">abandon their shopping cart</a>. Users don’t finish checking out for a variety of reasons, including simple distraction. These cart reminder emails are great for getting shoppers back in line – in fact, a study by <a href="http://www.getelastic.com/cart-abandonment-stats-infographic/">Salecycle</a> shows that nearly <strong>50% of abandoned cart emails are opened</strong>, with one third of clicks resulting in a purchase!</p>
<p><strong>4. Free for bloggers.</strong> Bloggers are a great source of product reviews (and backlinks) to your site. Make it easy for bloggers to try out your product or service by including a “free for bloggers” option within your pricing page. (Alternatively, you could do “Are you a blogger doing a review? Contact us” or something similar.) Get the blogger’s email and see if they are an appropriate blog to work with. Then email them all the info and graphics they need to create a hit blog post, making their life that much easier.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, be sure to <strong>reach out to bloggers in your industry</strong> <strong>and court them for a review</strong>. Not everyone will say yes, but some certainly will.</p>
<p><strong>5. Get niche with social sharing.</strong> Naturally you want to share your content online, and you’ll toss your post to the usual social media gauntlets like Facebook and Twitter. However, there’s so much more you can do.</p>
<p>Find a narrow subreddit related to your topic (there’s a subreddit on every subject under the sun) and post there, rather than to larger, more general subreddits. Also share your stuff on Quora, forums, and in the comments of other blogs (so long as what you’re sharing is relevant to the discussion).</p>
<p><strong>6. Test everything. </strong>Testing is the best way to carve away at your site until it’s a sleek, efficient, and high-performing piece of perfection. Test anything and everything!</p>
<p><strong>7. User-generated content contests.</strong> Host a photography or video contest asking customers to show why they love your product or service. Not only do contests get a lot of attention, but that valuable user-generated content can be utilized elsewhere in form of testimonials or for re-sharing across social sites.</p>
<p><strong>8. Not your grandma’s content.</strong> Craft interesting, above-the-rest videos and mega-guides so you&#8217;re offering <a href="http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/23/cornerstone-content-guide">truly awesome content</a>. Remember free tools count as content too! And they can get people interested in your paid offering.</p>
<p><strong>9. Be a personality.</strong> Sometimes it pays to be an odd duck. Embarking on outrageous and unusual PR and marketing campaigns can get news sites interested. If multiple news outlets write up a piece covering your business (even if it’s for being ‘out there’), you’ve won.</p>
<p><strong>10. Make the most of your data.</strong> Your data is a valuable weapon, but if left unsharpened, it can’t do much good. Make sure you are utilizing your data and filtering it to siphon out the insight you need (whether you’re talking demographics, content, site activity, etc).</p>
<p><strong>11. Fake it till you make it.</strong> You have to dress for the job, even if the suit is 3x too big! Many sites that rely on user-generated content have a hard time getting off the ground. After all, no one wants to hang out in a graveyard. If necessary, don’t be afraid to even up the odds a bit by seeding supply (aka, create artificial content). When Reddit first began, they had to create fake user accounts to generate interest. You might benefit doing something similar.</p>
<p><strong>12. PPC.</strong> <a href="/learn">Pay-per-click marketing</a> is not just a great method for driving conversions, but also can be used to validate ideas, test wording, and learn what language customers are attracted to. Even startups with a tight budget should consider sparing $100-$200 on PPC simply to test and validate different ad concepts.</p>
<p><strong>13. Remarketing.</strong> <a href="/blog/ws/2013/12/04/adwords-remarketing-best-practices-guide">Remarketing is powerful stuff</a> – get it on your side! Not only does remarketing (showing ads to people who have already visited your site) boast nice conversion rates, but it also does a lot to build your brand. The more users see your company on their favorite blogs, the more you stick in their minds. Suddenly you’re not a nameless nobody. Users may even see you as more trustworthy and established.</p>
<p><strong>14. Swing your partner.</strong> Partnering up with complementary businesses is another sweet growth hacking technique to expand your audience. Host a partner webinar, run a joint contest, offer unique promotions to the partner customers, and you’ll be reaching a whole new audience without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p><em>A big thanks is owed to <a href="http://piktochart.com/13-growth-hacking-techniques-you-could-apply-right-now/">Piktochart</a> and <a href="http://yongfook.com/actionable-growth-hacking-tactics.html">Yong Fook</a>, who inspired some of these growth hacking tips.</em></p>
<p>Good luck with growth-hacking – now have at it!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marketing graders are handy tools to have around, evaluating and grading your website to help you improve your marketing performance. Today we’re looking at<strong> 10 awesome marketing graders</strong> that will help you get a sense of how far you’ve come down the marketing road, and where you should focus your gaze next to improve your marketing campaigns across the board.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="/google-adwords">1. AdWords Performance Grader</a></strong></h2>
<p>WordStream’s very own <a href="/google-adwords">AdWords Grader</a> is a super handy free tool that evaluates your Google Ads (formerly known as AdWords) PPC account, giving an impressively packed report on where your campaigns thrive and where they wither and die.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="67f1b48d-a700-4e3a-9a48-140bb08b0354" data-langcode="en">

</div>
<p>The AdWords Grader tests your account on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Negative Keywords:</strong> Negative keywords make sure you aren’t wasting money on non-relevant keywords. Do you have the right amount of negative keywords in your account?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quality Score: </strong>A major factor in Google’s ranking algorithm, having a good Quality Score is a must for PPC.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impression Share:</strong> Are your PPC ads appearing for relevant queries?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Click-Through Rate (CTR):</strong> A strong CTR means you have targeted, relevant ads. A low CTR can put you into the danger zone.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account Activity:</strong> Are you logging into your Google Ads account regularly and updating your settings?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Long-tail Keyword Optimization:</strong> Long-tail keywords make for more targeted, cost-effective campaigns. Make sure your account is loaded with keywords.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ad Text Optimization:</strong> Do you have enough text ads to be appropriately targeting your various keywords groups?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Landing Page Optimization:</strong> More landing pages make for more targeted messages that speak to visitors. Do you have the right number of landing pages?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobile Advertising:</strong> Mobile PPC is hot these days. Are you following mobile advertising best practices?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>PPC Best Practices:</strong> Make sure you’re following the expert PPC guidelines to ensure your account is up to snuff.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s quite the impressive array of metrics. The AdWords Grader doesn’t just toss numbers in your face – it provides actionable tips you can take immediately which will help you improve your PPC performance.</p>

</div>
<p>WordStream’s PPC marketing grader sets you against the standards in your industry, letting you see how your numbers compare to others with similar budgets and pushing you to improve. If you do PPC (<a href="/blog/ws/2015/05/12/does-google-adwords-work">and why wouldn’t you?</a>), the AdWords Grader is an obvious must-use. WordStream also offers two other <a href="/wordstream-graders">free marketing graders</a>, the Bing Ads Grader and the Landing Page Grader.</p>
<h2><a href="http://nibbler.silktide.com/"><strong>2. Nibbler</strong></a></h2>
<p>Nibbler is a marketing grader that provides an overall grade for your website experience, along with 4 specialized grades focusing on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> How accessible is the site for mobile and disabled users?</li>
<li><strong>Experience:</strong> How user-friendly is your web experience?</li>
<li><strong>Marketing: </strong>How well are you marketing your site and <a href="/blog/ws/2014/12/17/social-media-strategy">promoting it on social media</a>?</li>
<li><strong>Technology:</strong> What is the design and functionality of the site?</li>
</ul>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0c656a4e-0daa-4376-bb94-d160610194c4" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Each section contains a dropdown providing more information. There you’ll find your ranking for individual tests, dealing with a huge list of specific metrics like Facebook activity, coding errors, your site’s printability, etc.</p>
<p>Nibbler is definitely a great marketing grader tool to help you get a sense of what areas your website could improve on, with a colorful grading system that provides an easy read.</p>
<h2><a href="https://marketing.grader.com/"><strong>3. HubSpot Marketing Grader</strong></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://marketing.grader.com/"><strong>HubSpot Marketing Grader</strong></a> gives you a short and sweet overview of your marketing status.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="d856f79f-8b9d-4e7c-8631-407d09115685" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>The tool gives you an overall grade on a scale from 1-100, then digs in and checks your site against metrics in five categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blogging</li>
<li>Social Media</li>
<li>SEO</li>
<li>Lead Generation</li>
<li>Mobile</li>
</ul>
<p>Each category has a checklist. The <a href="/blog/ws/2014/11/24/blogging-tips">blogging</a> checklist looks like this:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="3ea9e14f-a7b3-4b7f-9fc1-100c91446ff2" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>For each item on the checklist, you can get details about that metric, find out why it’s important, and learn how to correct your site if you’re not yet up to par.</p>
<p>For most marketers, many of these checklist items will concern things you’ve already thought of. For example, most of what is on the blogging checklist above is pretty darn obvious for experienced marketers. However, the marketing grader is an awesome tool for newbies who want to make sure that they’re killing it in the marketing arena.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.woorank.com/"><strong>4. Woorank</strong></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.woorank.com/"><strong>Woorank</strong></a> is another helpful marketing grader that runs a boatload of tests on your website, measuring where you’re doing well and where you need to improve.</p>
<p>The Woorank grader provides a score on a scale of 1-100 to give you a general idea of where you stand. It also shows visual colored bars to illustrate how many tests you’ve passed, to what degree you can improve, and the number of major errors found on your site.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"> <em>Looks like my site has much to improve upon</em></p>
<p>(I wish they wouldn’t tell me that my website is the 1,893,204th most popular website in the world. It’s as demeaning as a participation award.)</p>
<p>Some interesting metrics the Quick Sprout Grader analyzes includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heading tags that are too long or too short</li>
<li>Popularity on social media</li>
<li>Backlink counter and number of indexed pages</li>

<p>This ecommerce grader gives a great quick and dirty assessment of your online store. You also don’t need a Shopify store to get graded – any ecommerce store will do just fine.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e078e114-84da-4bee-8885-3c11d56773e5" data-langcode="en">

<h2><a href="http://www.claritygrader.com/"><strong>7. Clarity Grader</strong></a></h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.claritygrader.com/"><strong>Clarity Grader</strong></a> isn’t as sleek and stylish as the other graders, but it’s a pretty amazing tool for digging into your content and <a href="/blog/ws/2014/08/07/improve-writing-skills">analyzing your writin</a>g.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="f616ea15-84d2-4d98-b8a3-9ab24a000ecd" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>The Clarity Grader looks to help you make your copy more clear and readable by calling your attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long sentences</li>
<li>Passive language</li>
<li>Average sentence length</li>
</ul>
<p>The Clarity Grader takes it one step further, analyzing your least readable website pages and pinpointing exactly which sentences to correct.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e198060d-add0-4af5-a005-e21b61ea1408" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/claritygrader.png" alt="clarity grader" width="1064" height="337" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Clarity Grader notes that <strong>people on the web today don’t read – they scan</strong>. This is why the Clarity Grader encourages you to keep sentences short and to write in the more compelling active tense, rather than the passive tense.</p>
<p>The Clarity Grader also looks to correct clichés and jargon you may be using, which makes better writing easy as pie.</p>
<p>Some other ways to keep your text readable for the web include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use bullet points.</strong> Bullet points make content more scannable and can help break up text.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create new paragraphs every few sentences.</strong> In academic writing, paragraphs can go on for entire pages, but in web writing, the more white space, the better. For this reason, most writers prefer to use short paragraphs of just 3-6 sentences.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Insert images.</strong> Images provide a visual breather for readers. The best images build upon the text you’ve written surrounding it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bold font.</strong> Bolding and italicizing text can help draw emphasis to certain words or phrases, making your content easier for readers to digest.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://www.dareboost.com"><strong>8. DareBoost</strong></a></h2>
<p>Another powerful grader tool comes from <a href="https://www.dareboost.com"><strong>DareBoost</strong></a>. One unique offering from the DareBoost grader is the ability to have your performance analyzed based on user experiences from specific geographical areas and devices.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="fe8fdbc4-8c9a-416f-b8d7-7935a7383e89" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>My only issue with DareBoost is that <strong>the language can be pretty technical for basic users</strong>. There was definitely a lot that went over my head, although this may be the perfect project to hand off to a webmaster (good thing you can download the report into a PDF).</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="038ba9ee-cc3d-4c20-b99b-412728212cdb" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"> <em>T</em><em>his makes 0% sense to me</em></p>
<p>That being said, just because I can’t understand many of the suggestions doesn’t mean that they aren’t valuable – in fact, they seem like <em>very</em> important suggestions that I’ll have to dig in and research to decipher.</p>
<p>Clicking the “read more” button for each issue provides tons more information about the error, <strong>showing you exactly where the problem is and detailing how to fix it</strong>. It’s pretty incredible how much helpful info is packed in.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You need to sign up for a (free) account in order to see the detailed tips. Before signing up, info gets blurred out, which is a wee bit sneaky.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="a73ce7cf-5b61-4edf-aec3-3dd5fe61b816" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Oh DareBoost, you coy little fox</em></p>
<h2><strong><a href="http://validator.w3.org/">9. W3C Validator</a></strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="http://validator.w3.org/"><strong>W3C Validator</strong></a> is simple but useful, showing you exactly <strong>which code errors are happening on your site</strong> and pinpointing where to go to fix them, line by line.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="ccf71c7b-8140-4923-9aee-b4548c5c2463" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Again, similar to DareBoost, which also deal with code specifics, <strong>the language here can be a bit thick for coding greenhorns</strong>, but no doubt you can find a coding pro to help you decipher the computer language.</p>
<p>Use W3C Validator to ensure that your code is neat, clean, and fully functional.</p>
<h2><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/"><strong>10. Google Page Speed Insights</strong></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/"><strong>Google’s Page Speed Insights</strong></a> is a page speed grader that scores your site for mobile and desktop loading speed.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="9d17c328-e6bd-4631-bf2e-355a8fa68876" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>In addition to a snapshot score, you’ll be given code red and code yellow suggestions, in varying degrees of urgency.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/24/page-speed">Page speed</a> is an important factor of SEO</strong> that we often gloss – make sure you’re taking the time to build a fast, clean website that doesn’t keep visitors waiting around(who are we kidding? They won’t wait, they’ll just click elsewhere).</p>
<h2><strong>May Your Website Be Improved!</strong></h2>
<p>Hopefully these marketing graders have given you the knowledge you need to improve upon your websites and other marketing campaigns. Do you have any favorite marketing grader tools we didn’t mention here? Share your favorites in the comments!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is a Marketing Funnel?</h2>
<p><strong>The marketing funnel is the path users take during their journey with you</strong>, from introduction to, ideally, conversion. You are trying to get users to a specific destination, and in order to get them there, you’ll need to leave signposts and rest houses along the way to keep them on track.</p>
<p>Let’s face it, funnels can be awfully boring (unless we’re discussing the fried carnival variety). That’s why I’m using an ice cream cone for my funnel breakdown! For those of you losing interest, stay with me, for there are tasty treats involved.</p>
<p>Introducing the <strong>Ice Cream Cone Marketing Funnel!</strong> Let’s dig in!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="5cab26f4-7d6e-45fc-9bba-ceb8673f82f3" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Although funnels look like pretty stable objects, in the marketing word, it’s still easy for users to fall through the cracks and wander off the trail, where they can get eaten by bears (i.e. your competitors).</p>
<p>In this post, We’ll talk about various stages of the marketing funnel and how you can guide users towards their final destination (the good kind of final destination – not the <em>Final Destination</em> where everyone dies).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Would you believe this gem only got a 33% on Rotten Tomatoes?</em></p>
<h2>Top Of The Funnel: Get People Interested In You</h2>
<p>At the top of our ice cream cone funnel, it’s all about seduction. The sprinkles, the whipped cream, the chocolate sauce – it’s all there to entice users.</p>

<p>In marketing, seduction appears in the form of <strong>fun and informative free content</strong>. The specific media of this top-funnel content can vary depending on your industry. Here are some examples of top-of-funnel content:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engaging <a href="/blog/ws/2015/01/05/marketing-videos">marketing videos</a></li>
<li>Informative ebooks and how-to articles</li>
<li>Pinterest-style quote images</li>
<li>Listicles</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, just <em>having</em> your top-level content isn’t enough. No one is going to go crazy over that delicious ice cream cone if they don’t even see it.</p>
<p>To showcase your top-funnel content to your audiences, you’ll get involved with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social Media</strong>. Build your audience on social media and broadcast your killer content across social networks.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>PPC and SEO</strong>: Get users to your content through <a href="/blog/ws/2015/04/30/seo-basics">organic SEO</a> and paid Google searches (with awesome, <a href="/blog/ws/2015/02/02/ppc-ad-headlines">ultra-clickable headlines</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Awesome, <strong>now you have users engaging with your top-funnel content</strong>. The next question is, how do you usher them further down the funnel? We want them to keep eating that ice cream cone!</p>
<h2>Exchanging Info for Content</h2>
<p>Nothing in this world is free, and users understand that they’ll probably need to surrender some info in exchange for high-quality content.</p>

<p>For high-value resources, ask users for their contact infomation (for most, an email address is ideal) in exchange for your content. Achieve this by <strong>crafting tailored landing pages for your most valuable resources.</strong></p>
<p>On the landing page, give a brief overview of what the user can expect from your content. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re offering <strong>a collection of free art vectors</strong>, explain what kind of art they’ll get, the format it will come in, and any licensing info.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>For an ebook</strong>, explain what the ebook covers, and recap what they’ll learn.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another method some marketers use for <a href="/blog/ws/2014/05/05/longform-content">longer-form</a> blog posts is to <strong>provide 95% of the content for free</strong>, with extra bonus content users can obtain by joining your mailing list. For example, a post with “10 Quick and Easy Paleo Recipes” may have an offer at the bottom of the post, promising 3 bonus recipes that will be emailed to them if they sign up for the mailing list.</p>
<h2>An Example of Great Top-Funnel Content</h2>
<p>I’m going to give you one specific, unusual example of <strong>top-funnel content that got <em>me</em> to take out my wallet</strong>. That’s a pretty big deal because I’m a nearly notorious cheapskate.</p>
<p>It’s an example from a YouTuber by the name of ComicBookGirl19.</p>
<p>OK, at risk of making it public what a huge nerd I am, I watch a lot of <em>Game of Thrones</em> YouTube videos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="1bf2466f-eaa0-43c6-9b7f-8239cd8e075f" data-langcode="en">

</div>
<p><em>a glance at my YouTube watch history shows my true level of geekdom</em></p>
<p>I stumbled upon a couple videos by ComicBookGirl19 and was really impressed. Her videos are great quality, she has a very likeable presence, and her passion about <em>Game of Thrones</em> is obvious.</p>
<p><em><strong>Warning:</strong> This video does contain some language and adulty stuff</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</div>
</article>
</div>
<p>After watching one video, I continued to watch more. In a following video, ComicBookGirl19 discusses how she plans on making special, extra-long form videos detailing the history of various <em>Game of Thrones</em> houses. The videos would be on sale at Vimeo for $2.</p>
<p>I already knew from past videos that this YouTuber created really high-quality content, and I didn’t hesitate for an instant to buy access to her new video on Vimeo.</p>
<p>What’s also cool is that she even put those videos – which I know took many, MANY hours of work – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9q4Ht-W164">onto YouTube for free</a> after they were out for several months.</p>
<p>Before this incident, I had never paid (or planned on ever paying) for online, user-generated videos. Now, I’m much more open to the possibility. Also, in true <a href="/blog/ws/2014/06/26/word-of-mouth-marketing">word-of-mouth</a> fashion, I’ve been telling <em>all</em> my friends about ComicBookGirl19’s videos, and they’ve been impressed as well.</p>
<p>Granted, ComicBookGirl19’s marketing funnel is much more truncated than those of traditional services and products, but it still serves as a golden example of how <strong>introducing quality free content to a user can later convince them to convert</strong>.</p>
<h2>Middle of the Funnel: Up the Ante With More Targeted Assets</h2>
<p>In the middle of the funnel, you’ll begin nurturing the leads you obtained from your earlier top-funnel content efforts. This <strong>nurturing is often done through <a href="/blog/ws/2014/11/12/is-email-marketing-effective">email marketing</a></strong>, using contact information you obtained earlier to send users targeted content.</p>
<p><strong>Nurturing involves building your existing relationship with users</strong>. They’ve sunk their teeth into your ice cream cone, now it’s time to help them explore its flavors.</p>
<p>Slowly, when you’re in the middle funnel, you’ll want to <strong>trickle in targeted content that relates more closely to your product or service</strong>. Buying guides are a great example. It can be tricky to hit the right mark, as you want to be promoting high-value content, but still shouldn’t come off as too salesy.</p>
<p>Here’s a great example – let’s imagine that you sell coffee grinders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="97cd25cc-61ed-4b44-b0fc-c36a4fb8bd35" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A top-of-funnel idea might be detailing the differences between light and dark roast coffee. <strong>The middle funnel</strong> might involve a content piece that talks about why fresh grinded coffee is better than pre-ground coffee. You’re explaining why a coffee grinder could be useful, but aren’t directly pitching your product – at least not yet.</p>
<p>The middle of the funnel is also where you may want to consider discreetly promoting <a href="/blog/ws/2015/05/05/customer-testimonials">user testimonials</a> and user-generated content. You’re gently steering your users towards reminders about why you rock, without rubbing their faces in it.</p>
<h2>Bottom of the Marketing Funnel: It’s Game Time</h2>
<p>When you hit the <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/01/bottom-funnel-conversions">bottom of the funnel,</a> it’s time to get selling! When people are ready to buy, their behavior changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>They use keywords with high commercial intent,</strong> so this is where you should be bidding high with information-rich PPC ads that deliver exactly what they want. Think <a href="/blog/ws/2014/04/14/google-shopping-ads">Shopping Ads</a> and other extensions and formats that provide lots of product and price info as well as images.</li>
<li><strong>They might just call you directly.</strong> Make sure you&#8217;re using click-to-call in your mobile ads (with <a href="/call-tracking">call tracking</a>, so you know where the calls are coming from) and have your phone number plastered all over your site.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>At the bottom of the marketing funnel, you’ll be handing a lot off to your sales team. </strong>Your sales team probably helped with your research for developing some of your high-value content in the middle of the funnel (pieces like buying guides), but now they’ll be taking the reins by reaching out and getting in touch with leads ripe for the picking.</p>
<p>Using lead tracking software like Salesforce, you should be able to see which offers users have taken advantage of and where they’re engaging with you.</p>
<p>If they’ve engaged with some of your higher-value content, it’s time to reach out and promote your product. Some bottom of the marketing funnel actions includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demos</li>
<li>Free Trials</li>
<li>Assessments</li>
<li>Promotional Offers</li>
</ul>
<h2>Marketing Funnel Conversions Ahoy And Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>Hopefully your bottom funnel actions are enough to get users to convert. However, that doesn’t mean your job is over. You still need to <strong>work to retain customers</strong> and, ideally, <strong>get your new customers to promote you to their friends</strong> and family.</p>

<p><em>Wait until I tell you guys about this awesome tree I found</em></p>
<p>Remember, <strong>92% of customers say they trust word of mouth over any other form of online advertising.</strong> Consider setting up a referral program to encourage current customers to introduce you to new users.</p>
<p>Stay on your customers’ good side by continuing to provide value and top-notch customers service. And that’s how you create a great marketing funnel that will keep users licking to the bottom of the cone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>They come in many styles, they come in many colors; they come in many sizes, and you’ll need them to get followers. Ok, that rhyme may be a bit of a stretch, but I never claimed to be a gifted poet.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/social-media-buttons-cover.png" alt="social media buttons cover" width="300" height="300" /></div>
<p>When it comes to social media sharing buttons, your choices are as abundant as shades of paint at Home Depot (call me crazy, but ‘spring meadow green’ and ‘neon celery’ look exactly the same to me).</p>
<p>There’s tons to consider with social buttons, from positioning, coloring, size, wording, and style. Don’t worry, we’re here to help you suss it all out.</p>
<h2>1. Button Positioning: How Low Can (Or Should) You Go?</h2>
<p>When it comes to positioning, you have many, many options with social media buttons. You can put your social share buttons at:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Top of Post.</strong> It’s very common to place social media buttons at the top of blog posts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some challenge this logic, asking <strong>“will readers share a post they haven’t even read yet?”</strong> Bizarrely enough, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/14/5411934/youre-not-going-to-read-this">some studies have shown</a> no real correlation between sharing a post and reading it. It’s very possible that users see an entrancing headline and decide right on the spot whether or not it’s something worth sharing. Having social media buttons at the top of the page can also <strong>act as <a href="/blog/ws/2017/01/10/social-proof-guide">social proof</a> and encourage readers </strong>if you have tons of shares. If I see a post with +1,000 shares, it reinforces my belief that this article is awesome and worth taking the time to read.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/social-media-button-choices.png" alt="social media button choices" width="1054" height="192" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Social share buttons on TechCrunch</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bottom of Post.</strong> Another popular positioning, this placing allows social media buttons to be strategically placed for clicking as users finish reading a blog post.</li>
</ul>
<p>The downfall here is that putting social share buttons at the bottom of your posts means that <strong>the buttons will be competing with many other elements</strong>, from comments to related posts. They can easily get overlooked or lost in the crowd.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/different-share-buttons.png" alt="different share buttons" width="804" height="430" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>The Moz Blog keeps their social buttons at the bottom of posts</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In-Line with Post. </strong>Some bloggers elect to put social sharing buttons within the middle of the blog post. Usually this is an added element, done in conjunction with having social buttons at the top or bottom of a post. This can cleverly be executed after delivering an especially powerful statistic or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/26/social-media-quotes">moving quote</a> – if a certain line excites readers, they may be encouraged to hit a well-placed share button placed strategically to capture users in the heat of the moment.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Floating Bars.</strong> Having floating social buttons alongside the left column of a blog is another popular positioning. Floating bars don’t have to vertical (although that is the most common design).</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/floating-social-media-buttons.png" alt="floating social media buttons" width="562" height="296" /></div>
<p>Most websites <strong>don’t just choose one of these positions</strong>, but instead mix and match according to personal preferences.</p>
<p>Upworthy has an especially unique design, which I’m assuming must work for them, as social shares are their bread and butter.</p>
<p>Upworthy puts a subscription form, Twitter button, and Facebook share button combination box that sits towards the top of the post.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-social-media-buttons.png" alt="best social media buttons" width="773" height="201" /></div>
<p>Then, once you scroll past the share/subscription box, a Facebook share button floats in the top bar.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/top-social-media-buttons.png" alt="top social media buttons" width="835" height="516" /></div>
<p>By the way, for those wondering, there is no way in <em>hell</em> Sansa Stark is the real <em>Game of Thrones</em> hero. Just putting it out there.</p>
<p>Some extra quick general rules when it comes to button placement:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don’t put your social buttons too close to the navigation.</strong> You don’t want to have users accidentally clicking share buttons when they are trying to do navigate someplace else.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Place buttons close to the content.</strong> When buttons are farther away from the content, users become more confused about what it is that they are sharing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep buttons visible.</strong> Don’t burry your buttons where no one will ever encounter them. Unless you’re giving out Cadbury Mini-Eggs, this isn’t an Easter egg hunt.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Social Media Button Size: The Bigger the Better?</h2>
<p>You’ll find that most sites (especially those focused on virality) utilize large social share buttons. The more prominent your social share buttons are, the more likely users are to click them.</p>
<p>Large buttons can come off a bit needy, but there’s no denying that they’ll get clicked more than the smaller, more discreet buttons. The squeaky wheel gets the oil, as they say.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/social-media-button-sizes.png" alt="social media button sizes" width="400" height="197" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Social share buttons from </em><em><a href="http://jquery-plugins.net/ridiculously-responsive-social-sharing-buttons">RRSSB</a></em></p>
<h2>3. Custom Social Buttons vs. Classic Designs</h2>
<p>When taking stock of the various social sharing buttons scattered across the web, you’ll notice that <strong>some sites use their own original social media button designs</strong>, while others stick to the standard, official buttons.</p>
<p>There are advantages and disadvantages to either method. <strong>Customizing your buttons can help them stand out</strong> and be a bit more eye-catching than the standard social buttons we’ve all seen a trillion and one times. However, if the buttons look too foreign and unrecognizable, readers will pass right by them.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s check out some examples of social media button variations.</p>
<p>In this example, you can see that <a href="http://www.exacttarget.com/">ExactTarget</a>, the Salesforce blog, features greyed social buttons. These desaturated grey shades go hand-in-hand with the site’s design and give an added air of professionalism.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/social-media-buttons-black-and-white.png" alt="grey social media buttons" width="830" height="336" /></div>
<p>Many other sites modify the button style or shape, but will stick to the colors associated with each social network to make them easily recognizable – royal blue for Facebook, light blue for Twitter, red for Pinterest, etc.</p>
<p>These buttons on <a href="http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/">Pat Flynn’s blog</a> aren’t the standard button style, but are very close to the originals.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/social-media-icons.png" alt="social media icons" width="710" height="635" /></div>
<p>BuzzFeed does something similar, with customized button designs that stay very true to the originals.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/social-share-buttons.png" alt="social share buttons" width="933" height="441" /></div>
<p>This <a href="http://www.irocksowhat.com/2012/04/free-social-media-icons-freebies-woo.htmlsma">collection of social buttons</a> takes a lot of artistic license, creating very unique social media buttons. Users might hesitate to click these buttons, as they appear quite unfamiliar, but they also add a dose of originality to your site.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/creative-social-media-buttons.png" alt="creative social media buttons" width="576" height="491" /></div>
<h2>4. Too Much Of A Clickable Thing: Don’t Go Overboard on Buttons</h2>
<p>At first thought, you might easily assume that more social media buttons would be better, as they allow readers to easily share your post on any social network that they desire. The more the merrier, right? Not exactly. Here’s why.</p>
<h3>Too Many Choices Are Overwhelming</h3>
<p>The choice paradox has proven that us humans are a fickle, indecisive bunch. Just shopping for breakfast cereal can be a trial, deciding if we want multi-grain, chocolate, honey nut, or plain Cheerios. Yes, it’s a first world problem, but it’s still a problem nonetheless!</p>
<p>In fact, it seems that <strong>too many options can be just as paralyzing as too few.</strong></p>
<p>When users can’t decide if they want to share your post on Tumblr, Pinterest, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, StumbleUpon, LinkedIn, or Buffer, they may ultimately choose to not share your post at all! Oh, the horror!</p>
<p>Social button overkill is also obnoxious as hell, <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/facebook_likes">as <em>The Oatmeal </em>artfully illustrates</a>.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/social-networking-buttons.png" alt="social networking buttons" width="535" height="684" /></div>
<h3>Lots of Buttons = Social Slow Mo</h3>
<p><strong>Having too many social buttons can dramatically slow down your page load times. </strong>Social share buttons use JavaScript to communicate between your website and the respective social networking sites. More buttons means more scripts, which slow down your site to a snail-like pace.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/social-media-badges.jpg" alt="social media badges" width="1215" height="865" /></div>
<p>With Google using site speed as a ranking signal, it’s important to trim the fat wherever you can. For optimal SEO, you need to be as speedy as Sonic the Hedgehog.</p>
<h3>Choosing Which Buttons to Keep And Which to Scrap</h3>
<p>No doubt it was painful to rush towards the Intro to Acting bulletin board in high school, only to find that you didn’t earn the role of Puck or Oberon in your school’s production of <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em>, but instead must play the less-than-riveting role of Laughing Fairy #3. Sadly, cuts need to be made, and your social media buttons need to get the same harsh but fair treatment.</p>
<p>In order to decide which social media buttons are worth including, <strong>check out your analytics and see which social sites you regularly get the most referral traffic from</strong>. Those are likely the social buttons you’ll want to keep close at hand.</p>
<p>It’s also smart to think about what social networks your target demographics use, and which social media buttons generally get the most action. <a href="http://trackmaven.com/resources/content-marketing-report/">Research from TrackMaven</a> shows that, unsurprisingly, Facebook and Twitter account for the most social sharing, so it’s a good bet that you’ll want to keep those guys around.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/social-shares-by-network.jpg" alt="social shares by network" width="710" height="569" /></div>
<h3>What Is The Goal Of the Page?</h3>
<p>When considering which (if any) buttons to include on various site pages, definitely take some time to think about the intent of the page. Blog posts whose main aim is traffic and reach will probably want to include some social buttons.</p>
<p>It’s a different story on product pages or conversion-oriented pages. When a conversion is the key goal, <strong>social buttons can be distracting and can lead users away from your funnel</strong>.</p>
<p>One case study from <a href="https://vwo.com/blog/removing-social-sharing-buttons-from-ecommerce-product-page-increase-conversions/">Visual Website Optimizer</a> shows how <strong>a product page increased conversions by 11.9% after removing social buttons</strong>.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/removing-social-media-buttons.png" alt="removing social media buttons" width="634" height="342" /></div>
<p>Could a social button scrape increase your conversions? It’s something to consider.</p>
<h2>5. Should You Keep Score With Share Counters?</h2>
<p>Another element you’ll want to consider for your social share buttons is whether or not you want to include share counts for your buttons. <strong>Share counts can be a double-edged sword</strong> – if you have high share counts, those numbers will build social proof and will reinforce the belief that your content is high-quality and worth reading.</p>
<p>However, <strong>low share counts may dissuade a reader</strong>.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bad-social-proof.png" alt="bad social proof" width="356" height="79" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>womp womp</em></p>
<p>If your blog has a solid, active audience that likes to share your stuff, go ahead and put up share counters. If your audience isn’t as large, you may want to stay away from share counters, at least for now.</p>
<p>One genius solution to this little conundrum can be solved by the <a href="http://newinternetorder.com/giveaway-heres-why-social-share-counters-suck-plus-what-i-can-give-you-that-doesnt/">New Internet Order share plugin</a>. It lets you set the minimum displayed number of shares. That means I can program the plugin to show no share counter until I reach at least 50 shares. Once I hit 50 shares, the share counter will activate, helping build social proof. It’s a pretty sweet little tool!</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em>When there are more shares, a share number appears before the bracket shape.</em></p>
<h2>6. Calls-to-Action for Social Media Buttons: Ask and Receive</h2>
<p>CTA&#8217;s are vital for PPC ads, form completions, and even blog post headlines, so naturally they need to be considered for social media buttons as well. There are several different approaches you can take for implementing <a href="/blog/ws/2014/10/20/call-to-action-examples">calls-to-action</a> with your social media buttons.</p>
<h3>Option 1. Transform Sharing Button Into Text</h3>
<p>One option is to turn the entire button into a piece of call-to-action text. This is becoming a more popular trend on sites that limit their social sharing buttons to just a few key social networks.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/custom-social-share-buttons.png" alt="custom social share buttons" width="592" height="109" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Mashable social share buttons</em></p>
<h3>Option 2. Add Call-to-Action Text Around the Buttons</h3>
<p>Another option is to add text above or around the social share buttons, and simply ask users to share point blank.</p>
<p><a href="https://shareaholic.com">Shareholic</a> has a plugin that allows blogs to add call-to-action text above buttons, encouraging eyes to linger a bit longer on share buttons.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/social-button-text.png" alt="social button text" width="318" height="114" /></div>
<p>Sometimes the best way to get what you want is to simply ask. It’s been shown that tweets asking for retweets outperform those that don’t – <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/10-new-twitter-stats-twitter-statistics-to-help-you-reach-your-followers">Buffer took it a step further</a> and showed that including the word “retweet,” as opposed to “rt” resulted in 23x more retweets!</p>
<p>Adding call-to-action text to your social media buttons is definitely a smart idea to test for increasing social shares.</p>
<h2>7. Testing Makes the World Go ‘Round</h2>
<p>There are thousands of social media button variations you can choose from, and unfortunately there is no single 100% best social button system that outperforms across all sites.</p>
<p>Instead, <strong>the best way to find out which social media buttons will perform best on your site is by <a href="/blog/ws/2014/02/26/ab-testing-best-practices">testing</a>. </strong>Test sizes, colors, styles, positioning – any variation you can think of! It may seem like a tremendous task (and to be honest, it is), but it’s the only surefire way to discover your ultimate social button design. Remember, it’s all about the shares.</p>
<p>Do you have any social media button best practices or suggestions? Share your thoughts and deepest, darkest feelings in the comments.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/marketing-skills-for-20151.jpg" alt="marketing skills for resume 2015" width="495" height="327" /></div>
<p>Digital marketing moves very quickly, and as a modern marketer, you’re probably gaining new skills by the handful. But what marketing skills capture an employer’s eyes in 2015? What sets their hearts a-thumping? What makes them say, “We <em>need </em>to hire this one!”</p>
<p>Today we’re sharing 14 enticing marketing skills to add to your resume in 2015! (And if you&#8217;re looking for a job now, <a href="/jobs">check out our jobs page</a>. We&#8217;re hiring!)</p>
<h2>1. Content Marketing</h2>
<p><a href="/blog?field_taxonomy_tid=183">Content marketing</a> is inescapable in today’s digital marketing landscape. It’s like what the Spice Girls was to the 90’s. Brands have realized that they need to be producing a steady stream of high-quality content in order to attract their audiences.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/marketing-skills-for-resume.jpg" alt="marketing skills for resume" width="640" height="426" /></div>
<p>We’re in a pretty frightening content whirlwind; with many blogs pushing out several posts a day, there’s zero chance we will ever read most of what is published on the web. Still, you can capitalize on this mighty content race by marketing yourself as a content mastermind. (If you&#8217;re in the B2B aka business-to-business world, check out our <a href="/blog/ws/2016/12/01/b2b-content-marketing">seriously comprehensive guide to B2B content marketing</a>.)</p>
<h2>2. CMS Experience</h2>
<p>Since <strong>nearly all businesses publish content with the help of a Content Management System (CMS)</strong>, noting some CMS experience on your resume is always a smart move, especially if you&#8217;re applying for a content marketing job. WordPress and Drupal are two common examples of content management systems you may want to get you hands dirty with. Put this on your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/17/digital-marketing-skills">marketing skills</a> list and you&#8217;ll be sure to get noticed.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/top-desires-marketing-skills.png" alt="top marketing skills" width="886" height="436" /></div>

<h2>3. CRM Skills</h2>
<p>Businesses are also looking for <strong>experts in Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software</strong>, which serves as an essential tool for virtually any company. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/09/crm-for-small-business">CRM software</a> is used to organize and manage customers’ various interactions with a company. CRM software helps bridge the gap between sales, marketing, and customer service. Popular CRM software includes Salesforce and Oracle.</p>
<h2>4. Mobile Marketing</h2>
<p>Mobile is on the rise and no one is powerful enough to stop it. If mobile marketing were Godzilla, we’d be pretty screwed right about now.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/10-incredible-mobile-marketing-stats-2015-infographic">It’s estimated that</a> 60% of mobile consumers use their mobile phone as their primary (or only) device for accessing the internet, and over half of e-commerce traffic is driven by mobile devices! <strong>Understanding the mobile marketing landscape will make you a hero in the eyes of employers</strong>, so be sure to show this off on your resume.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/resume-marketing-skills.jpg" alt="resume marketing skills" width="640" height="426" /></div>
<h2>5. Lead Nurturing</h2>
<p>As companies say <em>sayonara</em> to hard sales tactics and cold calls, they increasingly look to lead nurturing as a better sales solution. In the <a href="/blog/ws/2013/07/18/b2b-ppc-guide">B2B world</a>, most customer relationships today begin with content offers, then continue on with lead nurturing through the sales funnel. Lead nurturing is in super high demand, so employees with experience in this area should be sure to note it on their resume&#8217;s marketing skills list and <a href="/blog/ws/2015/03/17/8-reasons-i-hate-linkedin-ads">LinkedIn</a> profiles.</p>
<p><strong>Show that you understand the lead nurturing model</strong> and that you have some knowledge of how various types of content (from ebooks to webinars) can be crafted to serve specific audience needs.</p>
<h2>6. Email Marketing</h2>
<p>Email marketing isn’t new, but <a href="/blog/ws/2014/11/12/is-email-marketing-effective">it’s still one of the most effective ways to market products and services.</a> Newsletter signup boxes are commonplace on nearly all blogs, and <strong>brands are hungry for employees who can help them grow, retain, and delight email subscribers</strong>. They’re looking for employees who understand open rates, A/B testing, and email lead nurturing. If you can get practice with email marketing, wear these skills like badges of honor.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/marketing-resume.jpg" alt="marketing resume" width="373" height="223" /></div>
<h2>7. Mastery of a Full Marketing Arsenal of Tools</h2>
<p><strong>Businesses are looking for marketers who are masters of industry tools.</strong> You need to know which weapons will help you conquer any given space, making you as powerful as Robert Baratheon with his warhammer (give me a break, the new season is just a couple weeks away).</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/marketing-resume-skills.jpg" alt="marketing resume skills" width="1024" height="724" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>It’s hammertime!</em> [<em>Art by </em><a href="http://alex-maxwell.deviantart.com/art/Robert-Baratheon-s-Warhammer-448441370"><em>Alex Maxwell</em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p> Brush up on your marketing weapon arsenal with tools like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social Media Marketing Tools.</strong> Tools that can help <a href="/blog/ws/2013/05/23/social-media-management-tools">manage your various social media accounts</a> and measure your effectiveness.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Productivity Tools.  </strong>A healthy knowledge of productivity tools shows that you’re motivated and skilled at <a href="/blog/ws/2016/08/10/time-management-tips">time management</a>. Popular tools include: Evernote, IFTTT, and Google Alerts. For more, check out our <a href="/blog/ws/2015/03/26/productivity-tools">list of awesome productivity tools.</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>SEO Tools.</strong> Resources to help you target relevant keywords and measure your link-building efforts. Some popular tools include Google Keyword Planner, Open Site Explorer, Ahrefs, and of course our own <a href="/keywords">keyword tools</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Image and Design Tools.</strong> Apps and software that can help you create <a href="/blog/ws/2014/11/17/creating-blog-images">blog images</a> and valuable visual content to capture the attention of your audience. Popular tools include <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canva</a>, Piktochart, SlideShare, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Email Tools.</strong> Programs that can help you manage email more effectively and measure open rates, clicks, and conversions for various email lists. One popular example would be MailChimp.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have experience with these tools (or tools that are similar), be sure to add it to your marketing skills resume. Employers want new hires who know how to use the tools they love.</p>
<h2>8. Video Production</h2>
<p>There has been a huge upsurge recently with video production. <strong>Brands are recognizing that video is a very engaging and compelling form of content</strong> that can be used to a company’s advantage.</p>
<p>Any experience in <a href="/blog/ws/2017/12/15/best-video-editing-software-for-beginners">video production, editing</a>, and even video animation is highly coveted. Best of all, you can brush up on some of these skills yourself if you’ve got a bit of spare time. Set up your own YouTube channel and <a href="/blog/ws/2015/01/05/marketing-videos">get filming!</a></p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/skills-to-put-on-marketing-resume.jpg" alt="skills to put on marketing resume" width="640" height="480" /></div>
<h2>9. Paid Social Media Advertising</h2>
<p>In an age when you can pay for likes and promote your Twitter posts, competition is heating up in the social arena, and businesses know that working with paid opportunities is the best (and quickest) way to get ahead. <strong>They need experts in paid social advertising – and their need is your opportunity!</strong></p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/marketing-skills-of-2015.png" alt="marketing skills of 2015" width="736" height="189" /></div>
<p>How do you get these skills? <strong>Experiment with your own paid social media campaigns</strong>. If you have your own blog or website, use them as social advertising guinea pigs (although you’ll have to deal with the smell). You can start mini-campaigns for relatively cheap, and it will get you familiar with all the ins and outs of <a href="/blog/ws/2014/09/24/social-media-advertising">paid social advertising</a>. This experience looks stellar on your marketing skills list.</p>
<h2>10. UX Design</h2>
<p>User experience design (UXD or UED) is another one of those fast-growing fields where employees are constantly in demand. Businesses know that their product needs to be smooth and streamlined, and they are chomping at the bit for skilled UX designers who can help create an intuitive, natural product experience for users.</p>
<p>Whether for apps, software, or site design, UX is X marks the spot on your search for prime marketing skills!</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/marketing-skills-2015.jpg" alt="marketing skills 2015" width="640" height="425" /></div>
<h2>11. Data Science</h2>
<p>Businesses are beginning to get freaked out by how much data they have at their disposal. From conversion tracking cookies, social media responses, and video views to GPS data and app activity, the sheer quantity of big data companies have access to is mind-boggling.</p>
<p><strong>That’s where you come in – the data analysis expert who can help sort, organize, and, most importantly, extract meaning</strong> and actionable insights from these huge data landfills. In order to be a <a href="/blog/ws/2014/10/14/data-scientist">data scientist</a>, you’ll need to be madly in love with math and be a true numbers guy. If you’ve got the goods, you can be sure businesses will be knocking at your door (or even breaking it down).</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/marketing-skills-to-add-to-your-resume-in-2015.jpg" alt="marketing skills to add to your resume in 2015" width="640" height="426" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Scary, scary math – not for data scientists though!</em></p>
<h2>12. Data Visualization</h2>
<p>Going hand in hand with the statistical analysis crew, brands also want to be able to share some of their data insights with their key target audiences.</p>
<p>However, most of us don’t perk up at the thought of combing through spreadsheets for that eureka moment. <strong>That’s where data visualizers come in – they help reformat valuable, insightful data into visual graphs, charts, and graphics</strong> that make those numbers easier to digest. Data visualizers are utilized to create powerful, <a href="/blog/ws/2016/08/25/data-driven-marketing">data-driven content</a> that is appealing to users (<a href="/blog/ws/2015/01/13/infographic-templates">infographics</a> are a prime example). Data visualization mastery is in high demand, so be sure to detail your knowledge on your marketing skills resume.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/marketing-skills-to-list-on-resume.png" alt="marketing skills to list on resume" width="804" height="329" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Infographics from Visual.ly</em></p>
<h2>13. HTML, CSS, and Other Coding Languages</h2>
<p>Knowing some basic coding has always been valuable, but <strong>today you’ll get a big bonus as a marketer with a little coding skill.</strong> Engineers and coders are valuable commodities, and they won’t gladly be spared to fix the padding on your tables and align your text properly.</p>
<p>Proving you know at least some very basic HTML and CSS skills shows that you can self-correct your own hiccups with a bit of finagling. If you’re beyond the basics, even better!</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/marketing-skills-list.jpg" alt="marketing skills list" width="640" height="426" /></div>
<h2>14. Consumer Behaviorist</h2>
<p>Brands realize that individuals make purchasing decisions based off of their feelings and emotional cues. It’s why advertisements like the Budweiser Super Bowl puppy ads are so successful.</p>
<p>As businesses seek to amp up the <a href="/blog/ws/2014/12/05/business-storytelling">emotional storytelling</a> and strengthen consumer bonds to brands, they want <strong>experts who understand consumer behavior and can help figure out what makes their key audiences tick.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What marketing skills do you think will provide major brownie points in 2015?</strong> If you’re an employer, what skills are you looking for in a new hire?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a summary of the top 14 marketing skills we think you should add to your resume:</p>
<ol>
<li>Content marketing skills</li>
<li>Content management system (CMS) experience</li>

<p>Ready to turn you smart phone pitter-pattering into a social media career? Social media stardom could just be a few tweets away if you’ve got the right stuff.</p>
<p>Today we’re celebrating 17 social media celebs who started off as just lowly social screen junkies like us. Do any of these social starlets sound a bit like you? Maybe you’ll be the next big thing (but&#8230;I  wouldn’t bet on it. Sorry).</p>
<h2><strong>Social Media Careers Spawned on Twitter</strong></h2>
<p>Twitter is full of the mindless, the mundane, and celebrity chatter. However, Twitter can be a great place for true genius to shine, any some witty users were able to use Twitter to launch themselves into serious social media careers!</p>
<p><strong>@ShitMyDadSays Goes From Silliness to Sitcoms</strong></p>
<p>In 2009 Justin Halpern, a comedy writer without much work, began a Twitter account in which he shared hilarious quotes from his charmingly cantankerous father. When a friend linked to the Twitter account, comedian Rob Corddry stumbled upon it and tweeted it, beginning a snowball effect that would launch Halpern into semi-stardom.</p>
<p>Less than a month later, <a href="https://twitter.com/shitmydadsays">@ShitMyDadSays</a> was being quoted on The Daily Show, Laughing Squid, and by Kristen Bell (which is obviously the coolest out of the three).</p>
<p>Some classic @ShitMyDadSays-isms</p>

<p>Halpern ended up signing a deal with Harper Collins and publishing <em>Sh*t My Dad Says </em>the book in 2009, eventually earning a coveted spot as a #1 The New York Times Best Seller.</p>
<p>Things didn’t stop there for Halpern. CBS developed a sitcom based on @ShitMyDadSays starring William Shatner, which aired from 2010-2011 and won the People’s Choice Award for Best New Comedy. Today @ShitMyDadSays has amassed over 2.5 million followers. Not too shabby for a jab at dad.</p>
<p><strong>@TheNardvark Goes to Late Nigh Talk Shows</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TheNardvark">@TheNardvark</a>, aka Bryan Donaldson, started tweeting jokes and clever quips in 2010, with his unique brand of comedy earned him nearly 50k followers.</p>
<p>After 20 years in IT, Donaldson tossed out his keyboard and transitioned to a new role – as a writer for <em>Late Night With Seth Meyers. </em>Well, OK, he probably needed a keyboard in the late-night writing circuit as well.</p>

<p>From IT slave to comedy mastermind,Twitter makes dreams come true!</p>
<p><strong>Megan Amram Laughs Her Way To <em>Parks and Rec</em></strong></p>
<p>Megan Amram (aka <a href="https://twitter.com/meganamram">@meganamram</a>) is another chuckle-enduing tweeter who quickly catapulted herself into a social media career, amassing over 460k followers with her clever 140-character cracks. Her Twitter wit earned her a writing position on NBC’s hit show, <em>Parks and Recreation</em>!Little Sebastian would be proud.</p>

<p><strong>Jenny Johnson Jabs at Chris Brown And Wins (Big Time)</strong></p>
<p>Jenny Johnson (<a href="https://twitter.com/JennyJohnsonHi5">@JennyJohnsonHi5</a>) earned her Twitter super status in an unusual way – by instigating an online yelling match with a Hollywood celeb.</p>
<p>The cyber duel took place back in 2012, after Chris Brown tweeted, “I look old as f—ck! I am only 23…” to which Jenny Johnson replied, “I know! Being a worthless piece of shirt can really age a person.” It went back and forth after that, with Chris Brown spouting some horrifically disgusting words of sexual harassment before backing down and suspending his Twitter account.</p>
<p>Some might consider name calling on Twitter immature, but the firefight certainly worked for Jenny Johnson, who earned admiration (Chris Brown isn’t exactly Mr. Popular), 400,000 followers, and made her a famed funny women. She went on to sign a book deal in 2013 and now can be found as a contributing writer on GQ, Glamour, and other online magazines.</p>
<p><strong>@HistoricalTweet Launches a Book (And a Social Media Career)</strong></p>
<p>Alan Beard and Alec McNayr rewrote history with their hilarious <a href="https://twitter.com/historicaltweet">@historicaltweet</a> account, in which they put a unique spin on the past, contemplating what tweets icons like Abraham Lincoln and Mahatma Gandhi might have typed out, had Twitter been around in their respective eras.</p>

<p>The joke account took off, eventually earning the duo a Random House publishing deal in 2010. Their book, <em>Historical Tweets</em>, was a big hit, earning enormous praise from Amazon readers.</p>
<p>McNayr has gone on to write scripts for <em>Parks and Recreation</em> and <em>How I Met Your Mother.</em> Together the pair now run their own social media humor agency called McBeard Media, representing clients like Disney, Sony, and 20th Century Fox. That’s one heck of a successful social media career, all launched from a simple parody Twitter account.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter Fame Lesson:</strong> The trend seems to be that if you want to get Twitter famous, comedy is key. Class clowns rejoice, your power is vast and endless.</p>
<h2><strong>YouTube Stars: Viral Videos Create Living Legends</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Michelle Phan Turns a Morning Routine into a Beauty Career</strong></p>
<p>Michelle Phan is a YouTube starlet who vlogs about beauty products, offering reviews, make-up tutorials, etc. With 7.5 million subscribers, she has no shortage of devoted fans staring at her face all day long. Her most popular videos are her Lady Gaga makeup videos, helping fans recreate the star’s outrageous looks from music videos; which, although cool, aren’t very practical for everyday wear unless you work at Cirque Du Soleil.</p>

<p>Since her YouTube fame, she’s been hired as a private makeup artist for celebrities, has worked for Lancôme, and has even started her own business called Ipsy, which provides makeup advice and monthly subscriptions. She even has her own makeup line with L’Oreal! Nothing like turning your daily routine into a million dollar dream career!</p>
<p><strong>Jenna Marbles Pays The Bills With Her Pooches</strong></p>
<p>Jenna Marbles is one of my personal favorite YouTube celebs, and I find many of her videos utterly hilarious.</p>
<p>Jenna is one of the most popular vloggers, and with over 14 million followers, she’s the most subscribed woman on YouTube. Her Chihuahua and Italian Greyhound, Marbles and Kermit, are often featured in her videos. Her biggest video to date is “How to Trick People Into Thinking You’re Good Looking,” with over 60 million views!</p>

<p>Jenna earns a pretty sweet salary, making over $4.3 million/year off just messing around with her pets and being a goofball. What a life!</p>
<p><strong>Smosh: The Veterans of Web Videos</strong></p>
<p>Smosh is a true online institution, composed of the dynamic duo team Ian and Anthony, who first started creating videos in 2003 (at age 11). That’s right folks, there was online video before YouTube, although it was a whole different, dangerous beast.</p>
<p>Smosh’s comedy-centric videos consist of skits and animations, often oriented around video games. They’ve amassed nearly 20 million subscribers (19.9 at the writing of this post) who can’t get enough of their unique brand of comedy.</p>

<p>Smosh has topped the charts of “most subscribed YouTube channels” since its YouTube conception, and has hopped on and off the top #1 spot over the years. The Smosh team has had some pretty cool experiences outside of YouTube as well – they’ve released a mobile game, four song albums, and it’s even said there is a Smosh movie in the works! The Smosh channel makes an estimated $5.7 million/year.</p>
<p><strong>Disney Collector BR, The Queen of Toy Unboxing</strong></p>
<p>All right, next we’ve got another YouTube celebrity, but this one isn’t quite like the rest…</p>
<p>DisneyCollectorBR posts unboxing videos of Disney toys with extremely detailed descriptions, even showing users how they can play with the toys. The mystery vlogger never gives her name or shows her face – you only see her hands as she unboxes various children’s toys.</p>

<p>Yeah…. it’s kind of weird. But it gets more bizarre.</p>
<p>Much of her success comes from her very soft, soothing voice, and many parents have noted that their young children are entranced by the videos. Some parents say that he videos are the only way they can get their kids to sleep. I also suspect that she is a major favorite with the ASMR (Autonomous sensory meridian response) community, who get huge waves of – well, basically, brain orgasms &#8211; from soft, whispery voices. Bizarre? Yes, very. <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/491/tribes?act=2#play">You can learn more about this strange phenomenon in a This American Life episode, “Tribes.”</a></p>
<p>Still, don’t get too weirded out. DisneyCollectorBR earns approximately $5 million per year from her channel.</p>
<p><strong>#1 YouTube Star and Super Social Celebrity PewDiePie</strong></p>
<p>Now it’s time to talk about the most popular YouTube star of all time, PewDiePie. PewDiePie is undoubtedly the biggest YouTube celeb, and he has the followers to prove it. With 35 million subscribers, PewDiePie is leagues ahead of any other channels. The closest contender in the #2 spot is the official YouTube channel at 22 million subscribers, which is laughably far from PewDiePie’s unbelievable numbers.</p>
<p>So what makes PewDiePie so popular? Ask his fans! No seriously, ask his fans because I don’t get it. PewDiePie’s popularity befuddles many, as most of his videos consist of Let’s Play videos (videogame play-throughs) accompanied with screaming, shouting, nonsensical commentaries from the beloved host. Still, his younger fan base can’t get enough of this cackling Swedish devil.</p>
<p>PewDiePie’s most popular video at the moment, with a montage of favorite moments (WARNING: lots of naughty-language is in this video)</p>

<p>Whatever he’s doing, it’s working. PewDiePie is a celeb, getting recognized on the street, signing autographs, and, of course, appearing in more selfies than a Starbucks cup.</p>
<p>PewDiePie has even been the victim of South Park jokes, featured in a running gag throughout several episodes in which Cartman reaches online fame narrating events as “Cartman Brah.” Clearly PewDiePie can take a joke though, as he ends up appearing in the show to save the world and banish Cartman Brah to wherever fallen YouTube vloggers go to die.</p>
<p>Part of PewDiePie’s fame comes from his endearing attitude towards his fans, often interacting with them on social media and lovingly referring to his subscribers as his “bros” in his videos. Is it all an act? I’d like to think not, but even if it was, could you blame him? This YouTube mastermind earns around $7 million/year from playing video games with a rapt audience.</p>
<h2><strong>How YouTube Celebs Make Their Millions</strong></h2>
<p>Oh yes, I know what you are thinking my friend. Time to quit that cubicle and start making YouTube videos 24/7. Before you do, remember that most of these users have spent years upon years building up their audience and producing content. It’s certainly not easy money by any means. Still, let’s find out how they make those sweet stacks.</p>
<p>Basically, <strong>YouTube vloggers make money from advertisements</strong>. You know how sometimes when you go to watch a YouTube video, you have to watch a commercial first? That’s a pre-roll, and YouTube generates revenue from these commercials by charging advertisers.</p>
<p><strong>For every 1,000 times a pre-roll video ad is shown, YouTube gets some money</strong> (approximately $20-$25 for every thousand ad views), which is also known as a CPM (cost per mile).</p>
<p>Now, when a YouTuber gets a large enough following, they can say to YouTube, “Hey man, I think I deserve a piece of that pie”.  YouTube vloggers apply to be part of the <strong>YouTube Partner Program</strong>, in which they can begin <strong>earning a portion of the ad earnings generated from their videos.</strong> YouTube takes 45% of whatever the vlogger earns, and while CPMs can vary a fair amount, a YouTube Partner can usually earn around $5-7 CPM.</p>
<p>Basically, for every 1,000 times a video ad is shown on a YouTuber’s channel, they earn $7 and YouTube takes $18. So if a YouTube vlogger has one million views, with every single viewer watching an ad, they would earn $7,000 (1,000 views X $7).</p>
<p>Now of course you don’t watch a pre-roll ad before <em>every </em>YouTube video (and pre-roll ads that are skipped earn much less than ads that are watched the whole way through), but you can get a sense of a single video with over a million views can generate a nice chunk of change over time.

<p>We’re not done with our social media stars yet though – next are Vine celebs.</p>
<h2><strong>Vine Video Six-Second Stars: Big Time Brand Endorsements</strong></h2>
<p>You may be surprised to hear that there are Vine stars who have made quite the career out of their six second videos. Some have been discovered and swept towards bigger stardom, while others make good money through brand partnerships.</p>
<p><strong>Shawn Mendes Signs a Record Deal</strong></p>
<p>16-year old Shawn Mendes is a Canadian singer-songwriter who has used Vine to share his craft. Posting original music material along with his take on popular covers, Shawn ended up signing a deal with Island Records. When his EP dropped, it topped iTunes within half an hour!</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Bachelor Makes Bank With Sponsored Vines</strong></p>
<p>Andrew Bachelor (@KingBach)boasts over 9.6 million followers, and he’s made himself a nice nest egg with Vine. Bachelor makes between $10,000 to $15,000 from sponsored Vines, earning even more with longer sponsored company brand Vine campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>Brittany Furlan Teams Up With Seth Green</strong></p>
<p>Brittany Furlan is Vine’s biggest female icon. With over 8 million followers her humorous, often wacky Vines have garnered quite some attention. So much in fact, that she recently landed a deal for a new sketch comedy show being produced by Seth Green. When partnering with companies like Trident, Furlan can make up to $20,000 for a branded Vine (and can make money simply for re-Vining a brand Vine).</p>
<p><strong>Us The Duo Becomes a Musical Sensation</strong></p>
<p>Us The Duo is the husband and wife folk-pop pair Michael and Carissa Alvarado. They got their start on Vine before making it big! Since their initial Vine videos, they’ve gone on to sign a deal with Republic Records, tour around the world, and have released two albums!</p>
<p><strong>Nash Grier</strong></p>
<p>Nash Grier (@griernash) is currently the most popular Vine star in the world, and he’s only 16! With over 10 million followers and endorsements for major brands like Virgin Mobile, he’s bringing in some big cash with his funny, comedic mini-videos.</p>
<p>Have these young social giants made you jealous yet? Hey, maybe your social media career is right around the corner!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that for many sites, the contact page gets more page views than any other section? It’s true, especially for <a href="/blog/ws/2015/02/19/ppc-agency-strategies">agencies</a> and contractors.</p>
<p>While many sites throw up a contact us page as a quick after-thought, you should be dedicating a lot more time and care to your contact page because, for many brands, it’s the beginning of your relationship with potential customers.</p>
<p>Today we’re providing some contact us page best practices and looking at examples of incredible contact us pages that show various styles based on different business audiences and intent.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/contact-us-page-image1.png" alt="contact us page tips" width="488" height="263" /></div>
<p>To begin, let’s look at…</p>
<h2>Some Obvious Contact Us Page Best Practices:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mind Your Ps and Qs:</strong> Even small grammatical errors can scream at visitors. You’ll want to go through your contact page with a fine-toothed comb.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep it Simple</strong>: You don’t want to put too many barriers between the site visitors and the contact information they’re looking for. Keep your contact us page short, sweet, and to the point.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Give the People What They Want:</strong> I hate contact forms – somehow I just get the feeling that when I fill one out, I’ll never hear back from them. It also feels like I’m somehow untrustworthy and don’t deserve a real email address. Of course, providing a real email address opens you up to potential spammers, so it’s really a bit of a toss up. However you choose to set up your contact page, make sure that it’s supremely easy for folks to get in touch with you. If you use a contact form, only ask for the essentials (name, email address, and their message). I’ve seen contact forms requiring mandatory mailing addresses and phone numbers. Form fields like those are a major turn-off.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Look Gorgeous:</strong> When users visit your contact us page, they’re beginning a relationship with you. They want to know more about you, and your contact us page’s design and style will be part of their initial impression. Keep that in mind! Look sexy, make those readers just SO excited to contact you!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Show off Your Personality:</strong> As I mentioned above, users who visit your contact us page are looking to learn more about you. Think about how you want your copy to reflect your brand persona. If your audience is the casual, fun-loving crowd, consider a light-hearted, even comical tone for your contact us page.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Contact Us Page Examples: The Great and Not-So-Great</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s check out some real-world examples. We&#8217;re scoring these <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/contact-us-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact us page examples</a> on a scale of 1-10. 10 is a contact us page piece of perfection, 5 is all right, and 1 is &#8220;burn it to the ground.&#8221; Let me know if you agree with my scoring!</p>
<p>Our first example comes from <a href="http://www.coolappse.com/">CoolApps</a>. Their contact us page provides a quick and simple contact form, an email address to use if you prefer, and various social media buttons in case you’d rather contact them through your social network of choice.</p>
<p>Of course what really sets this one apart is the style and adorable charm. It’s very fun!</p>
<p><strong>Score:</strong> 8. Looks fantastic, has plenty of contact options, and shows personality.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-contact-us-pages.png" alt="best contact us pages" width="810" height="419" /></div>
<p>Our next example from <a href="http://www.blacksheepwebdesign.com/">Black Sheep</a> shows a contact page that does a great job of <strong>using a style and design that matches the rest of the site</strong>. It’s clean, to-the-point, and looks good!</p>
<p><strong>Score:</strong> 6. Simple, stylish, and fits with the theme.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/blacksheep-contactus.png" alt="black sheep contact us" width="921" height="718" /></div>
<p>Next up we have a contact us page from <a href="http://www.viperchill.com/">ViperChill</a>, a site run by popular marketing maverick Glen. Before dishing out his e-mail address, Glen <strong>provides an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/24/faq-page">FAQ page</a> answering common questions that visitors have.</strong> This helps him save time and prevents him from getting overwhelmed by un-necessary emails.</p>
<p>While agencies and service companies may be hungry for emails, individuals who promote themselves as a personal brand are often working with a team of one. They can’t collect and hoard email contacts, and instead need to be much more deliberate with their time.</p>
<p><strong>Score:</strong> 6. Smart use of information hierarchy to answer users’ questions before they send an email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/viperchill-contact-us.png" alt="viperchill contact us" width="858" height="650" /></div>
<p><a href="http://www.jetblue.com/contact-us/">JetBlue</a> offers another example of a well-crafted contact us page. Like the example above, JetBlue <strong>provides a direct link to popular help topics and answers</strong>. For those who don’t get their questions answered in the topics section, email and phone number contact options are provided below. This page also fits in well with the brand’s larger JetBlue design and color scheme.</p>
<p><strong>Score:</strong> 7. JetBlue makes it very easy to grab info, whether from FAQs or with an email or telephone query, while maintaining a style that reassures visitors.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/jetblue-contact-us.png" alt="jetblue contact us" width="961" height="723" /></div>
<p>So functionality wise, Mashable’s contact us page isn’t the <em>very</em> worst. It provides all the info you need to get in contact with Mashable folks, with a contact form and more specific email addresses down below.</p>
<p>What’s shocking is how hideous this page looks. No style, no character, no personality at all. If you just saw this contact page, you’d never guess you were looking at one of the most popular sites on the web! Why so monstrous? Who knows? Maybe Mashable purposely maintains an ugly contact page so that their email inboxes won’t get as flooded.</p>
<p><strong>Score:</strong> 2. Ugly, boring, and unfitting for Mashable.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bad-contact-us-page.png" alt="bad contact us page" width="1023" height="711" /></div>
<p>This <strong>minimalist contact us page</strong> from <a href="http://mostlyserious.io/">Mostly Serious</a> is a great example of a clean, crisp design. Even with such few pieces of copy, Mostly Serious still manages to add a touch of <strong>humor and personality</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Score:</strong> 7. Mostly Serious manages to pull off this ultra-minimalist design without neglecting the element of fun.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/mostlyserious-contact-us.png" alt="mostly serious contact us" width="1386" height="725" /></div>
<p><a href="http://www.codequest.eu/">Code Quest</a> offers another well-executed contact us page, with an eye-catching design, fun graphics, and a dose of personality. Code Quest also <strong>provides a map showing their locations</strong>, which is a great idea if your business is locally oriented.</p>
<p><strong>Score:</strong> 8. Friendly, convenient, and concise, Code Quest gets it right.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/codequest-contact-us.png" alt="contact us pages" width="518" height="417" /></div>
<p>This contact us page from <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/">QuickSprout</a> is especially unique, featuring a scrolling infographic explaining how much mail Neil Patel gets each day and how little time he has to read them all! You’ll only reach Neil’s contact form after scrolling through this infographic. Like the ViperChill example from earlier, Neil needs to be able to filter out any unrelated queries to save time.</p>
<p><strong>Score:</strong> 8. Maybe folks will think twice before spamming people like Neil after checking out this infographic! This contact page is educational and functional.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/sprout-contact-us.png" alt="contact us infographic" width="695" height="645" /></div>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/contact-us-page.png" alt="contact us page" width="733" height="664" /></div>
<p>This contact us page from <a href="http://www.harpoonbrewery.com/">Harpoon Brewery</a> has a lot of information packed in, but it does a <strong>nice job of setting up an information hierarchy</strong>. At the top you have the address and phone number, along with <strong>directions and parking instructions</strong>. This is probably the information most people will be seeking out on a brewery contact page.</p>
<p>Alongside this high-value info are alerts about special events or hour changes from the brewery, and below is more information on hours for the brewery hall.</p>
<p><strong>Score:</strong> 6. Lots of information here that Harpoon Brewery visitors might require for their visit.</p>

<p>For a company that’s all about sleek, cutting-edge product design and style, Apple’s contact us page is unexpectedly plain. There’s nothing to indicate that we’re dealing with one of the most widely-renowned companies in the world! Come on Apple, we know you can do better. What gives?</p>
<p><strong>Score:</strong> 3. Not the kind of design we would expect from the creators of the iPhone.</p>

<p>It really shouldn’t be a huge surprise that Ticketmaster would have a god-awful contact us page, but you’d still think that a website that deals almost exclusively with online orders and makes <em>so</em> much money could spare a little more attention on their contact page.</p>
<p>The giant, unattractive, ridiculously out of place looking banner image is just one more way Ticketmaster is doing you no favors.</p>
<p><strong>Score: </strong>2. Oddly unattractive, this one needs some work.</p>

<p>Dropbox provides another example of a truly quality contact page. The mini icons match perfectly with Dropbox’s large design, creating a cohesive user-experience. I also appreciate how Dropbox puts your name in the copy (assuming you are signed in) to add personalization. It makes you feel more like you’re having a conversation with Dropbox rather than an angry rant or a stressful answer search.</p>
<p><strong>Score:</strong> 8. Reassuring and friendly-feeling, this contact us page is one worth storing away.</p>

<p>This contact page from <a href="http://groverwebdesign.com/">Grover Web Design</a> is friendly, inviting, and offers a variety of ways to contact the company whether through email, telephone, a contact form, social media, or even in-person.</p>
<p><strong>Score: </strong>7. Cute and quick, this page delivers what you need with a little smile.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/contact-us-page-examples.png" alt="best contact us pages" width="1418" height="716" /></div>
<p>Coca-Cola does something pretty ingenious with their contact page – they put a virtual chat agent window right front and center.</p>
<p>In our online era, many users prefer chatting online with a help agent rather than calling in person. Coca-Cola knows their demographic and provides a quick and easy way to get help.</p>
<p>Right below the chat window is an FAQ and other means of contact, giving users their contact method of choice.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how I feel about the accompanying photo slideshow beside the chat window. It seems pretty pointless and out of place, but there could be a method to the madness, as seeing an adorable photo of a Golden Retriever would certainly reduce any immediate consumer fury I might be looking to dish out. Look at him…so cute!</p>
<p><strong>Score:</strong> 8. With this creative approach, Coca-Cola shows they know their audience.</p>

<p>Princess Cruises provides us with another example of a not-so-excellent contact page. Similar to the Apple example from earlier, there just isn’t anything very <em>interesting</em> happening here. That’s not the only reason why this page is bad though – it also has a <strong>wonky information hierarchy</strong> happening.</p>
<p>The top-most section of contact information has to do with booking a cruise. Admittedly, I don’t know Princess Cruises’s audience, but I really doubt many people call cruises anymore to book trips, rather than booking online.</p>
<p>The next sections offer information to help you order a brochure (people still do this?), <a href="https://www.thiscollegelife.com/tip-calculator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find out about tipping</a>, and on-board alcohol policies (this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abosduPhns4">YouTube video about resealing water bottles</a> should help you out), and look at available employment. The very (very) last section <em>finally </em>provides an e-mail address for people who want to leave feedback or ask a question regarding their past cruise experience. I find it pretty bizarre that such <strong>vital information is buried beneath the fold</strong>, at the very bottom of the page. In my mind, I would expect that the customer assistance e-mail address is what a large portion of visitors are looking for on the contact page.</p>
<p><strong>Score:</strong> 2. This information hierarchy on this one is all out of whack.</p>

<p>Many contact us pages are dull and boring, but <a href="http://www.thebandagency.ca/">The Band Agency</a> shows that doesn’t have to be the case. This contact us page is my favorite of all the ones shown here. The vital info is readily available, placed cleverly layered over a map of their physical location. The parade of silhouetted animals adds a <strong>beautiful and endearing quality</strong> that sets this site apart from the rest!</p>
<p><strong>Score:</strong> 10. Adorable, charming, and functional, this contact us page has it all!</p>
