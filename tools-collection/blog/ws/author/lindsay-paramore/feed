<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://later.com/blog/instagram-live-rooms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>Here are some helpful tips for Live Rooms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Add three or more users to the live. </span></strong><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">You can invite up to three other users to join your live video. You could run a panel, get a discussion going, or even have different participants cycle through. As long as you and that account are following one another, they can join your session. </span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Make a bite-sized podcast.</span></strong><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN"> A full podcast for yor business could be a major undertaking.

Note: if you select the three dots at the bottom and the option doesn’t show up to remix, then that person has turned that feature off.  </span></li>

<h2><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Feature #5: Updates to Insights  </span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Instagram also made some general updates to their platform that have turned into great features for content creators. Many of these recent updates are targeted for <span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN"><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/instagram-is-introducing-new-insights-for-reels-and-live-7329447/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reels and IG Live</a><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">, which will help creators engage more with their audience.  </span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Check Reels and Live insights.</span></strong><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN"> These will come in handy after you have made your Reel or gone Live with another user. It will show you what your audience liked and what they didn’t like. Along with if Instagram pushed your reel out or not based on potential engagement and algorithm compliance. You can use these to adjust what you do next.  </span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Expand your tracking period!</span></strong><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN"> With the new updates, you can now expand your tracking period from 30 to 60 days. You now don’t need a third-party tool to analyze more of your data.  </span></li>

<h2><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Feature #6: Instagram algorithm shift</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Not actually a feature, but just as important! Instagram&#8217;s latest algorithm is said to favor fun and engaging video content. In June 2021, Instagram announced that it will <span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">not optimize for recycled content from other apps, such as TikTok. Before this recent update, users were missing about <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-algorithm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70% of their posts</a><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN"> along with 50% of their friends’ posts. </span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Write a longer caption with the video. </span></strong><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">This has actually shown to increase engagement and interaction on the platform where your audience will want to see the full video and not just keep scrolling.  </span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Branded intro and branded outro.</span></strong><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN"> This will keep consistency and make your videos on the professional video creation level. It needs to stay on-brand with your business so the user doesn’t get confused on what they are watching.  </span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Incroporate music.</span></strong><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN"> Also make sure these songs are copyright-free and you are using the right type of music for your video. Think about how you are trying to engage with your audience. If you are trying to give them an exciting update, then use upbeat music. If you are showing your audience something on the more serious side, then perhaps keep the music calm. </span></li>
<li><strong>Post at the right time.</strong> You may want to experiment with posting in the early hours of the monrng when competition is lower, so you can get more relative engagement with your posts.

<h2><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Feature #7: Instagram explains how its algorithm works </span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Also not a feature, but big news. In the same month, Instagram decided to shed more light on <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/shedding-more-light-on-how-instagram-works">exactly how their algorithm works</a>. You can learn more here in these <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-instagram-feed-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9 Ways to Show Up in the Instagram Feed [New Info!]</a>, but some quick pointers:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Regularly publish Reels:</span></strong><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN"><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN"> Reels regularly will help boost your page outside your network and all organically! It doesn’t have to be that time-consuming either if you keep everything in a shortened format. Studies are showing that Reels are getting <span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN"><a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/instagram-video-posts-receive-twice-the-engagement-of-other-post-types-study/295443/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two times the reach</a><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN"> than a normal post (as well as has longevity on the platform), so it only makes sense that you take advantage of how Instagram’s algorithm works.<br />

</li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Cut down on the hashtags. </span></strong><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Hashtags are losing their luster. The algorithm is getting more advanced in terms of categorizing for keywords (<a href="/blog/ws/2021/04/07/instagram-seo">more on Instagram SEO here</a>) and relying less on the use of hashtags in your posts. So maybe save some time and cut the normal 30 hashtags to about half or even less.  </span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Focus on video and shopping.</span></strong><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN"> Yes, the <span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/instagram-may-not-be-a-photo-sharing-app-anymore-but-glass-is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CEO of Instagram</a><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN"> is telling you, straight from the source, that Instagram is no longer a photo-sharing app. It is now more focused on shopping and video content. He’s not saying photos are going away, but they will definitely be focusing their algorithm to give more videos and products a boost over photos. It’s time to get more creative on how you are utilizing Instagram than just pushing out a photo a day.  </span></span></span></li>

<h2>Feature # 9: Location Stories (once again!)</h2>
<p>This feature was removed in October 2020 due to election precautions, and finally, a year later, it&#8217;s back! With it, users can find Stories being published by accounts nearby—a great way to do some <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-to-post-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local social media marketing</a>!</p>

<h2>Feature #10: Maps search</h2>
<p>In September 2021, Instagram began rolling out the Map search feature. The in-app map will show nearby shops, venues, and cafes, and if a user taps on one of the map items, Instagram will then show more information about the business like hours, address, pricing, their Instagram profile, and public posts tagged at that location.</p>

<p>With the growing momentum of people wanting to generally connect online, it’s no wonder that businesses spend about 15-25% of their advertising budget* on just social media. But organic social media marketing is just as important as paid efforts.</p>
<p>Paid or organic, it&#8217;s not enough to just set up your social profiles and let them sit there, essentially gaining virtual dust. Just like your website, you need to audit optimize your profiles to get the highest return on your investments of time, effort, and money.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/social-media-optimization.png" width="720" height="480" alt="social media logos" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>So in this post, I&#8217;m going to define social media optimization and provide tips, checklists, and tools to optimize your marketing efforts on the following platforms:</p>
<ol>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>YouTube</li>
<li>Instagram</li>
<li>LinkedIn</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>TikTok</li>
<li>Snapchat</li>
<li>Pinterest</li>
</ol>

<h2>What is social media optimization?</h2>
<p lang="EN-US" xml_lang="EN-US">Like <a href="/blog/ws/2015/04/30/seo-basics">search engine optimization</a>, social media optimization encompasses a number of strategies, tools, and best practices used to get the highest quality exposure <em>to</em> and engagement <em>with</em> your target audience. Purposes of social media optimization include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li lang="EN-US" xml_lang="EN-US">Show up in platform search results</li>
<li lang="EN-US" xml_lang="EN-US">Rank higher in your followers’ feeds</li>
<li lang="EN-US" xml_lang="EN-US">Get quality <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-check-social-media-engagement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engagement</a> on your posts</li>
<li lang="EN-US" xml_lang="EN-US">Send traffic to your website</li>
<li lang="EN-US" xml_lang="EN-US">Maintain <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/brand-consistency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand consistency </a></li>
<li lang="EN-US" xml_lang="EN-US">Establish thought leadership</li>
<li lang="EN-US" xml_lang="EN-US">Publish content your followers want to see</li>
<li lang="EN-US" xml_lang="EN-US">Improve social signals for SEO</li>
</ul>
<p lang="EN-US" xml_lang="EN-US">But unlike search engine optimization, which is pretty standard across Google and Bing, social media optimization has <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business">different best practices for each platform</a>, making it a much bigger challenge.</p>
<p lang="EN-US" xml_lang="EN-US">That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve broken up these tools and tips by platform, so you can audit and optimize each based on their specific differences.</p>
<h2>Social media optimization on Facebook</h2>
<p>This really does have to be first and foremost to consider when it comes to advertising your business. It’s a great way to stay connected with your customers, and you have the options to increase awareness by <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/15/facebook-sponsored-posts">boosting posts</a> or using <a href="/blog/ws/2017/04/27/how-to-compete-in-facebook-ads">Facebook ads</a>.</p>
<h3>Free Facebook optimization tools</h3>
<ul>

<h3>Facebook optimization tips</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Know which is which:</strong> It’s important to optimize separately for organic versus paid posts in Facebook. Just like Google Ads differ from organic results, users expect different things for Facebook posts versus ads. For example, all Facebook ads need a call to action, but you shouldn&#8217;t have one for every organic post.</li>
<li><strong>Pay attention to popular posts:</strong> This may seem to be a no-brainer, but it’s a good idea to take a look at the insights and see which posts perform better in terms of shares and engagements. When you know what works, the more users will engage with you which in turn gets your page noticed.</li>
<li><strong>Upload videos directly:</strong> You will actually see more engagement if you upload your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/28/facebook-video-marketing">Facebook videos</a> directly instead of linking to YouTube.</li>
<li><strong>Be cognizant of promotion: </strong>Your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/29/best-facebook-ads">Facebook ads</a> can highlight your products and services as much as possible, but organically, you will want to do this every third or fourth post.</li>
<li><strong>Engage with transparency: </strong>When there are not-so-nice comments, you don’t need to hide or delete them all. Try to authentically engage with your audience for a real connection. The more you interact, the better the social optimization.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Social media optimization on YouTube</h2>
<p>It may seem daunting to get into the <a href="/blog/ws/2017/03/08/video-marketing-statistics">video marketing</a> space, but it’s been an increasingly important way to communicate with your potential and current customers. Think about traditional TV commercials for a minute. Those still cost a LOT of money! For basically free, you can <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/11/at-home-diy-video">make your own video</a> from your phone and upload it to YouTube.</p>
<p>It’s also a great way to embed some great content on your website and not slow it down!</p>

<h3>YouTube optimization tips</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Optimize for search:</strong> Yes, <a href="/blog/ws/2021/06/10/youtube-seo-tips">YouTube SEO</a> is a thing. And for every video, you need to add relevant keywords to the title, description and filename. Remember, YouTube is Google, so you should consider that when uploading videos.</li>
<li><strong>Select a relevant category:</strong> Try to think of where the video would be best, which won’t always correlate with your company’s industry.</li>
<li><strong>Make use of hashtags: </strong>These appear above the title of your video.</li>
<li><strong>Customize the thumbnail image: </strong>Make the image as captivating as possible so you can grab the user’s attention to get them to <a href="/blog/ws/2020/05/14/how-to-get-more-views-on-youtube">view the video</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Add closed captions:</strong> <a href="https://www.nexttv.com/news/mobile-videos-often-watched-without-audio-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">92%</a> of users view videos with the sound off on mobile and 83% watch with sound off. It’s a good idea to add those captions.</li>

<h2>Social media optimization on Instagram</h2>
<p>The merge of Instagram with Facebook makes it easier to use both in conjunction without putting more financial strain on you as the business owner. You can set your Instagram posts to automatically publish to your Facebook feed, and you can boost posts both on Facebook and Instagram, maximizing your exposure.</p>

<h3>Instagram optimization tips</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use all of the formats: </strong>To get the most out of Instagram, be sure to use posts, <a href="/blog/ws/2018/05/04/instagram-videos">videos</a>, <a href="/blog/ws/2019/12/04/instagram-story-hacks">Stories</a>, <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/06/instagram-story-highlights">Highlights</a>, <a href="/blog/ws/2021/06/22/instagram-reels-ideas-for-businesses">Reels</a>, and <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/30/instagram-live">Instagram live</a> to maximize your exposure and engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Optimize your profile:</strong> In addition to ensuring your username is your business name (or as close as you can get it), you will want to <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/09/instagram-bios">optimize your bio</a> with hashtags and important keywords.</li>
<li><strong>Hashtags, hashtags, hashtags:</strong> For real. <a href="/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">Instagram hashtags</a> are SO important. You can have up to 30 (although the platform would prefer you stay between the 8-14 range).<br />
<strong>Tip:</strong> If you want to keep your post clean without all the hashtags, you can comment with all the hashtags you want to be found with as the first comment after you’ve posted. You will still be searched that way!</li>
<li><strong>Include alt text for your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-media-image-sizes">images</a>.</strong> Yes, you heard me right. Alt text isn’t just for SEO-ing your website. You can also add those important keywords in the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/07/instagram-seo">alt text of your Instagram post</a>. Check out the advanced settings section of your post to update it.</li>
<li><strong>Highlight your products: </strong>Instagram has the <a href="https://www.media-marketing.com/en/news/instagram-is-the-most-influential-social-network-in-marketing/">largest influence on purchasing</a> than any of the other platforms. This is the best social platform to showcase your products!</li>

<h2>Social media optimization for LinkedIn</h2>
<p>For this platform, it’s really more of a B2B type of social platform, and obviously great to find potential employees. As long as you keep that in mind, LinkedIn can really help shape your business online.</p>

<h3>LinkedIn optimization tips</h3>

<li><strong>More than just a job title:</strong> Your headline should be about your brand and not about who you need to hire.</li>
<li><strong>Publish already optimized content: </strong>Sharing links is a big component of LinkedIn, so take advantage by sharing links back to your website but don’t forget articles as well to mix it up a bit.</li>
<li><strong>Customize your URL: </strong>They can be <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/62467/updating-the-url-of-your-linkedin-page?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subject to availability</a>, but it’s always worth a try to get your URL as close to your business name or main keyword you are trying to optimize for.</li>
<li><strong>CTA in your Page, not always your posts:</strong> You will want to have a call to action in your profile bio but pay close attention to too many “check this out” phrases as that could get users to scroll on.</li>
</ol>

<li><strong>Be casual:</strong> This is actually one of our <a href="/blog/ws/2021/01/04/best-marketing-strategies-2021">top marketing strategies for 2021</a>. You won’t necessarily want to be super uptight in these videos. Keep them short and concise. Let your audience get to know you a little bit more personally.</li>
<li><strong>Participate in hashtag challenges: </strong>I’m sure you have seen parents dancing with their kids in some of these challenges. Basically, take a look at some of the <a href="https://medium.com/dailytiktok/what-is-a-hashtag-challenge-on-tiktok-b56fa793da25" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trending hashtag challenges</a> on TikTok and decide which one you want do to!</li>

<li><strong>Include keywords in your bio: </strong>Do you see a pattern with all these keywords in your social profile?</li>
<li><strong>CTA in your bio: </strong>A call to action in your bio is key to optimizing your TikTok page.</li>

<h2>Social media optimization for Snapchat</h2>
<p>Whatever video you just posted to TikTok, you can also post to Snapchat. They both have similar lengths and optimizations. Because of Snapchat’s policies, there won’t be a third-party tool to track what’s going on with your channel. The best you can do is pay attention to what <a href="https://forbusiness.snapchat.com/">SnapChat Business</a> lets you see.</p>

<h3>Snapchat optimization tips</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Target your demographic: </strong>Optimizing your ads towards the users that might convert is a main way to optimize your Snapchat profile.</li>
<li><strong>Pay attention to audience insights:</strong> This is a great way to see which ads users are actually interested in so you can keep using them.</li>
<li><strong>Take advantage of creative testing:</strong> You have the ability to test different variations of creatives, which makes things easier for you as a business owner. If your ad doesn’t resonate with users, you could end up spending a <a href="https://www.fetchfunnel.com/how-to-optimize-snapchat-ad-campaigns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher cost per optimization event</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Feature products:</strong> You can link to any product to help drive traffic to your website or online shopping site.</li>
<li><strong>Highlight events:</strong> Users tend to like to see events pop up to potentially attend. If you have an event coming up, you will want to showcase that. Geofilters can be useful for this.</li>

<h2>Final tips for social media optimization</h2>
<p>Here are some final tips that apply across platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure the name, description, phone number and all the necessary fields are filled out as thoroughly and consistently as possible.</li>
<li>Use an email that all applicable teammates have access to (except Facebook and LinkedIn, as you are required to have your own personal accounts to be connected to the business account); or that you have a shared (secure) document that provides usernames and passwords.</li>
<li>If you have more than one social media platform you are active on, we recommend getting a combo audit tool, such as <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/integrations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SproutSocial</a>. This type of auditing tool will at least give you an overview of each platform and different suggestions you can do to improve each one.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is only so much time in the day, especially as a business owner trying to have your name in a lot of other places on and offline. Now that you have the lay of the land, take a chance on starting or optimizing the social profile that is right for your business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a business, it’s important to stay in front of your customers where <em>they</em> are, not where we want them to be. And with <a href="https://assetdigitalcom.com/social-media-and-small-business-latest-statistics/">one billion</a> monthly active users, you can bet that a good portion of your customers are on Instagram.</p>
<section class="section">Combine that with the fact that video content fosters more engagement, connection, and trust, and you can see why Instagram Reels has become a marketing tool for businesses.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-use-instagram-reels-for-business-three-reel-examples-1-1.png" alt="three different instagram reels screenshots" width="720" height="419" /></div>
<p>In this post, I’m going to explain what Instagram Reels are and why businesses use them, and then dive into:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to create Instagram Reels for your business account.</li>
<li>Tips to get the most out of your Instagram Reels.</li>
<li>Instagram Reels ideas and examples to help you build your brand.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Instagram Reels?</h2>
<p>Social media has played a role in turning the buying “<a href="/blog/ws/2021/06/15/lead-magnet-ideas">funnel</a>” into more of a “web” of different places your customers use to find products and services. Instagram is one of the fastest growing out of all these social platforms with <a href="/blog/ws/2021/01/28/instagram-demographics-2021">one billion </a>monthly active users and 500 million daily users. That’s a lot of potential customers!</p>
<p>In addition to the fact that it&#8217;s <a href="/blog/ws/2018/05/04/instagram-videos">video content</a>, Hootsuite found that on days when they published Instagram Reels, they saw spikes in overall engagement.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-reels-experiment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<h2>What are Instagram Reels?</h2>
<p>Reels is an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/26/instagram-features">Instagram feature</a>, available in both iOS and Android, where you shoot, edit, and share 15- or 30-second videos. Unlike Stories but very much like TikTok, Reels offers sophisticated editing and <a href="/blog/ws/2017/12/15/best-video-editing-software-for-beginners">video processing tools</a>. You can overlay <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/18/music-in-ads">music</a>, speed things up or slow them down, add special effects, and more.</p>
<p>If you post a Reel to a public account, any other Instagram user will be able to create their own Reel using that audio track.</p>
<p>Reels appear in the Reels tab of your profile as well as the Explore tab, but you can also share Reels in your feed, Story, or directly with another user.</p>
<p>Your Reels will also appear in searches for the song or hashtag you used.</p>
<h2>How to create an Instagram Reel for your business</h2>
<p>Here are the four basic steps for creating a Reel for your business on Instagram.</p>
<h3>1. Enter Reels mode</h3>
<p>To enter Reels mode in your Instagram stories, go to your profile, tap on the plus sign, and  Select Reels.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-create-an-instagram-reel-go-to-profile-1.png" alt="step one to create an instagram reel for business- go to business bio" width="300" height="534" /></div>
<p>Then choose Reels</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-create-an-instagram-reel-for-business-choose-reel-1.png" alt="how to create an instagram reel for business-screenshot of media types" width="300" height="534" /></div>
<h3>2. Choose your settings</h3>
<p>There, you’ll have options for special effects, audio, length, speed, effects, touch up, and timer. (You can also add audio and effects later)</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-create-an-instagram-reel-for-business-recording-options-1.png" alt="recording options when creating an instagram reel for business" width="300" height="534" /></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Music: </strong>Adds an audio track of your choice from other Reels users or from the app&#8217;s library.</li>
<li><strong>Length:</strong> Choose 15 or 30 seconds.</li>
<li><strong>Speed</strong>. Slow down or speed up your video.</li>
<li><strong>Effects: </strong>Add filters and stickers; you can also use any of the filters you have previously created.</li>
<li><strong>Touch up</strong>: For that smooth skin look.</li>
<li><strong>Timer:</strong> Set a timer for hands-free video recording.</li>
</ul>
<p>After you hit the Record button, you&#8217;ll see a 3-2-1 countdown before you start recording.</p>
<h3>3. Record, preview and edit each clip</h3>
<p>As you record, you&#8217;ll see a progress bar at the top of the screen to help you stay within your time limit.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;re done recording, hit preview on the bottom right-hand corner of the screen.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-use-instagram-reels-for-business-recording-and-preview-screen-1.png" alt="how to use instagram reels for business—recording and preview screen" width="300" height="534" /></div>
<p>Remember, Reels allows you to stitch together clips that you record new clips <strong>or</strong> upload from your gallery, so you can add in those as well.</p>
<p>Once you hit preview, you’ll have additional editing options, as well as the original options if you didn&#8217;t choose them prior to recording.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Audio controls: </strong>adjust camera audio, add music (if you haven&#8217;t already).</li>
<li><strong>Voiceover</strong>: record audio over the video.</li>
<li><strong>Decorations</strong>: add GIFs, stickers, emojis, countdowns, labels, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Pen</strong>: make lines, arrows, scribbles, or write something</li>
<li><strong>Text</strong>: overlay text in different colors</li>
<li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Align objects from the previous clip before recording the next one to create smooth transitions for moments, like changing clothes or new characters appearing in the video.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Publish your Reel</h3>
<p>Once you are done recording and editing all of your clips, select the &#8220;Share To&#8221; button at the bottom right (as shown above), where you&#8217;ll be taken to the publishing screen. Here you can choose a cover, write a caption, add hashtags, and then publish your Reels.</p>

<h2>Tips for creating Instagram Reels for business</h2>
<p>You can edit video clips in the Reel app itself or use other video editing apps if you want to get super creative with it. If you need to schedule your reels out, you can always use platforms like <a href="https://later.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Later</a> or the like to get your video content planned ahead instead of directly in the app. Here are some more tips for using <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-instagram-reels-for-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram Reels for business</a>.</p>
<h3>1. Use music AND closed captions</h3>
<p>Each time you use music, your Reel gets exposed to that specific song’s tag. It’s similar to <a href="/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">hashtags</a> with the potential of more reach. And since there are plenty of users that don’t keep their sound on—yes, even while they are scrolling through Reels—it’s good to put on those captions so they can engage with the sound off.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tips-for-creating-instagram-reels-for-business-use-captions-1.png" alt="example of instagram reel for business with captions" width="300" height="534" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CMFgq21HlKm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View Reel here</a></p>
<h3>2. Tag relevant accounts</h3>
<p>Tagging other accounts is highly encouraged in the <a href="/blog/ws/2020/02/13/ugc-instagram">Instagram realm</a>. You get more reach by putting your content on someone else’s account as well as the potential for them to share your content with their following. You can utilize this tip with regular Instagram posts as well.</p>
<h3>3. Push Reels to your feed</h3>
<p>You can organically post your Reel as is through the Reel platform (it will then show up in your Reels tab), or also publish it on your own feed. For the most part, it’s a best practice to publish to your feed so that your current audience can engage too. This will also you to build more content and <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/05/promote-instagram-account-free">promote your account.</a></p>
<p>Tip: If you use words on your video, try to get them as centered as possible (without obstructing the important parts of the video). When you share your Reel to your feed, it will naturally get cut off as the <a href="https://help.instagram.com/1631821640426723" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ratios for posts and Reels</a> are different.</p>
<h3>4. Take old Stories and posts and recreate them into Reels</h3>
<p>A big portion of the content creation community <a href="/blog/ws/2015/02/03/repurposing-content">repurposes</a> older posts and Stories to create their 15-30 second video for Instagram reels. For example, if you just recently traveled somewhere as a business or have some pictures from a job you just completed, you can combine all of those photos into one video.</p>
<p>Check out this example from @cutylife that uses Jefferson Airplane’s &#8220;Somebody to Love&#8221; for their Reel soundtrack.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-use-instagram-reels-for-business-travel-ig-reel-example-1.jpeg" alt="instagram reel example documenting travel" width="300" height="534" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CPXeNtlhgX5/?utm_medium=copy_link">View Reel here</a></em></p>
<h3>5. Upload your TikTok videos to Reels</h3>
<p>Did you just <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/11/advertising-on-tiktok">post a video to TikTok</a>? You can literally post that same video to your Instagram Reels as well! Just make sure it’s all your 30-second versions of those videos (TikTok allows 60 seconds), or you can cut the 60 second video into two Reels—only if it makes sense to cut it.</p>
<h3>6. Add titles to your Reel cover photos</h3>
<p>When someone navigates to your Reels tab, make it easy for them to select which Reel they want to watch. Titling your Reels also gives your <a href="/blog/ws/2016/10/19/get-more-instagram-followers">Instagram followers</a> a feel for what kind of content you post. Useful tips? Inspiring landscapes? Company culture?</p>

<h2>Instagram Reels ideas and examples for businesses</h2>
<p>There are plenty of free ways to reach your potential customers on Instagram: posts, videos, Stories, <a href="/blog/ws/2018/06/22/instagram-tv">IGTV</a>, and now Reels. Here are some of the ways businesses are using Instagram Reels to express, educate, and entertain.</p>
<h3>7. Film yourself giving tips</h3>
<p>You could provide five short tips, one extensive tip, or a preview of a longer video to come. Think about the keywords you target in blog posts, FAQs from customers and prospects, and other videos that have performed well in your <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business">social media marketing endeavors.</a> You won’t believe how much content you will come up with just by answering questions your customers ask you on a regular basis.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CLU-GKKHr0T/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View Reel here</a></em></p>
<h3>8. Share customer testimonials or success stories</h3>
<p>Have some of your most <a href="/blog/ws/2019/07/18/loyalty-marketing">loyal customers</a> do a 15 to 30 second video on why they love doing business with you. <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">Reviews</a> are always going to <a href="/blog/ws/2019/04/05/social-media-marketing-strategy">perform well on social media</a>, especially video content like Instagram Reels.</p>
<h3>9. Make a blooper Reel out of your Reel bloopers</h3>
<p>Who doesn&#8217;t love bloopers? People love being able to relate to the business owner behind the camera. Use humor to express the lighter side of your <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/01/brand-strategy">brand personality </a>and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-check-social-media-engagement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improve your social media engagement</a> along the way.</p>
<h3>10. Feature your employees</h3>
<p>Get your employees in on the fun! Feature an employee each week, sharing what they love about working for your business, what they love about their job, or giving tips from their specialty. People want to feel connected to who they do business with. Plus, this is a great opportunity to express your <a href="/blog/ws/2021/06/09/company-core-values">company&#8217;s core values</a>.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/examples-of-instagram-reels-for-business-adobe-1.jpeg" alt="an example of an employee instagram reel by adobe" width="300" height="534" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CLZrhSVJSos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>View Reel here</em></a></p>
<h3>11. Provide useful checklists</h3>
<p>Did you start your own business? What were the best marketing strategies you used to <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/28/growth-strategy">grow your business</a>? The options are endless. A lot of content creators will have the options written out and they will point to them as it goes across the screen, but if that isn’t your style, you can always literally check off on a notepad and go through the tips of your particular topic.</p>
<h3>12. Create before-and-after Reels</h3>
<p>If you are a service company, this will be really easy. Just don’t forget to take some pictures before you start the project/maintenance/job.</p>
<h3>13. Promote another business</h3>
<p>You could choose to promote a neighboring small business, or if you&#8217;re a <a href="/blog/ws/2021/06/02/b2b-marketing-strategies">B2B</a> company, highlight one of your clients. Shopify does this in the example below, talking about a small, woman-owned landscaping company that went viral.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-reels-ideas-for-busines-feature-another-business-1.png" alt="shopify instagram reel example promoting a small business" width="300" height="534" /></div>
<h3>14. Share quick and encouraging messages</h3>
<p>It’s important to connect with your followers, and one quick way to do that is grab some inspirational quotes based on your business. You can either turn the camera on you and recite these quotes, or closed caption those with a nice moving background. One app I personally use that has been really helpful is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/subtitles-video-captions-mix/id1549309791" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Subtitles — Video Captions Mix</a>. It saves me a lot of time with handwriting out everything I’m saying.</p>
<h3>15. Talk about the perks of being on your email list and then tell them how to join</h3>
<p>Good cross-promotion strategy here. Do your subscribers get exclusive deals? Early access? Entered into a drawing? Get more <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/11/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups">email signups</a> with your Reels.</p>
<h3>16. Product highlights or tutorials</h3>
<p>Showcase <a href="/blog/ws/2014/04/07/unique-selling-proposition">what makes your business different </a>by producing Reels for each product or service your business offers. Head to your service or <a href="/blog/ws/2015/06/01/product-pages">product pages</a> and let the games begin! Or, show your customers how to become power users.</p>

<h3>17. Demonstrate how to leave a review</h3>
<p>Really focus on the platform you need the more help with (i.e., <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/16/get-more-google-reviews">Google</a>, Yelp, Facebook). Be funny with this one. Try not to placate too much but tell your followers how much you would love to hear their feedback on their service.</p>
<h3>18. Run a Reels contest</h3>
<p>Create a Reel, ask your followers to create a Reel on a topic of your choice, using the same audio for your Reel, and post with a custom hashtag. Follow all the same <a href="/blog/ws/2017/05/11/instagram-giveaways">best practices for Instagram giveaways</a>!</p>
