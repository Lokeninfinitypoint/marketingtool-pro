										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Content is a must have for any business marketing strategy. It serves to educate your audience on your products and services, distinguish your brand voice, and even more importantly, get your audience into your funnel in the first place.</p>
<p>In fact, according to <a href="https://blog.marketo.com/2017/12/gating-content-offers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marketo</a>, lead generation is the top goal for 80% of content marketers.</p>

<em><a href="https://blog.marketo.com/2017/12/gating-content-offers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></em></p>
<p>So how do you generate leads with content? There are a number of ways, but gating content is one of the most effective.</p>
<p>Gated content comes in many forms, from worksheets and ebooks to webinars and videos. Use this guide to determine which type of content to create and how to do so in a way that adds value and helps you achieve your lead generation goals.</p>

<p><a id="what"></a></p>
<h2>What is gated content?</h2>
<p>Gated content is any form of content that people (your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a>) can get in exchange for their contact information. More often than not, they share their name and email. This is a relatively easy way to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/17/b2b-lead-generation">generate more leads</a> because you’re offering something of value that your ideal client or customer wants, rather than simply asking for their email outright or pitching your offer immediately.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/gated-content-example-voluum.png" alt="example of gated content - pdf guide from voluum" width="720" height="440" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63772" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/gated-content-example-voluum.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/gated-content-example-voluum-480x293.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Gated content can come in nearly any form. Some of those most popular formats (also known as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/01/headline-examples">lead magnets</a>) include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guides/ebooks</li>
<li>Checklists</li>
<li>Worksheets/workbooks</li>
<li>Audio recordings</li>
<li>Videos (pre-recorded or live webinar)</li>
<li>Case studies</li>
</ul>
<p>The type of content is usually free and you’ll choose the format based on your industry and your target client or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/23/buyer-personas">customer persona</a>. For example, a CMO making an expensive purchasing decision is going to be more interested in a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/03/how-to-write-a-case-study">case study</a> while a that shows what you do as a company rather than a checklist or guide.</p>
<p>The file itself can be uploaded to your website and therefore accessible via a website page, but that page is not accessible to website visitors. It can only be accessed once the user fills out a form.</p>
<p>That form can live on a landing page or even embedded in a blog post or main navigation page on your site. The option you’ll choose ultimately depends on the software you use and features offered.<br />
<a id="pros_cons"></a></p>
<h2>Pros &amp; cons of gated content</h2>
<p>While gated content can be a valuable resource for driving leads, there are pros and cons to using this format.</p>
<h4>Pros of gated content</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lead generation:</strong> The primary reason for gating content is to generate leads. With your potential customers&#8217; contact info, you can follow up with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/30/lead-nurturing-campaign-emails">nurture emails</a>, and if you collect other information on your form, you can cater your copy and subsequent offers to their preferences and circumstances.</li>
<li><strong> Inexpensive:</strong> With a proper <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/13/content-marketing-strategy">content marketing strategy</a>, creating gated content is inexpensive and therefore a high-ROI lead generation tactic.</li>
<li><strong>Build trust:</strong> If a user finds a resource worth exchanging their contact information for, this indicates they find value in it, which helps enhance your brand authority.</li>
</ul>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><p>If you&#8217;re looking for more great marketing strategies, look no further:</p>

<h4><strong></strong>Cons of gated content</h4>
<p>There are a few cons to consider as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Barrier to entry:</strong> Having to share contact information might deter some people from actually accessing the resource. If this is a case study that can help someone make a purchasing decision, for example, you might stand to lose more than you gain. Then again, if a person isn&#8217;t interested enough to provide their contact information, this is a good way to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/25/lead-qualification">filter out unqualified leads</a>.</li>
<li><strong>SEO:</strong> In addition, gated content is typically shared in the form of a downloadable PDF or other media type. As such, the text isn’t on the webpage itself, meaning you can&#8217;t <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">optimize it for SEO</a> or use it for generating traffic.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are ways around this, however. For example, you can optimize the landing page for those keywords and &#8220;sneak in&#8221; the high-quality long-form content <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google">required for the page to rank</a> in the form of FAQs below the fold of the page.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/gated-content-landing-page-seo-optimized-example.png" alt="seo optimized landing page for gated content" width="438" height="618" class="aligncenter wp-image-63773" /></p>
<p>You can also use your ungated content to target high-volume keywords, and then promote gated content on those high traffic pages. This could even be a PDF version of the ungated content that has additional information and value.<br />
<a id="how"></a></p>
<h2>How to create gated content in 7 steps</h2>
<p>If you’re ready to generate more leads with gated content, there are a few important steps you need to take to ensure it actually achieves that goal. Use these tips to make sure you create a resource that works.</p>
<h3>1. Choose the right content</h3>
<p>For someone to give their personal information, they have to really want what you’re offering. To figure out what they consider to be worthwhile, look at your blog traffic, customer and audience behavior, and even competitor resources that your current customers or clients find most valuable.</p>
<h3>2. Determine the funnel stage</h3>
<p>Figure out which stage of the funnel you’re targeting with this gated content. Over time, you’ll likely have options that fall within each stage. For example, a case study would likely be categorized as middle or bottom of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/01/content-marketing-funnel">content marketing funnel</a> because someone downloading a case study is more toward the evaluation and intent phases, rather than the awareness phase.</p>
<p>Knowing the phase you’re targeting will provide clarity around the type of resource you should create.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/content-marketing-funnel.png" alt="content marketing funnel" width="720" height="745" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63246" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/content-marketing-funnel.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/content-marketing-funnel-480x497.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>3. Create a strong landing page&#8230;</h3>
<p>Your landing page contains information about the content that the visitor needs in order to decide whether to download it, as well as the form to obtain it. To <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/15/landing-page-best-practices">optimize your landing page for conversions</a>, you need a strong hook, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/06/how-to-write-copy-that-sells">compelling copy</a>, and very little clutter so the visitor is encouraged to fill out the form.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">Here are some landing page examples</a> to give you some ideas. If your landing page is indexed (i.e., it can appear on Google), you&#8217;ll need to take care of all the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/06/on-page-seo">on-page SEO best practices</a>.</p>
<h3>4. &#8230; and thank you page</h3>
<p>This, of course, is the page the user is redirected to upon completing the form and is the most important part of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/25/optimize-lead-generation-process">lead generation process</a>. This page either contains a button to download the PDF or media file, or it lets the user know what to do next—like check their inbox. You can even put a secondary, lower-funnel offer on your thank you page as a way to even further qualify an engage your lead.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/gated-content-thank-you-page-example-wrike.png" alt="example of a thank you page from write after requesting gated content" width="720" height="438" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63770" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/gated-content-thank-you-page-example-wrike.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/gated-content-thank-you-page-example-wrike-480x292.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And if you don&#8217;t have a marketing automation platform, you can use pageviews of the thank you page to see how many times something was downloaded.</p>
<h3>5. Deliver on your promise</h3>
<p>If the person doesn’t get what they were promised, you end up hurting your brand more than helping it. Think about it: if a person fills out a form to get an ultimate guide on something, only to find that it&#8217;s not a comprehensive piece of content on the topic, you&#8217;ve now lost their trust, and any nurturing tactics you had planned are not going to work.</p>
<h3>6. Follow up with and nurture your leads</h3>
<p>This is one of the most important pieces because, once you have your leads, you need to get your offer in front of them. Depending on your product and sales process, this could look like creating a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-nurturing-emails">nurture flow</a> that continues to deliver value, while educating them on what you offer, for a certain number of days, weeks, or months after.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/gated-content-nurture-email-flow.png" alt="gated content nurture email flow example" width="331" height="486" class="aligncenter wp-image-63774" /></p>
<p>If sales calls are an important part of your selling process, your goal with these emails is likely then to get those who’ve accessed the resource on a call. As such, all your emails are guiding the recipient to book that call.</p>
<h3>7. Measure success &amp; iterate</h3>
<p>As with anything in marketing, it takes time to get your gated content strategy right and optimize for the best results. Use data from Google Analytics, your CRM, and other <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/05/b2b-marketing-automation-tactics">marketing automation</a> tools to understand how successful the campaign was and then leverage that data to create gated content that works even better.<br />
<a id="examples"></a></p>
<h2>Examples of gated content</h2>
<p>If you’re not sure where to start, use these examples of gated content and their associated landing pages to create a valuable resource that generates leads. In each of these examples, notice how the landing pages are simple, concise, and persuasive with a large lead form to encourage conversions.</p>
<h3>1. WordStream&#8217;s 120 Words &amp; Phrases List</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/gated-content-example-wordstream.png" alt="gated content example - wordstream's 120 words and phrases list" width="720" height="632" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63778" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/gated-content-example-wordstream.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/gated-content-example-wordstream-480x421.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download">WordStream&#8217;s 120 of the Best Words &amp; Phrases for Marketing with Emotion </a>is a great example of the type of content that typically generates a lot of interest: a list. Marketers are always looking for ways to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/21/emotional-ad-copy-examples">write more compelling copy</a> and a big list that makes their life easier is a valuable resource.</p>
<h3>2. HR.com&#8217;s Performance Management Research Report</h3>
<p>HR.com releases gated content in the form of research reports on a regular basis—like its <a href="https://www.hr.com/en/resources/free_research_white_papers/the-future-of-performance-management_l5j4t3xt.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Future of Performance Management Report</a>. For some organizations, this is a great way to drive leads and maintain thought leadership within the industry.</p>
<p>Notice how further down on the page they share insights from the report—but these are below the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/13/call-to-action-examples">CTA</a> and download button to provide further incentive to download without cluttering the conversion. <a href="https://www.hr.com/en/resources/free_research_white_papers/the-future-of-performance-management_l5j4t3xt.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong></strong></a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/gated-content-example-hr-research-report.png" alt="gated content example - HR Research report" width="720" height="690" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63779" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/gated-content-example-hr-research-report.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/gated-content-example-hr-research-report-480x460.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>3. Content Marketing Institute&#8217;s Content Gaps Webinar</h3>
<p>Rather than providing a written piece of content, Content Marketing Institute&#8217;s <a href="https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/3893380/C9A61A5321D7774229ED6DBE1E103093?partnerref=CMIWEBINAR" style="font-size: 14px;">&#8220;Find Your Gaps&#8221; webinar</a> is a pre-recorded webinar that the user can access on demand. You can also do this with live webinars if you want to sell your product or service to an active audience. Follow our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/05/webinar-marketing">webinar tips</a> to make this a success.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/gated-content-example-webinar-cmi.png" alt="gated content example - webinar by content marketing institute" width="720" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63780" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/gated-content-example-webinar-cmi.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/gated-content-example-webinar-cmi-480x399.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3><a href="https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/3893380/C9A61A5321D7774229ED6DBE1E103093?partnerref=CMIWEBINAR" style="font-size: 14px;"></a></h3>
<h3>4. Ryan and Alex&#8217;s PDF Calendar</h3>
<p>Ryan and Alex created a 30-day ab challenge, wrote an in-depth piece of content on it, and then embedded the <a href="https://www.ryanandalex.com/30-day-ab-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDF calendar version</a> in that content. This is a great way to drive leads because, as a key resource for completing the challenge, users are more encouraged to download it. This also shows how you can embed your gated content within a blog post (which can rank on Google and generate traffic), rather than creating a solo landing page.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/gated-content-example-pdf-calendar.png" alt="gated content example - pdf calendar" width="416" height="535" class="aligncenter wp-image-63781" /><a href="https://www.ryanandalex.com/30-day-ab-challenge/"><strong></strong></a></p>

It also has multiple CTA buttons on the page that all lead to the form, which is important when you have a lot of content on the page.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/gated-content-example-customized-download.png" alt="gated content example - customized report" width="720" height="551" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63782" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/gated-content-example-customized-download.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/gated-content-example-customized-download-480x367.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>

<p>When the pandemic shut down entire cities, millions of employees transitioned to remote work overnight. Many people didn’t even have time to get their office plants or project notes before they had to set up a home office and get to work. Nine months after the shift to remote and 42 percent of the American workforce remains fully remote, according to <a href="https://www.upwork.com/press/releases/economist-report-future-workforce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upwork’s Future Workforce</a> survey.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/small-business-productivity-tools-remote_0-1.png" alt="Small business productivity tools—chart showing 57% of teams are working remote at least part of the time" width="800" height="439" /></div>
<p>The good news is, we adapted and remote work is getting easier as people learn how they can make it successful. The same Upwork survey found that 68 percent of hiring managers agree that work is going more smoothly now than when the pandemic started.</p>
<p>One reason for this is that teams have adopted tools to get work done. But not just any tools, but the right tools needed to make their organization thrive. To make sure you have what you need to make remote work work for you, we’re sharing our top tool choices.</p>
<p>For ease of organization, these tools have been broken down into three separate sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managing distractions while working</li>
<li>Improving project management</li>
<li>Increasing collaboration</li>
</ul>
<p>Do an audit of your current toolset and determine what needs to go, what can stay, and what you need to add to make sure your team is working efficiently and effectively.</p>
<h2>Productivity tools for managing distractions</h2>
<p>One of the most challenging parts of working from home is managing all the distractions that come with it. No longer are phone notifications and talkative coworkers your only concern. Now you have a pile of dishes in the sink, laundry to be done and a couch that looks awfully comfortable. Use these tools to limit distractions and boost <a href="/blog/ws/2014/11/04/productivity-for-content-marketers">productivity</a>.</p>
<h3>1. Freedom</h3>
<p>From checking website analytics to cruising social media, it can be hard to meet deadlines when you’re pulled away from your “focus zone,” every five minutes. With the <a href="https://freedom.to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freedom</a> app, you can block websites, alerts, and other digital distractions so your attention stays on your current project.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/small-business-productivity-tools-freedom-1.png" alt="small business productivity tools-freedom" width="800" height="459" /></div>
<p>This app goes a step above the rest because it blocks sites on multiple devices, so you won’t be able to pick up your phone and scroll to get around the block on your desktop.</p>
<p>Make sure your teammates know that you’re entering a “distraction-free zone,” so they understand why you aren’t responding to their messages.</p>
<h3>2. Calendly</h3>
<p><a href="https://calendly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calendly</a> is a must-have tool for small business owners and marketers because it eliminates the distraction of scheduling <a href="/blog/ws/2019/01/03/brainstorming-techniques">meetings</a> and booking time to work. With this app, you can set up events from your existing calendar and block out times when you’re busy. If someone wants to set a meeting, they can reserve a time in Calendly without having to submit a calendar request via email—or having to go back and forth on a time that works for both of you.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/small-business-productivity-tools-calendly-1.png" alt="Small business productivity tools-calendly" width="800" height="532" /></div>
<p>This tool is particularly useful because of its buffers. Users can create buffer times in between meetings, like 10-minute breaks for travel time or stretching and even set up barriers for last-minute meetings. This prevents people from packing your day or adding something to your schedule with only an hour’s notice.</p>
<h3>3. Noisli</h3>
<p>Whether you need to block out distracting sounds, increase your focus or wind down after a stressful period, <a href="https://www.noisli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Noisli</a> can help. This isn’t your average white noise generator, though. You can mix sounds to create the perfect working environment where you can be your most <a href="/blog/ws/2015/03/26/productivity-tools">productive</a> self.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/small-buisness-productivity-tools-noisli-1.png" alt="small business productivity tools noisli" width="800" height="376" /></div>
<p>If you work in a busy household with children or roommates, all the hustle and bustle can be distracting. Turn on Noisli to get into your zone of focus quickly and easily.</p>
<h3>4. Pushbullet</h3>
<p>Throughout the day, you likely switch back and forth between devices. From computer to iPad to smartphone; from desktop to smartphone to tablet. If you’re always bouncing around, you’re setting yourself up for a day of distracting transitions that make it harder to get back into the project you’re working on. Wouldn’t things be so much easier, and less distracting, if all your devices were connected as one? That’s exactly why you need <a href="https://www.pushbullet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pushbullet</a>.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/small-business-productivity-tools-pushbullet-1.png" alt="small business productivity tools pushbullet" width="800" height="434" /></div>
<p>You can send text messages from your computer, see your phone’s notification on your tablet, and share links and files instantly without having to email them to yourself. These are just a few of the conveniences Pushbullet provides. For the multi-device worker, this is a must-have tool.</p>
<h3>5. 1Password</h3>
<p>Passwords need to be safe—and to be safe, the need to be different and unique for every account.  But it quickly becomes impossible to remember them all, and if you write them down, that’s not safe either. This is especially important when using free wi-fi at a coffee shop or library rather than your secure router at home or in the office.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/small-business-productivity-tools-1password-1.png" alt="Small business productivity tools-1password" width="800" height="378" /></div>
<p><a href="https://1password.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1Password</a> solves this problem by locking all of your passwords safely away where no one can get to them except you. And when you need to sign into something? All you need to remember is one master password and you’re in.</p>
<h3>6. Sleep Cycle alarm clock</h3>
<p>Have you ever woken up in a mental fog, with a pounding headache, and somehow more exhausted than when you went to bed? This unpleasant trio is often the result of waking in the middle (or the deepest part) of a sleep cycle.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/small-business-productivity-tools-sleep-cycle-alarm-clock-1.png" alt="Small business productivity tools sleep cycle alarm clock" width="800" height="359" /></div>
<p>You’re much more likely to awake refreshed if you get enough rest each night and wake during the lightest phase of your natural sleep cycle. But how do you know when you’re in this lightest phase? <a href="https://www.sleepcycle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sleep Cycle</a> alarm clock app will analyze your sleep and automatically wake you at the best time. Instead of being distracted by a foggy brain or the temptation to take a nap, you’ll feel refreshed and productive all day.</p>
<h2>The best productivity tools for project management</h2>
<p>Great project management is more important than ever with a distributed team. It’s critical that everyone stays on the same page, making all the necessary deadlines and being able to share updates and data with the entire group often. These project management tools ensure that your team can do just that.</p>
<h3>7. Scoro</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.scoro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scoro</a> is an all-in-one business management software. Its aim is to streamline workflows, taking routine tasks off your hands so that you have more time to focus on what’s important—<a href="/blog/ws/2016/04/19/customer-marketing-strategies">pleasing your customers</a>. With Scoro, you can easily track time and manage your team, as well as create and send invoices.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/small-business-productivity-tools-scoro-1.png" alt="Small business productivity tools-scoro" width="800" height="457" /></div>
<p>The team dashboard is one of the most helpful features. It includes everything you need to check in on projects at a glance, including <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/07/agency-profitability-metrics">profit</a>, budget updates, project steps, and more. With all of this information available to the entire team in real-time, it’s easier to stay on track and, more importantly, on budget.</p>
<h3>8. Cyfe by Traject</h3>
<p>You likely use a variety of tools, platforms, and services to manage your <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business">social media marketing</a>, analytics, sales, support, and so on. Instead of managing each one independently, <a href="https://www.cyfe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cyfe</a> allows your marketing team to manage it all together, in one place. Integrations include Freshbooks, Alexa, Basecamp, Instagram, and more.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/small-business-productivity-tools-cyfe-1.png" alt="Small business productivity tools-cyfe" width="800" height="457" /></div>
<p>Data from those tools is pulled into Cyfe in real-time, allowing you to check-in and <a href="/blog/ws/2020/12/17/content-marketing-kpis">get a clear picture of what’s happening</a> at any moment—no matter where you are and what tools each team member has individual access to. When used in conjunction with historical data for your small business, you can make informed decisions more easily while ensuring the security of your various marketing accounts.</p>
<h3>9. Betterteam</h3>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2020/11/30/remote-startup-management">Hiring</a> can be a time-consuming, exhausting process. It takes a lot of time and effort to post jobs on several sites, weed out candidates that aren’t qualified, and conduct interviews. Simplifying even one part of that process would be a major relief for everyone involved.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/small-business-productivity-tools-betterteam-1.png" alt="Small business productivity tools betterteam" width="800" height="457" /></div>
<p><a href="https://www.betterteam.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Betterteam</a> streamlines the first stage of this process: posting open positions. In just minutes, you can post your jobs to 100+ popular job sites, likely much more than you could do manually. Not only will you save tons of time, but you also get far more exposure and access to thousands of qualified people. The value of <a href="/blog/ws/2017/06/16/working-remotely">working remotely</a> is being able to cast a wider net—so make sure you’re casting it.</p>
<h3>10. GoCo</h3>
<p>GoCo’s platform wraps HR management, benefits, and payroll into one easy-to-use tool, allowing you to keep all of your employees’ information organized in one place. In addition, it ensures that you’re always in compliance with laws and can sync the tool with your payroll system so there are no concerns about regulation compliance. Finally, it gives employees an easy way to apply for benefits, request time off and so on so there’s less emailing back and forth about who needs what.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/small-business-productivity-tools-goco-1.png" alt="Small business productivity tools goco" width="800" height="460" /></div>
<p><a href="https://www.goco.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoCo</a> can be integrated with several of your favorite apps including <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/02/linkedin-website-demographics">Linkedin</a>, Slack, Quickbooks, Lyft, Uber, and Paychex, making it easy to track every HR detail in one place.</p>
<h3>11. Filestage</h3>
<p>If projects often get caught up in the editing and approval process, with too many team leaders offering feedback and creating countless new drafts, it’s time for a new workflow. <a href="https://filestage.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Filestage</a> is a much-needed tool for teams that often collaborate in this way. It’s an all-in-one proofing software where creatives can submit their work and management can make comments and edit requests in one space. Filestage can handle videos, <a href="/blog/ws/2020/12/22/visual-marketing-tools">images</a>, documents, and audio files, making it ideal for any creative project you have.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/small-business-productivity-tools-filestage-1.png" alt="Small business productivity tools filestage" width="800" height="405" /></div>
<p>This tool was also recommended in our post on the <a href="/blog/ws/2020/12/29/remote-collaboration-tools-2021">best remote collaboration tools</a> for the new year.</p>
<h2>Best tools for productive collaboration</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/12/cross-functional-collaboration">Cross-functional collaboration</a> still reigns supreme in the workplace, but it can be challenging to keep it productive without getting everyone in a room together. Don’t let this key element of your business fall to the wayside with remote work. Instead, keep collaboration fresh and easy with these key tools.</p>
<h3>12. Connecteam</h3>
<p>As your remote team grows, your employees might not have time to get to know their new peers or connect with coworkers in the same way they used to socially. This is where <a href="https://connecteam.com/employee-communication-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Connecteam</a> comes in. This app serves as an employee intranet helping your workers connect with each other for improved collaboration.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/small-business-productivity-tools-connecteam_0-1.png" alt="Small business productivity tools connecteam" width="800" height="448" /></div>
<p>Employees can look up other team members in the organization to collaborate, managers can push messages to the whole staff, and everyone can take surveys and polls to get an idea for what the company hivemind is thinking. This is a fun tool if you’ve hired more staff during the <a href="/blog/ws/2020/03/13/covid-19-response">COVID-19 pandemic</a> and want these remote workers to get to know their peers.</p>
<h3>13. Hubgets</h3>
<p>In August 2020, the team at <a href="https://frontapp.com/blog/what-we-learned-from-analyzing-5000-email-inboxes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frontpage</a> released a survey that found our professional inboxes are more cluttered than our personal accounts. In fact, roughly 10 percent of people receive more than 100 emails per day, totaling one email every six minutes during business hours. Without clear organization, these messages get lost or jumbled easily, slowing down projects for people who need replies.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/small-business-productivity-tools-hubgets_0-1.png" alt="Small business productivity tools hubgets" width="800" height="415" /></div>
<p><a href="https://www.hubgets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubgets</a> works to break through the email dependency with clear project management tools and improved collaboration features. With this tool, teams can focus on singular projects and communicate in real-time rather than sending countless email threads. This allows you to log out of your inbox and focus on work, rather than getting distracted by endless email notifications and never-ending email threads.</p>
<h3>14. Nextiva</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.nextiva.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nextiva</a> boosts your productivity by making it <a href="/blog/ws/2020/05/21/client-communication-during-covid-19">easier to communicate</a> and work through projects effectively. Teams can communicate via phone, text, video, or email messaging and, most importantly, keep all of this communication in one place. No more scrolling through endless texts or searching vague email terms to find a missing thread. Your communication trail is all in one place.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/small-business-productivity-tools-nextiva-1.png" alt="Small business productivity tools nextiva" width="800" height="397" /></div>
<p>Nextiva can be a lifesaver for remote teams that use multiple communication channels to collaborate, no matter which platforms you prefer.</p>
<h3>15. Kayako</h3>
<p>What’s one of the best ways to <a href="/blog/ws/2016/11/10/customer-loyalty">build customer loyalty</a>? Providing timely and personalized support. Support ticketing tool, <a href="https://www.kayako.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kayako</a>, can help you do this, even providing a human live chat experience when you’re not online.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/small-business-productivity-tools-kayako_0-1.png" alt="Small business productivity tools kayako" width="800" height="387" /></div>
<p>Unlike other similar tools, Kayako unifies all of your support channels including email, social media, and live chat into one team dashboard. There’s even an internal helpdesk for your employees, making everyone’s job easier and their output more effective.</p>
<h3>16. Workflowy</h3>
<p>Leave behind the sticky notes, notepads, and scraps of paper. Instead, keep all your shared to-do lists in <a href="https://workflowy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workflowy</a>, where everyone on the team can compile and check off tasks in one place. If you’re worried that this would make for a long, messy list, think again.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/small-business-productivity-tools-workflowy-1.png" alt="Small business productivity tools workflowy" width="800" height="430" /></div>
<p>A few select formatting options make it easy to differentiate lists of different topics so they can be found at a glance. The same can be said of the #tags feature, which makes organizing and collaborating on lists with other team members easy and organized. While it is a minimalistic app, it’s one of the most powerful apps you could have in your collaboration arsenal.</p>
<h3>17. Traackr</h3>
<p>If you use <a href="/blog/ws/2015/02/26/influencer-marketing">influencers for your marketing,</a> it’s imperative that everyone on the marketing team has access to data about which ones are driving the best campaigns and which ones are falling short. <a href="https://www.traackr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Traackr</a> makes it possible for everyone to follow this data and shoulder the task of managing influencers. It also makes it easier for managers to check in at any time and keep tabs on who is performing.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/small-business-productivity-tools-traackr-1.png" alt="Small business productivity tools traackr" width="800" height="354" /></div>
<p>You can also use this tool to <a href="/blog/ws/2013/06/21/social-media-influence">find the best influencers</a> and compare what they can offer to budget, results, and benchmarks that help you make the right decisions as a team.</p>
<h2>Find the right productivity tools for your team</h2>
<p>The right tools are the ones that solve key problems and that your team will actually use. If you, as a leader, try to introduce unnecessary or unpopular tools, you risk disrupting workflows that already work and driving down productivity. Focus on finding tools you know your team needs and introduce them over time, allowing everyone the opportunity to integrate and provide feedback. With everyone working productively and collaboratively, you can focus on doing what you need to do: running the team and meeting deadlines. Here&#8217;s a list of the 17 <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-productivity-tools">productivity tools</a> we provided in this post:</p>

<p>If you want to stay competitive in your industry, you need to evaluate your SEO and PPC strategy and create a plan that ensures you’ll stand out from competitors once and for all. Start by evaluating these seven foundational elements of your current marketing plan, each of which will move the needle for your visibility efforts.</p>
<h2>How can you stand out from your competitors on Google?</h2>
<p>Google&#8217;s search engine results pages are filled with opportunities to stand out, in various forms. There are ads, organic results, local results, images, shopping results, and more. Below are some attainable ways to stand out above your competitors on the search platform.</p>
<h3>1. Make killer Google Search ads</h3>
<p>There are a lot of ways to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/21/adwords-ads">produce awesome Google ads</a> that stand out from your competitors. Do your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-research">keyword research</a>, test out ad variations (maybe you focus on keywords in one headline, and creativity or storytelling in another), make use of ad extensions, use customer feedback for ad copy, make your ads locally focused, and the list goes on. For more help with coming up with effective Google ads, check out the tips in these posts on the following:</p>

</div>
<h3>2. Try running Google Display ads</h3>
<p>To stand out on Google with display advertising, one strategy is to target keywords that perform best in your Search ads, if you are running them. You may also want to look at top-performing pieces of organic content to get a feel for what resonates best with your audience. Also, make sure your ads are being served on the right sites. You can get a feel for which sites would be best by checking out your referral traffic in Google Analytics.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important element to pay attention to is your creative design. If you’re uploading your own design, make sure that you create different sizes of the ad to fit various placements and devices. If you are using responsive display ads, make sure you focus on headlines. While you will be asked to provide a short headline (25 characters), a long headline (90 characters), a description (90 characters), and your business name (25 characters), Google will never run both headlines at the same time and sometimes excludes the description, so make sure both your short and long headlines are enough on their own.<a href="/blog/ws/2015/02/02/ppc-ad-headlines"> For more help with headlines, check out this post</a>.</p>

<h3>3. Optimize your landing pages</h3>
<p>Review your key landing pages to make sure the content is optimized. The goal is to <a href="https://jessicathiefels.com/blog/increase-organic-traffic-revenue-driving-pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase organic traffic to your revenue-generating pages</a> so you get more eyes on the pages that really matter. The more relevant eyes you get on your pages, the better your traffic. The better your traffic, the more engagement you&#8217;ll get on your pages. The more engagement, the higher you will rank and stand out on Google.</p>
<p>To optimize your landing pages,  the first question you have to ask is: do we have a primary keyword for this page? More importantly, is it sprinkled throughout the page in all the right places? For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>In your H1 tag</li>
<li>In at least one alt tag</li>
<li>In at least one H2 tag</li>
<li>In the URL</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>Don’t forget to add high-quality external links, relevant internal links, images, and rich media. With these simple changes, you can start ranking your landing pages, allowing you to drive more traffic to the pages that matter most.</p>
<h3>4. Create (and maintain) your Google Business Profile</h3>
<p>Your Google Business Profile is packed with information to help you stand out, but what carries the most clout is reviews. Get your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/16/get-more-google-reviews">reviews</a> right in search with a Google My Business account. With an account (which is free), you can manage and respond to reviews, which encourages even more of them. Your responses can also reveal a lot about your business brand and values—and with <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/research/local-consumer-review-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">96%</a> of customers reading a business&#8217;s responses to reviews, you should definitely take advantage of this opportunity to stand out. If you&#8217;re still not convinced, consider these stats from BrightLocal&#8217;s <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/research/local-consumer-review-survey/">2020 Local Consumer Review Survey</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>93% of consumers used the internet to find a local business in the last year.</li>
<li>87% of consumers read online reviews for local businesses in 2020.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you haven’t already <a href="/blog/ws/2020/06/10/create-google-my-business-account">claimed your address and set up your Google My Business account</a>, make that a priority now. You can share updated photos of your business and respond to reviews and questions from customers. Check out our tips on how to <a href="/blog/ws/2020/06/03/google-my-business-optimization">optimize your profile</a> so you can set your business apart from your competitors in local search.</p>

<h3>5. Leverage Google snippets</h3>
<p>Rich snippets refer to the various types of results that Google includes in the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/19/get-on-first-page-google">search engine results pages</a> (SERPs). While a standard snippet will include a standard meta description, a rich snippet will answer a user’s question or show a star rating, encouraging them to click on the link. As such, rich snippets provide a better search experience and increase the number of <a href="/blog/ws/2016/10/13/organic-seo-ctr-infographic">clicks to your website</a>. To create rich snippets for your site, you need to contain particular information in the form of Structured Data on your website. Structured Data is a way of classifying information on your pages so that Google knows to pull that information up for particular searches.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>Google also has the <a href="/blog/ws/2015/10/13/google-answer-box">Featured Snippet</a>, otherwise known as “Position Zero.” The featured snippet is a box that shows up organically to highlight the best answer for users. Some pointers for creating Feature Snippet-friendly content include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Target specific queries (&#8220;free ways to get on the first page of Google,&#8221; for example)</li>
<li>Make answers explicit in your content—use bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
<li>Look at the &#8220;Related searches&#8221; and &#8220;People also ask&#8221; sections and target those keywords in the same article. Thi swill help strengthen your signals to Google that you have the best information for that query.</li>
</ul>
