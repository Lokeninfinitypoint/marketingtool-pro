]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Local SEO is essential to smaller businesses that operate on a regional, as opposed to a national, level. While national SEO focuses more on ranking in searches across the country, local SEO prioritizes appearing on SERPs in a specific location. This strategy relies on marketing your brand, products, and services to local leads and customers.</p>
<p><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/12/27/eleven-seo-tips-for-local-search-optimization">Optimizing your local SEO</a> means more website traffic, leads, and conversions since the strategy is more relevant to your base of local customers. Think of this focused strategy as a way to help you compete more effectively against larger national brands that have unlimited resources to spend. By focusing on specific local-SEO to-dos, you can neutralize the advantage of bigger brands that routinely optimize for broader keywords and rely on brand recognition, instead of value propositions, to bring in traffic.</span></p>
<p>Further, <a href="https://www.reviewtrackers.com/local-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">35% of all search traffic is local</a> according to an estimate in a 2017 ReviewTrackers’ study. Without local SEO, your business could be losing out on a significant amount of traffic.</p>
<p>Here are the top 10 ways you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/13/local-search-marketing">make your local SEO successful</a>.</p>
<h2>1. Create a Google Business Profile</h2>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2020/06/10/create-google-my-business-account">Optimizing your Google listing</a> (aka your Business Profile) is perhaps the most effective way to <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/02/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps">rank higher on Google Maps</a> as well as gain visibility in Google Search local results. In order to get access to your Business Profile to make these optimizations, however, you need a <a href="/blog/ws/2020/06/08/what-is-google-my-business">Google My Business account</a> associated with that profile. Once you provide all of the requested information in your Google Business account dashboard, all of that information will be added to your Business Profile, which appears in Google Search local results, the Google Search Knowledge Panel, and Google Maps.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/local-seo-bakery-google-my-business-profile.jpg" alt="local SEO Google My Business profile" width="670" height="611" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_ca/business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image from Google My Business</a></span></em></p>
<p>To optimize your Business Profile on Google, ensure that you:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2020/06/10/create-google-my-business-account">Create a Google Business account</a> and verify ownership of the business</li>
<li>Provide accurate and up-to-date information</li>
<li>Include your logo, hours of operation, acceptable payment methods, the product or service you sell, and plenty of images</li>
<li>Encourage your customers to review your business online</li>
<li>Respond sincerely to customer reviews</li>
<li>Publish posts (announcing products, events, and special offers) to your Business Profile using the Google My Business dashboard.</li>
</ul>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4cd.png" alt="📍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Are your listings optimized for local search?</strong></p>
<p>Find out with our<strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/free-business-listings-grader?cid=Web_WS_InContentTextLink_Freemium_Listings&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free Business Listings Grader</a>!</strong></p></div></div>
<h2>2. Get Regular Reviews from Happy Customers</h2>
<p>Getting your customers to write glowing reviews for your business doesn’t just optimize your Google My Business presence; it also encourages more local customers to buy from you. BrightLocal’s 2017 Local Consumer Review Survey reveals that <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/learn/local-consumer-review-survey/?SSAID=314743&amp;SSCID=91k2_m1sad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">85% of customers believe online reviews as much as personal recommendations</a>.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/local-seo-yelp-review.jpg" alt="local SEO Yelp! review" width="1320" height="464" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.yola.com/blog/6-ways-to-get-google-and-yelp-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image from Yola</a></span></em></p>
<p>Here are some tips to encourage customers to leave reviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask for a review in person after the close of a sale</li>
<li>Send a post-purchase email or text asking customers to write a review (but only after you’ve screened them via an internal survey to ensure you’re not approaching dissatisfied customers)</li>
<li>Respond to existing reviews in a professional way, thanking reviewers and addressing complaints in not-so-favorable reviews</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Google says <a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/3474122?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s okay to ask your customers for reviews</a> while Yelp <a href="https://www.yelp-support.com/article/Don-t-Ask-for-Reviews?l=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actively discourages it</a>.</p>
<h2>3. Optimize for Voice Search</h2>
<p><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/04/10/voice-search-statistics-2018">Voice search</a> will grow rapidly in the coming years. Therefore, in <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/seo/">local SEO</a>, it’s vital to optimize for how people ask questions when they speak into devices, as opposed to how they type out their searches.</span></p>
<p>Essentially, your customers use more long-tail keywords when doing <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/08/20/hey-google-how-do-i-optimize-for-voice-search/#9b9cb8e38000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voice searches</a> compared with regular search. Because of this, you’ll also have to adjust the <a href="https://localiq.com/products/search-engine-optimization/">SEO</a> of your content to fit the more conversational tone of someone speaking. For example, you’ll want to account for the traditional question starters (who, what, when, where, why and how).</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/local-seo-voice-search.jpg" alt="local SEO voice search" width="810" height="540" /></div>
<p>It’s also crucial to consider user intent when <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/14/google-voice-search">optimizing for voice</a>, as these searches are most often performed when the user needs a specific piece of information. If they’re baking and ask Alexa to convert tablespoons to cups, they’re expecting a quick and useful answer. If a potential customer uses voice search to ask what your business’s hours are, this information should also be readily available</p>
<h2>4. Create Content Based on Local News Stories or Events</h2>
<p>There’s nothing quite like authoring content that speaks or relates directly to a local issue to grab your local customers’ attention.</p>
<p>Some strategies include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing blog posts around local news stories, activities, or events</li>
<li>Creating videos about local charities or causes that your business supports</li>
<li>Setting up location-specific webpages on your website with high-quality local content if you serve different parts of a region
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/local-seo-voice-search-newspaper.jpg" alt="local SEO voice search" width="811" height="541" /></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN"><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/F7n6gixbJK0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image from Keenan Constance</a></span></em></p>
<p>Let’s say you’re a local <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/16/real-estate-marketing">real estate business</a>. You can create different pages, one for each of your locations, where you can feature hyperlocal content around news events or changes in the local real-estate market. This strategy could also help you get ranked for each specific location.</p>
<h2>5. Optimize Your Website for Mobile</h2>
<p>A 2018 Stone Temple study that looked at 2017’s mobile vs. desktop trends found that <a href="https://www.stonetemple.com/mobile-vs-desktop-usage-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the shift to mobile is occurring faster than expected</a>. Mobile visits to websites grew from 57% in 2016 to 63% in 2017, and the overall visits to websites from desktop shrunk from 43% in 2016 to just 37% in 2017.</p>
<p>Another 2017 study from Acquisio determined that traffic from local searches can be especially lucrative, with a remarkable <a href="https://www.acquisio.com/blog/local/75-local-searches-store-visits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">75% of all mobile searches that exhibit local intent actually producing in-store, offline visits within 24 hours</a>.</p>
<p>This confirms that you have to optimize your website for mobile to be a player in local SEO (and, really, for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/28/technical-seo">good SEO</a> period).</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/local-seo-search_0.jpg" alt="local SEO search" width="945" height="630" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN"><a href="http://xezxeh_fieu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image from Yura Fresh</a></span></em></p>
<p>Here are some tips to achieve this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure your website loads quickly (no more than three seconds)</li>
<li>Use bigger fonts that are easy to read</li>
<li>Use images and copy sparingly, conveying only the information you need (no room for filler on a mobile screen!)</li>
<li>Ensure intuitive UI for great UX</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. Hone in on Local Keywords</h2>
<p>Your keywords should be relevant to local customers. It only makes sense, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>Google’s own <a href="https://ads.google.com/intl/en_ca/home/tools/keyword-planner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keyword Planner</a> lets you filter keyword searches based on location so you get an idea of the popular search terms for a given region. This lets you create a list of locally relevant keywords to target. Once you have them, they should make appearances in your site’s meta content, copy, and URLs.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/local-seo-google-keyword-planner.jpg" alt="local SEO Google keyword planner" width="892" height="581" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: left;"><em><span lang="EN"><a href="https://serps.com/library/guide-google-keyword-planner-seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image from Serps</a></span></em></p>
<p>Also, include mentions of region-specific landmarks and hotspots in your content. For instance, if your local restaurant serves dinner in downtown Seattle, include references to “dining by the Space Needle” or “just steps from the Space Needle” on your site.</p>

<h2>7. Use Location Pages or a Location-Specific “About Us” Page</h2>
<p>Location pages are a must if your business has more than one location in an area. These pages need to provide the following, at a minimum:</p>
<ul>
<li>Store hours</li>
<li>Name, address, and phone number</li>
<li>Individualized descriptions</li>
<li>Testimonials</li>
<li>Promotions</li>
<li>Parking availability</li>
<li><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/12/03/google-maps-marketing">Google Maps</a> attached to each location page</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Take care when you have multiple locations, because you need to create unique content for each page.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/local-seo-location-based-about-us-page.jpg" alt="local SEO location-based &quot;About Us&quot; page" width="1067" height="642" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/optimize-local-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image from Crazy Egg</a></span></em></p>
<p>If you only have one location, creating an “About Us” page that focuses on local, relevant information is essential. For example, if you have a florist shop, your “About Us” page is the perfect spot to mention your shop’s involvement in supplying the flowers for any parades in your town or city.</p>
<h2>8. Take Advantage of Online Business Directories</h2>
<p>Online business directories are websites like Yelp, Foursquare, MapQuest, and YellowPages, just to name a few. There are <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/10322/the-ultimate-list-50-local-business-directories.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many more</a>.</p>
<p>Not only will getting your business name, address, and phone number into these directories help visibility, but it’ll also boost your local SEO.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/local-seo-foursquare.jpg" alt="local SEO foursquare" width="1565" height="640" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/news/foursquare-launches-places-api-start-ups/2018/04/12">Image from ProgrammableWeb</a></span></em></p>
<p>Your <a href="https://localiq.com/products/listings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company listing</a> should include the following basics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business name <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/08/business-name-ideas">(creative business name ideas here!)</a></li>
<li>Address and phone number</li>
<li>A backlink to your website</li>
<li>A thorough description of your business</li>
</ul>
<p>These should be consistent across all directories.</p>
<h2>9. Focus on Link Signals (Get High-Quality Backlinks)</h2>
<p>According to Moz’s 2017 Local Search Ranking Factors study, <a href="https://moz.com/local-search-ranking-factors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link signals are the first- and second-most important factors</a> for local pack (or snack pack) results and for localized organic results, respectively. Link signals are backlinks pointing to your site.</p>
<p>It’s vital to get links to boost your local SEO, but their quality is important.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/local-seo-serp.jpg" alt="Local SEO SERP" width="753" height="704" /></div>
<p>Here are some tips on getting high-quality <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2010/04/01/build-amazing-backlinks">backlinks</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create high-quality content on your site so others want to link to your content</li>
<li>Guest blog on reputable sites with a high domain authority</li>
<li>Engage with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/03/21/social-media-influencers">local influencers on social media</a> or by email to get them to link back to you</li>
</ul>
<h2>10. Create a Dedicated Webpage for Each Product/Service You Offer</h2>
<p>While it can be tempting to just lump all of your products or services together in one big page, resist doing so. Instead, dedicate one page to each unique product or service you offer.</p>
<p>Your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/seo/whats-difference-between-organic-seo-and-local-seo">local SEO</a> juice isn’t as powerful if you lump everything into one page because search engines tend not to see your brand as an authority in one specific area. This lowers your ranking possibilities.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/local-seo-dental-marketing.jpg" alt="Local SEO dental marekting" width="1352" height="899" /></div>
<p>If you’re a business without different products or services, but have various locations, simply utilize location-based copy for each page. For instance, “<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/11/30/dental-marketing-ideas">dental marketing</a>” will become “New York dental marketing” or “Buffalo <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/31/facebook-ads-for-dentists">dental marketing</a>.”</p>
<h2>Local SEO: More Important Than Ever</h2>
<p>SEO changes quite rapidly. You never know when Google will introduce new features on its SERPs for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/01/google-local-search-trends">local searches,</a> but you can count on these changes coming. That’s why it’s essential to always stay on top of local SEO. By implementing these 10 actionable items, you will ensure that your business doesn’t just take advantage of lucrative local searches but also has a solid foundation when new SEO features are introduced. And if you don&#8217;t have the bandwidth to make these adjustments, you may want to try a <a href="https://localiq.com/localiq-grader">local seo audit</a>, or look into <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/21/small-business-seo-services">a small business SEO service provider.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number of businesses that use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/29/best-facebook-ads">Facebook for ads</a> and Business Pages is truly astounding. A whopping <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/facebook-stats-for-marketers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">93% of marketers</a> that use social media for advertising run Facebook ads, making it by far the most popular platform for paid social.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="5c209526-651b-4852-9fde-9b9f776ce277" data-langcode="en">

</div>
<p>With all that competition, it’s imperative that business owners and their marketing departments maximize their use of Facebook. One of the most effective techniques aimed at making this happen is to learn how to master the science of writing outstanding <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/02/ppc-ad-headlines">ad headlines</a>.</p>
<p>Did you know that most people only really read headlines? It’s true! Whether we’re talking about an ad, a landing page, or a news article, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/03/19/americans-read-headlines-and-not-much-else/?utm_term=.6160711ceb47" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many of us only read headlines</a>. While these stats may be demoralizing to some marketers, it means that <strong>you <em>have</em> to make your ad headlines on Facebook count</strong>.</p>
<p>When your brand is competing with such a great number of others on Facebook, you have to distinguish yourself and fast. The headline is where you have the best chance of doing so.</p>
<p>Today we’re sharing a collection of five tried and tested tips for writing effective Facebook ad headlines to help you increase conversions and engagement.</p>
<h2>1. Aim for the Perfect 5-Word Ad Headline</h2>
<p>When it comes to your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/23/facebook-ad-examples">Facebook ad</a> headlines, the research consistently shows that concision is the way to more engagement as measured by all-important factors like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comments</li>
<li>Shares</li>
<li>Likes</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t have unlimited space for your headline—<a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/facebook-ad-specs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depending on the ad type</a>, you only have between 25 and 45 characters to play with. So you need to figure out how to make the most of your message in a small amount of space.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://adespresso.com/blog/we-analyzed-37259-facebook-ads-and-heres-what-we-learned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study by AdEspresso</a>, five words has been the perfect number for a Facebook ad headline for four years running.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="70e8e18a-46a7-4fd3-9008-6687fe868ddb" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>A five-word headline is often catchy and definitely gets right to the point. See this example from Facebook itself, which AdEspresso says is “the perfect sponsored post”:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="f251b06c-6ea3-47ca-b630-d529eed2fae4" data-langcode="en">

<h3>Putting it into action</h3>
<p>Take a look at your existing ad headlines (especially the under-performing ones) and see if you can test a version of each headline that’s just five words. For example, “Get a Great Doctor to You” (a real Facebook ad headline from the startup Heal) could become “Find Your Perfect Doctor Now.”</p>
<h2>2. Start Your Facebook Ad Headlines with Numbers</h2>
<p>Instead of using catchy headlines for the sake of sounding cute, go where the evidence leads you. In this case, the research confirms quite powerfully that starting your headlines with numbers gives the best results.</p>
<p>Conductor, an SEO technology company, looked at which types of headlines resonated the most with their study subjects. They had their participants look at headline types that included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Questions</li>
<li>How-tos</li>
<li>Standard (no particular angle)</li>
<li>Addressing the reader with “you”</li>
<li>Numbers-based</li>
</ul>
<p>The results showed that <a href="https://moz.com/blog/5-data-insights-into-the-headlines-readers-click" target="_blank" rel="noopener">headlines that started with numbers resonated most with people</a>, to the tune of 36% of all participants. Compare this to the second-place finisher (reader-addressing), which only found favor with 21% of people.</p>
<p>That begs the question, what number should you start your ad headlines with? Are all numbers created equally? No, they’re not, as it turns out.</p>

<p>Another piece of research, this one from infographic-maker Venngage, shows that <a href="https://venngage.com/blog/blog-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a perfect 10 is the best number to use in headlines</a>. Their study looked at 121,333 articles to determine how many social shares those articles with different-numbered headlines received. Articles with 10 in the headline received 1046 shares while those with five came in second at 972.</p>
<p>The study gets more interesting when it breaks down these results across social networks, including Facebook. Even there, this favoritism for 10 holds true: Headlines with the number 10 in them got 622 shares on Facebook, again followed by the number five at 396 shares.</p>
<h3>Putting it into action</h3>
<p>While this study looked at Facebook social sharing in blog titles, we can apply this to ad headlines, too, to get some direction about what types of ad headlines will perform the best. Try using numbers in the headlines for your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/24/facebook-lead-ads">Facebook lead ads</a>, e.g. “10 Ways to Improve Client Retention,” or in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/21/facebook-carousel-ads">carousel ads</a>, e.g. “5 Dresses that Go from Summer to Fall.”</p>
<h2>3. Use Emotional Words in Your Facebook Ad Headlines</h2>
<p>Try as we may, most of us still can’t get a grip on our emotions. This also applies to readers of your headlines. While some of us may think we’re rational human beings, the truth is that we’re really emotional—which you can use to your advantage in headline crafting.</p>
<p>Writing in OkDork, CoSchedule’s Founder Garrett Moon conducted an experiment where he analyzed some of the most highly shared headlines at CoSchedule by using something called the <a href="https://www.aminstitute.com/headline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emotional Marketing Value Headline Analyzer</a> or simply the EMVHA for short.</p>
<p>In his experiment, he compared the emotional values of headlines for three data sets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Articles with more than 1000 shares</li>
<li>Articles with 500 shares</li>
<li>Articles with 100 shares</li>
</ul>
<p>The results were telling because they made an indelible link between the emotional value of a headline and the number of shares its article received.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="57f414e0-1531-40bb-a27e-ef7f50119754" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>The articles with more than 1000 shares had <a href="https://okdork.com/we-analyzed-nearly-1-million-headlines-heres-what-we-learned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an average emotional-value score of almost 40</a>. This was much greater than those articles with 500 shares (an emotional-value score of almost 30) and those with 100 shares (a score of close to 20).</p>
<p>This shows that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/11/09/emotional-ads">using emotional words in your headlines</a> increases the engagement level, so if you want more conversions and sales, it’s a good idea to use such words in your ad headlines.</p>
<p>That begs the question, what sorts of emotional words?</p>
<h3>Putting it into action</h3>
<p>To put emotional words in your ad copy, check out our lists!</p>

</ul>
<p>Play around with some of these emotionally charged words in your ad headlines, and keep track of which ones perform the best.</p>
<h2>4. Go Negative…to Get Positive Results</h2>
<p>This one’s a little surprising: Research indicates that using negative words in your headlines produces better results than using positive words! This flies in the face of conventional wisdom, but is likely due to audiences getting sick and tired of the oversaturation of positive-sounding words and feeling distrust about their authenticity.</p>
<p>Outbrain conducted a study where they determined that the presence of <a href="https://www.outbrain.com/help/advertisers/viral-blog-headlines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative words like “worst” and “never” in their headlines received a better response</a> from their audience. Outbrain believed that negative-sounding headlines connect with an audience’s desire to really cut to the chase in an intellectually honest fashion much more efficiently than positive-sounding words that make us feel all warm and fuzzy inside.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="54ea0b0c-49cb-4b41-872c-8597ab47c878" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>When you consider the sheer enormity of content on the web—and how, as a result, most of us only read the headlines in an attempt to save time—this logic makes sense. After all, when you’re faced with so much content, you want to get right down to what’s important.</p>
<h3>Putting it into action</h3>
<p>So, tying this back to your ad headlines on Facebook, try to move away from the cheerful headlines once in a while. Experiment with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/08/positive-vs-negative-ads">negative-sounding words</a> to capitalize on people’s desire to get at the ugly truth. And as always, test instead of assuming you know what will work your audience.</p>
<p>For example, when WordStream advertisers their free Google Ads Grader, they sometimes try out ad headlines with negative phrases like “Stop Wasting Money” and “Fix Your Mistakes in AdWords.” Not exactly feel-good phrases, but they totally work.</p>
<h2>5. Try out Super-Engaging 3-Word Phrases</h2>
<p>On a platform where people’s attention spans are generally short, it’s a wise decision to also use shorter phrases in your headlines. Specific, familiar three-word phrases can work exceptionally well on Facebook. According to the same Buzzsumo study mentioned above, the <a href="http://buzzsumo.com/blog/most-shared-headlines-study/#gs.ibKBHZo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three best-performing phrases</a>, based on engagement, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will make you (almost 9000 engagements)</li>
<li>This is why (4099 engagements)</li>
<li>Can we guess (3199 engagements)</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at the data further, we see that “Will make you” is far and away the clear winner, racking up enormous engagement that’s more than double the second-best phrase, “This is why.”</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="38386fa8-c3bd-42c9-9e88-d1a768995dc0" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>The reason that audiences connect with a phrase like “Will make you” so strongly is twofold. First, it implies that the content will have a direct effect on the reader…perhaps even an emotional one. Second, it is a linking phrase that can be seamlessly inserted in many, different types of headlines.</p>
<h3>Putting it into action</h3>
<p>Now, this study focused on article headlines, but you can absolutely try this tactic in your ad headlines too, and it might even make your Facebook ads seem more native. For example, if you’re writing a lead gen ad for a marketing guide, you could try a headline like “This Free Guide Will Make You a Better Marketer.”</p>
<h2>Facebook Ad Headlines: Part Science, Part Art</h2>
<p>To get more engagement from your Facebook ads—and, therefore, more clicks, leads and sales—you have to look at <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/05/17/how-to-write-great-headlines">writing headlines</a> as a science instead of just an art form. When you analyze and implement what’s been shown to work on Facebook, you greatly increase your chances of getting higher conversions for your brand.</p>
<p>Although you can never predict with certainty what your audience is going to do, you can dramatically raise your chances of connecting with them by testing what you put in front of them on Facebook.</p>
<p>With all this data out there, you have a treasure trove of data to empower you to write more effective ad headlines than ever! But if you&#8217;re not a numbers person, you can always get some inspo from these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/01/headline-examples">88 headline examples.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/25/does-facebook-advertising-work">Facebook advertising</a> is one of the most cost-effective ways to get attention on your brand these days. Not only are they affordable, but the potential reach is huge.</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, though, not many small businesses are getting the most from their Facebook ads! A survey released by website builder Weebly indicated that <a href="https://smallbiztrends.com/2017/01/do-facebook-ads-work.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">62% of small business owners</a> feel their paid ads on Facebook are missing their target. That’s not a very comforting statistic when you consider how many small businesses currently use and advertise on the platform.</p>
<p>The potential is there, however, for small business owners to harness the power of these ads to reach billions of people across the world – and, more importantly, the specific segments of people who would be most likely to become your next customer. While it can be challenging, at first, to get the hang of things, once you do it’s more than worth it.</p>

<h2>Types of Facebook ads</h2>
<p>It’s vital to have an understanding of what you’re working with when getting started with Facebook ads. To that end, let’s start with the different ad types available to you.</p>
<p>There are lots of different <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/07/13/facebook-ad-types-cheatsheet">Facebook ad types</a>. These include:</p>
<ul>

<h2>Facebook ad costs</h2>
<p>Facebook is <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/07/facebook-statistics">outrageously popular for businesses</a>, even <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/04/23/facebook-custom-audience-changes">in the wake of bad press</a> about how it handles your data. Much like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/articles/what-is-google-adwords">the auction for Google ads</a>, there’s a bidding process to determine where your Facebook ad appears and how much you pay per click. You’ll indicate how much you want to hand over for precise actions on any given ad, such as views, conversions, clicks, etc. You can manually adjust it or have Facebook automatically make calculations for you, based on your specifications.</p>
<p>Various factors can affect your Facebook ad costs, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>When your ad campaigns run (time, date, during peak hours when competition is fiercest)</li>
<li>Your specific audience</li>
<li>Your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/09/14/facebook-relevance-score">Relevance Score</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/10/facebook-ad-placements">Ad placement</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/31/facebook-ads-bidding-strategies">Your bidding method</a> (set a bid limit on every unique bid or just set your average bid)</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can probably guess, ad costs therefore can vary quite a bit.</p>
<p>Still, if we look at the averages, we can see some interesting information.</p>
<p>WordStream analyzed hundreds of client accounts to calculate <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/28/facebook-advertising-benchmarks">the average cost per click (CPC) and cost per action (CPA) on Facebook</a> for eighteen different industries. They found that the average across all business types was $1.72 per click and $18.68 per conversion.</p>

<p>These are averages, so yours, based on your unique campaigns, could well be different.</p>

<p>What if you’re outside the US? AdEspresso performed <a href="https://adespresso.com/blog/facebook-ads-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a study</a> where it looked at 2017 data to gauge average ad costs in the U.S. and other areas. Here are the findings, in US dollars:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPC average for all countries &#8211; $0.97</li>
<li>CPC average targeting those 65 and up – more than (Q1) $0.70</li>
<li>CPC average targeting those between 13 and 17 (Q1) = $0.11</li>
<li>CPC average of Instagram ad placement (Q4) &#8211; $1.15</li>
<li>CPC average of Facebook ad placement (Q4) &#8211; $0.50</li>
<li>CPC monthly average &#8211; $0.40</li>
<li>CPC average on Sundays &#8211; $0.40</li>
<li>CPC average on Tuesdays and Thursdays &#8211; $0.50</li>
<li>CPC average of targeting women (Q4) &#8211; $0.64</li>
<li>CPC average of targeting men (Q4) &#8211; $0.50</li>
<li>CPC average of optimizing for link clicks (Q4) &#8211; $0.44</li>
<li>CPC average of optimizing for impressions (Q4) &#8211; $3.79</li>
<li>CPL (cost per like) average for page like campaigns &#8211; $1.08</li>
<li>CPL average targeting those 55 and up (Q4) &#8211; $0.33</li>
<li>CPL average targeting those between 13 and 17 (Q4) &#8211; $0.04</li>
<li>CPL average per month &#8211; $0.12</li>
<li>CPL average per week (Q4) &#8211; $0.14</li>
<li>CPL average cost for women &#8211; $0.16</li>
<li>CPL average cost for men &#8211; $0.11</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at ad costs on the platform helps you get a sense of how much of your budget <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/08/facebook-marketing-ideas">Facebook marketing</a> will eat up. There are, of course, always ways to adjust your targeting and other strategies to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/16/facebook-ad-costs">lower your Facebook ad costs</a>.</p>
<h2>Facebook ad targeting</h2>
<p>Now it’s time to delve into ad targeting. Here’s where you identify your audience and ensure that the ad content you serve up to them actually appeals to them.</p>
<p>How well you’re able to identify your audience will have a meaningful impact on how much you spend on ads, your ROI, and their overall effectiveness. It pays to spend extra time to accurately define whom you’re targeting.</p>

</div>
<p>Facebook lets you go pretty deeply into the traits that define your audience. The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/27/facebook-ad-targeting-options-infographic">extensive targeting options</a> include (but are by no means limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Language</li>
<li>Interests</li>
<li>Behaviors</li>
<li>Life events (such as “recently married”)</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Job title</li>
<li><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/adwords-income-targeting">Income</a></span></li>
<li>Political affiliation</li>
</ul>
<p>These <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/16/psychographics-in-marketing">demographic qualities</a> help you narrow down who will see your ads.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re trying to market to teens on the west coast who speak different languages and are interested in entertainment products, your ad-targeting breakdown might look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Male/female</li>
<li>13 to 19</li>
<li>Washington/Oregon/California</li>
<li>English/Spanish</li>
<li>Entertainment &gt; Live events &gt; concerts</li>
</ul>
<p>Naturally, narrowing down your audience to those more likely to be in market for your offerings gives you better results than just showing your ads to anyone.</p>
<h2>Facebook ad copy &amp; creative</h2>
<p>Facebook advertising is just like any form of advertising: the quality of your ad copy and creative goes a long way toward determining your ROI.</p>

<p>One of the most important skills you can master in advertising is the art of persuasion. Famous psychologist Robert Cialdini’s 1984 book, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Robert-Cialdini/dp/006124189X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1531018888&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=cialdini" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion</a></em>, laid out six unique principles to help marketers convince and convert with greater success. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reciprocation</li>
<li>Social proof</li>
<li>Commitment and consistency</li>
<li>Scarcity</li>
<li>Authority</li>
<li>Liking</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a good idea to infuse your Facebook ads with some of these timeless <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/05/02/persuasive-copywriting-tips">persuasion principles</a>. For that, you have to consider how you can grab your audience’s attention and persuade them to click using various elements of your ads, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The headline (make it short, clear and memorable)</li>
<li>Placement (more on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/08/facebook-ad-placement-optimization">optimizing your Facebook ad placements here</a>)</li>
<li>Images (go with vibrant, eye-catching imagery)</li>
<li><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">Value proposition</a> (what makes you different; the unique value you bring)</span></li>

</ul>
<p>How can you use the principles of persuasion in your Facebook ads? For example, reciprocation can be as straightforward as telling people they can get a free report or ebook if they complete your lead form, while <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/01/10/social-proof-guide">social proof</a> can be something as simple as the number of reactions, shares and comments your ad racks up over the course of its run. More creative, engaging ads tend to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/24/how-to-get-more-likes-on-instagram-ads">get more likes</a> and shares.</p>
<p>Here are some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/29/best-facebook-ads">more tips on writing great Facebook ads</a>.</p>
<h2>Facebook policies</h2>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s ad policies are in place to make sure those in its community feel safe, informed, and respected. There are many common-sense policies, (seemingly) nonsense policies, and nuances to consider when creating your ads. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/16/facebook-ad-not-approved">Learn about the Facebook ad approval process and how to manage disapprovals here</a>.</p>
<h2>Outdoing the competition on Facebook</h2>
<p>It’s always fair game to see what your competitors are doing—and try to best them. After all, if you can deliver better content to your customers, then you attract their attention and more.</p>
<p><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/02/facebook-ad-transparency">Your competition’s Facebook ads</a> are a goldmine of inspiration for what you can do better in your ads. Simply analyze what their ads are doing right and where there’s room for improvement. Then, implement that in your own ads, especially if you’re competing for the same audience.</span></p>

<p>Case in point: Skillshare and Udemy are both <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/19/free-online-marketing-courses">online learning platforms</a> where courses and how-to videos are available.</p>

<h2>Facebook ad reporting</h2>
<p>After you’ve gone through all this trouble to familiarize yourself with how Facebook ads work and hopefully implemented some campaigns, you can’t just expect them to do all the work for you while you sit back. You have to take an active role in your campaigns even when they’re underway, so that you can ensure that you’re getting a good ROI from your ad spend and efforts.</p>
<p>Start monitoring results as soon as you’ve launched one of your ad campaigns. Don’t wait until the campaign has run its course to determine if it was hitting all the right targets or not.</p>
<p>Just head to your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/22/facebook-ads-manager-vs-power-editor">Facebook Ads Manager</a> to look at your ads’ performance in real-time (or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/04/new-facebook-grader">use our free Facebook ads grader</a>!) The beauty of monitoring in real-time is you can also respond in real-time by adjusting underperforming ads. Within the Ads Manager, you can easily edit your ads to tweak them to reach better performance.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="fa8c4c38-6bc1-4631-8351-d69c9129efb3" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If an ad’s engagement level is disappointing, try improving the copy or the visuals used in the ad to make it more stimulating and persuasive</li>
<li>If an ad’s reach is lower than you expected, try to expand the audience in your targeting parameters</li>
<li>If an ad’s conversions aren’t where you want them to be, try improving your call to action by using a more action-oriented verb, or working to improve your Facebook ad landing pages</li>
</ul>
<p>A final note on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-advertising">tracking Facebook performance</a>: Instead of putting an emphasis on vanity metrics like engagement and the like, you should be focused on tracking the metrics that really matter: sales and ROI or return on ad spend (ROAS). If your ad campaign gets you a lot of reach, clicks and conversions, but you’re actually losing money per sale when you figure in all your expenses, then the campaign’s no good.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="82559350-6d50-474b-baff-ce7a9d9e96d4" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>That’s why you need to track ad performance and sales first and foremost during the course of your campaigns.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re a website owner or content marketer, you’ve likely experienced this a few times before: your site traffic suddenly drops, and you’re at a loss to explain it.</p>
<p>There could be many culprits behind this, with a new <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/12/07/google-algorithm-update">Google algorithm</a> change likely first in your mind.</p>
<p>Whenever your organic traffic drops, you go through the usual reactions. There’s <a>panic,</a> confusion, and a sense of uncertainty about how to make things go in the right direction again.</p>
<p>One thing’s for sure, though: it’s best to get to the bottom of it as soon as possible to prevent more ranking, conversion, and sales losses.</p>
<p>In times of crisis, it’s enormously useful to have a contingency plan. That’s where this checklist comes in. Here’s a look at the first six things you should check for when you notice a drop in your organic traffic.</p>
<h2>1. Google Search Console</h2>
<p>Checking your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/25/new-google-search-console">Google Search Console</a> account tops this list for one, simple reason: it provides a number of insights into your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/27/seo-metrics">SEO metrics</a> to help you see what&#8217;s going on with your site’s organic traffic and beyond. That&#8217;s why <a href="/blog/ws/2021/06/16/how-to-use-google-search-console">Search Console should be your automatic starting point </a>to discover what happened to your website traffic.</p>
<p>To that end…</p>
<h3>Look Under the (Google Search Console) Hood</h3>
<p>Google Search Console lets you optimize the visibility of your site and check its indexing status. It&#8217;s ground zero for a lot of crucial information about the ins and outs of how your website is functioning.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/organic-traffic-search-console.jpg" alt="search-console-organic-traffic" width="800" height="476" /></div>
<p>Here are just some of the things you&#8217;ll be able to find by checking Search Console:</p>
<ul>
<li>Messages from Google (about manual actions, for example)</li>
<li>The list of internal and external pages that link to your site</li>
<li>Site errors</li>
<li>The crawl rate and when Googlebot accesses your site</li>
<li>The keyword searches that help your site appear in the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/serp">SERPs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This data should allow you to do some basic diagnostics. When did the drop start? Did it coincide with any other changes to your site? Did you lose rankings for some of your top keywords? Is there an indexing issue?</p>
<p>Try this analogy: The first thing you should check if there’s a blackout in your house is the fuse box. Similarly, the first thing you should check if there’s a traffic drop on your site is Search Console.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt; <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/28/technical-seo">6-Step Technical SEO Audit Checklist</a></strong></p>
<h2>2. The Tracking Code</h2>
<p>Sometimes, the reason for a drop in site traffic is a case of unreliable data. One of the most common areas where this can happen is your site’s tracking code. Because changes to your website code or even analytics plug-ins can create problems for the tracking code, issues in analytics reporting can arise.</p>
<p>So, to save yourself the trouble of looking in more complicated areas, double-check your site’s tracking code before anything else.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/organic-traffic-tracking-code.jpg" alt="tracking-code-organic-traffic" width="800" height="403" /></div>
<p><span lang="EN">Do yourself a favor by ensuring that your tracking code is installed properly in the first place. Go to the tracking code section—find it at Admin → Tracking Info → Tracking Code—and look for the status at the top of the page. This lets you know that the code is working as intended and that data is being reliably read by Google Analytics.</span></p>
<p>If you notice that something is not right, or you need to make sure that the tracking code is installed properly, head over to Google&#8217;s <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008083?hl=en">Analytics Help page</a> for troubleshooting tips or contact your site manager/developer.</p>
<h2>3. Google Algorithm Changes</h2>
<p>The thing about SEO in 2018 is that Google changes its algorithms more than once a day! Reports say that the company changes its algorithms <a href="https://moz.com/google-algorithm-change">up to 600 times a year</a>. While the majority of those updates consist of smaller changes, among them is the occasional, major update like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/23/google-hummingbird">Hummingbird</a> or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/05/21/panda-4">Panda</a> that can really wreak havoc with your traffic and search rankings.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s necessary to always stay abreast of developments in the SEO world, so that you can see these algorithm updates coming or you can determine what to do once they’ve been released. The WordStream blog is a great resource for SEO updates, but we also recommend <a href="https://searchengineland.com/">Search Engine Land a</a>nd <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/">Search Engine Roundtable</a> for news on updates. Glenn Gabe of <a href="https://www.gsqi.com/marketing-blog/">G-Squared Interactive</a> is also a great resource for analyzing the causes and impact of algorithm updates.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/organic-traffic-google-algorithms.jpg" alt="google-algorithms-organic-traffic" width="800" height="441" /></div>
<p>Scour these resources to determine the nature of the algorithm change. Look for information such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What exactly Google is penalizing</li>
<li>Why Google has made those changes</li>
<li>What to do about these penalties and how to stay on Google’s good side</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have all of this information, it’s your job to take the steps necessary to ensure your site’s not running afoul of Google’s new algorithm and prevent future problems.</p>

<h2>4. Link Losses</h2>
<p>One of the reasons for a traffic drop can also be due to your site losing links. You may be seeing a direct loss of that referral traffic, but there could also be indirect effects. When your site loses inbound links, it tells Google that your site isn&#8217;t as authoritative anymore, which leads to lower search rankings that in turn lead to traffic drops (because fewer people are finding your site if it&#8217;s not ranked as highly and more).</p>
<p>If you suspect a loss of links, you can double check to see if your suspicion is correct. Use a tool like <a href="https://majestic.com/">Majestic</a> or <a href="https://ahrefs.com/">Ahrefs</a>, two of the biggest link counters on the web, to determine if you lost any links.</p>
<p>When you use these tools, you can find out any of the following relevant information:</p>
<ul>
<li>A potential site-wide link decline</li>
<li>A possible link decline to a specific page or group of pages</li>
<li>A potential link decline to a specific page on your site that in turn links to another page on your site that suffered a reduction in traffic</li>
<li>A possible link decline in the external pages that provide inbound links to your site or specific page in question</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on what you find, you have two main options to pursue.</p>
<p>First off, you can contact the sites that removed your back links. Even if you don&#8217;t have a long-standing relationship with the site owner, he or she may be sympathetic to your situation if you just shoot them an email, explain your traffic decline, and ask for the inbound links to be restored.</p>
<p>The other strategy you can pursue is to step up your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/link-building-strategy">link-building</a> efforts again. This includes things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing guest posts on sites with a high domain authority</li>
<li>Stepping up your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/26/influencer-marketing">influencer-marketing campaigns</a> to earn backlinks from influential bloggers or social media figures in your industry</li>
<li>Increasing your social marketing to earn more social shares, along with the ensuing backlinks that come from more people talking about your content on social</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Site Redesign/Migration Issues</h2>
<p>Sometimes sites are changed for business reasons, and SEO isn’t the top priority. If you recently went through a site redesign or migration, and subsequently saw a drop in traffic, you’ll need to check and see if you unintentionally broke or de-optimized something on your website in the process.</p>
<p>For example, page speed – having a fast site is increasingly important these days. Google has confirmed that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/22/google-speed-update">page speed is a ranking factor</a> on mobile (and remember that Google is thinking mobile-first). So it&#8217;s no surprise that page speed is a crucial ranking factor; a slower site means lower rankings and traffic.</p>
<p>Insert image: mobile-page-speed-landing-page-load-adwords-keyword-quality-score1.png (already on server)</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve recently done a redesign or migration that causes your site to load more slowly, especially on mobile devices, it can come back to haunt you. Even if it costs you more money to get those load times down, it&#8217;s well worth it to your site traffic and rankings.</p>
<p>Site redesigns and migrations are a tricky beast that can introduce a whole slew of problems. Some of the other things that could always go wrong with a poorly handled site migration include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Service interruptions</li>
<li>Failed redirect implementations</li>
<li>Loss of content or metadata</li>
<li>Broken links and images</li>
<li>Loss of internal links</li>
<li>Information architecture changes</li>
</ul>
<p>These problems can be avoided with a lot of careful planning and QA, but if you’re experiencing the traffic loss now, it’s too late for that! Work with your developers to troubleshoot these issues and surface any mistakes you might have made in the process, so you can prioritize getting them fixed.</p>

<h2>6. The Quality of Your Content</h2>
<p>One of the things that can slow-bleed the traffic from your site is the quality (or lack thereof) of the content you publish on your site. Previous Google updates like Panda have already been released specifically to deal with <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/google-panda">the issue of low-quality content</a> on websites. Long story short: Panda intended to stop sites with bad content from appearing in the search results.</p>
<p>Further, we’re all aware of the classic study that showed a <a href="https://searchengineland.com/seo-user-science-behind-long-form-content-230721">correlation between longer content and higher rankings</a> in the SERPs.</p>
<p>Clearly, Google punishes low-quality content and rewards high-quality content. That begs the question, what constitutes high quality content?</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/organic-traffic-content-quality.jpg" alt="content-quality-organic-traffic" width="800" height="502" /></div>
<p>Turn your content into great content by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deindexing, deleting, or improving “doorway pages” or dynamically generated pages that aren’t getting much organic traffic</li>
<li>Striving to create longer content (towards 2000 words or more per article)</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/01/content-marketing-images">high-quality images in your content</a></li>
<li>Answering your prospects’ questions with in-depth educational content</li>
<li>Minimizing ads and pop-ups that disrupt the user’s experience</li>
<li>Designing easily navigable and/or legible user interfaces</li>
</ul>

<h3>Don’t Panic, and Go Through Your Checklist</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever experienced an organic <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/12/24/google-algorithm-update-changes">traffic decline</a>, we sympathize with you. It can be scary because reduced traffic means reduced visibility, which means fewer conversions and less revenue. You can almost imagine everything you&#8217;ve worked so hard to optimize suddenly coming apart at the seams.</p>
<p>Although it may seem contrary to what&#8217;s natural, the best thing you can do in such a situation is to take control and not panic. Instead, take a deep breath and calmly go through the different, possible causes on this checklist to get to the bottom of what&#8217;s causing your traffic woes.</p>
<p>Chances are that it’s an easily identifiable issue that can be readily fixed because you strategically pursued a process-of-elimination checklist to solve your problem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO</a>, there are two approaches you can take to increase the search rankings of your website: on- and off-page SEO. The former deals with what you can do on your own site to increase your rankings, while the latter deals with what you can do outside your site (on <em>other</em> sites, hence, off-page) to raise your rankings.</p>
<p>Both are equally vital to making sure that your site gets found in search, but we’re only going to deal with off-page tactics in this guide.</p>
<p>Optimizing your site for off-page SEO means you’ll have to improve the way that both users and search engines see your site in terms of credibility, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/12/google-e-a-t">authority</a>, popularity and relevance, just to name a few factors. A broad simplification of this is that other sites on the web (ideally, respectable ones) will link to your content to essentially promote or vouch for it, which, circling back now, has major benefits for your site’s reputation.</p>
<h2>On-Page vs. Off-Page SEO</h2>
<p>Here’s a quick refresher on the difference between on- and off-page <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/01/seo-case-study">SEO</a>.</p>
<p>On-page SEO generally includes factors like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Page titles and headings</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/08/image-seo">Images</a></li>
<li><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/meta-description">Meta descriptions</a> and tags</span></li>
<li>URL</li>
<li>Fast-loading pages</li>
<li>High-quality and regularly updated content</li>
<li>Internal linking</li>
</ul>

<p>Off-page SEO really comes down to one major factor, which is high-quality backlinks to your site. The more of these you can get, the better, but, at the end of the day, it’s really more about quality than quantity because you want backlinks from sites with higher domain-authority ratings.</p>

<p>You can get backlinks to your site in any number of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/guest-posting-guidelines">Guest posting</a> or blogging</li>
<li>Social-media activity</li>
<li>Influencer marketing</li>
<li>Simply creating high-quality and shareable content on a regular basis</li>
</ul>
<p>When all’s said and done, getting backlinks to your site depends mostly on how hard you’re willing to work to get them. The process can be quite involved, but it pays off if you do it diligently.</p>
<p>Let’s look at each of the four main ways to get backlinks to your site for off-page SEO purposes.</p>
<h2>Guest Posting or Blogging</h2>
<p>Before social and influencer marketing…there was blogging. One of the earliest marketing strategies on the web, blogging stands the test of time by still delivering results today. According to the data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blogging is <a href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Industry-Report-2018.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the second-most important type of content</a> for marketers</li>
<li><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Industry-Report-2018.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60% of marketers</a> use blogging in their social-media content</span></li>
<li>Websites featuring blogs get <a href="http://www.techclient.com/blogging-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">434% more indexed pages</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s precisely because of this popularity and effectiveness that landing guest posts on blogs is such a solid influencer-marketing strategy. When you publish a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/06/21/guest-posting-dos-donts">guest post</a> on an influential (and highly ranked) blog, you can usually get a backlink to your site, either in the article itself or in your author bio.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="d17e6da4-82c3-4d22-a98b-2834c7cabba8" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/off-page-seo-importance-of-blogging.jpg" alt="guest blogging for off page seo" width="776" height="580" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Here are some actionable tips on landing guest posts:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you write your introductory <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/19/outreach-marketing-techniques">outreach email</a> to the blog’s editor, make it personal to establish a <em>human</em> connection</li>
<li>Understand the industry of the blog you want to write on</li>
<li>Pitch topics that are in line with what the blog is looking for</li>
<li>Include some links to your best published work on the web</li>
<li>Tell the blog editor how his or her readers can benefit from your piece</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to repeat this strategy from one highly ranked blog to the next, using your growing list of successfully published guest posts as part of your pitch.</p>
<p>Remember that the whole tactic behind off-page <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/17/amazon-seo">SEO </a>is to get backlinks from <em>highly ranked</em> sites pointing to your site. This all goes back to a site’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/12/domain-authority">domain authority</a>, which is defined as:</p>
<p>A ranking score for search engines that predicts how highly a site is going to rank on search engine results pages. The score goes from one to 100; the closer the score gets to 100, the more authoritative it is.</p>
<p>Be sure to figure in this score when choosing the blogs to pitch your guest posts to. Use a tool like Moz’s <a href="https://moz.com/researchtools/ose" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Site Explorer</a> to help you figure out any site’s domain authority.</p>
<h2>Social Media</h2>
<p>For the longest time, there’s been a correlation between the social shares a piece of content gets and how well its corresponding site or page does in search rankings.</p>
<p>Recent research and analysis from our own Larry Kim suggests that it’s not just the number of social shares, but <a href="https://moz.com/blog/relationship-between-organic-rankings-and-social-shares" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the engagement rate of social content</a> that strongly correlates with higher organic rankings. That would be things like comments, likes, click-throughs on images, etc.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="9e57e8fc-f355-4cb3-b849-c0b200246373" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/off-page-seo-social-activity.png" alt="social engagement for off page seo" width="1028" height="644" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>This brings me to the next strategic piece of increasing your off-page SEO results: social media. The more that people on social share your content—and the greater its engagement rate—the more backlinks for that specific piece of content you’ll probably get. Social media is essentially a way to get a lot of free exposure, assuming your content is worth sharing.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: Let’s say you create an extremely helpful and eye-opening infographic that talks about all the little-known foods that Americans should stop eating. Mercola.com has done just that with <a href="https://www.mercola.com/infographics/10-banned-foods.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an impressive infographic on banned foods that has amassed almost 700,000 social shares</a>.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="fc73ee6e-f02a-4edd-9c49-b12ed6201707" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/banned-foods-infographic-off-page-seo.jpg" alt="what is off page seo" width="600" height="521" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>According to Moz’s Open Site Explorer, this infographic has earned 50 backlinks, and when I search for “banned foods” on Google, it ranked at #2.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="c0abd01b-feb0-4b2f-8b74-768f3f1c0bb9" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>This is just one example of how getting a lot of social shares and social engagement can be a very effective way of using off-page SEO to increase your search rankings.</p>
<h2>Influencer Marketing</h2>
<p><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/26/influencer-marketing">Influencer marketing</a> is a strategy where businesses and brands work together with popular (read: <em>influential</em>) bloggers and/or social-media users to promote their products or services. Because these influencers enjoy huge audiences and carry sway with them, businesses want to tap into that audience by having their products or services plugged or at least mentioned in some way by these influencers.</span></p>
<p>To be sure, influencer marketing includes both paid and non-paid arrangements. The former is when businesses pay influencers or at least give them a free product in exchange for their promotion. The latter is when the relationship is organic, when both the business and influencer enter into a mutually beneficial relationship.</p>
<p>While it’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/06/01/influencer-marketing-is-under-attack-six-reasons-it-still-works/#2d7a19f06058" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come under attack recently</a> for having the potential to sometimes be inauthentic, the truth is that research confirms it’s very helpful to your off-page SEO efforts, with influencers having the potential <a href="https://www.marketingprofs.com/chirp/2018/33333/the-influencer-marketing-revolution-macro-versus-micro-influencers-infographic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to generate 11 times the ROI of traditional advertising</a>. And if you work to nurture and build these truly authentic relationships with influencers, you’ll see good benefits.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="88cf53d1-a92d-49d1-824a-323b32060ee2" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Here’s how to use influencer marketing to get backlinks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Talk about the influencer in your blog posts. Quote them, or mention their brand. Then, reach out to them on social or by email to let them know that you’ve featured them. Since people naturally love being recognized, chances are they’ll link back to your content if you ask them to.</li>
<li>Work side-by-side with an influencer to create an in-depth guide, video or other piece of valuable content. In this scenario, you’ll get backlinks when you co-promote your content on different channels to each other’s respective audiences.</li>
<li>Get your social fans to act as micro-influencers for your brand. If you notice that people are already organically taking pictures of themselves with your product and posting it to their social feeds, invite them to do the same for your official social account. The result is a multiplying effect of the promotion of your brand…to all of their followers. Boat-shoe brand <a href="https://www.adweek.com/digital/how-sperrys-micro-influencers-reach-impressive-heights-little-cost-instagram-175053/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sperry recently tried this strategy</a>.</li>

<h2>High-Quality Content</h2>
<p>All of the above off-page SEO strategies aren’t going to work in the first place if you don’t have high-quality and shareable content that you create on a regular basis. This is the fundamental <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/23/cornerstone-content-guide">cornerstone</a> of your entire strategy. By having this great content in place, you make it easier:</p>
<ul>
<li>To land guest posts on influential websites and blogs</li>
<li>For people on social media to share your content</li>
<li>For influencers to speak highly of your work and team up with you on content-creation projects</li>
</ul>
<p>That begs the question, how do you create such content?</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="31fa8f46-4adb-4a2b-a439-a738ecce8950" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/long-form-content-for-seo-data.jpg" alt="length of high ranking content" width="894" height="564" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Here’s a general checklist of what to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write <a href="https://searchengineland.com/seo-user-science-behind-long-form-content-230721" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-form pieces</a> (defined as about 2000 words), as they tend to rank better on the first <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/serp">SERP</a></li>
<li>Use images in your content, as <a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2017/10/visual-storytelling-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posts featuring images</a> receive 2.3 times better <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/24/facebook-engagement">Facebook engagement</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/12/28/content-marketing-advice">Answer hard questions</a>, dare to be <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/05/19/contrarian-content-marketing">bold and contrarian</a>, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/14/marketing-data">back up your arguments with data</a> in the content you create</li>
</ul>
<p>Make it a point to include these three features in your content, and you’ll have a much easier time getting backlinks pointing back to it, no matter which off-page SEO strategy you use.</p>
<h2>Off-Page SEO: Just Half of the Puzzle</h2>
<p>Follow these extremely important strategies, and you’ll notice your search rankings increase over time. As your rankings increase, that means more traffic and leads coming to your site, which will have a healthy impact on your conversions, too.</p>
<p>Of course, taking care of off-page SEO is just half the story since on-page SEO matters, too. Only when you exhaust both SEO approaches can you be sure that you’ve done everything to make sure that your website is found in the big, vast world of organic search.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From a public-relations standpoint, it hasn’t been the easiest of times for Facebook. Recent data-breach scandals have <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-trust-collapses-after-cambridge-analytica-data-scandal-2018-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">undermined user confidence</a> in the social-media giant, and security is on everyone’s minds in the age of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/04/04/facebook-ads-gdpr">GDPR</a>.</p>
<p>In spite of this, Facebook still remains one of the best platforms for businesses to reach their customers, drive leads to their websites, and increase their sales. The fact that Facebook is home to <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2.2 billion monthly active users</a> as of March 2018 is a big reason why.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="68f6d1d5-d34d-4895-ab59-aaddeb4d1557" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-user-penetration-2018.png" alt="facebook user stats" width="1280" height="618" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Simply put: With so many people using the platform, that’s exactly where your leads and customers are also going to be.</p>
<p>Data issues aside, no one is going to stop using Facebook, and its user base will likely only keep increasing. Therefore, your best move is still to understand how to use Facebook to increase your business opportunities.</p>
<h2>The Importance of Facebook Engagement</h2>
<p>Before we dive headfirst into strategies, we should define what we mean by Facebook engagement. Engagement sometimes means different things to different marketers and businesses, but in general, increasing your Facebook engagement means your audience is more likely to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comment on your updates</li>
<li>Like your content</li>
<li>Share your content</li>
<li>Look at your posts or videos</li>
<li>Click on your links</li>
</ul>
<p>The more your audience performs these actions, the higher your Facebook engagement rate, and the more successful your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/16/facebook-business-page">business page</a> will be, increasing traffic and conversions to your website.</p>
<p>What’s not to like, right? Here are seven powerful strategies to achieve this.</p>
<h2>1. Celebrate the Holidays (Fake Ones Too)</h2>
<p>Facebook engagement is all about relevance. If you post relevant content for your customers, then they’re going to engage with your content.</p>
<p>One of the most straightforward approaches to creating this relevance is by acknowledging holidays throughout the year and working them into your post updates.</p>
<p>For instance, Macy’s January 1 post rings in the new year on its Facebook page:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="ef6422ae-3b94-4d0a-8d1a-84104ce323ab" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-engagement-rate-holiday-posts.jpg" alt="high engagement facebook posts" width="622" height="852" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>The fun thing about this strategy is that you don’t just have to stick to the major holidays everyone knows: Christmas, New Year’s, Easter, the Fourth of July, etc. You can also dig deep by referencing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_holidays" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fictional holidays</a>. These are holidays that are featured in pop culture, but that no one <em>really</em> celebrates—until you mention them on your Facebook page, that is! A lot of brands have also found success by referencing <a href="https://nationaldaycalendar.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national days</a> like National Scavenger Hunt Day (May 24). If you find a day that’s relevant to your business, and almost certainly one of them is, go to town.</p>
<p>At the very least, you’ll raise awareness about fun and comical “holidays” among your audience, which increases <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/07/customer-engagement-strategy">customer engagement,</a> too.</p>
<p>P.S. Our monthly marketing ideas posts share all the national days for each month! Head to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/10/june-marketing-ideas/">June</a> and you&#8217;ll also see links to the rest of the months in there.</p>
<h2>2. Start a Facebook Group</h2>
<p>Your Facebook activity shouldn’t solely be limited to your brand page. When you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/16/create-facebook-group">create a Facebook Group</a>, you can drive people and therefore activity to your brand page.</p>
<p>There’s a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook/facebook-tips-whats-the-difference-between-a-facebook-page-and-group/324706977130/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">difference between a Page and a Group</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Facebook <strong>page</strong> is the public presence of a business, organization or even personality</li>
<li>A Facebook <strong>group</strong> is a community of like-minded Facebook users that rally around a specific cause, organization or personality, holding small-group discussions about a shared interest</li>
</ul>
<p>So how can a group actually drive traffic to your page?</p>
<p>Let’s say that your business is a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/16/real-estate-marketing">real estate</a> corporation. You maintain a separate page for it, where you post updates about the real estate market, home-buying tips, and anniversaries special to your brand. Simultaneously, you’re also a member of a real estate-based group, where the community regularly discusses market trends, its members’ home-buying and home-buying experiences, and any questions related to home ownership.</p>
<p>By frequently posting and sharing information within the group, you’ll eventually be seen by members as a trustworthy source of knowledge—and traffic to your page will follow that way.</p>
<p>Here are some of the groups you find when you search for “real estate groups” on Facebook:</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>But if you don’t find the right group, start your own! <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/facebook-group" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Check out Buffer’s guide for more info</a>.</p>
<h2>3. Post Surveys, Polls and Quizzes</h2>
<p>Taking the pulse of your audience is a guaranteed engagement-upping tactic. What fan doesn’t want to share his or her opinion when their favorite brand asks them a question?</p>
<p>There’s perhaps no more direct way of engaging your audience because you’re asking them a straightforward question.</p>
<p>In general, a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/10/best-online-survey-tools"> survey</a> is for more serious topics, such as what your audience thinks you can do better or their personal experiences with your brand. On the other hand, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/04/instagram-story-ads-polls">a poll or quiz </a>can be a bit more frivolous in nature and play to your audience’s sense of fun. A poll or quiz can ask your audience:</p>
<ul>
<li>What you’re doing for the holidays</li>
<li>What you think of current events in the news</li>
<li>Whether or not you’re going to buy a hot, new product</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s an example of a poll tied into Mother’s Day, from a small UK jeweller:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="565f9574-67a5-458d-973e-d43ac5bf770c" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/mothers-day-poll-facebook.jpg" alt="using facebook polls to increase engagement" width="863" height="1103" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>They&#8217;ve even thrown in a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/05/11/instagram-giveaways">contest</a> on top of the poll, for extra engagement.</p>
<h2>4. Time Your Facebook Updates Just Right</h2>
<p>Based on <em>when</em> you post to your page, you can drastically affect your engagement levels. The idea is to avoid posting when fewer people are around and post during peak times. It’s simple math: When more people are active on the platform, your posts stand to get more exposure.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://coschedule.com/blog/best-times-to-post-on-social-media/#facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a compendium of 23 studies</a>, the best opportunities for posting on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/15/facebook-dynamic-creative">Facebook</a> are:</p>
<h3>Best Days:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Thursday</li>
<li>Friday</li>
<li>Saturday</li>
<li>Sunday</li>
</ul>
<h3>Best Times of Day:</h3>
<ul>
<li>9 am</li>
<li>1 pm</li>
<li>3 pm</li>
</ul>

</article>
</div>
<p>Looking at this data even more granularly, we also see:</p>
<ul>
<li>More upbeat content does best on Friday (probably due to the weekend being right around the corner)</li>
<li>1 pm posts receive the most shares</li>
<li>3 pm posts get the most clicks</li>
<li>The most engagement occurs later in the week and on weekends from 1 to 4 pm</li>
</ul>
<p>If you plan your posts around these data tidbits, you’ll be sure to see an increase in your engagement almost immediately.</p>
<h2>5. Tell a Lot More Facebook Stories</h2>
<p>Human beings are hardwired to tell, listen to, and respond to stories. It’s in our DNA. According to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02036-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study published in Nature Communications</a>, storytelling is associated with all sorts of cultural benefits, such as cooperation, preferred social-partner status, and higher reproductive success.</p>
<p>With this fact perhaps in mind, it’s no wonder that Facebook last year debuted its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Stories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stories</a> feature for both individual profiles and pages. Stories are brief, user-created pictures or videos that are uploaded to your page. The feature is centered on the platform’s in-app camera that lets you incorporate unique filters and lenses to shared content, as well as visual, geolocation tags to pictures. This content can be posted for only 24 hours, creating artificial scarcity and a sense of urgency to view said content.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">Image via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/25/facebook-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch</a></span></em></p>
<p>If you’re thinking that this sort of sounds…a little bit like…Snapchat, you’d be correct. Think of this as Facebook’s answer to Snapchat’s well-known modus operandi.</p>
<p>Creating a story for your page is as easy as pie. Simply:</p>
<p>1) Use your iOS or Android app, as Stories can only be posted from mobile</p>
<p>2) Head to the timeline of your page</p>
<p>3) Tap on “Create Story”</p>
<p>Now, you’re all set to create short, image- or video-based montages that present your brand in a new light to your audience. The beauty of Stories is that it strongly promotes engagement because anyone viewing your Story can reply with a direct message.</p>
<h2>6. Directly Approach Your Audience</h2>
<p>Your audience, also known as your fans, already likes your brand. If they didn’t, they wouldn’t spend the time on your page. Knowing this, you can also take an educated guess that these people are more likely than not willing to directly engage with your brand. All you have to do is push them in the right direction a little bit.</p>
<p>Since visual content is <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?_ga=2.139747571.1586833963.1526877072-1082832656.1526877072" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40 times likelier to receive social shares</a> than any other type of content, a smart engagement strategy is based on soliciting photos from your audience around a specific topic, challenge or even just about your product.</p>
<p>For example, if you run a donut chain, you might encourage your audience to post various pictures of them enjoying your sumptuous and sugary creations in all sorts of different settings. Your audience feels engaged, and they get to participate in what they love: talking about and posing with your product.</p>
<p>American restaurant The Duke’s has this strategy down pat: This eatery that specializes in serving up American favorites in Thailand solicits engagement like this from its audience. Here, The Duke’s is asking its customers to check in, take a photo of themselves while in the restaurant, and tag their page on Facebook. As a reward, customers who go along get free ice cream after their meals.</p>

<h2>7. Use a Lot More Videos</h2>
<p>When it came to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/07/facebook-marketing-tips">Facebook marketing</a>, there was a time when people thought that just posting high-quality images was the best you could do for engagement. When we look at more recent data, it turns out that video beats images when it comes to engagement—by a lot!</p>
<p>Facebook IQ’s own research determined that users in the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates <a href="https://www.facebook.com/facebookiq/videos/1105592942884597/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent five times longer looking at video content than they did at static content</a> (1:41) on both Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>From this recent study alone, it’s clear that people appreciate the interactive nature of video more than static pictures.</p>
<p>To engage your audience better, you have to use more video, whether that’s simply posting more videos on your page, using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/25/facebook-video-ads">Facebook video ads</a>, or using something like <a href="https://live.fb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Live</a>. (Check out WordStream&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/31/facebook-live-guide">ridiculously awesome guide to getting started with Facebook Live</a>.)</p>
<h2>8. Run Facebook Ads</h2>
<p>Organic reach pales in comparison to what you can get using paid Facebook advertising. The targeting on Facebook is second-to-none, since you can target profile information like age, gender, location, occupation, marital status, interests, and more. Even better, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/12/facebook-ads-cost">costs to advertise on Facebook</a> are more than affordable and the returns are high. If you need help getting started, these are some of the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/02/best-facebook-ads-courses"> best Facebook ads courses</a> out there.</p>
<h2>Make Facebook Engagement Priority #1</h2>
<p>Due to the sheer number of people on Facebook, it can be hard to make your content stand out. One of the fastest ways to succeed at getting it noticed just the same is to work on your engagement. When your content appeals to your audience based on relevance to them, then it’s easier to make that content stand out.</p>
<p>By incorporating the above strategies into your Facebook marketing framework, you drastically increase the chances of people engaging with your content. The more folks engage with what you post, the more it’ll have a positive impact on not just your Facebook metrics, but also your business’ leads, customer base, and sales.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>SEO isn't always about Google! If you sell products on Amazon, you need to understand Amazon's product ranking algorithm, A9. Here are the factors that influence your rankings when people search for products like yours in the Amazon search engine.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/17/amazon-seo">Amazon SEO: How to Rank Highly for Amazon Searches</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All too often, when we think of SEO, we only think of Google. And of course you want great rankings in the search engines.</p>
<p>However, your website isn’t the only place on the web where you may be selling your product. If <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/16/compete-with-amazon-ebay">you have a product page on Amazon</a>, you want it to be found by customers just as you would want your site to show up on the first <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/serp">search engine results page (SERP)</a> for your industry keywords.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/amazon-seo-guide.png" alt="amazon seo how to" width="512" height="512" /></div>
<p>Failure to do Amazon SEO right, just like with regular SEO, will result in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">less traffic</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/03/increase-sales-online">fewer sales</a>.</p>
<p>It’s vital to understand that Amazon’s search algorithm works differently than any Google or Bing algorithm in surfacing results. In a nutshell, there are way fewer ranking signals or factors than with typical SEO, which some say includes as many as <a href="https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">200 factors</a> (though others <a href="https://moz.com/blog/the-myth-of-googles-200-ranking-factors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dispute this</a>).</p>
<p>You might think that this makes ranking in Amazon easier, but it’s not that simple. If you’re trying to analyze Amazon SEO from a web-SEO standpoint, you’re going to have a hard time. That’s because Amazon is primarily a buying platform, first and foremost.</p>
<p><em><strong>A multi-channel ecommerce strategy is an effective ecommerce strategy. <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSContentDLWebAnyInContentBannerEcommerceShopping101.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentBanner_Ecommerce_Shopping101_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download our free guide to Google Shopping</a> and start spreading your brand today!</strong></em></p>
<h2>An Intro to Amazon’s Search Algorithm</h2>
<p>Amazon’s search algorithm is referred to as A9, just because the company of the same name that handles SEO for the company, which is a subsidiary of Amazon, is named <a href="https://www.a9.com/">A9</a>. In its own words:</p>
<p>“We manage search and advertising technologies that are scalable, highly available, and cross-platform for our parent company, Amazon, and other clients.”</p>
<p>Understand that Amazon, as the world’s biggest ecommerce site, only cares about one thing: its bottom line, and therefore selling as efficiently as possible to its millions of customers.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/amazon-a9-algorithm-stats.jpg" alt="amazon a9 algorithm" width="750" height="270" /></div>
<p>While people perform <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/12/10/three-types-of-search-queries">all kinds of different searches</a> on Google, many of which are informational searches, pretty much every Amazon search is transactional. That’s why its algorithm actually comes down to only a couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relevance</li>
<li>Performance</li>
</ul>
<p>If you optimize your Amazon <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/09/07/ecommerce-sales-product-pages">product page</a> for these two, crucial ranking factors, you’ll end up converting and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/01/27/top-reasons-to-sell-on-amazon-2021">selling more on the site</a>.</p>
<p>Both relevance and performance can be broken down into additional sub-categories, so we’ll look at each one in more detail.</p>
<h2>Relevance-Related Amazon Ranking Factors</h2>
<p>Good news: You’re able to influence these ranking factors directly by the strategic use of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/23/amazon-keyword-research">relevant keywords</a> in the following areas of your Amazon pages.</p>
<h3>Your Product’s Title</h3>
<p>Probably the most important element of Amazon <a href="https://localiq.com/products/search-engine-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO</a>, as far as relevance is concerned, is the product-title ranking factor. You’ll want to put the most relevant keywords for your product in the title.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/amazon-product-name-title-seo.jpg" alt="how to optimize products for amazon seo" width="750" height="319" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>The top 3 Amazon results for “mortar and pestle” all have those words in the product name</em></p>
<p>Here are some tips to optimize your Amazon product name:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/30/ecommerce-brand-bidding">brand name</a></li>
<li>Include a clear description of what your product does</li>
<li>Mention a specific ingredient or essential material</li>
<li>Specify the color of your product</li>
<li>Clarify the size of your product</li>
<li>Make a mention of the quantity of your product (if applicable)</li>
</ul>
<p>As in the world of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/white-hat-seo">white hat SEO</a>, avoid keyword stuffing in your title, as that will harm your search rankings on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/16/amazon-alternatives">Amazon</a>. If you keyword-stuff, you run the risk of composing a title that doesn’t read naturally, which can look spammy and have a negative impact on your click-through rate.</p>
<h3>Your Seller Name</h3>
<p>Consider the impact of your seller name on your relevance as a ranking factor. Some marketers have observed that they can get specific products to rank higher in Amazon’s organic search results <em>if</em> they include the main keywords for the product within the seller name.</p>
<p>Let’s look at an example. If you search Amazon for “American flag ties for men,” the first result comes from a seller called “Man of Men.” The word “men” in the seller name could very well be helping them out with that ranking. (If you remove “for men” from the search query, you get different results.)</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/amazon-seo-seller-name-relevance.jpg" alt="amazon seller name seo" width="906" height="533" /></div>
<p>So pay attention to your seller name to eke out more gains in Amazon’s SERPs.</p>
<h3>Your Amazon Backend Keywords</h3>
<p>Backend keywords are essentially <a href="https://www.sellerlift.com/amazon-backend-keywords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“hidden” keywords</a> that will only be used in your Amazon Seller Account’s backend section. Their function is to tell Amazon’s algorithm that a specific product listing is targeting a specific keyword on the site.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for an analogy to search engine SEO here, think of these backend keywords like the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/meta-tags">meta tags</a> that tell Google what your webpage is about, which helps the search engine figure out when to show the page to people searching for specific information.</p>
<p>There are five fields sellers can fill out with their backend keywords. Each line has a 50-character limit. If you go over the limit, your backend keyword won’t be indexed by the site.</p>
<p>Here are five rules to keep in mind to successfully fill out your Amazon backend keyword fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t repeat any words</li>
<li>Avoid quotation marks since they’ll limit your overall character count</li>
<li>Don’t include too many variations of the same word</li>
<li>Commas are ignored</li>
<li>Include variations in spelling or synonyms</li>
</ul>
<h3>Your Brand Field</h3>
<p>A product’s brand field always shows up on the product page (right above the title or headline) and links to various search results for additional products from the same brand. As you list your products, be meticulous about spelling your brand name exactly right.</p>
<p>Typical user behavior on Amazon is for shoppers to search for a product based on its brand name, which is why it’s vital to always include an accurate name.</p>
<p>If your product has various brand names that you could conceivably use, get some help from a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-tools">keyword tool</a> to help you determine which variation is the most searched for brand name and use that.</p>
<h3>Your Product Description and Bullet Points</h3>
<p>These go hand-in-hand. Both tell your customers more about your product, so this is your chance to be very detailed, as well as persuasive. Of course, you’ll need to include your most important keywords here, too.</p>
<p>For the description, work hard to make the copy readable, natural and convincing from a pure sales standpoint. Follow <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/05/product-landing-pages">ecommerce landing page best practices</a>. This will resonate with potential buyers beyond the SEO power you’ll get from including your keywords.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/amazon-seo-product-bullet-points.jpg" alt="amazon product page seo" width="1242" height="352" /></div>
<p>As for the bullet points, the same applies. Bullet points are easy and quick to read because they’re scannable, so your customers are going to look at this area with priority. Tell your customers about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/21/features-vs-benefits">the benefits of your product</a> (not just the features) and include crucial information like ingredients or dimensions. Work your relevant keywords into these bullet points in a natural way, so as to add value to each tidbit of information about your product. Check out your competition and make sure they’re not including more thorough information than you.</p>
<h2>Performance-Related Amazon Ranking Factors</h2>
<p>Performance factors are a bit harder to directly exert control over because additional considerations beyond keywords come into play. Still, it’s vital that you have an understanding of these, too, for optimized Amazon SEO.</p>
<h3>Your Product’s Price</h3>
<p>It goes without saying (at least it should) that how much you charge for your product significantly impacts your Amazon conversion rate and how many units you move on the site. If your price on Amazon is competitive compared to other sites selling your product or products similar to yours, then your conversion rate should be positively affected.</p>
<p>One aspect of this that’s sometimes overlooked is how your price compares to similar products in the same category on Amazon.</p>
<p>If many products in the same category are selling for less than yours, then two things likely will happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>You won’t sell as many as those similar products</li>
<li>Amazon’s algorithm will prejudge that your product likely won’t sell as many as the others</li>
</ul>
<p>Long story short: In either case, <strong>you’ll suffer with a lower Amazon search ranking</strong> if you charge too much relative to similar products, so don’t price yourself out of the Amazon market. Carefully compare what your competitors on the site and other sites are doing, and set your price accordingly and competitively.</p>
<p>If your price is higher, there should be a very clear reason why (such as more and better reviews).</p>
<h3>Your Amazon Conversion Rate</h3>
<p>Intimately linked with price, your product’s conversion rate is another highly significant performance factor in your search ranking. Unfortunately, it’s going to be challenging to learn <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/29/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks">how your conversion rate compares</a> with much certainty, as you don’t really have access to Amazon’s analytics in the same way you would with analytics on your own ecommerce site.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/amazon-business-reports-unit-session-percentage.jpg" alt="unit session percentage amazon conversion rate" width="610" height="351" /></div>
<p>The best you can do for conversion data is to check Seller Central’s Detail Sales Page and Traffic under Business Reports and Reports. Here, you’ll want to look at the Unit Session Percentage, which is essentially the number of units that are bought per visit. It’s the closest you’ll get to a pure conversion rate for your product page.</p>
<p>If the conversion rate is unspectacular and you believe your product should do better, then it’s time to revisit some of the aforementioned relevance factors to see if you can appear higher in Amazon searches and/or persuade more people to buy with better product page copy.</p>
<h3>Your Product Images</h3>
<p>Products that feature high-quality images <a href="https://conversionxl.com/blog/how-images-can-boost-your-conversion-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistently have a higher conversion rate</a>, studies show. The same principle applies to your Amazon product page.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/amazon-seo-product-images.jpg" alt="seo for amazon product images" width="830" height="640" /></div>
<p>Amazon itself recommends bigger images in its <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.ca/gp/help/external/16881?ref=efph_16881_cont_200220550&amp;language=en_CA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seller Central Product Image Guidelines</a>, writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Images should be 1,000 pixels or larger in either height or width. This minimum size requirement enables the zoom function on the website. Zoom has been proven to enhance sales. The smallest your file can be is 500 pixels on its longest side.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Include <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/06/01/high-converting-landing-page-images">high-quality images</a> that follow these guidelines, and help ensure that your product listings aren’t relegated to the end of the search results, which makes conversion rates suffer. And when your conversion rates increase due to these optimizations, your Amazon search-results rankings should do better.</p>
<h3>Your Amazon Reviews</h3>
<p>It’s safe to say that online reviews—which <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/learn/local-consumer-review-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">85% of customers trust as much as personal recommendations</a>—are another performance-related factor that figures into Amazon’s algorithm. Notice the correlation in Amazon’s search results and products with many reviews. The products that rank at the top for a broader keyword generally have more reviews, and higher reviews, than those lower down on the list.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-get-amazon-reviews-1.png" width="512" height="275" /></div>
<p>From this, we can conclude that having more reviews has an impact on click-through rates and can lead to more sales, which in turn has an impact on overall product ranking on the site. Of course, Amazon has in recent times <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/10/27/amazon-lawsuit-fake-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cracked down on fake reviews</a> to ensure better integrity, so don’t try to cheat the algorithm.</p>
<p>If you’d like to get more of your customers to leave reviews on your Amazon product page, simply send them follow-up reminder emails after a purchase, asking them to leave a review for what they just bought from you.</p>
<p>If your Amazon reviews are negative, take a look at what people are complaining about and work to address the problems with your product. Here are some more tips on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/10/amazon-reviews">getting more and better Amazon reviews</a>.</p>
<h2>Eyes on the &#8220;Amazon&#8217;s Choice&#8221; Prize</h2>
<p>Successful Amazon SEO comes down to knowing what Amazon’s algorithm wants from you as the seller, which ultimately comes down to making Amazon&#8217;s customers happy. Your product page can be optimized in various ways, but they all come down to two main factors: relevance and performance.</p>
<p>If you optimize with these big factors in mind, you should eventually see movement in the right direction with regard to your search rankings, conversion rates, and sales.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Copywriting is the science and art of using the right words to sell a product or service. Famed ad exec David Ogilvy, regarded as the father of advertising, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/298352-i-don-t-know-the-rules-of-grammar-if-you-re-trying" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notably said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I don’t know the rules of grammar. If you’re trying to persuade people to do something, or buy something, it seems to me you should use their language.”</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s what copywriting really comes down to: Using <em>specific</em> language in such a way that it increases the sales—or, in a more modern context, conversions—of an online store.</p>
<p>Words matter crucially, when it comes to writing effective and high-converting copy. As you’ll see in the following case studies, even something as seemingly inconsequential as switching up one or two words in a call to action, product page, or landing page can produce impressive conversion lifts, which equals lots more sales and revenue over time.</p>
<p>These copywriting changes are easy to test—why <em>not</em> see if they make a difference to your conversions?</p>
<h2>1. “Buy” Vs. “Shop”—Don’t They Mean the Same Thing?</h2>
<p>People take synonyms for granted. While they convey the same meaning, the curious thing about them is that people online often react quite differently to which specific word your store uses. This difference can amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue…making it a huge impact for such a small word. Depending on the size of your business, that’s not chump change.</p>
<p>That’s what Black &amp; Decker found out when they decided to run some A/B tests on one of their product pages.</p>
<p>One of Black &amp; Decker’s trade names is DeWalt, a power-tool maker. On the DeWalt website, the main call to action originally featured the button copy “Buy Now.” After the Black &amp; Decker team analyzed the page, they hypothesized that changing the word “buy” to “shop” would have much less of a commitment sound to it, thereby potentially encouraging more click-throughs.</p>

<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/buy-vs-shop-a-b-test.jpg" alt="buy vs. shop cta split test" width="1284" height="491" /></div>

<p class="text-align-center"><span lang="EN">Image via <a href="https://blog.optimizely.com/2014/07/03/black-decker-discovers-big-win-in-buy-now-vs-shop-now-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Optimizely</a></span></p>
<p>So the team ran the A/B test. In sharp contrast to their hypothesis, “Buy Now” was actually the more successful CTA, <a href="https://blog.optimizely.com/2014/07/03/black-decker-discovers-big-win-in-buy-now-vs-shop-now-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resulting in 17% more click-throughs than “Shop Now</a>.”</p>
<p>Sound like a small difference? <strong>Projected over an entire year, this equaled six figures in revenue.</strong></p>
<p>Suffice it to say, it’s good the team A/B-tested before implementing their hypothesis. Not only does this show that you should always <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/02/26/ab-testing-best-practices">A/B-test</a> instead of just recklessly implementing changes, but it also demonstrates that changing one little word on a product page can swing <em>a lot</em> of money in either direction.</p>
<h2>2. Low-Price Guarantee Vs. Authenticity</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/09/07/ecommerce-sales-product-pages">Product pages</a> love to feature low-price guarantees as a persuasive element to drive more sales. While these have been shown to help drive conversions, sometimes it’s seals of authenticity that do a better job in that regard.</p>
<p>In this case study, it’s also a change of just a few words that leads to a substantial conversion increase for an e-commerce retailer.</p>
<p>Express Watches was a UK-based retailer of Seiko watches. However, their biggest problem was concern over the authenticity of their Seiko watches. Customers weren’t 100% sure that these were the real deal.</p>
<p>Digital-marketing agency High Position structured an A/B test around this customer distrust. The control page featured the phrase “Never Beaten on Price” on the right side of the product page. They designed the test so that the variation would more clearly communicate that this retailer sold only legitimate Seiko watches. High Position hypothesized that the phrase “Seiko Authorized Dealer Site” would be the phrase that would allay these customer fears and lead to higher conversions.</p>

</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><span lang="EN">Image via <a href="https://vwo.com/blog/increase-in-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VWO</a></span></p>
<p>The new phrase replaced the original on the same part of the page.</p>
<p>High Position discovered that this seemingly insignificant change in copy, involving only four words, would lift conversions. They were right.</p>
<p>The results showed that the variation <a href="https://vwo.com/blog/increase-in-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lifted conversions by an impressive 107%</a> in a 30-day test. The conversion rate went from 1.81% to 3.76%, <strong>effectively doubling the conversion rate</strong>.</p>
<p>Shoppers pay attention to even the smallest alteration in words on pages, so be sure to regularly run A/B tests when you hypothesize that a new word or phrase might have an impact.</p>

<h2>3. Contact Us or Request a Quote?</h2>
<p>Web forms can be tricky to properly optimize. As with anything in digital marketing, the only way to know for sure is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/09/25/a-b-testing">run A/B tests</a>.</p>
<p>B2B Iron Mountain enlisted the help of iProspect, a digital-performance agency, to optimize the quality of leads generated from its form. One of Iron Mountain’s biggest issues was that it strongly suspected its form of unclearly communicating to leads what they should input. A large part of this fell on the headline, which in the original form read “Contact us today.” The problem with that was the form was intended to get leads to ask about the B2B’s business solutions.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the A/B test, the treatment’s headline read “Request a quote,” which clarified the goal of the form much clearer. The treatment form also included visual-form validation to better guide users.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="bec300d7-c11d-48fd-a918-15bb2a45415f" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/contact-us-vs-request-a-quote-ab-test.jpg" alt="copywriting split testing examples" width="1028" height="584" /></div>

</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><span lang="EN">Image via <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/customers/iron-mountain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Optimizely</a></span></p>
<p>Iron Mountain believed these changes would improve both lead quality and, therefore, revenue.</p>
<p>They were right: The treatment form produced a <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/customers/iron-mountain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">140% conversion lift</a>, which happened to be the best lead quality the B2B’s sales team ever experienced.</p>
<p>While it may seem like there was not much of a difference between “contact us” and “request,” the context in this case study was all-important, as “request” spoke more directly to the purpose of the form, which was to inquire about Iron Mountain’s business solutions.</p>
<h2>4. We All Love Free Stuff</h2>
<p>Sometimes, explicitly spelling out to your site visitors that something is free works wonders on the conversion rate. Job recruitment-and-online-address-book app Viadeo, formerly Soocial, discovered this through a straightforward A/B test on their homepage.</p>
<p>Their homepage had a huge, green CTA with the phrase “Sign up now!” prominently displayed. The goal was to increase sign-ups, so Viadeo flirted with several hypotheses and variations.</p>
<p>They tested everything including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different colors</li>
<li>Copy variations</li>
<li>Adding the word free</li>
</ul>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="d1362c62-d81b-424c-b062-d271e30b0055" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/free-copywriting-ab-test-example.jpg" alt="a/b testing landing page copy" width="806" height="390" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center">Image via <a href="https://vwo.com/blog/ab-test-case-study-how-two-magical-words-increased-conversion-rate-by-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VWO</a></p>
<p>The test that produced the most significant conversion lift was adding the two-word phrase “It’s free!” immediately to the right of the big “Sign up now!” CTA. Adding these two little words <a href="https://vwo.com/blog/ab-test-case-study-how-two-magical-words-increased-conversion-rate-by-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resulted in a 28% conversion jump</a>, with the original layout possessing a 14.5% conversion rate and the “It’s free!” treatment garnering an 18.6% conversion rate.</p>
<p>Note also how the “It’s free!” copy wasn’t exactly the most easy to read (it was a small, subtle font), but it still did the trick, just because of the word “free.”</p>
<h2>5. A Few Words for Regional Personalization</h2>
<p>Another case study from WiderFunnel involves a short phrase and a hypothesis about regional personalization. In this scenario, a relatively small-sized caption underneath a field boosted conversions for an insurance rate-quote form.</p>
<p>The DMV—everyone’s favorite state-level government agency—is often a place where people get frustrated or confused due to bad service. DMV.org—which is actually <strong>not</strong> a government-owned site, but provides consumers with information to simplify their DMV experiences—wanted to optimize its conversion rate by providing better service to its customers on its webpages.</p>
<p>DMV.org’s challenge was that they had only a very small optimization team and so couldn’t run the A/B tests they required to try out better-performing variations.</p>
<p>In one test WiderFunnel ran, they looked at an underperforming insurance-quote form, particularly the absence of captions underneath the fields. They hypothesized that regional personalization—adding state-specific references to where the quotes would be coming from—would lift conversions.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="7089964f-3aa3-407a-9ade-4c81f6f7d779" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/local-personalization-a-b-test.jpg" alt="personalization a/b test" width="960" height="659" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><span lang="EN">Image via <a href="https://www.widerfunnel.com/case-studies/putting-ab-testing-to-the-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WiderFunnel</a></span></p>
<p>They were right.</p>
<p>When they added a short caption, <em>Get quotes from top providers in New York</em>, the <a href="https://www.widerfunnel.com/case-studies/putting-ab-testing-to-the-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">variation form increased revenue by 3.9%</a>. The original form had no caption underneath the field.</p>
<p>It just goes to show you that the smallest changes—from a standpoint of the number of words <em>and</em> the font size of additional copy—can make substantial improvements to revenue lifts.</p>
<h2>6. Quote Vs. Pricing—Aren’t They Synonyms?</h2>
<p>You may be tempted to think that some changes are just distinctions without a difference. If you were going from a purely semantic point of view, you may be right…but if you’re looking at things from a business perspective, you’d be pretty far off base.</p>
<p>In perhaps one of the largest conversion rate increases ever based on changing just one word alone, “quote” was substituted for “pricing.”</p>
<p>Veeam Software, a developer of products for data protection and virtual-infrastructure management, conducted a survey asking its visitors what other information they’d enjoy seeing on a product page. Most of the responses indicated that visitors wanted to see pricing information.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="2ea01ea9-3b78-4924-bbd5-2db7d88b74b7" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/copy-ab-test-quote-vs-pricing.jpg" alt="copywriting split test examples" width="847" height="664" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><span lang="EN">Image via <a href="https://vwo.com/blog/increase-click-through-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VWO</a></span></p>
<p>Armed with this feedback directly from their customers, Veeam Software hypothesized that changing the product page’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/anchor-text">anchor text</a> to “Request pricing” from the original “Request a quote” would yield good results.</p>
<p>The click-through rate <a href="https://vwo.com/blog/increase-click-through-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jumped by 161%</a> from that one-word change alone!</p>
<h2>Let’s Hear it for the Power of Words</h2>
<p>These case studies prove that you should never underestimate the power of words to boost your conversion rates. Copy on any page has the power to motivate people to convert. The key is knowing what <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/22/power-words">words have power</a>.</p>
<p>The truth is that none of us ever really knows, which is why it’s a must to always A/B-test your landing and product pages, along with specific words in the CTAs.</p>
<p>Start with a hypothesis, and once you run that A/B test and you see higher conversions…you’ll know you’ve struck gold.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>Since maintaining healthy conversion rates is so integral to running a successful online business, it’s vital to examine and master one of the most significant factors impacting conversions: <strong>your site’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/27/design-thinking">user experience</a></strong>.</p>
<p>UX relates to everything your leads, visitors or customers experience as they navigate and interact with your site on each page or page element. It relates to how easily they can find what they’re searching for on your site—without being slowed down by unnecessary friction, which can make them bounce, never to return.</p>
<p>Here are six key ways your site&#8217;s UX can affect your conversion rates.</p>
<h2>1. Video on Landing Pages</h2>
<p>Any time you navigate a landing page, there’s usually a <em>lot</em> of text to absorb. That&#8217;s because landing pages are really sales pages that want to persuade you to click on the call-to-action button right on the page or click through to the main page for the actual purchase. <a href="/blog/ws/2017/09/21/landing-page-designs">Some landing pages</a> can be exceptionally long if they have a very detailed <a href="/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">value proposition</a> to communicate to visitors.</p>
<p>In terms of UX, this can be absolutely arduous for people because—let’s face it! Who has the time or wants to read all that text?</p>
<p>Situations like these are tailor-made for video. Studies show that using <a href="/blog/ws/2014/12/16/video-landing-pages">videos on landing pages</a> can increase conversion rates by a sizable amount. Any time conversions shoot up, it’s because a page’s UX is improved. Conversions happen because a page successfully communicates its value proposition <em>and</em> seamlessly encourages users or customers to complete the page goal.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center">Image via <a href="https://www.eyeviewdigital.com/documents/eyeview_brochure.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EyeView</a></p>
<p>Take the case of TutorVista, a one-on-one, web-tutoring service. When EyeView, a video-solutions provider, added video to TutorVista’s landing page with the goal of increasing subscription signups, <a href="https://www.eyeviewdigital.com/documents/eyeview_brochure.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conversions skyrocketed by 86%</a>, just due to the video.</p>
<p>The takeaway? Leads are visual creatures and appreciate video over text.</p>
<p>This is part of a broader trend, with the web as a whole becoming <a href="/blog/ws/2017/03/08/video-marketing-statistics">more video-centric</a>. As Cisco reports in its <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2017 Visual Networking Index Forecast</a>, a decisive 82% of all IP traffic will be video by as soon as 2020.</p>
<h2>2. Call to Action Button Placement</h2>
<p><em>Where</em> you place your calls to action greatly influences your customers’ UX. If the CTAs are hard to see, read or click, then that has a negative impact on UX and conversions. The goal of many pages is to sell something—whether products, subscriptions, or signups. CTAs are integral to conversions and so is their placement.</p>
<p>The UX phrase <em>the fold</em> pertains to that imaginary line on websites that divides everything users can see on the page without scrolling down from that which they can see only when they scroll down. Naturally, bigger screen sizes—desktop versus tablet and mobile—will have more space for content to be above the fold.</p>
<p>According to UX experts at the NN Group, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/page-fold-manifesto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">84% is the average difference of how users treat content above versus below the fold</a>. Put another way, content above the fold is seen 84% more than that below the fold. The study arrived at this conclusion by conducting its own study and analyzing a Google study of display advertising across different sites.</p>
<p>This already provides a very strong indication that content that’s important that you want your customers to see—like a CTA!—should be placed above the fold. One company tested this out and found it to be true.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center">Image via <a href="https://unbounce.com/conversion-rate-optimization/landing-page-cta-placement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unbounce</a></p>
<p>Unbounce experimented with its PPC landing page, which originally had the CTA below the fold, by adding a secondary CTA above the fold, which directed leads to scroll down the page to the pricing grid, below the fold. This change in CTA placement produced <a href="https://unbounce.com/conversion-rate-optimization/landing-page-cta-placement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a conversion spike of 41%.</a></p>
<p>The takeaway? Don’t fight your leads’ user behavior by putting the CTA in hard-to-see places. Put it above the fold for greater conversions.</p>
<h2>3. The Speed of Your Website</h2>
<p>Today, more than ever, site speed is one of the most crucial determining factors in whether your UX is up to par or not. Sites that are noticeably slower suffer from conversion losses compared to sites that are blazingly fast. (It can even <a href="/blog/ws/2018/01/22/google-speed-update">affect your organic rankings</a>.)</p>
<p>How do you know what’s fast enough, though?</p>
<p>A classic study conducted in 2009 by content delivery network provider Akamai and Forrester revealed that <a href="https://www.akamai.com/us/en/about/news/press/2009-press/akamai-reveals-2-seconds-as-the-new-threshold-of-acceptability-for-ecommerce-web-page-response-times.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40% of consumers refuse to wait longer than three seconds</a> for a page to render before they abandon the site. If your site takes three-and-a-half or four seconds to load, then poof. Your leads vanish along with your conversions.</p>
<p>A much newer study done in 2016 by DoubleClick by Google confirmed these earlier findings. When it comes to mobile, if pages take longer than three seconds to load, then <a href="https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/articles/mobile-speed-matters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">53% of mobile site visits are abandoned</a>.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="6c221697-8c90-4699-86ce-3477ddb97cf7" data-langcode="en">

<p>So your answer is <strong>three seconds or less</strong>. That’s how fast your site’s pages have to render if you don’t want your leads to think your site has poor UX due to slowness!</p>
<p>Here are some handy site-speed tools to help you ensure that your site stays blazingly fast:</p>

<h2>4. Website Readability: Make it Bigger</h2>
<p>An often underappreciated aspect of UX is how readable your site is. It stands to reason: When your leads and visitors can’t make heads or tails of the content on your site, that means they’re not going to understand what they’re supposed to do. And that means lousy UX.</p>
<p>Should they read reviews? Look at a video? Maybe they should just skip straight to the CTA?</p>
<p>If your copy isn’t readable enough, they won’t know what to do.</p>
<p>Consider the reality that your leads and visitors don’t even actually read much of the copy on your site. According to UX Myths, <a href="http://uxmyths.com/post/647473628/myth-people-read-on-the-web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people usually just skim site content</a>. With these short attention spans, it’s all the more crucial that what little of your content they read is actually…<em>easy</em> to read.</p>
<p>Case in point: In a report titled <a href="http://pielot.org/pubs/Rello2016-Fontsize.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Effect of Font Size and Line Spacing on Online Readability</em></a>, UX researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Spain’s Universitat Pompeu Fabra discovered that 18-point font sizes are the best for UX <a href="/blog/ws/2021/06/04/seo-content-readability">readability</a> as well as comprehension in the body text of pages.</p>

<p>Doing so just makes your content harder to read. Content that’s harder to read is, in turn, harder to comprehend. When your customers can’t understand what you want them to do on your site, that spells disaster for your site conversions.</p>
<p>Since most people already won’t read much of the content on your pages, you have to make it even easier for them to absorb what little they read. Making fonts bigger is always better.</p>
<p>The takeaway? Don’t use less than 18-point font sizes in the body text of your pages.</p>
<h2>5. Free Shipping Works Wonders</h2>
<p>Sometimes, adding specific page elements to entice your shoppers to actually convert is all that it takes to increase conversions. Think of this as the little, extra nudge that shoppers need to be persuaded to convert in greater numbers.</p>
<p>For <a href="/blog/ws/2018/01/10/ecommerce-trends">ecommerce sites</a> in particular, adding a free shipping threshold can meaningfully boost your conversions, as one retailer found out.</p>
<p>NuFace, an anti-aging device maker, discovered that giving their customers, who were already familiar with their brand and products, just a small incentive during the checkout process increased their conversion rate.</p>
<p>They ran an A/B test with the treatment page displaying a message of free shipping for orders over $75. The results were amazing: Not only did the average order value increase by 7.32%, but <a href="https://vwo.com/blog/free-shipping-threshold-increases-aov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the number of orders almost doubled, jumping by 90%</a>.</p>

<p>This case study sheds light on other areas of ecommerce UX psychology, that help to explain why free shipping is so desirable.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://marketingland.com/e-commerce-report-9-10-consumers-say-free-shipping-no-1-incentive-shop-online-180280" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 Walker Sands Future of Retail Report</a>, almost everyone asked said that free shipping is their number-one incentive to increase their online shopping. 90% of all respondents said they’d buy more through ecommerce if there was more free shipping.</p>
<p>The takeaway? When your customers are clamoring for incentives like free shipping, you give it to them, especially when it increases the number of orders <em>and</em> average order value!</p>
<h2>6. Getting Rid of Friction in the Form of Navigation</h2>
<p>The majority of pages on the web and all landing pages, for sure, have just one goal: to get their visitors to convert. One of the biggest problems that can negatively impact conversion rates is when a landing page suffers from too much clutter in the form of navigational links that take said visitors away from the page. These links act as distractions, working to undercut the whole goal of the page.</p>
<p>The solution? Declutter the page, of course!</p>
<p>A case study from AmeriFirst Home Mortgage illustrates this principle to a tee.</p>
<p>AmeriFirst has a policy of naked landing pages, that is, landing pages with no navigation. That way, visitors aren’t tempted to click <em>away</em> from the only offer on the page. Instead, they can focus, distraction-free, on the offer, fill out the form, and complete the conversion.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="79e004d9-7a37-4d14-a48e-2c52900a1f33" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center">Image via <a href="https://www.relevance.com/want-a-high-landing-page-conversion-go-naked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Relevance</a></p>
<p>This policy of removing navigation from landing pages has resulted in <a href="https://www.relevance.com/want-a-high-landing-page-conversion-go-naked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an impressive 30 to 40% conversion rate increase</a> at AmeriFirst.</p>
<p>From a UX standpoint, it makes all the sense in the world: When you remove distractions from a page, your users aren’t bombarded with competing decisions to make. Their minds are at ease, able to focus on just the one task—the page goal—of the landing page.</p>
<p>The takeaway? Get naked on your landing pages, and reap the benefits of a higher conversion rate.</p>
<h2>Take Care of the UX, and More Conversions Will Follow</h2>
<p>We highlighted numerous case studies to demonstrate one of the truest laws in digital marketing. When your site’s UX is impeccable, your site is rewarded with more conversions. In other words, ensure your UX is awesome, and your visitors will be much likelier to convert in higher numbers.</p>
<p>Look at it from the perspective of your leads. If you land on a page—even if you’re interested in the offer you come across from a Google Ads (AdWords) ad or organic search result—yet the offer is so unintelligible that you can’t understand much of it, then your experience as a user is very poor. You’ll be frustrated, and your patience for staying on the page to figure things out will drastically decrease. You’ll likely exit the page very quickly. You’re not going to convert.</p>
<p>That’s why, when you ensure the UX on a site is excellent thanks to clarity and well-defined page goals, you can be sure that higher conversions will follow.</p>
