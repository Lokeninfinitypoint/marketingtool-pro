										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve seen AI productivity tools put to so many tasks recently, like planning a vacation, scheduling activities for school breaks, or even organizing finances. But today, we’re going to look at ways AI tools can help you be more productive during your workday (so you can get back to vacation planning faster).</p>
<p>We’ll focus on AI tools that take on the most time-consuming tasks and that are the easiest to outsource. You know, those repetitive tasks that continue to pile up and get in the way of things that really move the growth needle.</p>
<p>Because there’s rarely a one-size-fits-all solution, we’re giving you a couple of solid options to test for each section, and letting you know the pros and cons of each.</p>
<p>Let’s get productive!</p>

<h2>AI tools for content creation</h2>
<p>Now, using<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/25/ai-content-generators"> AI tools to create your content</a> start to finish isn’t the best strategy. Especially because it can impact your brand’s<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/topical-authority"> authority</a> and relationship with your audience, but you should definitely use AI tools for productivity gains throughout the content creation process—whether it’s brainstorming, outlining, or even reviewing for tone. Just be sure to play an active role and review everything.</p>
<h3>1. Jasper</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.jasper.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jasper</a> is a generative AI tool that helps you create marketing copy, including <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post">blog posts</a>, product descriptions, landing pages, social captions, and more. This AI tool uses advanced large language models (LLMs) purpose-built for writing copy, which makes the output stronger than some other <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/chatgpt-alternatives">alternatives</a>. Plus, you can input examples so that Jasper learns your brand voice and can replicate it as it writes.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-jasper.webp" alt="AI productivity tools - screenshot from Jasper" width="937" height="468" class="aligncenter wp-image-93206 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-jasper.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-jasper-480x240.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.jasper.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>However, this better output comes with a cost. Jasper is pricier than a lot of other options, so make sure it works for your budget before testing it out.</p>
<p><strong>Jasper pricing:</strong> <a href="https://www.jasper.ai/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jasper’s Creator plan</a> costs $39 per month.</p>
<h3><strong></strong>2. Copy.ai</h3>
<p><a href="http://copy.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Copy.ai</a> is an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-copywriting-tools">AI copywriting assistant</a> that can produce nearly any type of copy, but it excels particularly in creating short-form content, such as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-ad-copy">social captions</a>, product descriptions, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/21/promotional-email-examples">marketing emails</a>. The tool is straightforward and easy to use, so you can get lots of options quickly.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-copy-ai.webp" alt="AI productivity tools - screenshot from Copy ai" width="873" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93207 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-copy-ai.webp 873w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-copy-ai-480x330.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 873px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.copy.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Copy.ai offers robust workflow features, but other tools give you more control over tone.</p>
<p><strong>Copy.ai pricing:</strong> Copy.ai offers a <a href="https://www.copy.ai/prices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basic free plan</a>, and its paid plans start at $49 per month.</p>

<h2>AI tools for scheduling and calendar management</h2>
<p>Managing your calendar takes time, from scheduling meetings to reviewing your day to moving things around when an unexpected doctor’s appointment or client call takes precedence. (Seriously, why is it still so annoying to move appointments in the Google Calendar app?)</p>
<p>Here are a few tools to make it all easier.</p>
<h3>3. Clockwise</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.getclockwise.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clockwise</a> uses AI to automatically optimize your calendar by finding the best times for meetings, eliminating the back-and-forth. It also blocks out time for prep and debriefing based on your own settings. It even protects dedicated focus time to ensure you can get everything done in your day.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-clockwise.webp" alt="AI productivity tools - screenshot from Clockwise" width="937" height="529" class="aligncenter wp-image-93208 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-clockwise.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-clockwise-480x271.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.getclockwise.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Another key thing here is that Clockwise focuses on team-wide time management, not just individual calendars. That’s a bonus if you’re looking to improve the way your department, or even your business, manages scheduling.</p>
<p>Make note that while Clockwise integrates with Google Calendar, it has limited support for Microsoft users at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Clockwise<a href="https://www.getclockwise.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> offers a free plan</a>, and its paid plans start at $6.75 per month.</p>
<h3>4. Motion</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.usemotion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Motion</a> offers AI-powered scheduling that it blends with task management. Motion allows you to input your to-do list as well as link your calendar, so that the AI tool has the ability to consider your time in meetings as well as your time for tasks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-motion.webp" alt="AI productivity tools - screenshot from Motion" width="662" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93209 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-motion.webp 662w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-motion-480x435.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 662px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.usemotion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></p>
<p>According to the Motion team, that’s how the tool organizes your day dynamically based on priority.</p>
<p>This is a huge pro in automatically prioritizing tasks, in addition to the same time-savings you get by eliminating manual meeting planning. But be aware that this automated prioritizing can feel too restrictive for some. Still, it’s worth testing out.</p>
<p><strong>Motion pricing:</strong> <a href="https://www.getclockwise.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Motion pricing</a> starts at $19 per seat, billed monthly.</p>
<div id="ai-tools-for-more-productive-meetings"></div>
<h2>AI tools for more productive meetings</h2>
<p>This meeting could have been an email! How often do you wish your meetings were more useful and concise? These AI tools will help you make that dream a reality.</p>
<h3><strong></strong>5. Otter.ai</h3>
<p><a href="http://otter.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Otter.ai</a> is an AI tool that provides real-time transcription, summaries, and highlights of meetings. It integrates with Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet, so you’re covered regardless of the platform your company uses.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-otter.webp" alt="AI productivity tools - screenshot from Otter ai" width="937" height="546" class="aligncenter wp-image-93210 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-otter.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-otter-480x280.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://otter.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Unlike some other meeting tools, you can edit Otter.ai’s transcription live to ensure accuracy. This is especially important because the transcriptions are not only searchable, but you can use its chatbot to get information from previous meetings. Otter.ai is a great tool for collaboration and keeping your team all on the same page—or for double-checking customer requests before following up.</p>
<p><strong>Otter.ai pricing:</strong> <a href="http://otter.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Otter.ai/pricing</a> offers a free Basic plan, with its Pro plan starting at $8.33 per month.</p>
<h3>6. Scribbl</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.scribbl.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scribbl</a> is a super simple, lightweight tool if you’re mainly looking to capture meeting transcripts. The interface is straightforward, and it’s free to get started for up to 15 meetings per month.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-scribble.webp" alt="AI productivity tools - screenshot from Scribbl" width="637" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93211 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-scribble.webp 637w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-scribble-480x452.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 637px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.scribbl.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Scribbl automatically shares transcripts with meeting attendees or other designated recipients, and it integrates with common tools like Google Drive, Slack, and HubSpot. But keep in mind that other than this, the tool offers minimal advanced features.</p>
<p><strong>Scribbl pricing:</strong> Scribbl offers a<a href="https://www.scribbl.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> free Lite plan</a>, and its paid plans start at $13 per month.</p>
<div id="ai-tools-to-streamline-your-emails"></div>
<h2>AI tools to streamline your emails</h2>
<p>I’ll be honest: I’ve given up on ever reaching inbox zero. But I still need to apply some order to all the emails if I want to avoid devolving into chaos and ensure I’m catching all the important messages. Setting up this organization manually is time-consuming, and worse, it’s easy to lose your progress and slip out of it. That’s why you need to try a tool to streamline your emails if you’re looking to use AI for productivity.</p>
<h3>7. Gemini for Gmail</h3>
<p>Using AI tools that are native to your email system is a win because they’re automatically integrated. That’s why if you’re already a Google Workspace user, consider testing out <a href="https://gemini.google.com/app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gemini</a> for Gmail. Gemini helps you draft replies, summarize lengthy email threads, search for information in your inbox, get information from your Google calendar, find Google Drive files, and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-gemini.webp" alt="AI productivity tools - screenshot from Gemini" width="937" height="581" class="aligncenter wp-image-93212 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-gemini.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-gemini-480x298.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is only available for Gmail users, and it’s most effective if you’re a full Google Workspace user.</p>
<p><strong>Google Gemini pricing:</strong> You can use the basic version of Google Gemini for free or get the Pro version for $19.99 per month.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="👋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Make email easier!</strong> Get <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/email-examples-and-templates?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Email_EmailTemplates_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links">The Complete Email Marketing Toolkit: Free Email Templates, Subject Lines, and Tips</a></p>
<h3>8. Superhuman</h3>
<p><a href="https://superhuman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Superhuman</a> uses AI-backed shortcuts and automations to help you organize your inbox and spend less time getting through more emails. Sounds great, right?</p>
<p>The tool labels and sorts emails so that you can quickly skim your inbox for the most important ones. Plus, Superhuman will automatically archive marketing emails, especially cold pitches. Superhuman will even help you schedule meetings in one click, draft replies, and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-superhuman.webp" alt="AI productivity tools - screenshot from Superhuman" width="937" height="531" class="aligncenter wp-image-93213 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-superhuman.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-superhuman-480x272.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://superhuman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>The one downside to this AI productivity tool is that it is pretty pricy compared to other options in this category</p>
<p><strong>Superhuman pricing:</strong> <a href="https://superhuman.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Superhuman pricing plans</a> start at $25 per month.</p>
<div id="ai-tools-for-more-efficient-research"></div>
<h2>AI tools for more efficient research</h2>
<p>You want the most trustworthy sources for your work. But it’s so easy to get caught up in research rabbit holes that waste time and lead you to dead ends. Here are a couple of tools to help make research more efficient, allowing you to spend the most time on the best sources.</p>
<h3>9. Genei</h3>
<p>Explicitly designed for researchers and writers,<a href="https://www.genei.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Genei</a> instantly summarizes research papers, web pages, and long articles. The platform allows you to search and select articles to review and summarize, and it also supports blog post drafting if you’re looking for a place to get started.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-genei2.webp" alt="AI productivity tools - screenshot from Genei" width="937" height="444" class="aligncenter wp-image-93215 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-genei2.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-genei2-480x227.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.genei.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Another benefit of Genei is that it includes citations, allowing you to access your sources directly for follow-ups.</p>
<p><strong>Genei pricing:</strong> Genei <a href="https://www.genei.io/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lists its pricing</a> in British pounds, but the lowest tier plan costs roughly $13.45 USD.</p>
<h3>10. Glasp</h3>
<p><a href="https://glasp.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glasp</a> is a browser add-on that lets you easily highlight and save web content, generating summaries and personal knowledge banks while you browse and read on your own. You can use the chat function to search your notes and summaries, and you can even export your notes files to upload elsewhere or share with your team. Glasp has similar functionality for summarizing videos.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-glasp.webp" alt="AI productivity tools - screenshot from glasp" width="937" height="528" class="aligncenter wp-image-93216 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-glasp.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-glasp-480x270.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://glasp.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>The downside is that Glasp isn’t intended for deep research, so that’s something to be aware of as you’re testing it out.</p>
<p><strong>Glasp pricing:</strong> <a href="https://glasp.co/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glasp has a free plan</a>, and its paid plans start at $10 per month.</p>
<div id="ai-tools-for-automating-tasks-and-workflows"></div>
<h2>AI tools for automating tasks and workflows</h2>
<p>One of the best ways to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency"> use AI tools</a> for productivity is to automate repetitive, time-consuming tasks. The setup might take some time and testing, but letting the tasks run without your intervention frees up your creative energy for other essential tasks.</p>
<h3>11. Zapier AI</h3>
<p><a href="https://zapier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zapier</a> is essentially a middleman that can create connections between thousands of digital platforms and apps. It acts like an intermediary, allowing two apps to work together. For example, if you need items from a Typeform submission to be converted into lines on a Google Sheet or to add Google Calendar events to a Notion page, Zapier can help.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-zapier.webp" alt="AI productivity tools - screenshot from Zapier" width="798" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93217 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-zapier.webp 798w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-zapier-480x361.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 798px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An example of a Zap, Zapier’s name for a connection between apps.</em></p>
<p>There are numerous templates and AI-powered suggestions, but in some cases, these automations—called zaps—can become quite complex and require trial and error to set up..</p>
<p><strong>Zapier pricing:</strong><a href="https://zapier.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Zapier offers several pricing plans</a> tailored to your use case, with free options available. The paid version for creating Zaps starts at $19.99 per month.</p>
<h3>12. Bardeen</h3>

<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-bardeen.webp" alt="AI productivity tools - screenshot from Bardeen" width="963" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93218 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-bardeen.webp 963w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-bardeen-480x299.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 963px, 100vw" /></p>

<h2>AI tools for maintaining productivity gains</h2>
<p>Once you’ve taken the time to test out and implement some AI tools to make your workday more productive, you want to make sure you can stick to it. Here are AI tools to help you maintain these productivity gains—stay on track, ensure everything is organized, and keep your time and attention free to focus on bigger-picture strategy.</p>
<h3>13. ChatGPT (OpenAI)</h3>
<p><a href="http://chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT</a> is one of the most well-known and widely used AI solutions. The chat-based tool can assist with a wide range of tasks, including writing, coding, brainstorming, and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/05/chatgpt-seo"> SEO</a>. It’s incredibly versatile, and while you’re focusing on using AI for productivity, it’s worth exploring how ChatGPT can also speed up your other tasks in your day-to-day routine.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-chatgpt-1.webp" alt="AI productivity tools - screenshot from Chatgpt" width="866" height="467" class="aligncenter wp-image-93220 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-chatgpt-1.webp 866w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-chatgpt-1-480x259.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 866px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>ChatGPT, like other chat-based tools, works by feeding it prompts. We’ve curated a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/08/chatgpt-prompts"> list of prompts</a> you can try to get started.</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT pricing: </strong>ChatGPT offers a robust free version that anyone can use, while its paid subscriptions start at $20 per month.</p>
<h3>14. Notion AI</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.notion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notion AI</a> is a workspace that can automatically generate content inside Notion pages—from meeting notes to action items—and allows you to search your knowledge base. It also helps build workflows within Notion, for example, creating pages, task trackers, and calendars for a new product or marketing campaign.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-notion.webp" alt="AI productivity tools - screenshot from Notion" width="688" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93221 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-notion.webp 688w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-notion-480x419.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 688px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.notion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>This is great if you’re already a Notion user. And if you’re looking for a solution for documentation creation, storage, and access, then Notion could be a great solution.</p>
<p><strong>Notion pricing:</strong> <a href="https://www.notion.com/pricing">Notion has a free plan</a>, and its paid plans start at $10 per month.</p>
<h3><strong></strong>15. Reclaim.ai</h3>
<p>Now, this is similar to the calendar tools, but we’re putting it here because of its singular mission: <a href="http://reclaim.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reclaim.ai </a> automatically blocks time for habits, tasks, and meetings based on your goals and availability. And even better, Reclaim will help you track your time so that you can review your patterns—and stay honest and accountable.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-reclaim.webp" alt="AI productivity tools - screenshot from Reclaim" width="879" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93222 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-reclaim.webp 879w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-productivity-tools-wordstream-reclaim-480x328.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 879px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="http://reclaim.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>When you’re automating and leveraging AI tools to get more productive, you don’t want to lose control over those newly gained work blocks. The only drawback to note here is that, at least for now, Reclaim.ai only integrates with Google Calendar.</p>
<p><strong>Reclaim pricing:</strong> You can use Reclaim’s Lite plan for free, and the paid plans start at $8 per month.</p>
<h2>Start using these AI tools for productivity</h2>
<p>You’re busy, and sometimes it feels like you’re too busy to start testing out new workflows or tools when you need to get things done. But if you can invest a little time to stand up one AI productivity tool, it’ll free up enough time to try another, and possibly another. Then, all of a sudden, you have lots of time back in your day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Online reviews can be a huge boon for your brand’s reputation, especially for a small business. But not all online review platforms work the same way. And Facebook can be especially tricky.</p>
<p>But Facebook reviews are a big deal, and if you&#8217;re not paying attention to them, you&#8217;re missing out on an opportunity to build trust with potential customers. In this article, we’ll cover everything you need to know to manage and get more Facebook reviews.</p>

<h2>Why do Facebook reviews matter?</h2>
<p>If you’re <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/free-marketing-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing a small business</a>—or, you know, a consumer who is making purchases—then you’re aware that most people look up products and services online. Even if they see an out-of-home advertisement or pass by a brick-and-mortar, they’ll often look up the business online to check out the pricing, offerings, and the company’s online presence. (Guilty.)</p>
<p>Facebook reviews, in particular, matter because they will influence your potential customers. <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/chart/266242/where-us-consumers-start-their-search-online-shopping-feb-2024-of-respondents">10%</a> of shoppers start their search for a product on Facebook. And that’s only the percentage of users who begin with Facebook, not who check Facebook at all during the consideration phase.</p>

<p>These reviews are persuasive, whether they’re positive or negative. In fact, BrightLocal found that <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/research/local-consumer-review-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">49%</a> of survey respondents trust consumer reviews as much as personal recommendations from friends or family members.</p>
<p>If your customers are checking your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-facebook-page-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook page</a> for reviews, and they’re listening? Well, that makes your Facebook reviews an important tool for your business. Here’s how to get more and to keep them managed.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2b50.png" alt="⭐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Get all the tips you need to collect more reviews in this free guide download &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/how-to-get-more-reviews?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_howtogetreviews_Download&amp;itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links">How to Get More Reviews: 8 Tips to Boost Ranking, Reputation, &amp; Revenue</a></p>
<div id="how-to-get-more-facebook-reviews"></div>
<h2>How to get more Facebook reviews</h2>
<p>When it comes to Facebook reviews, more is more. You need at least <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/500762053364226" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five reviews</a> to get a rating for your page, but this is a minimum. You want to amass enough reviews that they reflect all of your different customer types and reference all of your core products and offerings.</p>
<p>The most effective way to get more reviews is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">ask for them</a>. Here’s how to do that.</p>
<h3>Send follow-up emails after a purchase or service</h3>
<p>You probably already have automations set up for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/07/thank-you-for-your-order-messages">thank you emails</a> post-purchase and shipping updates, if those are relevant. One effective, straightforward strategy to get more Facebook reviews is to add an automated check-in email.</p>
<p>This should arrive a week or two after a completed order to see how your customers are enjoying their purchase. Did everything arrive in good condition? Were the services satisfactory? Do they have any immediate feedback? And, most importantly, if they’re happy with the purchase and results, would they be interested in leaving a review?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/review-request-email-example-png.webp" alt="review request email example" width="528" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91180" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/review-request-email-example-png.webp 528w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/review-request-email-example-480x818.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 528px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Two things to be aware of with these emails. First, make it easy to submit a review. Include a button (like the email example above) linking directly to your Facebook review page.</p>
<p>And second, be sure to actually respond to any feedback—positive and especially negative. You don’t want to ignore an unhappy customer who is willing to reach out.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4eb.png" alt="📫" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Get everything you need for great emails (even review request emails!) &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/email-examples-and-templates?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Email_EmailTemplates_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links">The Complete Email Marketing Toolkit: Free Email Templates, Subject Lines &amp; Tips</a></p>
<h3>Request reviews in your receipts or invoices</h3>
<p>For plenty of giant corporations, including a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/qr-code-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QR code</a> leading to a review site on a physical receipt or a link to submit review in an emailed receipt is common practice. This is something that your business—small or medium, ecommerce or in-person services—can do, too.</p>
<h3>Ask customers directly</h3>
<p>If you do business in person, make sure to ask your customers directly for a review. If you have a services business, add this to your final goodbye when a happy client thanks you for a job well done. If you have a brick-and-mortar store, include the prompt to leave a Facebook review in your regular checkout script. Or save the request for your enthusiasts and return customers.</p>
<p>And it’s good to keep in mind that customers won’t be thrown by this request. BrightLocal found that <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/research/local-consumer-review-survey-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">28%</a> of customers reported they&#8217;d prefer to be asked to leave reviews in person (second only to email requests).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/how-customers-want-to-be-asked-to-leave-reviews-png.webp" alt="how customers want to be asked to leave reviews from brightlocal survey" width="831" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91189" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/how-customers-want-to-be-asked-to-leave-reviews-png.webp 831w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/how-customers-want-to-be-asked-to-leave-reviews-480x520.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 831px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Post on your Facebook page with a clear CTA</h3>
<p>Another option is to ask your customers to leave a review when they’re already on Facebook. Post an update requesting reviews for your page, and include the direct link to get started submitting one.</p>
<p>Americans over 18 spend an average of <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/social-media-usage#spending-time-on-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">31 minutes</a> on Facebook each day. While they’re scrolling past updates and ads, or if they’re checking your business page for hours or sales, they’ll see your post—and best case scenario, they’ll leave a review.</p>
<p>Just remember, you don’t want to do this too often. Asking for reviews is great. Looking like you’re begging or bugging your followers? Not a good tactic.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4da.png" alt="📚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide download</strong> &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download">The 42 Best Call to Action Phrases Ever (&amp; Why They Work)</a></p>
<h3>Include a link in your email template</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CAN-SPAM Act </a>requires that you include a few things in your email, like your physical location and a clear and correct option for unsubscribing. Most <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-email-examples-and-templates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing email templates</a> put these in a footer so that they appear in every single email sent to ensure compliance. But you don’t have to stop there.</p>
<p>You can also include a subtle request for reviews in your email footer. Depending on your template or your company’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/01/email-marketing-tips">email marketing strategy</a>, you could also include this request to leave a review on Facebook in your employee email signatures.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/review-request-in-email-signature-png.webp" alt="example of review request in email signature" width="607" height="403" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91181" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/review-request-in-email-signature-png.webp 607w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/review-request-in-email-signature-480x319.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 607px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Text your subscribed customers about review promotions</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/sms-marketing-examples">SMS marketing</a> is another good channel to reach your customers with a simple, direct request for a review, especially after a recent transaction. Simple Texting found that <a href="https://simpletexting.com/blog/2024-texting-and-sms-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">79%</a> of consumers opted into receiving text messages from businesses in 2024. I’m definitely one of them. I’ve submitted my phone number in exchange for a 15% off discount… and proceeded to stay subscribed and click on the sales offers too many times.</p>
<p>But as long as you’re using SMS marketing sparingly and purposefully, adding a prompt to leave a Facebook review after purchase is a great way to get more reviews.</p>
<h3>Leverage a chatbot script</h3>
<p>If you’re using a chatbot on your website, you can create a script with a prompt to leave a Facebook review to target relevant conversations with customers. In fact, some businesses have seen great success using this tactic.</p>
<p>Andrey Lipkovskiy shared the breakdown of a chatbot experiment they ran to generate more Facebook reviews <a href="https://manychat.com/blog/generate-customer-reviews-with-chatbots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manychat blog</a>. The results were overwhelming. An 87% open rate, a 24% CTA, and 65 new 5-star reviews in just 24 hours. Worth a try.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/manychat-reviews-status-on-facebook-png.webp" alt="reviews standing for manychat on facebook" width="600" height="433" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91177" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/manychat-reviews-status-on-facebook-png.webp 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/manychat-reviews-status-on-facebook-480x346.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Image via Manychat</em></p>
<h3>Use positive reviews in your marketing materials</h3>
<p>Another subtle way to call attention to your Facebook reviews is to use those customer testimonials in your marketing materials. You can feature these in display ads, Instagram or Facebook ads, Google Ads—there are tons of options. And the good news is that these are effective for sales, as well. One case study found that using testimonials on sales pages, for instance, increased purchases by <a href="https://vwo.com/success-stories/wikijob/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">34%</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/reviews-in-facebook-ad-png.webp" alt="star rating showing in facebook ad" width="509" height="495" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91179" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/reviews-in-facebook-ad-png.webp 509w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/reviews-in-facebook-ad-480x467.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 509px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Avoid offering a discount or running a giveaway</h3>
<p>Technically, the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/soliciting-paying-online-reviews-guide-marketers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Trade Commission</a> allows you to incentivize reviews as long as you incentivize positive and negative reviews equally and the compensation is disclosed in the body of the review. But many platforms, including Etsy and Google, prohibit this because it makes reviews less trustworthy.</p>
<p>Facebook doesn’t explicitly prohibit compensation for reviews, but it’s still better to avoid. Especially because it undermines the authority in all of your other reviews, even ones you earned from happy, uncompensated customers.</p>
<div id="how-to-manage-facebook-reviews"></div>
<h2>How to manage your Facebook reviews</h2>
<p>Getting more Facebook reviews is important, but so is following through on managing those reviews. You need to be paying attention to your page, responding in a timely manner, and keeping track of your overall business score to ensure that these Facebook reviews remain a tool to help grow your business.</p>
<p>Here’s how.</p>
<h3>Make sure your reviews are enabled and visible</h3>
<p>This is the first step because it’s the most basic. <strong>In order to get Facebook reviews on your business page, you need to enable reviews in your profile. </strong>Luckily, it’s easy to do.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, go to your page.</li>
<li>Next, click on settings.</li>
<li>When the new window appears, click on the “Templates and Tabs” section.</li>
<li>Toggle reviews “On.”</li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s it. Simple, but essential. You can also change the order so that the tab containing reviews appears early.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/facebook-business-page-reviews-tab-example-png.webp" alt="facebook business page reviews tab" width="1200" height="683" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91184" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/facebook-business-page-reviews-tab-example-png.webp 1200w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/facebook-business-page-reviews-tab-example-980x558.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/facebook-business-page-reviews-tab-example-480x273.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Have your Facebook review link handy</h3>
<p>When you’re asking people to leave a review, you need to direct them to the correct place. So make sure you have a link directly to your review page stored in a readily accessible location. Whether it’s in your email signature, in a shared note or document with all your review and social links, or in your company’s project and document database is up to you and depends on what works best for your team and your business. The important thing is that it’s easy to access.</p>
<p>And make sure other members of your team have easy access, too, and know where to find the link. You never know when someone might want to ask for a Facebook review.</p>
<h3>Set up automated notifications for new reviews</h3>
<p>To manage your Facebook reviews, you need to know when you have a new one. Checking regularly is good practice, but to save yourself time, you can set up automatic notifications for any new review.</p>
<p>On your Facebook business page, go to the “Notifications” tab and make sure you’ve got the “New Reviews” options selected.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/5-star-facebook-review-moving-service-png.webp" alt="5-star review for a moving service on facebook" width="451" height="272" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91178" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/5-star-facebook-review-moving-service-png.webp 451w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/5-star-facebook-review-moving-service-300x181.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You want to be able to respond to a glowing review like this ASAP.</em></p>
<h3>Respond to all reviews</h3>
<p>You need to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-respond-to-google-reviews-with-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">respond to all of your reviews</a>. This is not only a good practice, it’s also important for ensuring a good Facebook business rating (more on this later) and boosting your brand’s trustworthiness. Studies show that businesses that respond to customer reviews are perceived as <a href="https://grow.google/intl/en_my/article-how-to-respond-to-reviews-on-google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.7 times</a> more trustworthy than brands who don’t respond.</p>
<p>Remember that your responses should be individualized when it’s called for, too. This is true for an exceptional and personal review as well as your negative reviews. When a frustrated customer reaches out, you should validate and accept their feedback, apologize for the poor experience, and provide a venue for follow-up communication to resolve the issue. And this brings us to our next step.</p>
<h3>Follow up with action on negative reviews</h3>
<p>When you have <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-respond-to-negative-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative reviews</a> that are specifically about a poor experience or a disappointing purchase, you need to follow up with an action. This should first be a follow-up communication off of your Facebook page, either a direct email or a phone call. And if possible, you should offer a solution to rectify the situation, like a replacement item, a discount, or a correction in your services.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/negative-facebook-review-example-plus-response-png.webp" alt="example of a negative facebook review with a response" width="1066" height="601" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91188" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/negative-facebook-review-example-plus-response-png.webp 1066w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/negative-facebook-review-example-plus-response-980x553.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/negative-facebook-review-example-plus-response-480x271.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1066px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A good prompt response that validates and promises a follow-up action.</em></p>
<h3>Flag inappropriate or fake content right away</h3>
<p>Now, let’s be clear. You can’t curate your Facebook reviews (and you can’t delete them just because you don’t like them). Negative reviews will stay there (and that’s not always bad), and lukewarm recommendations will be visible, too. But if there is content that is inappropriate, it’s your responsibility to report it. If it’s a fake review, you want to report it.</p>
<p>You can do so easily by clicking the three dots (&#8230;) next to the review, selecting “​​Find Support or Report Review,” and then following the prompts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this won’t delete the content automatically, but it is the first step in removing it from your page.</p>
<h3>Monitor your Facebook business score</h3>
<p>Before 2018, all Facebook reviews included star ratings. In 2018, the platform changed the format of reviews to a simple question: “Do you recommend the business or not?” Then, respondents have the opportunity to include a narrative review.</p>
<p>Once your page has five or more Facebook reviews, the platform will assign your business a rating. According to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/579645403238373" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta</a>, this rating reflects an average of your customers’ satisfaction with your business and your products or services. This includes your recommendations as well as your reviews.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/facebook-business-page-recommended-percentage-png.webp" alt="facebook business page recommended percentage" width="1200" height="753" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91185" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/facebook-business-page-recommended-percentage-png.webp 1200w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/facebook-business-page-recommended-percentage-980x615.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/facebook-business-page-recommended-percentage-480x301.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here, the rating appears with other relevant information right on the Facebook business page.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, you don’t have much control over this rating or visibility into the specific weighting system. That’s why it’s especially important to keep an eye on it.</p>
<h3>Optimize your Facebook business page</h3>
<p>You’re putting a lot of effort into generating Facebook reviews and monitoring this feedback from your customers. Make sure you’re paying attention to the rest of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/16/facebook-business-page">Facebook business page</a>, too.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/facebook-business-page-example-landmark-fine-homes-png.webp" alt="facebook business page for landmark fine homes" width="870" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91190" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/facebook-business-page-example-landmark-fine-homes-png.webp 870w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/facebook-business-page-example-landmark-fine-homes-480x497.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 870px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>On brand and up to date.</em></p>
<p>If your customers are on the platform, take advantage of this. Post regular updates, share shoppable links, and ensure all of your business information—especially hours and contact information—is up to date.</p>
<h2>Use this guide to get more Facebook reviews</h2>
<p>Okay, this was a lot on Facebook reviews to cover. But keep in mind that most of the setup steps are one-offs—important, but quick to go through. The key is to set up automated solicitations for reviews, make a habit of asking for Facebook reviews when it’s possible, and keep track of new reviews when they come in.</p>
<p>Now, you’re equipped with everything you need to know to get started growing your Facebook reviews. Good luck!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re like me, you’ve been logging onto X (formerly Twitter) less and less over the last year, whether it’s for personal scrolling or work-related account management.</p>
<p>And if you’re also like me, you’ve been asking whether or not businesses should be on Bluesky, what that audience looks like, and how the platform functions.</p>
<p>Today, we’re answering these questions and more in this guide to Bluesky for marketers.</p>

<h2>What is Bluesky?</h2>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bluesky</a> is a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">social media platform</a> that allows users to post short copy posts, images, and videos. While videos and images are prevalent, Bluesky is similar to X in that the platform features more text-based posts. While the character limit is 350 per post, Bluesky allows users to group longer content in threads.</p>
<p>This similarity to X is by design. Bluesky originally launched back in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/11/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-announces-bluesky-social-media-standards-push.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019</a> as a research project at X that was focused on exploring decentralized social media. It became its own independent company in 2021 when Jack Dorsey left then Twitter.</p>
<p>The platform grew by invitation only in 2023 before finally becoming open to all users (over 13 years of age) in early 2024. (It’s worth noting that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/07/jack-dorsey-quits-bluesky-board-urges-users-stay-elon-musk-x-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jack Dorsey left Bluesky in 2024</a>, too, but this has more to do with the platform’s founding story than its use in your marketing strategy.)</p>
<p>When it comes to your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/07/best-marketing-strategies"> marketing strategy</a>, Bluesky will likely look familiar to other social media platforms. In terms of layout and platform experience, it’s very similar to X. The left-hand menu, the dual-option Discover and Following feeds, and the publish button are a lot like its competitor platform if not exactly the same.</p>
<p>If you’ve been active on X, you’ll be able to navigate the Bluesky platform easily.</p>

<div id="how-is-bluesky-different"></div>
<h2>How is Bluesky different from other social media platforms?</h2>
<p>As an X competitor, Bluesky is similar to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/26/instagram-threads">Instagram Threads</a> and Mastodon. These platforms use the same approach to short-form posts that enable conversations with other platform users.</p>
<p>Here are a few key ways that Bluesky is different.</p>
<h3>Decentralized</h3>
<p>Bluesky is decentralized. This means that it runs on an open AT protocol, which isn’t controlled by a single organization.</p>
<p>Because there isn’t centralized control, users have more control over their data and, importantly, their app experience. There is not a single, central instance of the Bluesky platform. Users can customize and build feeds to tailor their experience on the app to their interests.</p>
<p>In fact, there are more than <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3lbd2ee2pwd2r" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50,000</a> algorithmic feeds that users can opt into.</p>
<h3>Data control<strong> </strong></h3>
<p>Even though this is a result of the decentralized platform, data control is worth calling out specifically. Bluesky gives users more control over where their data is stored or not stored, unlike competitors like Threads, which is connected and controlled by Meta.</p>
<p>This control means more user privacy, but it also means less insight into analytics on the platform.</p>
<h3>Community</h3>
<p>Other platform algorithms prioritized the network effect with an algorithm serving content and profiles. Bluesky allows users more control over the feed and the content they consume on the platform, so the focus is on creating many communities of users tied together by common interests and, in turn, common content.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-discover-png.avif" alt="Bluesky for marketing - discover page." width="510" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-90692 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-discover-png.avif 510w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-discover-255x300.avif 255w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-discover-480x565.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Instead of serving a single algorithm-driven feed, Bluesky allows users to subscribe to multiple feeds and curate their experience on the platform.</em></p>
<h3>Ads</h3>
<p>Here’s where Bluesky really diverges from its closest competitors. For now, the platform is completely ad-free. That’s important to note for your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/stretch-your-marketing-budget">marketing budget</a> and strategy. So, while you won’t put dollars directly into <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/12/how-to-generate-leads">getting leads</a> on Bluesky, you may need to invest more time in doing so since there are no <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/ppc">paid ad</a> shortcuts.</p>
<div id="how-popular-is-bluesky"></div>
<h2>How popular is Bluesky?</h2>
<p>Bluesky has <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/how-and-why-to-join-bluesky-which-now-has-30-million-users-as-a-twitter-alternative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30 million</a> users. Now, this might sound dismissable when you consider the fact that X has <a href="https://backlinko.com/twitter-users" target="_blank" rel="noopener">360 million</a> users and <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/threads-users" target="_blank" rel="noopener">320 million</a> people use Instagram Threads. Each of those is dwarfed by LinkedIn—another platform that’s a little more text-focused—and has <a href="https://about.linkedin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 billion users</a> worldwide.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-milestone-png.avif" alt="Bluesky for marketing - post from Bluesky about growth milestone." width="936" height="237" class="aligncenter wp-image-90693 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-milestone-png.avif 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-milestone-300x76.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-milestone-768x194.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-milestone-480x122.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bsky.app/post/3lh5iyaqqos24" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></p>
<p>But it’s important to call out how quickly Bluesky’s user base is growing. The total audience on the platform more than doubled between October and December last year.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-statista-png.avif" alt="Bluesky for marketing - bar graph from Statista." width="789" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-90694 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-statista-png.avif 789w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-statista-300x228.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-statista-768x584.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-statista-480x365.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 789px) 100vw, 789px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/bluesky-users" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>There were two major factors that contributed to growth in the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dm0ljg4y6o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fall of 2024</a>: The continued <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/05/29/every-way-twitter-has-gotten-worse-since-it-became-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decline of X</a> and the US presidential election. Both left users looking for alternative social media platforms.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-x-loss-png.avif" alt="Bluesky for marketing - graph showing X decline and Bluesky growth." width="822" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-90695 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-x-loss-png.avif 822w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-x-loss-300x219.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-x-loss-768x561.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-x-loss-480x350.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px" /></p>
<p>The rapid rise of accessible audiences makes Bluesky worthy of a look for many marketers.</p>
<div id="who-uses-bluesky"></div>
<h2>Who uses Bluesky?</h2>
<p>Because of Bluesky’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/22/customer-data-privacy">data privacy</a>, the demographic information about accounts isn’t as widely available as it might be on other social media platforms. Still, there’s plenty of information that can tell you who is spending the most time on the website.</p>
<p>Overall, Bluesky users are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>US-based: </strong>In 2024, nearly <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/website/bsky.app/#geography" target="_blank" rel="noopener">48%</a> of traffic to Bluesky originated in the US, followed by 5% from the United Kingdom and 5% from Japan. This is a big gap between the US and the next countries.</li>
<li><strong>Mostly male-identifying.</strong> <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/website/bsky.app/#geography" target="_blank" rel="noopener">61%</a> of app users are men. According to <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/bluesky-users" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exploding Topics</a>, this is similar to X (60.9% men and 39.1% women) and not too far off from Facebook (56.8% men and 43.2% women).</li>
<li><strong>Under 35: </strong><a href="https://www.similarweb.com/website/bsky.app/#geography" target="_blank" rel="noopener">33%</a> of users fall between 18 and 22 years of age, and another 27.26% are 25-34. That means 60% of Bluesky users are under 35.</li>
<li><strong>iPhone users: </strong>Throughout 2023 and 2024, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1382164/bluesky-worldwide-downloads-by-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more Bluesky app downloads</a> occurred on iOS devices than on Android devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>This overview is a good way to figure out if your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/22/customer-data-privacy">target audience</a> is on Bluesky and whether or not your brand should be, too. There’s one more crucial question.</p>
<h3>But are there businesses on Bluesky?</h3>
<p>With 30 million users, limited analytics, and no ads, Bluesky isn’t going out of its way to attract businesses to its platform. But that doesn’t mean the platform is devoid of company accounts. Some of the most popular accounts on the platform are corporate news media accounts. The Onion has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/theonion.com">1.1 million</a> followers, and so does the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nytimes.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Times.</a></p>
<p>However, most brands have far fewer followers. For example, Netflix has<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/netflix.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 49,000</a> followers on Bluesky and<a href="https://x.com/netflix" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 22 million</a> on X.</p>

<h2>3 things you can do for your business on Bluesky now</h2>
<p>You may not want to devote a big chunk of your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-calendar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing calendar</a> or budget to Bluesky just yet. But it’s worthwhile to be on the platform if just to secure your account and watch how the app evolves. Here are a few things you can do on Bluesky now while you wait and see if it’s worth a bigger investment in the future.</p>
<h3>1. Claim your profile</h3>
<p>At a minimum, you want to ensure you have first dibs on your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/08/business-name-ideas"> brand name</a>. Ideally, you’ll also want to make your profile recognizable with brand colors, graphics, copy, and more. This will let you benefit from<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/brand-awareness-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> brand recognition</a> and use the stop at your profile to leave a positive impression, even if you’re not active on the platform.</p>
<p>Compare these examples from two well-known brands.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-red-bull-png.avif" alt="Bluesky for marketing - post from RedBull" width="510" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-90697 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-red-bull-png.avif 510w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-red-bull-255x300.avif 255w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-red-bull-480x565.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /></p>
<p>This is a blank profile for Red Bull. But there’s a brand header image and profile photo. There’s also the<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/brand-slogans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> slogan</a> in the bio. I know, visiting this profile, that it’s Red Bull, but they don’t really use Bluesky yet.</p>
<p>Now, here’s the best option for Dunkin’ that comes up for a search on the platform.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-dunkin-donuts-png.avif" alt="Bluesky for marketing - Dunkin account page." width="633" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-90698 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-dunkin-donuts-png.avif 633w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-dunkin-donuts-300x284.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-dunkin-donuts-480x455.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></p>
<p>It’s another blank profile, but there are no images with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/small-business-logo">logos</a> or brand colors and no quippy references in the bio. It doesn’t seem to be owned by the company, but this also isn’t super clear.</p>
<p>If you have people landing on a Bluesky handle with your brand name, you want it to be yours—and you want everyone to know that.</p>
<h3>2. Experiment to find your audience and voice</h3>
<p>You can use the fact that Bluesky is a newer platform with a smaller audience to your advantage and get creative as you find your footing. American Eagle is a great example of this. The clothing company has about <a href="https://x.com/AEO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">500,000</a> on X and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/americaneagle/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4 million</a> on Instagram. On Bluesky, American Eagle has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/americaneagle1977.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">92 followers</a>. Yup, you read that right.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-american-eagle-account-png.avif" alt="Bluesky for marketing - American Eagle account page." width="936" height="511" class="aligncenter wp-image-90699 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-american-eagle-account-png.avif 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-american-eagle-account-300x164.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-american-eagle-account-768x419.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-american-eagle-account-480x262.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" /></p>
<p>But the brand is using this low following to its advantage and testing out some content that’s quick, casual, and, in some cases, reminiscent of the best stream of conscious posting.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-american-eagle-png.avif" alt="Bluesky for marketing - posts from American Eagle." width="724" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-90700 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-american-eagle-png.avif 724w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-american-eagle-300x249.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-american-eagle-480x398.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>American Eagle’s Bluesky feed during the Grammy’s.</em></p>
<p>As you’re testing out the platform, don’t be afraid to get creative with your brand account, too. You never know what might grow your audience until you start trying.</p>
<h3>2. Leverage internal influencers and brand spokespeople</h3>
<p>Individual accounts will perform better on Bluesky. If your audience is spending time on the platform, and you have a founder or spokesperson interested in growing their following for the sake of the brand, it’s worth some devoted time and effort.</p>
<p>This strategy isn’t without precedent on other platforms and is not without success on Bluesky already. This is a big example. One of the top accounts on Bluesky is James Gunn, the co-CEO of DC Studios, with nearly a quarter of a million followers. On his account, he shares some personal content, including cat pictures. But most of the posts are about the world of DC, whether it’s confirming news of a second season or sharing a trailer for an upcoming movie.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-james-gunn-png.avif" alt="Bluesky for marketing - post from James Gunn." width="504" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-90701 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-james-gunn-png.avif 504w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-james-gunn-252x300.avif 252w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-james-gunn-480x571.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px" /></p>
<p>DC Studios? Not even on Bluesky.</p>
<p>Now, be aware that this isn’t without risk. If this person leaves the company, you’re just out those followers and that distribution channel. As long as you know that going into it, though, building an individual account in service of your brand could be a good strategy for finding your audience on Bluesky.</p>
<h2>Set up your Bluesky profile today</h2>
<p>This was a crash course in Bluesky for marketing: platform specifics, differentiators, audience demographics, and more. Now that you’re equipped with all this information, you can develop a clear plan to make the most of your brand’s presence on the platform.</p>
<p>It’s still early days for Bluesky. So keep checking on the platform’s updates and its growing user base to see when it should become a bigger part of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-media-strategy">social media marketing strategy</a>. But for now, lock down your brand’s account on Bluesky so you don’t lose your headstart.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LinkedIn is a massive platform that keeps on growing year after year. As the user base expands, there are more opportunities for industry niches, rising star influencers, and must-follow business accounts.</p>

<h2>Why does it matter when you post on LinkedIn?</h2>
<p>The time you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/generating-leads-on-linkedin">post on LinkedIn</a> impacts how your post is sorted, coded, and amplified by the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/11/08/linkedin-pulse">platform’s algorithm</a>. So, posting at the right times means a better chance your content gets in front of more people.</p>
<p>When you sign into your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/linkedin-company-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn page</a>, your feed is automatically sorted by “top” posts, as opposed to a chronological order of the most recent.</p>
<p>LinkedIn users <em>can</em> switch manually to the most recent if they choose to do that. But they’d have to do it every single time they log in. That’s because the platform wants to serve the posts identified as “top” by the algorithm first. Since most people won’t go through that trouble, “top” posts are seen the most.</p>
<p>Here’s my view, as an example.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin-wordstream-LinkedIn-post-png.webp" alt="Best time to post on LinkedIn - screenshot from LinkedIn account." width="774" height="880" class="aligncenter wp-image-90013 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin-wordstream-LinkedIn-post-png.webp 774w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin-wordstream-LinkedIn-post-480x546.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 774px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The top post is liked by Allen Finn, a marketer who previously wrote for the WordStream blog and regularly posts on LinkedIn (also relevant here is the fact that I’m married to him).</p>
<p>The actual content is shared by Emily Kramer, who runs the educational newsletter and advising program for marketers <a href="https://www.mkt1.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MKT1</a>. She also has nearly 35,000 followers on LinkedIn, where she regularly shares this type of deep-diving, insightful content.</p>
<p>My experience with LinkedIn here tells us a lot about how the algorithm works. For example, the LinkedIn algorithm prioritizes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accounts that you regularly interact with or are closely connected with: </strong>This includes accounts you engage with and follow.</li>
<li><strong>Accounts that other profiles comparable to yours interact with: </strong><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/linkedin-profile-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Profiles</a> comparable to yours may have the same industry experience, similar companies, close job titles, or even matching keywords in your bios.</li>
<li><strong>Posts with high engagement, especially in the form of substantive comments: </strong>The key word here is substantive. Those posts asking for a single emoji “vote”? LinkedIn is ruling these out.</li>
<li><strong>Posts with high-quality content: </strong>This means no spam or spam-like text or images, no clickbait with a million lines of only one or two words to entice a “see more” click.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re wondering what spam is, here’s how LinkedIn detects it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin-wordstream-spam-chart-png.webp" alt="Best time to post on LinkedIn - LinkedIn's process chart for detecting spam." width="1024" height="595" class="aligncenter wp-image-90015 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin-wordstream-spam-chart-png.webp 1024w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin-wordstream-spam-chart-980x569.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin-wordstream-spam-chart-480x279.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>According to </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/trust-and-safety/viral-spam-content-detection-at-linkedin" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em>, this is the model for spam detection.</em></p>
<p>So what does this have to do with the timing of your LinkedIn posts, you might be wondering?</p>
<p>The answer is all about engagement. The faster you can get engagement on a post, the more likely the algorithm will prioritize your post for more users. Then, the flywheel kicks in because more people will engage with your post, and the algorithm will show it to even more people.</p>
<p>So, timing your post for the most early engagement is key to getting more overall engagement. Here’s how to do it.</p>

<h2>What’s the best time to post on LinkedIn overall?</h2>
<p><a href="https://buffer.com/resources/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buffer</a> analyzed 1 million posts sent through its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/17/best-free-social-media-management-tools">social media scheduling platform</a> to determine the best time to post on LinkedIn. According to the data, it’s best to post on weekdays <strong>between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. in your local time zone. </strong>And it’s slightly better to post between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://buffer.com/resources/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buffer data</a> shows that the best time to post on LinkedIn is 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays</em></p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind here is that Buffer’s data only accounts for pre-scheduled posts through the platform, which doesn’t allow you to tag other LinkedIn accounts. Tagging other users can be a big source of engagement.</p>
<p>Still, Buffer’s data is an excellent starting place for guidance on the best time to post on LinkedIn if you have no other data. When you get started, prioritize posting on LinkedIn on weekdays during typical work hours, focusing on Tuesday and Thursday mornings when possible.</p>

<h2>What is the best time to post on LinkedIn for your industry?</h2>
<p>The most important thing to keep in mind when posting on LinkedIn is when <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">your audience</a> is online. You want to share your content at the moment it’s most likely to elicit engagement—meaning lots of quality comments, reshares, and reactions.</p>
<p>Whether you’re growing a business account or your own personal brand, the industry you’re targeting matters. <a href="https://www.socialpilot.co/blog/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social Pilot</a> analyzed the engagement for more than 50,000 LinkedIn accounts to determine the best times to post on LinkedIn to reach people in your sector.</p>
<p>According to the data, here are the best times to post on LinkedIn for your industry:</p>

<p>Overall, these ideal times align with the general advice to post during typical office hours on weekdays, prioritizing Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. But there are some specifics to pay attention to. For instance, manufacturing skews slightly earlier, perhaps due to the influence of early job site hours. And marketing has a bigger window, three days with morning hours. The bottom line is to check the top times to post for your industry and try these out.</p>

<h2>What are the best days to post on LinkedIn?</h2>
<p>Now, there isn’t a general consensus here.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buffer</a>, Thursday is the best day to post on LinkedIn because it yields the most engagement. This is closely followed by Wednesday and Tuesday, which isn’t a surprise if you take a look at the best days by industry. Many of them include one or both days.</p>
<p>In mid-2024, the social media management platform <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin/#The_best_time_to_post_on_LinkedIn_by_day_of_the_week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hootsuite</a> analyzed 1 million social media posts and determined that posts on Tuesday received the most engagement. This tracks with the data from multiple studies that point toward Tuesday as a peak day for most industries. At the same time, Thursday appears regularly, too.</p>
<p>Our take: <strong>Keep prioritizing posts on both Tuesdays and Thursdays</strong>. If you’re able to share quality content multiple times a week, that will be better for growing your following and generating engagement, anyway.</p>
<div id="worst-days-to-post-on-linkedin"></div>
<h2>What are the worst days to post on LinkedIn?</h2>
<p>LinkedIn has over <a href="https://news.linkedin.com/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 billion users</a>, with more than 250 million of these individuals in the United States. The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/50-linkedin-statistics-every-professional-should-ti9ue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top industries</a> on the platform include technology, financial services, and higher education. These are industries with Monday-to-Friday job schedules, most often with typical office hours.</p>
<p>With this majority in mind, it’s no wonder that the slow days on LinkedIn are Saturday and Sunday. Buffer’s research backs that up, noting a considerable drop in engagement for any posts on those days.</p>
<p>While some influencers on the platform maintain their activity level every day, the data suggests that it isn’t moving the needle for brand accounts. So feel free to avoid posting on the weekend and save your best material for mid-week.</p>

<h2>How do you find the best and worst times to post on LinkedIn for your audience?</h2>
<p>The guidance above is valuable for setting your schedule and cadence for posting on LinkedIn. But to keep <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-media-strategy">growing your account</a>, you need to get more specific with the better, more accurate data you have access to.</p>
<p>That means reviewing your posts’ performance and your audience’s behaviors to determine the best and worst times to post on LinkedIn. Here’s how.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, on your company page, click on the analytics tab from the left-hand menu.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin-wordstream-analytics-menu-png.webp" alt="Best time to post on LinkedIn - LinkedIn Analytics menu." width="302" height="942" class="aligncenter wp-image-90017 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin-wordstream-analytics-menu-png.webp 302w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin-wordstream-analytics-menu-96x300.webp 96w" sizes="(max-width: 302px) 100vw, 302px" /></li>
<li>Then, select “Content” from the Analytics menu. You should also set a date range, whether it’s by month, quarter, or a look at the last year.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin-wordstream-analytics-time-range-1024x218.webp" alt="Best time to post on LinkedIn - analytics date range." width="1024" height="218" class="aligncenter wp-image-90019 size-large" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin-wordstream-analytics-time-range-1024x218.webp 1024w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin-wordstream-analytics-time-range-300x64.webp 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin-wordstream-analytics-time-range-768x163.webp 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin-wordstream-analytics-time-range-1080x230.webp 1080w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin-wordstream-analytics-time-range-980x208.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin-wordstream-analytics-time-range-480x102.webp 480w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/best-time-to-post-on-linkedin-wordstream-analytics-time-range-png.webp 1194w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></li>
<li>On the Content page, you will see a drop-down option to look at impressions, members reached, clicks, comments, reactions, reposts, and engagement rates. Once you select a metric to focus on, you’ll see a visualization. If you scroll down, you’ll also be able to look at the performance metrics for each individual post.</li>
<li>Take a look at patterns with days of the week. Unfortunately, LinkedIn won’t add in the time for each post. But you can export the data and add this yourself to identify patterns (specifically, the times that posts tend to perform well and the times when they don’t).</li>
<li>Use this data to inform your posting schedule, and keep checking on it to refine your plan and grow your account.</li>
</ol>
<h2>TL;DR: When to post on LinkedIn</h2>
<p>Overall, the best times to post on LinkedIn are Tuesdays and Thursdays between 10 a.m. and 12 p.m. in your local time zone. The worst times are over the weekends when the professional platform is a bit of a dead zone.</p>
<p>But the best time to post on LinkedIn is really the one that yields the most impactful engagement from <em>your</em> audience. So, once you have some data to look into, follow the steps to check your work and find trends. Then, you can keep posting on LinkedIn and growing your platform even more strategically…and watching that engagement skyrocket!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Instagram Threads has been around for over a year now, but it seems like the activity on the platform has really picked up. Accounts I follow are writing more long-winded Threads about books, news outlets are threading (is “threading” a word?) breaking stories more frequently, and—most relevant for me—a bunch of brands are distributing product information on Threads. It’s enough to make any marketer want to test out the platform.</p>
<p>If you’re also interested in testing out Instagram Threads, you’ll find everything you need to know about it in this guide. We’ve included how to create content, best practices for engaging, how to align your Threads strategy with your marketing goals, how to track your metrics, and common mistakes to avoid.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to cover, so let’s get started.</p>

<h2>What is Instagram Threads?</h2>
<p>Instagram Threads is a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms"> social media app</a> that allows for conversational posts and replies. It was launched by Meta (the makers of Facebook and Instagram) in July of 2023.</p>
<p>While Instagram focuses on video and image-based content, Threads offers users a text-based forum to stay connected with followers. The platform allows users to post up to 500 characters, including links, photos,<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/23/instagram-carousel-ads"> carousels</a>, and videos up to<a href="https://about.instagram.com/threads" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> five minutes long</a>. It also enables users to connect these posts in Threads, similar to  X (formerly Twitter).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/instagram-threads-wordstream-zuck.webp" alt="Instagram Threads - Thread from Mark Zuckerberg." width="743" height="205" class="aligncenter wp-image-89334 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/instagram-threads-wordstream-zuck.webp 743w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/instagram-threads-wordstream-zuck-480x132.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 743px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Founder Mark Zuckerberg posted the inaugural Thread on 7/3/23 to get the conversation started.</em></p>
<p>This similarity to X is intentional, which is something to keep in mind when <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-marketing">marketing on Instagram</a>. Some users were frustrated with<a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2023-deep-dive-the-state-of-twitter-in-april-https:/datareportal.com/reports/digital-2023-deep-dive-the-state-of-twitter-in-april-20232023" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> changes in the X app</a>, which prompted a migration to the new competitor, Threads. Thread’s growth was bolstered by its integration with Instagram, which already had a large user base.</p>

<div id="why-does-instagram-threads-matter"></div>
<h2>Why does Instagram Threads matter?</h2>
<p>As of September 2024, Instagram Threads had over <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/threads-users" target="_blank" rel="noopener">200 million monthly active users</a>, and the platform set multiple records while accruing almost 100 million total users within its first four days.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/instagram-threads-wordstream-threads-users.webp" alt="Instagram Threads - Graph of Threads users." width="782" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-89335 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/instagram-threads-wordstream-threads-users.webp 782w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/instagram-threads-wordstream-threads-users-480x368.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 782px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/threads-users" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>This isn’t nearly as high as<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/09/instagram-bios"> Instagram</a>, which has<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 2 billion monthly active users</a>, but it’s exceptionally strong growth for a new platform. The large and quickly growing audience indicates that your business should establish a presence on Threads.</p>
<p>There are some clear benefits of using Instagram Threads for your business:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grow beyond Instagram: </strong>With 200 million active users, Threads offers an opportunity to grow your reach, particularly beyond your regular Instagram audience.</li>
<li><strong>Establish your brand identity: </strong>There are already brands active on Threads, but they haven’t overwhelmed Thread’s feed. Setting up your Threads profile and posting content regularly now establishes your brand identity on the platform, which will be important as it continues to grow.</li>
<li><strong>Take advantage of the text-based platform: </strong>Whether or not your brand was previously active on X, you can take advantage of the text-based content that Threads allows. This gives you more space for explanations, conversations, and quips that don’t rely on visuals.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s also good to note that Threads has <a href="https://martech.org/marketing-on-threads-what-you-need-to-know/#h-threads-begins-a-limited-early-test-of-advertising" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begun testing ads</a> for a limited number of brands. It’s likely that the program will roll out for more businesses soon.</p>

<h2>7 steps to use Instagram Threads for growth</h2>
<p>Instagram Threads is an excellent platform to show off your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">brand personality</a>, develop your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">brand’s presence</a> on the platform, and engage with your audience directly. Here’s how to do it.</p>
<h3>1. Set up your account</h3>
<p>If you haven’t already, it’s time to set up your account. Luckily, this is straightforward, especially because it’s already connected to your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/09/instagram-bios">Instagram account</a>.</p>
<p>To get started, you can navigate to <a href="http://threads.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threads.net</a> and log in with your Instagram username and password.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/instagram-threads-wordstream-login.webp" alt="Instagram Threads - Threads login screen." width="543" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-89337 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/instagram-threads-wordstream-login.webp 543w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/instagram-threads-wordstream-login-480x530.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 543px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Your profile will automatically populate with your Instagram <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-media-image-sizes">profile picture</a>, bio, and links, as well as your Instagram followers. It’s worth noting that if you have a verified account, you can’t edit your profile picture in Threads, only on Instagram. Otherwise, you can edit your bio directly on Threads.</p>
<p>Be sure to determine whether your profile is private (which will limit your visibility) or public (better for brand accounts).</p>
<p>With your profile set up, you’re ready to get started.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Free guide!</strong> <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite30BestWaysToPromote.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Marketing_The30BestWaysToPromoteYourBusiness_Download">The 30 Best Ways to Promote Your Business</a></p>
<h3>2. Create compelling content</h3>
<p>The Threads <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-algorithm">algorithm</a> prioritizes content with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/27/how-to-increase-instagram-engagement">high engagement</a>, which is no surprise considering the conversational design of the platform. So, your primary goal should be to create entertaining, thought-provoking content that your audience can respond to.</p>
<p>This could take the form of a multi-post thread summarizing a recent article, responding to a trend in your industry, or breaking down how to use your product or service. It could also be a single post update with all the details for upcoming sales, releases, or events. The latter is what Netflix primarily posts on its Threads account.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/instagram-threads-wordstream-netflix.webp" alt="Instagram Threads - Thread from Netflix." width="404" height="593" class="aligncenter wp-image-89338 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/instagram-threads-wordstream-netflix.webp 404w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/instagram-threads-wordstream-netflix-204x300.webp 204w" sizes="(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px" /></p>
<p>And remember, not every post has to be long or even serious. If it fits with your brand, short and sweet or even silly works well on Instagram Threads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/instagram-threads-wordstream-funny.webp" alt="Instagram Threads - Thread from Tostitos." width="877" height="484" class="aligncenter wp-image-89339 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/instagram-threads-wordstream-funny.webp 877w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/instagram-threads-wordstream-funny-480x265.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 877px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>3. Pay attention to your formatting</h3>
<p>In your posts, Instagram Threads allows you to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to 500 characters</li>
<li>Links</li>
<li>Photo content</li>
<li>Carousels of photos or GIFs</li>
<li>Videos of up to 5 minutes</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/20/daily-hashtags">Hashtags</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to keep these guidelines in mind when you’re creating content. And it’s equally important to consider the best way to convey your point when planning<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-plan"> your posts</a>. Sometimes, a video might make sense; other times, you might skip the visuals and lean on text-based Threads with plenty of line breaks and emoji to encourage quick reading.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/instagram-threads-wordstream-leave.webp" alt="Instagram Threads - Holiday themed Thread." width="468" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-89340 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/instagram-threads-wordstream-leave.webp 468w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/instagram-threads-wordstream-leave-234x300.webp 234w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Hashtag-heavy text and a carousel of holiday decor work for this ~ signing offline ~ post.</em></p>
<p>Mixing up the format of your posts is a good way to discover what works for your brand and your audience. Just remember to keep your voice and your themes consistent.</p>
<h3>4. Engaging with your audience</h3>
<p>The primary benefit of using Threads versus Instagram’s primary platform is the ability to start, continue, or contribute to public conversations. You want to prioritize engaging with your audience on the platform as a part of your Instagram Threads strategy. Here’s how users interact with content on Instagram Threads:</p>
<ul>
<li>Views</li>
<li>Likes</li>
<li>Quotes</li>
<li>Replies</li>
<li>Reposts</li>
</ul>
<p>When you’re creating your content, consider how you’re encouraging engagement. This could be as simple as publishing a funny one-liner that you’re hoping will encourage smiles and likes, or it could be a more explicit request for replies and reposts in the form of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">calls to action</a> (CTAs). Instagram Threads also offers interactive content, including polls, questions, and stickers that you can try out.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/instagram-threads-wordstream-question.webp" alt="Instagram Threads - Thread with a question." width="771" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-89341 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/instagram-threads-wordstream-question.webp 771w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/instagram-threads-wordstream-question-480x374.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 771px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A curious question? Excellent for engagement.</em></p>
<p>Remember, your goal is to create a sense of community and participate in conversations. That means you also need to engage with content. Respond to replies on your content, and take the time to reply, repost, or quote relevant Threads from other accounts, too.</p>
<h3>5. Consider your marketing goals</h3>
<p>Whenever you’re looking into new marketing platforms, it’s important to think about how the channel aligns with your existing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/15/marketing-objectives">marketing objectives</a>. Instagram Threads could be a great place to pursue a few different marketing goals, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lead generation</strong>: If your goal is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-generation-ideas">generate leads</a>, consider how you’re building an audience and sharing links to your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/lead-generation-website-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lead-capturing website</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Brand awareness</strong>: Use your content to discuss the problems your product or service solves and mention your solution as appropriate.</li>
<li><strong>Customer education</strong>: Share tutorials, FAQs, and value-packed tips for customers or potential clients.</li>
<li><strong>Product or service launches</strong>: Focus your content around sneak peeks, previews, countdowns, and in-depth announcements on launch days.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key is making sure it works for your business, your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">audience</a>, and your workflow.</p>
<h3>6. Track your performance on Instagram Threads</h3>
<p>In order to accurately align your Instagram Threads strategy to your marketing goals, you need to track your performance. According to <a href="https://business.facebook.com/business/help/metrics-labeling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta</a>, more robust Instagram Threads analytics will be available soon. But for now, the Insights tab in your threads account offers a good overview. This includes your views, interactions, top posts, and your followers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/instagram-threads-wordstream-settings.webp" alt="Instagram Threads - Menu from Threads account." width="509" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-89342 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/instagram-threads-wordstream-settings.webp 509w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/instagram-threads-wordstream-settings-480x566.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 509px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Access Insights by clicking on the settings menu in your Threads account.</em></p>
<p>Also, if you’re already using a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/17/best-free-social-media-management-tools">social media management tool</a> to schedule and monitor your other social media accounts, you can also track your Instagram Threads performance there.</p>
<h3>7. Avoid common mistakes</h3>
<p>If you’re going through the trouble of learning about a new <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">social media platform</a>, setting up a profile, and creating content, it would be silly to undermine those efforts by making simple mistakes.</p>
<p>Here are a few common mistakes to avoid when you’re getting started on Instagram Threads:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Making it too complicated: </strong>Threads is a casual, conversational platform. Try not to make your strategy or content too complicated.</li>
<li><strong>Straying from your brand voice: </strong>Your content and profile on Threads should be recognizable as your brand. That means sticking to your brand voice and your brand values.</li>
<li><strong>Ignoring your audience: </strong>You can’t just drop posts and hope they engage your audience on their own. You’ll need to dive into the conversations for your account to grow.</li>
<li><strong>Forgetting your settings: </strong>To grow your brand’s presence on Instagram Threads, you need to have a public profile that allows responses from followers and non-followers alike. Double-check your settings.</li>
</ol>

<h2>What is a target audience?</h2>
<p>Many of the search ads, social ads, commercials, and other marketing promotions that you see are created with the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a> in mind. A target audience is a group of people with shared attributes you intend to reach with your marketing campaign or materials.</p>
<p>Here are the common attributes of a well-defined target audience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics: </strong>Think age, gender identity, job title, education, location, marital status.</li>
<li><strong>Motivations: </strong>Is the person concerned with personal safety, the environment? Interested in learning new things?</li>
<li><strong>Pain points: </strong>How are their current solutions not working?</li>
<li><strong>Marketing channels: </strong>Do these individuals watch TV, spend time on Facebook, or scroll TikTok? Where can you reach them?</li>
<li><strong>Content preference: </strong>Would they prefer a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post">blog post</a> or a newsletter? A how-to video or a case study?</li>
</ul>

<p>Figuring out these details will help you fill out a specific target audience—which will help make your marketing stronger.</p>

<div id="why-do-you-need-a-target-audience"></div>
<h2>Why you need a target audience</h2>
<p>To avoid targeting everyone and no one—and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/losing-money-in-google-ads">wasting your budgeted ad spend</a> in the process—you need a target audience.</p>
<p>When the target audience is missing or muddy, it’s obvious. Take this commercial from T Mobile that was somehow a Super Bowl spot in 2024, for example.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YVeCwSWNLrM?si=riJj2FkPjZW7o3Ri" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>It is entirely unclear who this is for—Scrubs fans? Musical fans? Aquaman fans? Suburbanites with internet issues and parties to host? As far as I can tell, there’s no specific customer profile in mind. That’s what makes this commercial so frustrating for me. This seems like it was created with a little something for everyone, but by appealing to everyone, you’re often appealing to no one. And this makes your marketing and advertising ineffective.</p>

<h2>12 real-world target audience examples</h2>
<p>The examples below feature brands, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/04/marketing-collateral">marketing assets</a> directly reaching a specific group of people, and a breakdown of that target audience. We may have the full brief of demographics, motivations, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-pain-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pain points</a>, and all—not many people share their target audience definition publicly—but there’s a lot we can infer. And with that, there’s a lot to learn from.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<div id="lowes-suburban-parents"></div>
<h3>1. Lowes: Suburban parents</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://www.ispot.tv/ad/nBuA/lowes-summer-is-open" target="_blank" rel="noopener">television commercial from Lowes</a> promises to help turn any backyard into a summer hot spot, or, well, all summer hot pots. This campaign ran in the summer of 2020 and highlighted products that can make a backyard filled with fun, quality time, and escape even during lockdowns and quarantines.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-lowes.webp" alt="example of ad from lowes" width="885" height="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89120" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-lowes.webp 885w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-lowes-480x271.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 885px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here’s who they’re targeting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics: </strong>Parents ages 30s-40s with young kids who are suburban homeowners with disposable income.</li>
<li><strong>Motivations: </strong>Spending quality time outside; making memories for their kids.</li>
<li><strong>Pain points: </strong>Pandemic-related closures limiting summer plans and family memories; unusable or unwelcoming yard space.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Jeni’s Ice Cream: Corporate gifters</h3>
<p>I received this email a few weeks ago from Jeni’s, which makes delicious and occasionally odd flavors of ice cream sold in scoop shops, grocery stores, and through their website.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-jenis.webp" alt="example of marketing email from jenis ice cream targeting professionals" width="353" height="583" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89121" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-jenis.webp 353w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-jenis-182x300.webp 182w" sizes="(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px" /></p>
<p>Let’s start with the imagery. The open Mac laptop reads tech, finance, startups—and, of course, money. It’s clear that the focus is a corporate audience. The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/21/emotional-ad-copy-examples">copy</a> is also telling. While “a lot of gifts” is vague, it’s also casual and implies being busy. This tracks with the rest of the wording—promising a “quick” way to send more than 25 gifts at once.</p>

<h3>3. Peloton: Fitness Newbies</h3>
<p>It’s hard to think of a Peloton ad and not think of <em>the </em>Peloton ad. But this commercial takes a different tactic (and, well, a less problematic and less viral one).</p>
<p>Here, Peloton is appealing to those new to fitness and interested in establishing a routine, regardless of physical goals. Instead, this ad stresses that taking Peloton classes can be fun.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RGv9hBLUteY?si=_4u3rI-yAkJd5YgP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s who we can infer they’re targeting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics: </strong>This is wider, but it’s still limited to those who can afford to shell out more than $1,000 for a bike and $40 for a monthly subscription.</li>
<li><strong>Motivations: </strong>Trying something new, enjoying fitness, finding a routine that works, engaging in community.</li>
<li><strong>Pain points: </strong>Fitness programs that are solitary and intimidating.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing channels: </strong>TV, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/optimize-youtube-ad-campaigns">YouTube</a>, Facebook.</li>
</ul>
<div id="usaa-veterans"></div>
<h3>4. USAA: Veterans</h3>
<p>In this Google Ad, this national bank is speaking to a specific audience: Veterans. USAA has an exclusive marketing contract with the United States Military, so its ads often include portrayals of veterans and those in service to appeal to this specific audience.</p>
<p>USAA still includes this in the ad copy. Take a look:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-usaa.webp" alt="example of google ad from usaa" width="749" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89122" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-usaa.webp 749w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-usaa-480x385.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 749px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of this target audience example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics: </strong>Veterans, specifically those interested in owning a home.</li>
<li><strong>Pain points: </strong>Cost and confusing mortgage processes.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing channels: </strong>Google Search.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Running Google Ads already and worried you&#8217;re wasting spend?</strong> Find out with a free, instant audit &gt;&gt; <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Google Ads Performance Grader</a></p>
<div id="northeastern-university-ambitious-college-grads"></div>
<h3>5. Northeastern University: Ambitious college grads</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://www.ispot.tv/ad/2zIB/northeastern-university-katherine-latoff-real-word-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this commercial</a>, Northeastern University highlights its co-op program and the opportunity to get real-world career experience while still enrolled in a full-time program. In this case, it’s a graduate degree program, which makes its target audience and their motivations clear.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-northwestern-university.webp" alt="example of video ad from northwestern university" width="875" height="510" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89123" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-northwestern-university.webp 875w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-northwestern-university-480x280.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 875px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here’s a potential breakdown of their target audience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics: </strong>Recent college graduations in their 20s living in urban settings with corporate career aspirations.</li>
<li><strong>Motivations: </strong>Getting farther in a career faster with more education.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing channels: </strong>YouTube, Facebook, Instagram.</li>
</ul>
<div id="figs-emergency-medical-responders"></div>
<h3>6. FIGS: Emergency Medical Responders</h3>
<p>FIGS scrubs are comfortable, youthful, and, most prominently, stylish. The sets come in bright colors, muted palettes, or bold ombre. The company offers tapered legs, jumpsuit styles, and grandfather collars. A lot of their marketing highlights these features, updated scrubs that you’re excited to grab for the day at work.</p>
<p>But this commercial shifts focus and takes a different tone entirely, and it’s clearly targeting a different audience. The emergency medical providers at the motorsport racing track pictured count on their well-fitting, durable gear not to inhibit their movement when seconds matter most. With this spot, FIGS highlights its durability, comfort, and reliability—and the grave impact of scrubs that fall short on any of these.</p>
<p><iframe title="FIGS EXTREMES | FIGS Scrubs" width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wORueepoCTw?feature=oembed"  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This target audience example includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics: </strong>Emergency medical professionals. This isn’t exclusive to motorsports, think paramedics, ER staff, ICU nurses.</li>
<li><strong>Motivations: </strong>Reliability in high-stress, high-stakes moments. No one needs their scrubs sagging down as a distraction in those moments.</li>
<li><strong>Pain points: </strong>Ill-fitting scrubs.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing channels: </strong>TV, Instagram, Facebook.</li>
</ul>
<div id="maisonette-parents-with-fashionable-babies"></div>
<h3>7. Maisonette: Parents with fashionable babies—in the Northern Hemisphere</h3>
<p>Maisonette is an ecommerce marketplace for boutique baby and kids clothing, toys, and more. I saw this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-nurturing-emails">marketing email</a> from the brand (where I love to virtually window shop) in my inbox in the fall:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-maisonette.webp" alt="example of email marketing message from baby retailer" width="462" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89124" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-maisonette.webp 462w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-maisonette-231x300.webp 231w" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/31/email-subject-lines">subject line</a> is already doing some work in telling us the target audience. The convention of an “edit” is used in fashion often. Vogue, for instance, regularly publishes with this structure: “The Essentials Edit,” “The Fall Edit,” etc. Fashionable kids and babies—or, really, parents who find this appealing.</p>
<p>Then, the copy in the first part of the marketing email and the products pictured define the target audience even further—locating it specifically in the Northeast where the temperatures are dropping.</p>
<p>Here’s a closer look at this target audience example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics: </strong>Parents of babies, toddlers, and young kids who live in the Northeast.</li>
<li><strong>Motivations: </strong>High-quality clothing, guaranteed to be cute and chic.</li>
<li><strong>Pain points: </strong>The same squishy, puffy, shapeless coats as every other kid.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing channels: </strong>Email, Instagram, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reddit-marketing">Reddit</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div id="cozy-earth-women-in-search-of-casual-outfits"></div>
<h3>8. Cozy Earth: Women in search of casual, cute, easy outfits</h3>
<p>Cozy Earth has served me this ad a few times now, and with good reason. The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-ad-targeting">Instagram video ad</a> shows a woman in her late 20s or early 30s in a curated, neutral homey setting getting dressed for a very temperate fall day, starting with a long, flowy dress and layering on a soft cable-knit sweater and accessories. The effect? Effortlessly put together. And the caption underscores this focus: “Maximum style, minimal effort.” The dream.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-cozyearth.webp" alt="example of instagram ad from cozy earth" width="353" height="584" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89125" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-cozyearth.webp 353w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-cozyearth-181x300.webp 181w" sizes="(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px" /></p>
<p>Here’s a potential breakdown of their target audience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics: </strong>Women ages 20s to 30s, with disposable income (based on Cozy Earth’s pricing).</li>
<li><strong>Motivations: </strong>The women in this target audience want to look nice and up-to-date…</li>
<li><strong>Pain points: </strong>But their primary pain point is a lack of time: to get ready, to plan outfits, to keep up with trends. Minimal effort means minimal time.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing channels: </strong>Instagram, YouTube, TikTok.</li>
</ul>
<div id="grammarly-customer-experience-leaders"></div>
<h3>9. Grammarly: Customer experience leaders</h3>
<p>Grammarly is a professional tool to review writing for errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation, as well as provide <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-uses-in-marketing">AI-powered suggestions</a> to improve tone, clarity, and more. It’s used in educational settings and in workplaces alike.</p>
<p>In the ad below, Grammarly is targeting a specific professional: CX, or customer experience, leaders.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-grammarly.webp" alt="example of ad from grammarly targeting cx audience" width="355" height="585" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89126" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-grammarly.webp 355w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-grammarly-182x300.webp 182w" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px" /></p>
<p>The jargon—something that a writing tool is keenly aware of—is on purpose. CX for customer experience appears in the headline, and then we see CSAT, or customer satisfaction, scores in the caption. By using this specific language, Grammarly is speaking directly to its target audience as an insider. So when it promises to share the secrets to other CX leaders&#8217; communication skills, it’s speaking with authority. In this case, it’s jargon done right.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a closer look at their potential target audience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics: </strong>Customer experience or customer service leaders.</li>
<li><strong>Motivations: </strong>Improving CSAT and NPS scores with stronger communication.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing channels: </strong>Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn.</li>
</ul>
<div id="bombas-healthcare-workers"></div>
<h3>10. Bombas: Healthcare workers</h3>
<p>I’ve received a few pairs of Bombas socks as gifts, and my primary association with the brand has been its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/purpose-driven-marketing">purpose-driven marketing</a> commitment to donate one essential item to someone experiencing homelessness for every item purchased. A great cause.</p>
<p>Lately, I’ve been seeing the brand’s Sunday slippers, grip slippers, and more across my Instagram feed. This video ad below is a great example—even though I’m not the target audience. In the clip, a healthcare worker getting up for the day slips into her Bombas slippers to get ready, pulls on scrubs, and Bombas compression socks that she swears by to avoid tired, achy feet during her long shifts.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-bombas.webp" alt="example of ad from bombas" width="344" height="581" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89127" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-bombas.webp 344w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-bombas-178x300.webp 178w" sizes="(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=794317596112168" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Here’s a closer look at the potential target audience for this ad:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics: </strong>Healthcare workers who are on their feet for long shifts.</li>
<li><strong>Motivations: </strong></li>
<li><strong>Pain points: </strong>Sore, tired feet from long hours at work—and activities like long runs or weekend weddings on off days.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing channels: </strong>Facebook, Instagram, TikTok.</li>
</ul>
<div id="optimizely-content-marketers"></div>
<h3>11. Optimizely: Content marketers</h3>
<p>Most of these examples are B2C because, without access to the campaign briefs, it’s often easier to determine the target audience for these ads. But here’s a great B2B example from Optimizely.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-optimizely.webp" alt="example of ad from optimizely" width="352" height="582" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89128" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-optimizely.webp 352w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-optimizely-181x300.webp 181w" sizes="(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px" /></p>

<li><strong>Demographics: </strong>Content marketers working in B2B or B2C with large workflows and multiple team members.</li>

</ul>

<div id="wellnessliving-yoga-studio-owners"></div>
<h3>12. Wellnessliving: Yoga studio owners</h3>
<p>Here is a perfect example from Wellnessliving, a software commonly used by gyms and workout studios. In this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/07/instagram-story-ads">Instagram Story ad</a>, Wellnessliving is targeting owners of yoga studios. It’s incredibly clear, and the ad is effective in its simplicity.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-wellnessliving.webp" alt="example of ad from wellnessliving" width="275" height="562" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89129" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-wellnessliving.webp 275w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/target-audience-example-wellnessliving-147x300.webp 147w" sizes="(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px" /></p>
<p>The static image Story ad shows two women in yoga gear smiling and features a simple headline: “Grow your yoga studio revenue by 57%” with a clear CTA to book a demo. You know who it’s talking to, what the offer is, and where clicking the link will take you. Talking to your target audience doesn’t have to be more complicated than this.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We know video will continue to be a major focus for marketers in 2025. At this point, it’s an essential medium across marketing goals and channels—social media strategy, product marketing, brand storytelling, customer education, content strategy, podcasting, ad placements, influencer marketing, and so much more.</p>
<p>That’s made video a mainstay in many marketing plans for small businesses, solopreneurs, and big corporations. But with last year’s proliferation of AI-enabled tools creating more possibilities and more content than ever before, we wanted to know how video marketing will change in 2025.</p>
<p>To figure that out, we turned to marketers, video producers, social media experts, and content creator professionals for their predictions on the video marketing trends that will dominate in 2025. We heard about AI growth, local content creation, repurposing strategies, and several other trends you&#8217;ll want to follow.</p>

<h2>8 video marketing trends for 2025</h2>
<p>Keep these <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/video-marketing-for-small-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video marketing</a> trends on replay to stay ahead this year.</p>
<div id="more-ai-tools"></div>
<h3>1. Even more AI tools will hit the scene</h3>
<p>If you were on the internet at all last year, you know that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-copywriting-tools">AI tools</a> were a big deal. This is definitely true for video.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-graph.webp" alt="Video marketing trends - Graph from Google Trends." width="885" height="543" class="aligncenter wp-image-88989 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-graph.webp 885w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-graph-480x295.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 885px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Searches for AI video examples, tools, and more grew steadily over the year, and they’ll continue to rise in 2025.</em></p>
<p>Previously, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/03/video-marketing-ideas">video content</a> was often expensive and time-consuming to create, edit, and distribute. Plus, it required proficiency with cameras and editing software. But with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/25/ai-content-generators">AI platforms designed for video production</a>, making videos became way easier. Platforms like <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-use-canva/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canva</a> and Vimeo added AI components to make video editing easier. Tools like Lumen5, Descript, and Synthesia leverage AI to generate scripts, splice clips, and even create digital avatars for marketing videos.</p>
<p>With these capabilities, it’s no wonder that experts expect AI to dominate video marketing trends in 2025. Simon Høiberg, the SaaS founder and YouTube personality, recently shared his confidence in AI videos on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/simonhoiberg_im-bullish-on-ai-videos-it-seems-like-ugcPost-7280567890292928513-dDuN/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-AI-video-linkedin-post.webp" alt="Video marketing trends - LinkedIn post." width="521" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88990 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-AI-video-linkedin-post.webp 521w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-AI-video-linkedin-post-480x553.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 521px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The video he referenced? It’s of a cat cooking.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-cat.webp" alt="Video marketing trends - still from an AI video of a cat cooking." width="408" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88991 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-cat.webp 408w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-cat-204x300.webp 204w" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px" /></p>
<p>This won’t be confused with actual video footage, but it will capture attention and stop some scrolling. As AI video tools become even better and even more accessible this year, the possibilities are limitless (see even more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-marketing-trends-2025">AI trends in marketing</a>).</p>

<h3>2. Skilled traditional video editors will remain vital</h3>
<p>AI tools will make<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/08/facebook-video-ads"> video marketing</a> more accessible to small businesses, small teams, and even small budgets. But that doesn’t mean that our beloved video creators are going anywhere. Right now, on LinkedIn, for instance, there are 479 video marketing job openings in Cambridge, MA, with 45 posted just this week.</p>
<p>We can expect the same for freelance video marketing support, too, for now. In a recent survey by WyzOwl,<a href="https://www.wyzowl.com/video-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 93%</a> of marketers reported their plans to spend about the same or even more on video marketing in 2025.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-pie-chart.webp" alt="Video marketing trends - Pir chart of video marketing spend." width="709" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88992 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-pie-chart.webp 709w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-pie-chart-480x406.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 709px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>According to WyzOwl, </em><a href="https://www.wyzowl.com/video-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>48%</em></a><em> of marketers intend to spend more on video in 2025.</em></p>
<p>That’s because there are some video marketing areas AI can’t help with. One in particular that will grow in 2025 is<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/04/25/event-marketing"> live events</a> and experiences.<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/74-fortune-1000-marketers-increase-190000092.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 74%</a> of Fortune 1000 marketers report that they’ll be increasing spending on experiential marketing in 2025.</p>
<p>Video marketers will be essential in capturing the experience—whether it’s recording talks, getting on-the-fly testimonials from attendees, or taking plenty of b-roll for highlight and overview reels—for posterity.</p>
<div id="social-media-will-prioritize-video"></div>
<h3>3. Social media will prioritize video even more</h3>
<p>It’s possible not every social media platform will be<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/03/video-marketing-ideas"> video first</a>—it’s still unclear whether <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/bluesky-for-marketing">Bluesky</a> favors video, for instance. But overall, social media platforms favor video content now and will even more as we progress throughout this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/23/tiktok-marketing">TikTok</a> and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/how-to-get-more-views-on-youtube"> YouTube</a> are strictly video, with consistently growing traffic. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-trends-2025">Facebook</a>, Instagram, Snapchat, and even<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/11/08/linkedin-pulse"> LinkedIn algorithms</a> prioritize engaging video content, particularly with<a href="https://www.fanpagekarma.com/insights/photos-with-faces-more-likes-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> human faces</a>. This is even more important to consider for brand social accounts, which are already often suppressed by algorithms. When you’re investing time into content creation for social, you want it to move your business forward.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-linkedin.webp" alt="Video marketing trends - LinkedIn videos." width="515" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88993 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-linkedin.webp 515w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-linkedin-480x559.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 515px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>LinkedIn continues to prioritize video content.</em></p>
<p>Experts expect to see video-first continue across social media channels in 2025.  A study by Sandvine found that video usage grew<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sandvines-2023-global-internet-phenomena-report-shows-24-jump-in-video-traffic-with-netflix-volume-overtaking-youtube-301723445.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 24%</a> in 2022, accounting for 65% of all internet traffic. And these significant increases were before AI enabled even more video creation.</p>
<p>This video-first trend might seem overwhelming to keep up with, but don’t worry yet. This leads us to our next video marketing trend for 2025.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2b50.png" alt="⭐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free resource!</strong> <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDL25LeadGenIdeas.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_LeadGenIdeas_Download">The Definitive Guide to Lead Generation: 25 Ideas (+Tips &amp; Examples)</a></p>
<div id="repurposing-content-will-be-a-must"></div>
<h3>4. Repurposing content across social platforms will be a must</h3>
<p>With every social media feed prioritizing video content, there will inevitably be some flattening of platform personality. That means more opportunities for light repackaging of the same video assets will exist.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-repurposing.webp" alt="Video marketing trends - screenshot of a video from Atlassian." width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88994 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-repurposing.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-repurposing-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>In 2025, savvy brands will turn one video into dozens of marketing assets.</em></p>
<p>Tami Oladipo, content writer at<a href="https://buffer.com/"> Buffer</a>, predicts that we’ll see an increase in sharing and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/03/repurposing-content"> repurposing</a> video content across social platforms this year.</p>
<p>“As AI tools become more sophisticated and platforms become mirrors of each other, I think we&#8217;ll see creators who are able to stretch themselves more because they are working more efficiently. One long video into multiple pieces of content will likely become the norm, and creators will choose to crosspost to multiple platforms, even in seemingly unexpected places.”</p>
<p>Look to creators and brands you trust for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-repurposing">great content repurposing examples</a>. The more creative you get, the more benefit you can pull from every asset you create.</p>
<div id="expect-more-casual-local-content"></div>
<h3>5. Expect more casual local content</h3>
<p>The scale enabled by AI and incentivized by <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-algorithm">social media algorithms</a> across the board prioritizing video will also lead video marketers and content creators to work harder to stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tylersteinhardt?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAA2BSjMBbvX1tiK2zLP_PhEa9cha8Rf5QI0&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3Bv0UOghVjSi%2B2Ob3eb4Ae2g%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyler Steinhardt</a> is the Chief Strategy Officer of<a href="https://vocal.media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Vocal Media</a>, a platform dedicated to discovering, supporting, and rewarding creators. He expects to see these videos working against AI, with creators and brands getting closer to home.</p>
<p>“In 2025, we&#8217;ll see more locally-produced creator content.” Local content defined by community or physical environments will be harder to replicate with AI tools, and it will appeal to people sharing a common connection, as well as the algorithms favoring human faces and recognizable places.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-local.webp" alt="Video marketing trends - screenshot of a video from Petrella's. " width="870" height="513" class="aligncenter wp-image-88995 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-local.webp 870w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-local-480x283.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 870px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The quick brand clip from Italian sandwich shop </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/petrellas_ford_city/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Patrella’s</em></a><em> is an example of this local, casual trend. Simple overhead shots of preparing food beat over-produced, professional videos for authenticity.</em></p>
<p>According to Tyler, “Users will see more restaurant reviews, sports updates, and vlog updates from our neighbors, as every algorithm&#8217;s for you page tries to cut through the deluge of AI-content slop that will be flooding our feeds.”</p>
<div id="creator-communities-will-fragment"></div>
<h3>6. Creator communities will fragment</h3>
<p>Another shift for video creators in 2025 will be less about content and volume and more about community and personal branding.</p>
<p>“Before the podcast industry&#8217;s recent sluggish turn, everything was very communal,” explained Chris O’Keefe, the editor of the weekly Substack <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/theabtest/p/issue-1-force-philosophy-video-volatility?r=3hc65x&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The A/B List: Art &amp; Business in Audio</a> and the founder of <a href="https://www.ok-creative.com/">OK Creative: The Language Agency</a>, which provides writing and narrative services to businesses.</p>
<p>“Content creators, podcasters, journalists, marketers, video, audio—people were just excited to be making stuff and weren&#8217;t as concerned with which titles they had or scenes they were associated with,” he said. “Now, with middle-class creator money drying up and many producers feeling hoodwinked by big tech companies, I&#8217;m already seeing more clear lines being drawn with how people define themselves. YouTube Creators over here, Audio Podcasters over there. That sort of thing.”</p>
<p>Why does this fragmentation matter for marketers? In addition to impacting <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-promote-your-youtube-channel">brand YouTube channels</a>, podcasts, and more, shifts in creator communities mean changes to partner and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/26/influencer-marketing">influencer marketing</a>, which brings us to the next video marketing trend for 2025.</p>
<div id="video-creators-expand-monetization"></div>
<h3>7. Video creators will expand monetization beyond brand partnerships</h3>
<p>In 2024, creators continued the existing trend of placing more content behind a subscription and/or paywall to generate direct revenue from fans. That’s in addition to, or instead of, relying on brand sponsorships</p>
<p>Last year, more than <a href="https://news.patreon.com/articles/celebrating-another-year-of-connecting-creators-and-their-real-fans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 million fans paid</a> for access to content from more than 300,000 creators on Patreon each month. Substack hit <a href="https://backlinko.com/substack-users#substack-paid-subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">49 million subscribers</a> on the platform in January 2024, and while the content is primarily copy and images, the platform has supported video since early <a href="https://on.substack.com/p/video-on-substack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022</a>. In 2023, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/03/28/substack-community-fundraising-round" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axios</a> reported that there were more than 17,000 Substack newsletter writers, with the top 10 creators earning $25 million annually, a jump from $7 million in 2020.</p>
<p>Instagram even offered accounts with more than 10,000 followers the option to host a one-to-many chat in a free, private <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-broadcast-channels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram broadcast channel</a> beginning in 2023, a tool that grew in 2024. By creating more exclusive content, influencers can cultivate a greater sense of community—and, with paywalls, generate more revenue directly from their fans and followers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-monitization.webp" alt="Video marketing trends - Instagram post from coffee content creatior." width="739" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88996 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-monitization.webp 739w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-monitization-480x390.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 739px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Coffee content creator Lance Hedrick posts sponsored videos on Instagram and creates exclusive</em><a href="https://www.patreon.com/lancehedrick" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <em>Patreon content</em></a><em>, generating about $7,000 monthly.</em></p>
<p>The platforms that support these exclusive communities and revenue generation, like Patreon and Substack, will continue to grow. So, in 2025, we’ll see more exclusivity with video content, including vlogs, product reviews, and more.</p>
<p>This shift behind a paywall has the potential to influence influencer marketing. This could mean more opportunities for better quality engagement in exclusive communities and creators who are less interested in smaller deals or working with new brands because they have diversified their revenue streams.</p>
<p>If you’re still considering <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/03/21/social-media-influencers">which influencers you work with</a> this year, be sure to check out content that appears publicly versus in an exclusive community. If you’re already working with influencers regularly, make sure to keep an eye out for changes.</p>
<div id="creativity-will-flourish-in-marketing-videos"></div>
<h3>8. Creativity will flourish in marketing videos</h3>
<p>This is by far the most exciting trend that experts predict for video marketing in 2025 for both marketers and internet consumers. With the increased accessibility enabled by AI and the resulting increase in competition to stand out, we’ll see an influx of creativity and innovation in video marketing this year.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-creative.webp" alt="Video marketing trends - Screenshot of a cooking video." width="884" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88997 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-creative.webp 884w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/video-marketing-trends-wordstream-creative-480x326.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 884px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Big and small brands will be incentivized and empowered to produce more creative videos.</em></p>
<p>“One optimistic prediction is that we&#8217;ll see more innovation by creators,” shared Chris O’Keefe. “I don&#8217;t know if we need any more Zoom-style interview shows. With YouTube and Spotify making it easier to create and publish video content, which creators are going to leverage the features to make interesting, immersive, narrative, or cinematic content?”</p>
<p>There will be more pressure to produce compelling,<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/01/05/marketing-videos"> creative video content</a> that stands out due to the shifts in algorithms and the influx of video content enabled by AI. But this pressure is coming from consumer expectations, too. WyzOwl found that<a href="https://www.wyzowl.com/video-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 91%</a> of consumers say video quality impacts their trust in a brand, up from 87% in our 2024 report.</p>
<p>AI can help with these increased standards, too—as long as you rely on these tools correctly. Creators and marketing teams alike will have more capability at their disposal with AI tools, in particular. This includes generative AI that can create clips that wouldn’t otherwise be possible (see the cat cooking short above, for example) and editing that makes video sharper and more professional-looking in just a few minutes.</p>
<h2>Use these video marketing trends to inform your 2025 strategy</h2>
<p>Prioritizing video marketing in 2025 may require more time, effort, and budget, but you’ll see the benefits with increased views, response rates, and, even better, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/08/brand-affinity-marketing">brand affinity</a>. As both the tools to produce videos and the competition to get eyes on them grow, you’ll want to spend your time creating the most memorable content for your brand.</p>
<p>Let’s quickly recap the top video marketing trends that experts expect to see in 2025:</p>
<ol>
<li>Even more AI tools hit the scene</li>
<li>Skilled traditional video editors will remain vital</li>
<li>Social media will prioritize video even more</li>
<li>Repurposing content across social platforms will be a must</li>
<li>Expect more casual local content</li>
<li>Creator communities will fragment</li>
<li>Video creators will expand monetization beyond brand partnerships</li>
<li>Creativity will flourish in marketing videos</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every day, billions of users are scrolling through thousands of posts on dozens of social media platforms. With this kind of excess, it’s easy to feel defeated. How can a small business stand out with all this noise? It’s simple: By developing a targeted social media strategy.</p>
<p>With a social media strategy, you’ll focus on reaching your audience with high-quality content they want to see on the platforms where they’re already spending time. You won’t be competing with all the noise for any attention; you’ll be putting a plan in place to reach your potential customers. In this article, we’ll go over all the steps you need to follow to create a social media strategy that works for your business.</p>

<h2>What is a social media strategy?</h2>
<p>Before we get into the steps, let’s go over what a social media strategy is and how creating one can help build your brand and grow your business (because social media is still one of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/popular-marketing-resources-2025">top places people go to learn</a>).</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/01/09/social-media-marketing-strategies">social media strategy</a> outlines how your organization will create and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-distribution">distribute content</a>, which <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">social media platforms</a> it will use, and what defines success for your brand. Ideally, your social media strategy is documented all in one place that’s easy to share with the marketing team, new hires, or anyone at your company contributing to your brand’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/17/increase-online-presence">social media presence</a>. (Using our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-wQd2McKzEHBj1rJCqopfq1qeeBIo6bCjfDaUroApEY/copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media strategy template</a> can help you set that up.)</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/social-media-strategy-wordstream-fyp.webp" alt="Social media strategy - FYP TikTok." width="388" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88057 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/social-media-strategy-wordstream-fyp.webp 388w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/social-media-strategy-wordstream-fyp-194x300.webp 194w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A social media strategy will help you spot trends so your content ends up in front of more people.</em></p>
<p>How detailed this strategy gets will depend on the size of your business and the investment in <a href="https://localiq.com/products/social-media-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media management</a>.</p>
<p>For instance, if you’re a one-person marketing team growing a new channel, you might not have specific hour blocks to post on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/01/instagram-story-ideas">Instagram Stories</a> daily—at least not yet. But suppose you’re a social media manager for a brand with a large <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/17/how-to-get-more-likes-on-tiktok#:~:text=1.,help%20but%20stop%20and%20watch.">TikTok following</a>. In that case, you might have a social media strategy that dictates which emoji your brand uses and which it doesn’t in its daily video posts. Either way, you’ll need the basics, including your audience, goals, and more, which we’ll cover below.</p>
<p>Now, this might all sound prescriptive and boring. You might wonder where the room for organic day-in-the-life content, jumping on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/14/tiktok-trend-discovery">trends</a>, or connecting with your audience is. The truth is that there’s room for that, too. But it’s important to have a clearly defined strategy in place first to know what you’re working towards and where your investment is going.</p>

<div id="why-does-a-social-media-strategy-matter"></div>
<h2>Why does a social media strategy matter?</h2>
<p>Your social media strategy matters because it keeps you organized and focused on growing the right audience for your business.</p>
<p>As of July 2024, there are <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5.45 billion</a> internet users worldwide and 5.17 billion social media users. If your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target customers</a> are online, then chances are they’re on social media, too.</p>

<p>The people who head over to your social media profiles will likely do so for a few different reasons. Some will follow for product and offering updates, some will engage with content and share <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/19/customer-testimonial-examples">testimonials</a>, and more will check out your social presence while they’re in the consideration stage.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2024-global-overview-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">51.2%</a> of people research brands online before purchasing. You need a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-plan">plan</a> in place to make sure that you’re taking advantage of this online traffic to build your audience, engage with your followers, and convert your community into your customers. So, let’s get to it.</p>
<div id="how-to-create-a-social-media-strategy"></div>
<h2>How to create a social media strategy</h2>
<p>Now that we’re clear on what a social media strategy is and why it’s important, let’s get into the steps to create one of your own. Here are the essentials for developing a social media strategy that works for you and your business.</p>
<h3>1. Write your mission statement</h3>
<p>You’re likely familiar with a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/02/how-to-write-a-business-mission-statement">mission statement</a> for a business. It’s a concise, clear statement of the brand’s purpose, values, and goals. But documenting this guiding principle for your marketing is worthwhile, too.</p>
<p>If you don’t already have a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/11/content-marketing-mission-statement">content marketing mission statement</a>, start your social media strategy doc by crafting one that’s specific to these channels. Here are a few questions to help you get started brainstorming:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is your social media content funny or formal?</li>
<li>Is your personality quirky, irreverent, or all business?</li>
<li>How does your social media content relate to other marketing channels?</li>
<li>What type of content do you share on your social accounts?</li>
</ul>
<p>And when you’ve got all your answers down, use this formula to start drafting:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>[Your brand]’s social media presence is where [your target social audience] can find [type of content] and [other type of content] for [benefit]. </em></p>
<p>Developing a concise statement that defines your social media content and why it matters will also help you with the rest of your strategy.</p>
<h3>2. Set your goals</h3>
<p>Your time, efforts, and budget are all valuable and limited resources. For your social media strategy to be effective, you need to put those resources to the best use for specific goals. In <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/harris-insights-report-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The 2023 State of Social Media Marketing</a>, Buffer reported the top three <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/social-media-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media marketing objectives</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building brand reputation (selected by 66% of survey respondents).</li>
<li>Understanding customers (65%).</li>
<li>Improving competitive positioning (63%).</li>
</ul>
<p>These are great places to start if you’re unsure what you’d like to get from your brand’s social media presence. Once you have your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-objectives-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">objective</a>, it’s time to set some goals. SMART goals are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/social-media-strategy-wordstream-influencer-1.webp" alt="Social media strategy - SMART goal visual." width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-88059" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/social-media-strategy-wordstream-influencer-1.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/social-media-strategy-wordstream-influencer-1-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For example, if your following on TikTok hovers around 1,000 and you&#8217;re <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/20/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok">posting regularly</a>, a good goal for building brand awareness could be to get 250 more followers on the platform by the end of the quarter.</p>
<p>Remember, this strategy is meant to focus your social media efforts and ensure you get the results you need without wasting your time. So, keep this part simple if it makes sense for your time or your company. Think more followers, posts, and engagement—and these can be incremental gains.</p>

<h3>3. Define your audience</h3>
<p>You need to define your audience to grow your followers and engage with your community. Your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/target-audience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">target audience</a> on social media is a part of your company’s target audience, so a good place to start with this step is pulling out your buyer personas and mapping these to your social.</p>
<p>Which platforms do each persona spend time on? What type of content does each persona engage with? This will be a good starting point for defining your audience and brainstorming content.</p>
<p>But your brand’s target audience isn’t a direct translation of your social media’s target audience. Your persona, endearingly referred to as Brad the Builder, never goes on TikTok, for instance. Why make a bunch of videos with him in mind? That’s why it’s helpful to go one step further.</p>
<p>Once you’ve aligned your channels with buyer personas, look at your followers on each platform and figure out patterns. Do the people following your account have similar ages or job titles? What about their educational backgrounds or geographic locations?  This will help you hone in on your target audience—and hopefully even develop your own social media personas for content creation.</p>
<h3>4. Audit your accounts</h3>
<p>Before you get any further in your planning, you need to take the time to do a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-media-audit">social media audit</a>. This should be comprehensive, but it doesn’t need to be an exhausting endeavor.</p>
<p>Here’s where to focus your social media audit:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Confirm you have access to all of your accounts:</strong> First things first, make sure you have up-to-date credentials for your social media accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Review your profiles:</strong> Are the cover and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/linkedin-banner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banner photos</a> on brand and high res? Is pinned content relevant? Are you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/articles/keyword-research-for-social-media-guide">optimized for search</a>? Make sure this is all set.</li>
<li><strong>Dive into your audience:</strong> Note everything you learned from reviewing your audience.</li>
<li><strong>Get familiar with your performance: </strong>Check your analytics for patterns, identify content that works well, and remember anything that regularly tanks.</li>
</ul>
<p>This gives you a baseline understanding of your social media performance so that you can focus on growing.</p>
<h3>5. Check out your competitors</h3>
<p>Once you have a handle on how your own social media is working, you need to figure out the landscape. Check out your major <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/competitors-ads">competitors</a> and do a similar audit. Sure, you don’t have access to all the analytics, but you can still see follower counts, posting schedule, and engagement metrics, including likes, shares, and comments. What’s working well? What do you like? What isn’t getting engagement?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/social-media-strategy-wordstream-pop.webp" alt="Social media strategy - examples of two soda brands' marketing." width="455" height="587" class="aligncenter wp-image-88060 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/social-media-strategy-wordstream-pop.webp 455w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/social-media-strategy-wordstream-pop-233x300.webp 233w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/social-media-strategy-wordstream-pop-400x516.webp 400w" sizes="(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px" /></p>

<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f575-fe0f-200d-2640-fe0f.png" alt="🕵️‍♀️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Want an in-depth look at what your competitors are doing online?</strong> Get the guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/how-to-spy-on-competitors?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SpyOnCompetitors_Download">How to Spy on Your Competitors: 7 Ways to Become a Competitive Supersleuth</a>.</p>
<h3>6. Plan your content pillars</h3>
<p>Content pillars are themes or topics that your account will consistently create social media content about. That includes new posts, re-shares to amplify other posts, and reactions to trending stories related to these topics.</p>
<p>The topics will be specific to your brand, but there are several common types of content pillars.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Educational:</strong> This content will teach your audience about your niche. Think breakdowns of your expert knowledge in videos, posts, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-threads">Threads</a>. Remember, this should be about your area of expertise, not directly about your product or offering.</li>
<li><strong>Entertaining:</strong> Think memes, gifs, and trend videos for entertaining content. With this type of content, you want your audience to pause scrolling, notice your brand, and even laugh and follow.</li>
<li><strong>Promotional:</strong> Your product tutorials, case studies, testimonials, and new release updates are all examples of promotional content.</li>
<li><strong>Engaging:</strong> This type of content includes direct engagement with your audience. Think about conversations with followers, response videos to comments, and user-generated content.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you try to post all of the types of content we just covered in the table above, you’d be busy—and your social media profiles would look scattered.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s worth the time to designate content pillars. This focus will help you more easily brainstorm and create content, identify trending stories to engage with, and find complementary accounts to engage with online. And by staying consistent, you’ll let your audience know what to expect by following your brand. This will help with brand recognition, the first step to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/brand-loyalty">brand loyalty</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/social-media-strategy-wordstream-maha-copy.webp" alt="Social media strategy -Social media post from Maha." width="824" height="590" class="aligncenter wp-image-88061 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/social-media-strategy-wordstream-maha-copy.webp 824w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/social-media-strategy-wordstream-maha-copy-480x344.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 824px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A great example of educational content from </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8rwU0-OLI3/?img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Maha Copy</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>When coming up with these content pillars, remember to choose topics relevant to your brand and your audience.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you’re running a small marketing agency. For educational content, you might want to focus on copywriting for your expert tips and create content around this. And for the engaging category, you might run a weekly AMA “office hours” where your followers submit marketing challenges and you give your on-the-spot advice. This helps you know where to focus your efforts, and it helps your audience know what to expect.</p>
<h3>7. Document your tone and voice guide</h3>
<p>Content pillars help develop consistency that makes your brand and social media content more recognizable. A clear tone and voice guide will help with this, too, by ensuring you maintain your distinct <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/07/31/brand-voice">brand voice</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/social-media-strategy-wordstream-greetings.webp" alt="Social media strategy -Funny social media post." width="442" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88062 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/social-media-strategy-wordstream-greetings.webp 442w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/social-media-strategy-wordstream-greetings-221x300.webp 221w" sizes="(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Is your brand serious, studious, or silly?</em></p>
<p>Your guide can include how you capitalize and punctuate posts, what types of slang or casual language you use, and even key terms to use regularly.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that your tone will shift slightly across your platforms. For instance, your brand account on LinkedIn should sound more professional than your brand account on TikTok or Snapchat. If you want to include these platform-specific differentiations in your tone and voice guide, all the better.</p>
<h3>8. Settle on your core channels</h3>
<p>Your social media strategy needs to identify the platforms on which your brand will be active. But you don’t need to post with the same frequency everywhere. Focus on your core channels instead.</p>
<p>You might need to do some work to figure out which should be your core channels. Consider where you have the most followers, where your competitors are most active, and where your target customers spend most of their time. Then, once you’ve identified your primary channels, you can turn your attention to setting a schedule and brainstorming content. In other words, create your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/24/editorial-calendar">content calendar</a>.</p>
<h3>9. Create a content calendar</h3>
<p>If you’re scheduling your social posts in a tool like Buffer or Hootsuite, you can use these to create a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-calendar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media calendar</a>. But your content calendar doesn’t need to be on a social platform or a scheduling tool—a Google Sheet works perfectly well. The main thing is organizing your content, cadence, and schedule.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here’s what you need to include for each piece of content:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dates and times:</strong> Specify when each post will go live, including the time of day you plan for each post to go live. Remember, time of day matters when it comes to engagement. Here’s a guide to the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-time-to-post-on-social-media">best times to post on social media</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Content type</strong>: Indicate whether it’s an image, a video, a carousel, a status update, a poll, or something else. This will let you track how often you post different types of content and help you with performance analysis later.</li>
<li><strong>Platforms</strong>: Record which social media platform the content will be posted on.</li>
<li><strong>Post details</strong>: Her,e you’ll want to track the copy and the primary visuals for each post.</li>
<li><strong>Campaign</strong>: If your post is a part of a more extensive marketing <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/social-media-campaign-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign</a>, make sure to note that in your calendar.</li>
<li><strong>Target audience</strong>: Include the specifics of the audience you’re appealing to with social media content. For example, you might be posting for current customers or members of your community with a certain job title.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, your calendar should be a tool for you to make planning, tracking, and reviewing your social media content easier.</p>
<h3>10. Cover your social selling</h3>
<p>More than <a href="https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/resources/76-of-consumers-buy-products-seen-in-social-media-posts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two-thirds</a> of people on social media have clicked a link and learned more about a product that they weren’t previously interested in. And many of those people go on to buy the product—whether it’s through the link immediately, months later, or even when they find the product in a store. That’s why <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-shopping-trends?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/sales/social-selling-stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">87%</a> of sellers report that social media is a powerful sales channel for their business.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/social-media-strategy-wordstream-influencer.webp" alt="Social media strategy - Influencer post on social media." width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88063 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/social-media-strategy-wordstream-influencer.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/social-media-strategy-wordstream-influencer-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/digital-marketing/influencer-marketing-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Influencer marketing</em></a><em> is a popular form of social selling</em></p>
<p>So, when you’re coming up with your social media strategy, make sure you’re accounting for your approach to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-selling">social selling</a>. Will you regularly share links to your product or offer? Will you group these links to your products in highlights? How will your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">call to action</a> appear in your bio?</p>
<p>Most of your sales will likely come from <a href="https://localiq.com/campaigns/why-localiq/?cid=Paid_GGL_Search_LiQ_WhyLocaliQ_Demo&amp;utm_content=social_ads_sitelink&amp;utm_term=localiq&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAj9m7BhD1ARIsANsIIvBfMWX1vWMvLB1MsX90JzIDnItoxR5gcAoSeVAJFuvqckdbtir5kPgaAlN2EALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paid social ads</a> vs. organic posts, but it’s good to proactively decide how you’ll feature links, products, and sales in your organic content.</p>
<h3>11. Schedule progress reviews</h3>
<p>Set up regular progress reviews to see how your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/social-media-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">performance metrics</a> stack up against your goals. These could be monthly or quarterly, and they should also be annual. But it’s important to make sure they’re on your calendar so you’re accountable for checking in.</p>
<p>By checking in on your social media performance regularly, you’ll be able to adjust your strategy to improve your performance. If something isn’t working, you can pivot. If something is really working, double down. These progress reviews help you maintain an emergent social media strategy that helps you grow your brand.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Purpose-driven marketing is all about aligning a brand&#8217;s mission with its values to create a deeper connection with consumers. By focusing on a social or environmental cause, companies can connect more meaningfully with their audience and build stronger brand loyalty. But it’s not as simple as selecting a cause and launching a campaign.</p>
<p>In this guide to purpose-driven marketing, we’ll explain the meaning and importance of purpose-driven marketing and then show some examples of brands that do it well.</p>

<h2>What is purpose-driven marketing?</h2>
<p>Purpose-driven marketing is the strategy of aligning external communications, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">brand identity</a>, and marketing activities with a meaningful cause. The central cause could be <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/28/green-marketing">environmental</a>, social, philanthropic, or economic, but it must be baked into the identity of the brand. Ideally, it’s also integrated into the founding story and the central operations of the business.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.warbyparker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warby Parker</a> is a great example. The direct-to-consumer glasses brand connects breaking up a monopoly on prescription glasses in the US with a critical global issue of access to both exams and eyewear with its core belief: “We believe everyone has the right to see.” Through its non-profit partners, Warby Parker’s philanthropic program donates a pair of glasses for each one sold. The company’s Buy a Pair, Give a Pair program has distributed more than 15 million pairs of glasses.</p>

<h2>Purpose-driven marketing vs. cause marketing</h2>
<p>Corporate social responsibility has been in the news more regularly over the last several years. The 2016 election, the onset of the 2020 pandemic, and Gen-Z’s aging into the workforce have motivated the trend. But not all marketing that relates to causes is purpose-driven marketing. Sometimes, it falls in the category of<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/22/cause-based-marketing"> cause marketing</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the key differences.</p>
<h3>Duration</h3>
<p>Plenty of companies run short-term marketing campaigns for socially responsible causes, whether it’s connected to a specific time of year, product launch, or special initiative.</p>
<p>Companies with purpose-driven marketing strategies have their support for these causes integrated into the business operations and values, so the commitment is longer-term.</p>
<h3>Founding mission</h3>
<p>With purpose-driven marketing, social responsibility is a part of the founding mission of the company.</p>
<p>With cause marketing, companies partner with nonprofits, offer direct support, or call attention to an issue. This is great but not a core part of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/23/how-brand-your-business">brand’s identity</a>.</p>
<h3>Business operations</h3>
<p>Cause marketing doesn’t always require business operations, but purpose-driven marketing does. Think Warby Parker’s Buy a Pair, Give a Pair program. That scale and direction require operational support, including integration in any financial forecasting.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola recently introduced plant-based bottles. While supporting the environment is an excellent cause, it’s not a cornerstone of the brand’s mission or identity, so it’s not purpose-driven marketing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cocacola.webp" alt="Purpose-driven marketing - Coca-cola ad for plant-based bottled." width="848" height="428" class="aligncenter wp-image-87589 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cocacola.webp 848w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cocacola-480x242.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 848px, 100vw" /></p>

<div id="why-use-purpose-driven-marketing-strategies"></div>
<h2>Why use purpose-driven marketing strategies?</h2>
<p>Purpose-driven marketing strategies can make a big difference in the world. But they also have benefits for businesses that practice them. They’ll help win loyal customers, increase brand recognition, retain and engage employees, and even increase profits.</p>
<h3>Winning loyal consumers</h3>
<p>If you’re running a small business or <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-create-a-small-business-marketing-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">managing the marketing</a> for one, you’re thinking about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/25/optimize-lead-generation-process">customer acquisition</a>. The biggest business benefit of purpose-driven marketing is winning loyal customers.</p>
<p>Last year, Toms of Maine—a <a href="https://www.tomsofmaine.com/the-backstory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand</a> committed to natural products and giving back to its community—commissioned a study of 2,000 Gen Z and Millennial consumers to learn about values and habits. The results were clear: <a href="https://www.carbonneutralcopy.com/sustainable-purchases-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80%</a> of respondents base their purchases on a brand’s mission or purpose, and 85% would rather spend more money on a better, more sustainable product than its lower quality, lower cost alternative.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-gen-z.webp" alt="Purpose-driven marketing - Graphic showing 4 in 5 gen z buy based on brand's mission." width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87590 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-gen-z.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-gen-z-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.carbonneutralcopy.com/sustainable-purchases-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>If you’re considering incorporating purpose-driven marketing into your business model, know that consistency in your marketing, mission, and practices is key to keeping these loyal customers, though. <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/google_cloud_cxo_sustainability_survey_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">84%</a> of consumers say that unsustainable practices will alienate them from a brand.</p>
<h3>Encouraging brand recognition</h3>
<p>By spending time online, we’re all seeing hundreds—if not <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2023/05/03/how-many-ads-do-we-really-see-day-spoiler-it-s-not-10000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thousands</a>—of ads each day. Throw in all the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/26/influencer-marketing">influencer mentions</a>, sponsored content, organic social media posts, and brand placement in shows and movies, and you can see how we’re constantly taking in branding.</p>
<p>In this environment, you want to give your small business every opportunity to stand out and find more ways to get your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">brand recognized</a>.</p>
<p>Purpose-driven marketing creates a strong and memorable brand story, as the commitment to the cause is central to the company’s origin. Stories are remembered up to <a href="https://womensleadership.stanford.edu/node/796/harnessing-power-stories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">22 times</a> more than facts, helping your customers and potential customers remember your brand.</p>
<p>Your brand is also more likely to get positive press mentions. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378426615001934" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research</a> shows that companies with stronger commitments to corporate social responsibility receive more press coverage overall and, in this coverage, are perceived more favorably.</p>
<p>Aligning your business with a cause can help foster more passionate internal advocates, too. And this can impact your brand recognition and customer relationships. In fact, <a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2018/majority-of-consumers-buying-from-companies-that-take-a-stand-on-issues-they-care-about-and-ditching-those-that-dont-accenture-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">65%</a> of consumers report that a brand’s employees and its CEO can influence their purchases. This leads us right to the next benefit of purpose-driven marketing.</p>
<h3>Attracting employees</h3>
<p>The next major benefit of a purpose-driven marketing strategy is attracting, engaging, and retaining employees. <a href="https://www.bluebeyondconsulting.com/blog/what-do-employees-value-most/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80%</a> of employees consider working for a company with values that align with their own extremely important.</p>
<p>People want to feel connected to the work they’re doing, and this is becoming more true as Gen Z begins to make up a larger percentage of the workforce. <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/consumer-business/welcome-to-gen-z.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deloitte</a> found that, compared to other generations, Gen Z is more concerned about a company’s ethical standards and social impact. Last year, Deloitte also found that <a href="https://www.esgtoday.com/over-40-of-gen-z-millennials-would-switch-jobs-over-climate-concerns-deloitte-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40%</a> of Gen Z and Millennials have changed career plans because of their urgent and escalating concerns about climate change.</p>
<p>This is another area where commitment to your mission is critical. If you’re attracting passionate employees, your company needs to stay true to its core values in order to keep them engaged at work. And if you’re able to keep your employees engaged, you’ll see real, tangible benefits to your business.</p>
<h3>Increasing profits</h3>
<p>Employee engagement corresponds with productivity and presence, which translates to profitability for your business. <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236366/right-culture-not-employee-satisfaction.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a> found that companies with engaged employees see a 17% increase in productivity and 41% less absenteeism. These same companies are also <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236366/right-culture-not-employee-satisfaction.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">21%</a> more profitable on average.</p>
<p>The potential increase in profits is also directly attributable to purpose-driven marketing. <a href="https://www.babson.edu/social-innovation-institute/thought-leadership/project-roi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project ROI </a>found that companies with strong commitments to social responsibility have a 6% higher market value and generate 20% more revenue.</p>
<p>Those are some significant gains.</p>

<h2>7 meaningful examples of purpose-driven marketing</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve covered purpose-driven marketing and why it’s an effective business strategy, let’s go over some effective examples from various businesses and marketing channels.</p>
<h3>1. Lush: SEO copy</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.lush.com/us/en_us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lush</a> is a beauty and cosmetic company founded with clear intentions to use better ingredients and avoid animal testing. Now, the company hosts a competition for animal testing alternatives and has donated more than $2 million to this cause.</p>
<p>This social responsibility is core to the brand, and they make sure to use that in their marketing. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/03/seo-copywriting">SEO copy</a> that appears on the Google search engine results page (SERP).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-lush.webp" alt="Purpose-driven marketing - Lush search engine results." width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-87591 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-lush.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-lush-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The copy is informative. It’s clear that the company offers hair care, skincare, and bath products. But the copy shares more without getting repetitive—the ingredients are “fresh,” the hair products are “zero-waste alternatives,” and the products are “Vegetarian &amp; Cruelty-Free.” This is an excellent use of space, fitting this commitment to social causes into short snippets of SEO copy.</p>
<p>All this and inventing the bath bomb? Amazing.</p>
<h3>2. Cuddle + Kind: Google Ads copy</h3>
<p><a href="https://cuddleandkind.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cuddle + Kind</a> makes handmade, organic, safety-certified stuffed animals for babies and children. The full-size knit animals have outfits, names, and birthdays. They also each have a wristband that shares the company’s philanthropic mission of donating 10 meals for each doll sold.</p>
<p>Cuddle + Kind donates proceeds from each sale—not just the full-size animals—to combat child hunger. The brand shares that since launching in 2015, it has helped provide 31 million meals for children in need.</p>
<p>This worthy mission makes it into the company’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/24/google-ads-examples">Google Ads copy</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cuddle.webp" alt="Purpose-driven marketing - Cuddle and Kids Google Ad." width="740" height="195" class="aligncenter wp-image-87592 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cuddle.webp 740w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cuddle-480x126.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 740px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>My favorite thing here is the description line, “Believe in the gift you give.” It’s a lovely sentiment that frames the product as a wonderful purchase. It’s a gift that’s good for more than just the recipient.</p>
<h3>3. TOMS: website structure and copy</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.toms.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TOMS</a> is a shoe company that was launched in 2006 with a one-for-one shoe program. For every pair of original iconic flats sold, the company would donate a pair.</p>
<p>In 2019, after significantly expanding its offerings with more shoe styles and accessories, TOMS changed its commitment to social impact. Instead of one-for-one donations, TOMS allocated a third of its profits for giving, including grants and donations. The business was able to evolve this without changing its brand identity. Giving is still its core value.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/14/website-examples">website</a> does a great job of capturing this value and putting it front and center with a tab in the main navigation for its Impact page. Take a look at the hero copy of the Impact overview page below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cuddle-1.webp" alt="Purpose-driven marketing - Tom's ad." width="758" height="227" class="aligncenter wp-image-87593 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cuddle-1.webp 758w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-cuddle-1-480x144.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 758px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The copy here emphasizes a continuation of the same mission: “to improve lives” and “drive sustainable change.”</p>
<h3>4. Blueland: CTAs</h3>
<p>Emphasizing your brand’s impact and commitment to its core values doesn’t always have to be serious in tone, especially if it doesn’t align with your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">brand personality</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.blueland.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blueland</a> is a cleaning product brand created with a simple mission: to prevent single-use plastics by making eco-friendly alternatives easy to find and use. I recently switched to Blueland laundry tablets. They come in a sleeve of brown paper packaging, and I’m never going back to lugging a clunky jug of free-and-clear back from Target.</p>
<p>The brand is light, clean, and youthful, and its commitment to environmentalism is enthusiastic and matter-of-fact. Here’s an excellent example of how Blueland uses this in small moments, including the website footer <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">call to action</a> to join the newsletter.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-emails.webp" alt="Purpose-driven marketing -Blueland email newsletter signup page." width="804" height="587" class="aligncenter wp-image-87594 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-emails.webp 804w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-emails-480x350.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 804px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The joke in the headline and the promise of no spam and no waste? Sold.</p>
<h3><strong>5. </strong>Viv: Email marketing</h3>
<p>I love <a href="https://vivforyourv.com/?srsltid=AfmBOorEhZlXf4ACGgcWNJtwGRLfopo4n3n_kLbb1ZaseNpBe5T_lPSi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viv’s</a> marketing. The period care company is committed to toxin-free ingredients and sustainable solutions.</p>
<p>This sounds serious, and it is. But Viv doesn’t let the severity of these issues weigh down its storytelling or its brand. It’s an excellent decision considering its target demo of young buyers.</p>
<p>Viv speaks to its younger audience, who are concerned about comfort and sustainability—those looking for smaller, better alternatives to major players in the market.</p>
<p>Viv’s brand is youthful and playful. It uses casual confessional videos, bright contrasting colors, lots of emoji, and conversational copy. This is consistent in its social media posts, on its website, and in its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/01/email-marketing-tips">email marketing</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a recent example of an email that I received with a celebratory subject line: “WE HIT A SUSTAINABILITY MILESTONE”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-viv.webp" alt="Purpose-driven marketing - Viv marketing." width="375" height="576" class="aligncenter wp-image-87596 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-viv.webp 375w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-viv-195x300.webp 195w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /></p>
<p>Sending an email to let customers and potential customers know about what’s already happened is compelling. It calls attention to the fact that other period care products are still kicking while Viv is offering a tangibly better alternative. With all the greenwashing claims in marketing these days, this focus on a tangible milestone is perfect.</p>
<h3>6. Patagonia: Video marketing</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.patagonia.com/home/">Patagonia</a> might be the best, most well-known example of a company committed to purpose-driven marketing. The brand has made news for its anti-consumption marketing decisions, including a full-page ad in The New York Times urging readers <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/stories/dont-buy-this-jacket-black-friday-and-the-new-york-times/story-18615.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not to buy the jacket</a> and a decision to cease production of iconic <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/transitioning-away-from-logos.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">logo-branded vests</a> and other gear.</p>
<p>These unconventional marketing tactics align with the company’s core values, including its promise “to make products that give back to the Earth as much as they take.”</p>
<p>Patagonia’s Stories We Wear is an incredibly moving long-form video series. Each installment features one person who reflects on the emotional importance of one item of clothing.</p>
<p>For example, Patagonia ambassador and runner Jenn Shelton focuses on a jacket she wears often. It’s one that she wore hiking with her son in the Dolomites. Novelty doesn’t have the same appeal, she says. “I don’t get that dopamine hit when you get a new thing the way I get a dopamine hit when I put on an old piece.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-patagonia.webp" alt="Purpose-driven marketing - Screenshot of Patagonia video." width="880" height="513" class="aligncenter wp-image-87597 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-patagonia.webp 880w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-patagonia-480x280.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 880px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXHbUkqkRjQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>The series underscores Patagonia’s environmental concerns and anti-consumerism message to buy less and make it mean more.</p>
<h3>7. Jiminy’s: Social media marketing</h3>
<p><a href="https://jiminys.com/?ref=blog.smile.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jiminy’s</a> might be my new favorite brand name. The company creates dog food that’s more sustainable than its meat-based counterparts, saving hundreds of gallons of water per bag and producing next to no greenhouse gas emissions, all by using insect-based protein. (Get it, crickets?)</p>
<p>The sustainable dog food brand leverages <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/28/user-generated-content">user-generated content</a> across their social media, particularly on Instagram. This is an excellent call, taking advantage of the adorable pups who enjoy their product and celebrating their consciously consuming owners.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-jiminys.webp" alt="Purpose-driven marketing - Jiminy's social media post." width="875" height="558" class="aligncenter wp-image-87598 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-jiminys.webp 875w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/purpose-driven-marketing-wordstream-jiminys-480x306.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 875px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Just look at this good (insect protein-loving) boy.</em></p>
<h2>Commit to purpose-driven marketing</h2>
