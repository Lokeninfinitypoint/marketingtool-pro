										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years, Instagram has been treated like a closed ecosystem: what you post stays on the app, and the only way to grow was through hashtags, shares, and the ever-changing (and often ambiguous) algorithm. But now, Google is indexing Instagram content—meaning your posts can show directly in search results.</p>
<p>Why would Instagram do this? What’s the opportunity for business owners and marketers? Let’s break down what’s happening, and how you can take advantage of the update.</p>

<h2>What’s happening?</h2>
<p>On July 10, 2025, many users in the app received this notification:</p>
<p><em>“Your public photos and videos may soon appear in search engine results. From 10th July 2025, search engines will automatically be allowed to show all photos and videos on result pages.”</em></p>
<p>That’s right. Google has started pulling Instagram content from professional accounts into its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/serp">search results</a>. That means your posts are no longer confined to your followers’ feeds. They can show up<strong> right where people are actively searching for answers, ideas, and inspiration</strong>.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/best-coffee-near-me-google-search-results.webp" alt="best coffee near me google search with instagram post result" width="900" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93852" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/best-coffee-near-me-google-search-results.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/best-coffee-near-me-google-search-results-480x251.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Social and search have blurred considerably in recent years. Instagram joins the likes of TikTok, YouTube, and X (among others) to index content on Google. Think about it: that carousel of brunch spots in Austin, Reel on low-impact workouts, and static post showing minimalist office setups were all once siloed within the Instagram app.</p>
<p>Today? They can all surface when someone types similar semantic queries into Google.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f50e.png" alt="🔎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Need help understanding the modern rules for SEO?</strong> Download our free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/how-to-do-seo-right?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SEOstrategies_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links/">How to Do SEO Right—Right Now!</a></p>
<div id="why-is-instagram-indexing-content-on-google"></div>
<h2>Why Instagram is indexing content on Google</h2>
<p>From Meta’s point of view, the business case for indexing content on Google is pretty clear. Instagram has been criticized for years for the short lifespan of its content. Feed posts peak in a day or two, Stories disappear in 24 hours, and Reels burn out quickly.</p>
<p>By making posts visible in the search results, Meta extends the shelf life of that content, giving creators and brands the ability to capture traffic <strong>long after the initial posting window has passed</strong>. This makes Instagram more competitive with platforms like YouTube, Pinterest, and TikTok, where videos and pins can rank and drive discovery for months or even years.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dance-trends-google-search-results.webp" alt="dance trends google search with tiktok result highlighted" width="900" height="487" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93853" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dance-trends-google-search-results.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dance-trends-google-search-results-480x260.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The value added is so obvious that it begs the question: Why did it take them so long? Over the last few years, Meta has been consciously reshaping itself as a discovery engine, not just a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">social platform</a>. Threads launched with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO-friendly</a> public posts, Facebook Marketplace has long been indexed by Google, and now Instagram joins the mix. Add in the clear competitive pressure of losing out on visibility to the other media platforms, and this move was really a no-brainer.</p>
<div id="how-does-this-impact-creators-businesses-and-marketers"></div>
<h2>How does this impact creators, businesses, and marketers?</h2>
<p>For creators and marketers, this move increases Instagram’s value prop<strong>.</strong> A single post can now generate both social engagement <em>and</em> organic search visibility, which means a higher return on the effort it takes to produce content.</p>
<p>Until now, an Instagram post’s reach was mostly determined by the platform’s algorithm, your followers, and a bit of luck with hashtags. That meant most posts had a <em>super</em> short shelf life, often peaking within 24-48 hours before fading into the background.</p>
<p>Contrast that with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-copywriting">SEO-optimized blog posts</a>, which can drive traffic for years, sometimes tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of hits per month. With Google indexing, that same Instagram post can live far beyond its initial boost. Suddenly, that Reel you produced for your business or client can potentially accrue a lot more value if it goes evergreen on Search.</p>
<p>This is especially powerful for small businesses and local brands. According to Think With Google, <a href="https://business.google.com/us/think/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">46%</a> of all Google searches have local intent. Previously, a boutique coffee shop’s Instagram post about a new seasonal latte would mostly be seen by followers. Now, that same post gains access to all that local traffic if it can rank in the search results.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/seasonal-latte-google-search-results.webp" alt="seasonal latte google search results" width="900" height="516" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93854" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/seasonal-latte-google-search-results.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/seasonal-latte-google-search-results-480x275.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Creators also gain a new level of leverage. Building an audience on Instagram has always carried risk: if your reach gets throttled by the algorithm, your content dies on the platform. But now, your best work is no longer trapped on Instagram. That means more visibility, more followers, and more opportunities for sponsorships and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/26/partner-marketing">brand partnerships</a>.</p>
<p>The generational trend makes this even more urgent. Google itself has acknowledged that nearly <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/gen-z-prefers-tiktok-google-searches" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40%</a> of Gen Z prefer searching TikTok or Instagram over Search for things like restaurants, products, and travel ideas. By allowing posts to rank in Google, Instagram bridges that gap: it keeps Gen Z happy with in-app discovery while also meeting Google searchers where they are.</p>

<h2>5 ways to take advantage of indexable Instagram content</h2>
<p>It all sounds great in theory (the theory being that by effectively search-optimizing your Instagram content, you can increase exposure many times over). But do creators actually have control over that kind of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">compounding traffic</a>, or is this still just a game of luck?</p>
<p>We think they do.</p>
<p>But, first, to give your posts the chance of showing up in Google, there are a few requirements: You must have a professional account, your account must be public, and you must have enabled the setting that allows your content to be indexed (you can find this in Settings &gt; Account privacy).</p>
<p>Now that that&#8217;s out of the way, here are five strategies that you can use to rank your Instagram content high in the search results and drive more value.</p>
<div id="treat-captions-like-mini-blog-posts"></div>
<h3>1. Treat captions like mini blog posts</h3>
<p>Writing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/23/instagram-captions">Instagram captions</a> has always been a fairly casual exercise. They’re typically short, witty, or emotional. That kind of brevity and wit still has a place, but now, consider the fact that captions are going to be a key signal for search engines. Just like Google scans the body content of a blog post, it will now do the same to the keywords in your caption to determine whether your post will provide value to users in the search results.</p>
<p>Keyword density will be important. Depth, maybe even more so.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-post-caption-finalstraw.webp" alt="long instagram post caption example from finalstraw" width="454" height="850" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93855" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-post-caption-finalstraw.webp 454w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-post-caption-finalstraw-160x300.webp 160w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" /></p>
<p>For example, imagine you’re a fitness coach posting a Reel on “5 at-home workouts for beginners.” Instead of a vague caption like “get moving with me today,” try either transcribing your video or actually detailing the five workouts you’re talking about.</p>
<p>Your caption should explicitly mention <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/keyword-mapping">keywords</a> that drive volume on Google: queries like <em>beginner workout</em>, <em>at-home exercise</em>, or <em>fitness tips</em>. You can use Google’s Keyword Planner, Ubersuggest, or even autocomplete in the Google search bar to identify keywords to weave naturally into your captions. (You can also try <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">WordStream&#8217;s Free Keyword Tool</a> for more ideas!)</p>
<div id="optimize-alt-text-for-seo-and-accessibility"></div>
<h3>2. Optimize alt text for SEO and accessibility</h3>
<p>Instagram quietly added an alt text feature a few years ago, primarily for accessibility. Most users let Instagram auto-generate alt text, but now, marketers have a bigger incentive to customize it. Just like with website images, alt text on Instagram gives Google context about what your post contains.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-alt-text.webp" alt="instagram alt text example" width="900" height="473" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93856" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-alt-text.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-alt-text-480x252.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Let’s say you post a carousel showcasing “Minimalist Office Setup Ideas.” Instead of letting Instagram auto-tag it as “Photo of a desk,” you could write: <em>“Minimalist office setup with standing desk, white monitor, and ergonomic chair. Modern home office inspiration.”</em> This not only helps visually impaired users but also gives Google exactly the keywords it needs to rank your post.</p>
<div id="geotag-for-local-seo"></div>
<h3>3. Geotag for local SEO</h3>
<p>Nearly half of all Google searches have local intent, and <a href="https://business.google.com/us/think/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">76%</a> of people who search for something nearby on their smartphone visit a business within a day. That’s massive for brick-and-mortar stores, restaurants, and service providers. With Instagram posts now indexable, a geotag could mean your content surfaces in those local searches.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/summer-instagram-captions-home-services.webp" alt="summer instagram captions - example home services caption for summer" width="781" height="557" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91466" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/summer-instagram-captions-home-services.webp 781w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/summer-instagram-captions-home-services-480x342.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 781px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This Instagram post is geotagged for Phoenix, Arizona, and includes Arizona-related hashtags.</em></p>
<p>The takeaway? Always use location tags when posting about <strong>events, products, or services tied to a physical place</strong>. And when possible, pair your geotags with localized keywords in your caption to maximize visibility.</p>
<div id="build-evergreen-content-themes"></div>
<h3>4. Build evergreen content themes</h3>
<p>As mentioned, one of the biggest challenges with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-marketing">Instagram marketing</a> has been its content treadmill. Posts spike in engagement, then disappear in the algorithm’s black hole. Indexing changes that dynamic.</p>
<p>For marketers, that means rethinking <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-plan">content strategy</a>. Instead of only chasing trends, try deliberately building a library of posts around evergreen themes relevant to your brand. For example, a skincare brand might post Reels about “morning skincare routines,” “how to apply retinol,” or “best sunscreens for sensitive skin.” Those topics get searched year-round, giving your posts long-tail relevance in Google.</p>
<p>As an added layer to your current trends strategy, try identifying 5–10 <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/10/16/guide-to-evergreen-content-marketing">evergreen themes</a> in your industry using keyword research. Create Instagram posts around these topics consistently, so you build a bank of content with lasting value in both places.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Get copy-and-paste social media posts ready for the whole year</strong> in our <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteMonthlySocialMediaCalendarTemplate.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Template_MonthlySocialMediaCalendar_Download">free social media template</a>!</p>
<div id="encourage-engagement-as-a-ranking-signal"></div>
<h3>5. Encourage engagement as a ranking signal</h3>
<p>While Google doesn’t use Instagram “likes” directly in its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-algorithm">algorithm</a>, engagement still matters. Posts that get more comments, shares, and saves are more likely to be surfaced by Instagram, and that visibility in turn boosts signals to Google that the content is relevant. In other words, an engaged audience still helps your post rank better.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/vuori-instagram-post-example.webp" alt="vuori instagram post example with lots of engagement" width="900" height="662" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93857" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/vuori-instagram-post-example.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/vuori-instagram-post-example-480x353.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Marketers should treat engagement prompts as part of their SEO strategy. Instead of ending a caption with “Thoughts?” try something more specific: “Which of these office setups could you see yourself working in? Comment below!” or “Tag a friend who needs a new at-home workout routine.” These <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/13/call-to-action-examples">calls-to-action</a> not only drive comments, but also send positive signals that your post is worth surfacing.</p>
<div id="prevent-instagram-indexing"></div>
<h2>How to keep your Instagram content from being indexed on Google</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve talked about what to do to get your Instagram posts found on Google, but what if you DON&#8217;T want your content to show there? You have a couple of options:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Set your profile to private.</strong> Google will not index private Instagram profiles (and they also are not currently indexing personal Instagram account posts&#8211;only professional ones). We don&#8217;t really recommend this approach for business accounts, because it will limit who can see your posts within the app and create a barrier to entry for growing your page.</li>
<li><strong>Disable the indexing setting.</strong> If you don&#8217;t want to set your account to private but you also don&#8217;t want your posts indexed, you can toggle this setting off. Simply go to Settings &gt; Account privacy and then toggle off &#8220;Allow public photos and videos to appear in search results.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-index-settings.webp" alt="instagram indexing settings" width="900" height="502" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93864" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-index-settings.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/instagram-index-settings-480x268.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>Drive cross-channel value on Instagram</h2>
<p>For years, Instagram has been a closed loop: your content lived and died within the app. With Google now indexing content, marketers finally have a way to extend the lifespan of Instagram content and connect with audiences beyond their followers.</p>
<p>While that doesn’t mean you should turn every post into a blog article, it does mean you should be intentional about your strategy. The marketers who learn to balance creativity with SEO will be the ones whose Instagram content not only trends but also earns a lasting spot on Google.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember when &#8220;email marketing&#8221; meant blasting the same generic newsletter to your entire list and hoping for the best? Yeah, those days are about as dead as using Internet Explorer to browse the web.</p>
<p>Email marketing is still crushing it as one of the highest-ROI digital channels. We&#8217;re talking $36 returned for every dollar spent, according to some studies.</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re still relying on traditional tactics like batch-and-blast campaigns or basic demographic segmentation, you’ll be hard-pressed to reap the rewards of your email efforts.</p>
<p>In 2025, winning email marketers aren&#8217;t just using email for nurture sequences. They&#8217;re leveraging AI to write <strong>smarter emails, target better leads, and scale campaigns</strong> without sacrificing that personal touch that makes people want to open your emails.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into what AI email marketing looks like today, which tools are worth your time and budget, and how to leverage AI tactics for scale and high performance.</p>

<h2>What is AI email marketing?</h2>
<p>AI <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/01/email-marketing-tips">email marketing</a> is the use of artificial intelligence to personalize and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/01/automated-email-marketing">automate email campaigns</a> in ways that go beyond basic automation rules. With the help of large language models and machine learning, AI can map out customer behavior and dynamically react to deliver the right message at the right time—drastically improving open and click-through rates.</p>
<p>Using AI, email marketers can now <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/13/content-creation">generate content</a> and make decisions that would take a human marketer hours or days to figure out. The AI does this in ways that go <em>way</em> beyond basic automation and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/personalized-marketing">personalization</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s expand on that a bit.</p>
<p>Automation includes techniques like trigger-based emails, drip campaigns, and user journeys that send emails automatically under certain conditions. A <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/welcome-email-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">welcome email</a> that sends after you subscribe to a newsletter is an example. So is that &#8220;You left something in your cart&#8221; email.</p>

<p>Personalization is the process of adding dynamic content based on information you know about your customers or subscribers. For instance, using someone&#8217;s first name, company, or past purchase history to customize campaign messaging.</p>
<p>True AI is a bit different. It <em>learns from the data it collects</em> and optimizes itself over time. Imagine an email campaign that can predict which <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/31/email-subject-lines">subject line</a> will perform better for a specific <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/audience-segmentation-for-email-campaigns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">audience segment</a> before you even hit send. Or one that automatically adjusts <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/best-time-to-send-email-campaign">send times</a> based on individual recipient behavior patterns.</p>
<p>That’s AI-powered email marketing.</p>

<h2>How is AI used in email marketing?</h2>
<p>Where can and should AI show up if you’re looking to build out an AI-powered email marketing stack? Honestly, pretty much everywhere. Think:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data enrichment and </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/11/how-to-build-an-email-list"><strong>list building</strong></a>: AI can take a basic email address and fill in information like job titles, company size, and buying signals.</li>
<li><strong>Content generation: </strong>AI can create entire email sequences, adapt messaging based on persona, and even adjust tone based on what&#8217;s working for similar recipients.</li>
<li><strong>Segmentation:</strong> In place of manual segments based on demographics, AI can identify behavior patterns and create <em>dynamic</em> segments that update in real-time.</li>
<li><strong>Send-time optimization:</strong> AI can analyze when individual recipients are most likely to engage, and schedule emails accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Predictive lifecycle modeling:</strong> AI can predict where someone is in their buyer journey and automatically adjust messaging and cadence to match their stage and likelihood to convert.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-email-marketing-wordstream-true-classic.webp" alt="AI email marketing - email from True Classic" width="461" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93693 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-email-marketing-wordstream-true-classic.webp 461w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-email-marketing-wordstream-true-classic-231x300.webp 231w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>AI makes dynamic email marketing possible for even smaller brands.</em></p>
<p>Implementing a system that does all of the above is a sophisticated endeavor. But when done right, the result is a campaign that feels less like mass marketing and more like one-to-one conversations, even when you&#8217;re sending emails to thousands of people.</p>

<h2>7 tips to get more out of AI for email marketing</h2>
<p>Once you’ve picked the right tool, it’s time to orchestrate your first send.  Like with any marketing, it’ll take a little trial and error. Use these tips to start off strong.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Train AI with your own data:</strong> Don’t rely only on generic templates—feed your AI tool past subject lines, customer segments, and performance data so it learns your brand’s voice and audience preferences.</li>
<li><strong>Set clear goals before using AI</strong>: Whether you want higher open rates, more clicks, or reactivating dormant subscribers, giving your AI tool a defined target makes its recommendations more effective.</li>
<li><strong>Use AI suggestions as a starting point</strong>: Treat AI-generated subject lines or email copy as drafts you refine, rather than final versions. This keeps the human touch while saving time.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-email-marketing-wordstream-walks.webp" alt="AI email marketing - email with expert feedback." width="522" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93701 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-email-marketing-wordstream-walks.webp 522w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-email-marketing-wordstream-walks-480x552.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 522px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Add in expert points of view to humanize your AI email content.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Combine AI personalization with brand guidelines</strong>: Make sure dynamic content blocks stay aligned with your brand’s tone and compliance rules so personalization feels authentic, not robotic.</li>
<li><strong>Test small before scaling</strong>: Start with one AI-driven experiment, like send-time optimization or subject line testing, and expand once you see results. This avoids overwhelming your workflow and gives you more easily actionable data.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor performance regularly</strong>: AI isn’t “set it and forget it.” Check metrics like open rates, clicks, and conversions to ensure your tool is adapting correctly to your audience.</li>
<li><strong>Blend AI insights with human creativity</strong>: <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-experiments">Use AI</a> to spot trends or recommend ideas, but add context, storytelling, and emotional appeal that only a human marketer can bring.</li>
<li><strong>Keep data clean and up-to-date</strong>: AI performs best with accurate customer information, so regularly update your email lists and remove inactive or invalid contacts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>AI prompts for email marketing</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re using a tool like ChatGPT or Perplexity to help with some aspects of your email marketing, you&#8217;ll need to use the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-prompts">right prompts</a>. Here are some to try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give me ideas for newsletter copy that&#8217;s around 300 words long and features these five recent company updates [List the updates].</li>
<li>Brainstorm 10 subject lines for a newsletter that covers [topic] for [business] that will be sent to [describe audience]. Include emojis in three of the options and puns in three of the options.</li>
<li>Pretend you&#8217;re an email marketer for [business] and you want to promote [event, like a seasonal sale]. Your business&#8217;s three <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">value propositions</a> are [e.g., fast service, all-natural products, etc.]. Write the email copy and three variations of a subject line for this promotion.</li>
<li>Give me five options for calls to action for a marketing email. The goal is to get more people to [list an action like download a report or register for a webinar]. Make them creative, five words or fewer, and value-focused</li>
<li>Create a three-email nurture cadence to send after someone completes a demo of [your product]. One should go out immediately. The next two days later. And the third one week later. Emphasize the value of our product and offer [a benefit like a 10% discount] if they order within two weeks.</li>
<li>Tell me some ways I can personalize this promotional email, assuming the audience is [describe the audience]</li>
<li>Create a newsletter outline I can use for my monthly newsletter. It&#8217;s for [audience description] in [industry].</li>
</ul>

<div id="the-future-of-ai-email-marketing"></div>
<h2>The future of AI email marketing</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about where this is all heading, because the pace of change in AI email marketing is absolutely wild right now.</p>
<p>First, it’s fairly obvious that AI-generated content is going to get significantly better. But so are the filters designed to detect it. We&#8217;re already seeing major email providers getting more sophisticated at identifying AI-generated content, which means the bar for quality is only going to get higher. The winners will be marketers who can use AI to enhance human creativity, not replace it entirely.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-email-marketing-wordstream-gpt.webp" alt="AI email marketing - chatgpt email." width="937" height="701" class="aligncenter wp-image-93702 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-email-marketing-wordstream-gpt.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-email-marketing-wordstream-gpt-480x359.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>AI is good, but still requires strong prompts and human oversight to be truly personalized.</em></p>
<p>Also, email is becoming more adaptive and contextual. In the next few years, we&#8217;ll see emails that change content based on when and where they&#8217;re opened, what device is being used, and even real-time data about the recipient&#8217;s company or industry. Imagine an email that automatically updates pricing based on the prospect&#8217;s company size or includes <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/03/how-to-write-a-case-study">different case studies</a> based on their industry. Yeah. That’s coming.</p>
<p>I also think that the line between cold outreach and demand generation will continue to blur. AI is making it possible to send highly personalized, value-driven emails at scale, which means cold outreach is starting to feel more like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/05/inbound-marketing-examples">inbound marketing</a>. Prospects are getting emails that feel like content they would have subscribed to receive.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that marketers who can pair AI with human insight will absolutely crush those who are still stuck in the batch-and-blast era.</p>
<h2>Scale your AI email marketing systems, scale your revenue</h2>
<p>AI isn&#8217;t a replacement for good email marketing. But it is rocket fuel. When used strategically, it turns email from a static broadcast channel into a living system that gets better every single week.</p>
<p>Pro tip: You don&#8217;t need to implement everything at once. Start small. Pick one area where AI can solve a real bottleneck in your current process. Maybe it&#8217;s enriching your prospect lists, or maybe it&#8217;s optimizing your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/31/email-subject-lines">subject lines</a>. Focus on proving ROI in one area before expanding to others.</p>

And, if you weren’t already scared enough of the AI-induced end of mankind, we now have one more terrifying example to add to this list. Google’s new AI Mode. That’s right.

But the expansion of AI Overviews, which have been impacting search engine results pages (SERPs) for over a year now, is nothing to sneeze at. And with the launch of AI Mode, a more personalized, intuitive, and conversational version of search than anything else Google has created, marketers everywhere need to be informed about what exactly this means for their ability to drive organic traffic from search.</p>
<p>Never fear: we’re here to fill you in. Let’s dive into what AI Mode is, what it means for your organic search efforts, and what you can do to best position yourself for the future.</p>

<h2>What is AI Mode?</h2>
<p>To fully understand the implications of AI Mode, we first have to understand <em>what it is</em>. And to get at the root of AI Mode, we need to start with an exploration of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-overviews">AI Overviews</a>. If you’ve used Google at all in the past year, you’ve seen plenty of search results that look like this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ai-overviews-example-png.webp" alt="example of google ai overview for search on ai overviews" width="1999" height="963" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90414" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ai-overviews-example-png.webp 1999w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ai-overviews-example-1280x617.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ai-overviews-example-980x472.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ai-overviews-example-480x231.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1999px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An AI Overview of AI Overviews.</em></p>
<p>AI Overviews merge the power of Gemini, Google’s largest and most capable AI model, with traditional search. Google introduced AI Overviews as part of its <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/generative-ai-google-search-may-2024/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Search Generative Experience (SGE)</a> during the Google I/O conference in May 2023. Initially available in the United States, the feature was officially rebranded as AI Overviews and rolled out globally in October 2024 (and they&#8217;re <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-overviews-impact-on-seo">impacting SEO</a>).</p>
<p>AI Overviews essentially populate longer, more in-depth answers to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/05/25/keywords-vs-search-queries">search queries</a> that Google deems deserve them. You’re likely to get an AI Overview for queries that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Broad and informational-based. </strong><em>&#8220;How does solar panel efficiency compare by brand?&#8221;</em></li>
<li><strong>Comparison-based. </strong><em>&#8220;Tesla Solar Roof vs. traditional solar panels?&#8221;</em></li>
<li><strong>Multi-step. </strong><em>&#8220;What are the steps to install a standing seam metal roof?&#8221;</em></li>
<li><strong>Explanatory. </strong><em>&#8220;Why is fly fishing better in colder water?&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Per Google, their systems “automatically determine which links appear. There is nothing special for creators to do to be considered other than to follow our regular guidance for appearing in search, as covered in <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Search Essentials</a>.”</p>
<p>We’ll get to whether or not we buy this statement in our section on how to optimize for AI Overviews/AI Mode.</p>
<p>How does <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI Mode</a> differ? Well, it takes the conversation a step further. For users who want to have a more in-depth conversation on a topic (rather than just a single question-and-answer), AI Mode brings <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-use-google-bard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gemini’s chat experience</a> into the SERP. All you have to do is click on the icon.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/where-to-find-googles-ai-mode-png.webp" alt="google ai mode icon on serp" width="1200" height="668" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90420" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/where-to-find-googles-ai-mode-png.webp 1200w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/where-to-find-googles-ai-mode-980x546.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/where-to-find-googles-ai-mode-480x267.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>From there, users enter a query just as they would in traditional search. But instead of a one-and-done answer, they now have the ability to take their research a step further using the Ask AI Mode search bar.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ask-google-ai-mode-png.webp" alt="ask google ai mode search bar on google serp" width="1182" height="667" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90419" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ask-google-ai-mode-png.webp 1182w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ask-google-ai-mode-980x553.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ask-google-ai-mode-480x271.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1182px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is particularly useful for questions that require more advanced exploration, comparisons, and reasoning. It’s also particularly time-consuming if, like me, you’re addicted to entering research wormholes.</p>

<div id="has-ai-mode-been-fully-released"></div>
<h2>Has AI Mode been fully released?</h2>
<p>Not quite. Google first announced AI Mode on March 5 and has been testing and gathering feedback from a trusted sample of users. On March 24, <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-ai-mode-rolling-out-to-second-batch-of-users-now-453553" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they expanded to a second group of users</a>. That means that if you don’t currently see the “AI Mode” icon next to your search bar, you still need to manually opt-in. You can do that by going to the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?udm=50" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI Mode site</a> and opting into Search Labs&#8211;that will add you to a waitlist or grant you access.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ai-mode-optin-png.webp" alt="google ai mode opt in page" width="1200" height="707" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90542" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ai-mode-optin-png.webp 1200w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ai-mode-optin-980x577.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ai-mode-optin-480x283.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="how-does-ai-mode-change-the-current-landscape-of-search"></div>
<h2>How does AI Mode change the current landscape of search?</h2>
<p>Okay. Now that we have a good handle on <em>what AI Mode is</em> and how users will be engaging with it, let’s get to the good stuff. If, like me, you felt a wave of relief when you read that AI Mode was still constrained to test users and to manual opt-ins, I would suggest you think twice before letting that temporary sense of relief turn into complacency. For me, one paragraph from Google’s blog release was particularly telling:</p>
<p><em>“AI Mode is rooted in our core </em><a href="https://search.google/pdf/google-about-AI-overviews-AI-Mode.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>quality and ranking systems</em></a><em>, and we’re also using novel approaches with the model’s reasoning capabilities to improve factuality. We aim to show an AI-powered response as much as possible, but in cases where we don’t have high confidence in helpfulness and quality, the response will be a set of web search results.”</em></p>
<p>So here is Google telling us 1) That there’s not much publishers can do to optimize for AI Mode, and 2) That <em>they</em> <em>aim to show an AI-powered response as much as possible. </em>AI Overviews have increased considerably over the course of the past year, and you can bet that Google is going to continue to lean into AI and will <strong>soon roll out AI Mode to all users</strong>. That means that all the ways people have traditionally gotten to your site through search, things like the list below are going to be folded into one interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web links</li>
<li>Images</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/03/04/google-shopping-campaigns-tips-tricks">Google Shopping</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-knowledge-panel">Knowledge Graph</a></li>
<li>Maps</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-mode-view-on-google-png.webp" alt="ai mode view on google" width="1200" height="671" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90421" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-mode-view-on-google-png.webp 1200w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-mode-view-on-google-980x548.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-mode-view-on-google-480x268.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Naturally, Google anticipated pushback from search marketers who are worried that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-overviews-breaking-search">more AI is going to throttle their traffic</a>. Why go to a website when a user can get all the information they need from a chat module? And it’s a valid concern. But Google is basically saying: <em>If you’re producing quality content, don’t worry about it. Keep doing things the right way and you’ll be rewarded. </em></p>

<div id="how-to-optimize-for-ai-mode"></div>
<h2>How businesses can optimize for AI Mode</h2>
<p>To a certain extent, Google is right. They make the products, and they bring in the audience, so we’re all just playing the game based on the rules they set. It’s also true that if you spend too much time worrying about how to deal with various updates in search, you risk neglecting the hard work that leads to genuine results: creating <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/15/quality-content-defined">quality content</a>. It’s a platitude, but it’s proven true time and again.</p>
<p>So that’s my first tip for how publishers should prepare for AI Mode. Double down on what you’re doing <em>right. </em>Bring in credible content creators. Create <em>in-depth</em> content that comes from a place of expertise and genuinely solves a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points">pain point</a>. Make sure your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/02/improve-core-web-vitals">Core Web Vitals</a> and UX are strong, and that you’re generating high-authority links. All these things are going to lead to Google popping <em>your </em>link in an AI Overview, rather than your competitors.</p>
<p>That aside, here’s where I think businesses can move the needle in the new landscape of AI:</p>
<h3>1. Write content that AI wants to feature</h3>
<p>AI responses prioritize <strong>concise, authoritative, and structured</strong> content. That means you should, ideally and when appropriate, try to answer questions directly in the <strong>first 1-2 sentences</strong>. <em>Then </em>introduce deeper explanations, examples, and links.</p>
<p>It also means that you should become <em>extremely</em> well-acquainted with lists and tables. Are you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/06/irresistible-blog-post-titles">writing a blog post</a> on the exorbitant price of vegetables? Fight that urge to wax poetic, in paragraph form, about what the price of vegetables <em>used to be. </em>Instead, do this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/example-chart-content-vegetable-prices.png" alt="example chart content on vegetable prices" width="518" height="131" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90422" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/example-chart-content-vegetable-prices.png 518w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/example-chart-content-vegetable-prices-480x121.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 518px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Facetious example, but you get the point. Tables and structured content are easier for Google to interpret and relay to users.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/first-page-of-google?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_10WaysFirstPageGoogle_Download">10 Tangible &amp; Free Ways to Get on the First Page of Google</a></p>
<h3>2. Own the next step</h3>
<p>At a certain point, depending on the query, your user is going to <em>have </em>to leave the SERP to get the information they need. Your job is to <strong>own the queries and the content that live in that next step</strong>.</p>
<p>Sure, it’s going to get a lot easier for users to get straightforward answers from the SERP that they used to get from your website. But things like case studies, deeply opinionated and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/09/21/thought-leadership-marketing">data-backed thought-leadership</a>, and deep analysis: these are all areas where you can and should continue to shine.</p>
<h3>3. Strengthen E-E-A-T (Expertise, Experience, Authority, Trust)</h3>
<p>We talked about credibility a bit earlier, but we really can’t stress enough how important it is. Google is <strong>only going to show the most </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/14/google-e-e-a-t"><strong>authoritative, trustworthy sources</strong></a> in their AI Overviews. Why? Because if they show something not credible or untrue there, they’re liable to be in a world of sh*t.</p>
<p>That means that whenever possible, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add credentials, experience, and bylines to content (Google prefers content written by real experts).</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/author-bio-example-searchengineland-png.webp" alt="author bio example from search engine land" width="1200" height="446" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90482" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/author-bio-example-searchengineland-png.webp 1200w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/author-bio-example-searchengineland-980x364.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/author-bio-example-searchengineland-480x178.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Boost <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/10/link-building-secrets">backlinks</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/llm-tracking">mentions</a> from trusted sites.</li>
<li>Use first-hand data, surveys, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/03/how-to-write-a-case-study">case studies</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>
<p>Keep it credible, and you’ll give yourself the best chance to show up where it counts.</p>
<h3>4. Optimize for conversational search and follow-ups</h3>
<p>The whole point of AI Mode is to solicit follow-ups. As <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-seo-in-2024">we’ve written about at length</a>, search is continuing to shift more and more toward conversational, intent-driven content. Rather than be discouraged, you should look at this as an opportunity to show up for more conversational queries than ever before.</p>
<p>Things like schema markup/structured data, detailed <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/24/faq-page">FAQ sections</a>, and <strong>deliberately targeting related queries that AI Mode suggests</strong> are all going to allow you to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-referral-traffic">max out your traffic opportunities</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Monitor and adapt to AI traffic changes</h3>
<p>Adapting is the name of the game. As Matthew McConaughey says in <em>The Wolf of Wall Street</em> &#8220;Nobody— and I don’t care if you’re Warren Buffett or if you’re Jimmy Buffett— nobody knows if a stock is going to go up, down, sideways or in circles.” The same is true about AI Mode. People are going to speculate, but nobody really knows what kind of impact this is going to have on search until it’s fully released and we have enough data to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>That last point, the one about making <strong>data-backed and informed decisions</strong>, is really important. Make sure that your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/05/15/google-analytics-tips">analytics suite</a> is fully humming, and that you’re actively tracking your top keywords.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ga4-ai-traffic-source-png.webp" alt="ai traffic as a source in ga4" width="401" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90014" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ga4-ai-traffic-source-png.webp 401w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ga4-ai-traffic-source-201x300.webp 201w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You can track <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-referral-traffic">AI referral traffic</a> in GA4.</em></p>
<p>From there, it’s really as simple as following the cookie crumbs and making intuitive tweaks based on what the SERP is telling you.</p>
<h2>AI Mode is just as much an opportunity as a threat</h2>
<p>I’m firmly of the mind that any potential negative can be turned into a positive, and it’s no different with search. Every update Google gives us is another opportunity for the people that are paying attention and doing the right things to rise to the top.</p>
<p>Follow the tips we’ve laid out and continue to double down on things that are working, and you can rest assured that you’ll be where you want to be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write content that AI wants to feature</li>
<li>Own the next step</li>
<li>Strengthen E-E-A-T</li>
<li>Optimize for conversational search and follow-ups</li>
<li>Monitor and adapt to AI traffic changes</li>
</ol>

<h2>How to promote your YouTube channel: 9 ingenious ideas</h2>
<p>You’ve gone through all the trouble of creating killer content, so let&#8217;s get more eyes on it!</p>
<div id="use-the-right-keywords-in-the-right-places"></div>
<h3>1. Use the right keywords in the right places</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/youtube-seo">Optimizing your YouTube channel</a> and videos for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/30/seo-basics">SEO</a> is a non-negotiable tactic if you want viewers to find them. It’s free, completely scalable, and, if you do it effectively, can have massive implications for your visibility and reach.</p>
<p>Just like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-seo-guide">Google SEO</a>, you want to start by conducting some thorough <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide">keyword research</a> to find keywords relevant to your niche, products, and services. Tools like Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, Moz, SEMrush, and WordStream’s own <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">Free Keyword Tool</a> are all great tools to help here.</p>
<p>Another tactic to consider here is entering some queries related to your topic into YouTube’s search bar. Autocomplete will give you a good idea of what people are searching for and how to optimize your video for relevant keywords.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-youtube-search.webp" alt="How to promote your YouTube channel - screenshot of YouTube search." width="882" height="529" class="aligncenter wp-image-86079 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-youtube-search.webp 882w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-youtube-search-480x288.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 882px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Create a list of relevant keywords for your business. Then, identify the keywords on the list with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/01/23/keyword-search-volume">high search volume</a>.</p>
<p>From there, you’ll want to work these keywords strategically (and naturally!) into your videos’ <strong>titles, descriptions, and tags</strong> to improve your search rankings.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Want more?</strong> Download <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/big-easy-guide-to-kw-research?cid=Web_Any_Homepage_PPC_BigEasyKeyword_Download">The Big Easy Guide to Keyword Research for Businesses</a></p>
<div id="boost-ctr-with-engaging-titles-and-thumbnails"></div>
<h3>2. Boost CTR with engaging titles and thumbnails</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/click-through-rate">Click-through rate</a> (CTR) will also have a huge impact on your search rankings. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/15/youtube-algorithm">YouTube’s algorithm</a> automatically gives preference to videos that users engage with more frequently. If you want to increase your CTR, you <strong>need </strong>to make sure your titles are engaging, informative, and clickable, and include your primary keyword.</p>
<p>Showing people how to bake a cake? Don’t make your title &#8220;How to Bake a Cake.&#8221; Make it &#8220;Here’s How to Bake the Most Delicious Chocolate Cake You’ve Ever Tasted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, consider the impact that a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/07/youtube-thumbnail">super appealing thumbnail</a> can have on CTR. Thumbnails are typically the first visual impression users have of your video. Don’t make them bland. Use bright colors, readable text, and compelling, high-definition images that accurately represent your content, and you’ll be sure to increase click-through rate and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-rank-for-a-keyword">search rankings</a>.</p>
<div id="develop-a-consistent-content-schedule"></div>
<h3>3. Develop a consistent content schedule</h3>
<p>Like so many things in life, shooting for perfection when creating YouTube videos is the kiss of death. You never want to pump out mediocre content just for the sake of consistency, but you need to play the volume game.</p>
<p>Focus on quality above all, but once you’ve nailed down a formula for engaging content, you need to develop a consistent posting cadence. This will keep the flywheel of engagement spinning, keep your subscribers engaged, and keep your audience ever-growing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-schedule.webp" alt="How to promote your YouTube channel - YouTube's scheduling dashboard." width="558" height="590" class="aligncenter wp-image-86081 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-schedule.webp 558w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-schedule-480x508.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 558px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Leveraging YouTube’s scheduling feature is a great way to keep the flywheel spinning.</em></p>
<p>Start by determining a realistic schedule you can adhere to (whether it&#8217;s multiple times per week, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly). Consistency is the name of the game, so choose a schedule that fits your capacity to create quality content without burnout. Communicate this schedule to your audience by mentioning it in your videos, channel description, and across your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">social platforms</a>. This level of transparency sets expectations and builds anticipation.</p>
<div id="post-content-in-advance-and-at-the-right-times"></div>
<h3>4. Post content in advance and at the right times</h3>
<p>Want to streamline? Try batch filming and scheduling your videos in advance to ensure you always have the content in reserve ready to deploy. Tools like YouTube&#8217;s scheduling feature, pictured above, can help you do just that.</p>
<p>Consistency is one thing, but what about timeliness? Like any social platform, the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/08/best-time-to-post-on-youtube"> time of day and week you post to YouTube</a> significantly impacts your video&#8217;s performance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image7.webp" alt="How to promote your YouTube channel - Graphic of the best times to post on YouTube." width="936" height="304" class="aligncenter wp-image-86082 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image7.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image7-480x156.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here are some general insights:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Thursdays and Fridays:</strong> These are prime days to upload videos. Viewer engagement tends to increase towards the end of the workweek as people start looking for content to watch during their downtime.</li>
<li><strong>Saturdays and Sundays:</strong> These days see high viewer activity. Posting in the morning (between 9 and 11 AM) can capture viewers who are relaxing and have more time to watch videos.</li>
<li><strong>Weekday evenings (5 PM to 9 PM):</strong> During the week, viewers are more active during the evening after work or school. Posting during this time can increase the likelihood of your video being seen soon after it&#8217;s published.</li>
</ol>
<p>When in doubt, leverage <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/20/youtube-studio-reports">YouTube’s Analytics and reporting suite</a>, specifically the &#8220;When your viewers are on YouTube&#8221; report, to understand when your specific audience is most active.</p>
<div id="engage-with-your-audience"></div>
<h3>5. Engage with your audience</h3>
<p>Alright, so now you’ve optimized your videos for SEO. You’ve developed a consistent and timely posting schedule. Job done, right?</p>
<p>Not quite. Because while compelling content is great, engaging with your audience is really the cornerstone of building a successful YouTube channel. Nothing creates community, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/brand-loyalty">fosters loyalty</a>, and encourages repeat engagement <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/how-to-get-subscribers-on-youtube">among your subscribers</a> better than showing them that you are actively invested in the culture you are building around your YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Start by responding to comments on your videos. Whether you answer questions, acknowledge feedback, or simply thank viewers for their input, engaging in the comment section shows that you value your audience&#8217;s opinions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-reply.webp" alt="How to promote your YouTube channel - Screenshot of YouTube replies." width="869" height="505" class="aligncenter wp-image-86083 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-reply.webp 869w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-reply-480x279.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 869px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This will inevitably lead to higher engagement rates, as viewers are way more likely to comment when they know they will receive a response.</p>
<div id="leave-viewers-with-a-question-to-encourage-comments"></div>
<h3>6. Leave viewers with a question to encourage comments</h3>
<p>Want more comments? Encourage viewers to leave them by asking questions or prompting discussions at the end of your videos. You can also utilize YouTube’s Community Tab to post updates, polls, behind-the-scenes content, or even shout-outs to loyal subscribers. This is an excellent way to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/30/social-media-engagement">keep your channel active and engaging</a>, even when you&#8217;re not posting new videos.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/27/youtube-live">live streaming</a> is a great tool for real-time interaction. Hosting Q&amp;A sessions, live tutorials, or casual hangouts can significantly enhance your connection with viewers.</p>
<div id="collaborate-with-like-minded-creators"></div>
<h3>7. Collaborate with like-minded creators</h3>
<p>We know how it is. You put so much effort into your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/15/youtube-algorithm"> YouTube videos</a> that you’d like to believe they’ll gain traction on their own merit. You want to believe what you say or offer is unique and compelling enough to post and promote in a vacuum and get all the engagement you’ll ever need.</p>
<p>Listen: self-reliance isn’t a bad thing. But you’re severely handicapping your growth if you think you’ll max out your potential by going it alone.</p>
<p>Collaborating with other creators is a fundamental part of growing any YouTube channel. When you partner with fellow YouTubers in your niche or who serve a similar audience, you immediately gain access to a completely new set of qualified potential subscribers and customers.</p>
<p>Consider this partnership HelloFresh created with YouTube influencer Lee Williams.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-influencer.webp" alt="How to promote your YouTube channel - Influencer video for HelloFresh." width="357" height="586" class="aligncenter wp-image-86084 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-influencer.webp 357w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-influencer-183x300.webp 183w" sizes="(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/_sDClBReMe0?si=lNC5i8-R6gM8S_0l" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>By soliciting Lee to do an unboxing of one of its subscription food deliveries, HelloFresh gained instantaneous access to her 155k+ subscriber base. They also gained credibility by being associated with Lee’s lifestyle, which her audience loves. You don’t necessarily have to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/03/21/social-media-influencers">partner with influencers</a>; you can simply partner with another brand or creator. But creating this kind of partnership can give you a similar level of unprecedented access to audience growth.</p>
<div id="host-new-guests-and-get-featured-on-like-minded"></div>
<h3>8. Host new guests and get featured on like-minded channels</h3>
<p>Want to increase your reach even more? Get featured on other channels! You need to expose yourself to new audiences as much as possible to buoy your growth, and making guest appearances on like-minded creators’ channels is a surefire way to do just that. The same goes for featuring that guest on your channel.</p>
<div id="leverage-email-marketing"></div>
<h3>9. Leverage email marketing</h3>
<p>We know what you’re thinking. What on earth does YouTube have to do with email? Aren’t my other social platforms the best avenue to promote my videos?</p>
<p>While you should absolutely be promoting your YouTube videos on Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), and the like, leveraging <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/01/email-marketing-tips">email marketing</a> is an equally powerful strategy to get engagement. Here&#8217;s a five-step primer on using email marketing to boost your channel&#8217;s visibility:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Build your list: </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/11/how-to-build-an-email-list">Build an email list</a> of your subscribers and viewers who have opted in to receive updates from you. This list is <em>super valuable,</em> as it consists of people who are already interested in your content.</li>
<li><strong>Engage with subscribers</strong>: Send regular updates about your latest videos or series launches. Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/31/email-subject-lines">enticing subject lines</a> and thumbnails to grab attention and encourage people to click on your content.</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-email.webp" alt="How to promote your YouTube channel - Email promoting YouTube video." width="251" height="552" class="aligncenter wp-image-86085 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-email.webp 251w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-wordstream-email-136x300.webp 136w" sizes="(max-width: 251px) 100vw, 251px" /></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Personalize the emails: </strong>Personalize your emails to make them more relevant to each subscriber. Address them by their name and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/28/behavioral-segmentation">segment your list based on interests</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Give exclusive benefits: </strong>Use email to promote exclusive content or behind-the-scenes footage that is only accessible through that channel. This creates a sense of exclusivity and encourages subscribers to stay engaged with your updates via email.</li>
<li><strong>Get people sharing:</strong> Include <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/19/social-sharing">social sharing buttons</a> and encourage subscribers to share your videos with friends and networks.</li>
</ol>
<p>Integrate email marketing into your promotional strategy, and you’ll quickly build loyalty, drive traffic, and boost engagement.</p>
<h2>Promote your YouTube channel to accelerate growth</h2>
<p>Getting your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/optimize-youtube-ad-campaigns">YouTube channel</a> online is a huge first step, but serious growth happens when you <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/youtube-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actively promote it</a>.</p>
<p>You don’t need to spend hours doing it every day. Get started with 30 minutes per week using one or two of these YouTube promotion ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the right keywords in the right places</li>
<li>Boost CTR with engaging titles and thumbnails</li>
<li>Develop a consistent content schedule</li>
<li>Post content in advance and at the right times</li>
<li>Engage with your audience</li>
<li>Leave viewers with a question to encourage comments</li>
<li>Collaborate with like-minded creators</li>
<li>Host new guests and get featured on like-minded channels</li>
<li>Leverage email marketing</li>
</ol>

<p>But how can you increase site speed to start reaping these benefits? In this article, we’ll discuss what site speed is, why it’s important, and six ways business owners and marketers of all shapes and sizes can increase it.</p>

<h2>What is website speed?</h2>
<p>Website speed is the amount of time it takes for a web page to load <em>fully</em> in a user&#8217;s browser. It encompasses a number of factors, including the time it takes for the browser to receive the first byte of information from the server (i.e. Time To First Byte), the time needed to render and display content, and the overall responsiveness of a website or web page to various interactions by the user.</p>
<p>Web speed is critical for user experience (UX) and can significantly impact user satisfaction, engagement, and conversion rates. Studies have shown that <a href="https://www.portent.com/blog/analytics/research-site-speed-hurting-everyones-revenue.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sites that load in 1 second</a> have conversion rates <em>3 times higher</em> than sites that load in 5 seconds.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/page-load-speed-vs-conversion-rate.webp" alt="chart showing correlation between page speed and conversions" width="866" height="440" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85353" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/page-load-speed-vs-conversion-rate.webp 866w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/page-load-speed-vs-conversion-rate-480x244.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 866px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>That’s a crazy delta for a little bit of site optimization.</p>

<div id="why-is-website-speed-important"></div>
<h2>Why is website speed important?</h2>
<p>From a tech perspective, website speed is influenced by multiple factors, including server performance, network latency, code efficiency, and file size optimization. That may seem like a headache, but as discussed above: the benefits can be huge. Here are just a few of the reasons that website speed is critical:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>User experience</strong>. Faster loading times lead to better user experiences, reducing bounce rates and increasing engagement. Per Google, as page load time goes from one second to ten seconds, the probability of a mobile <a href="https://www.adlift.com/blog/impact-of-google-web-page-speed-on-user-experience/s/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20study%20by,one%20to%20ten%2Dsecond%20range." target="_blank" rel="noopener">site visitor bouncing <strong>increases by 123%</strong></a>.</li>
<li><strong>Conversion rates.</strong> We cited one conversion rate stat above, and here’s another: Walmart reported a <a href="https://www.cloudways.com/blog/impact-of-website-speed/#:~:text=Case%20Study%201%3A%20Walmart,their%20conversions%20increased%20by%202%25." target="_blank" rel="noopener">2% increase in conversions</a> for every 1 second improvement in page load time.</li>
<li><strong>Better rankings.</strong> As discussed above, site speed <em>is a ranking factor for search engines like Google</em>, and studies by site like Backlinko have proven this out.</li>
<li><strong>Increased revenue.</strong> It stands to reason, but we should spell it out here anyway: improved site speed directly impacts revenue. Amazon, for instance, reported a <a href="https://www.conductor.com/academy/page-speed-resources/faq/amazon-page-speed-study/#:~:text=Back%20in%202006%2C%20Amazon%20found,a%20fast%20site%20is%20important." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>1% increase in revenue</em></a> for every 100 milliseconds improvement in page load time.</li>

<div id="how-to-increase-website-speed"></div>
<h2>How to increase website speed</h2>
<p>We’ve talked about the what and the why, now let’s discuss the <em>how </em>of site speed optimization. Here are my top six strategies for increasing speed on your site.</p>
<h3>1. Compress and convert (i.e. “optimize”) your images</h3>
<p>If you’ve had any exposure to the site speed optimization game, you probably know that this is the easiest, and often the most productive, step you can take to reduce latency and increase <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PageSpeed Insights</a> scores. Let’s take a look at one such report, from a brand I like called Den that sells beautiful but egregiously overpriced cabin plans.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-insights-for-den.webp" alt="pagespeed insights for den" width="881" height="524" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85354" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-insights-for-den.webp 881w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-insights-for-den-480x285.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 881px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>First of all, I should mention: if you’re trying to increase site speed, PageSpeed Insights and <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTmetrix</a> are hands down the best diagnostic tools you can use to do so. They’re free, fast (usually), and they provide easy-to-follow lists of action items (and approximate bandwidth savings) that you can knock out to reduce page load time. These two tools are your best friend in this quest.</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll notice in this report is that Den’s homepage passes the Core Web Vitals assessment (if you want to learn more about Core Web Vitals, read our post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/19/core-web-vitals-google-page-experience-update">here</a>.) Each of the Core Web Vital metrics, except for Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), relates to page speed, and as such, we need to pay attention to them. And insofar as Core Web Vitals are a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/09/google-ranking-factors">ranking factor</a>, and help determine how high in the search results Google ranks your website, they are super important. But you should view them more as benchmarks that you can use to measure performance as you optimize for speed. That is to say: don’t freak out if you’re not passing, and there is nothing in these numbers themselves that you can actually use to improve your site speed.</p>
<p>Where the report gets juicy is when you scroll down to the performance section.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-insights-performance-report.webp" alt="pagespeed insights performance report" width="879" height="517" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85355" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-insights-performance-report.webp 879w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-insights-performance-report-480x282.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 879px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here you’re going to get a snapshot, on a scale of 1-100, of how fast your page is. As you can see, Den’s homepage has strong scores for Best Practices, SEO, and Accessibility, but is lacking a bit on the Performance front, with a score of 66 out of 100. Not bad for a fairly dynamic and image-intensive page, but with definite room for improvement. This performance score is what you need to pay attention to, as it takes into account all speed-related factors that <em>Google</em> takes into account when determining speed (and consequently, ranking your site).</p>
<p>Scroll down a bit more, and we can start digging into the various factors that are causing Den’s suboptimal website performance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-website-performance-factors.webp" alt="pagespeed website performance factors" width="890" height="597" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85356" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-website-performance-factors.webp 890w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-website-performance-factors-480x322.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 890px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As you can see, items related to images occupy the number two and three spots on Google’s list of most actionable inputs. In my fairly extensive experience, that is where you should expect to be when you run this report on your website. For the purposes of this section, we’re going to focus on “properly size images” (we’ll get to “defer offscreen images” in the next section). Let’s pull down the tab and see what Google tells us.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-insights-image-sizes.webp" alt="pagespeed insights image sizes" width="894" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85357" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-insights-image-sizes.webp 894w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-insights-image-sizes-480x322.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 894px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For reference, anything above 500 KiB (kilobytes) is pretty damn big. And really, in today’s age of next gen image formats, you should really never be above 250 KiB. So there’s a lot for Den to to work on here, with some potentially big savings available.</p>
<p>How would one optimize these images? There are a few ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run the image through a free compression tool, like TinyPNG or <a href="https://compressor.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compressor.io</a>, then re-upload the image to your web page or CMS.</li>
<li>Convert the image to a next-gen image format (specifically, WebP) using a free tool like <a href="https://cloudconvert.com/png-to-webp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cloudconvert.com</a>. WebP is inherently served in the most compressed version, so if your CMS can accept it, I would highly recommend using this method.</li>
<li>Use your CMS to either bulk compress your PNGs and JPGs, or bulk convert your images to WebP. Webflow, for instance, has an out-of-the-box feature that allows for this conversion in bulk. If you’re using WordPress, you can download any number of extensions that allow you to accomplish the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>Image compression is really the lowest-hanging fruit in site speed optimization. Leverage the above methods, and you’ll see your speed scores climb quickly.</p>
<h3>2. Lazy load your images</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/08/lazy-loading-seo">Lazy loading</a> is number two on this list because, once again, I often find it at or near the top of Google’s reports. Remember that “Defer offscreen images” recommendation from above? Anytime you see that, know that Google is referring to <em>lazy loading</em>.</p>
<p>Lazy loading, as I discuss in this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/08/lazy-loading-seo">excellent post on the topic</a>, is defined as the following:</p>
<p><em>“Lazy loading, in a nutshell, allows you to defer slow-loading page elements until after your page has rendered. It’s a way of making sure a user “gets” to your site (and doesn’t bounce) before doing the heavy work of loading some of the bigger, non-critical, below-the-fold elements on your web page.”</em></p>
<p>So let’s revisit that PageSpeed Insights report and see what it says under the “Defer offscreen images” tab:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-defer-offscreen-images.webp" alt="pagespeed insights report - defer offscreen images" width="890" height="575" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85358" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-defer-offscreen-images.webp 890w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-defer-offscreen-images-480x310.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 890px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Would you look at that: it’s all the same culprits that we found in the prior section! This is actually great news. Because depending on what kind of CMS you’re using, be it Shopify, WordPress, Bigcommerce, or Webflow, you’ll often be able to knock out image compression and lazy loading in one fell swoop. WordPress, for instance, has a great extension called Smush that implements lazy loading and bulk compression for you.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/smush-report.webp" alt="smush report" width="884" height="561" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85359" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/smush-report.webp 884w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/smush-report-480x305.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 884px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/lazy-loading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shopify</a>, on the other hand, will require some very specific (but very doable) CSS tricks that you can pass on to your developer. <a href="https://sqskits.com/plugins/lazy-loading-images-for-squarespace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Squarespace</a> has its own plugin that you can work with. And <a href="https://webflow.com/feature/new-images-set-to-lazy-load-by-default" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Webflow</a>, bless its heart, sets all of its images to lazy load by default. Whatever backend you’re working with, simply research the implementation they recommend and attack from there.</p>
<h3>3. Optimize for mobile first!</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve seen the power of Google’s PageSpeed Insights in action, and before we move onto the next section, I’d be remiss to mention: <strong>do not sleep on the Mobile tab of this report</strong>!</p>
<p>Depending on your business model and the nature of your site, you may (and may likely, in some cases) be getting more mobile traffic than desktop traffic. Take a quick peak into Google Analytics to find the exact percentage. Even sites with strong desktop scores often score poorly on mobile, because mobile has its own specific set of requirements you need to fulfill for optimal speed. And we can use Den’s scores as a case in point here.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-mobile-report.webp" alt="pagespeed mobile report" width="852" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85360" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-mobile-report.webp 852w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-mobile-report-480x337.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 852px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>33 looks pretty brutal on its face, and I’m sorry to say that if you’ve never worked on mobile speed, you’re likely to see something similar. Most site owners neglect this area, and consequently see scores in the 30s and 40s. But guess what? That probably means your competitors haven’t dug into this area either. You can and should use this report as an opportunity to forge and spring ahead.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f495.png" alt="💕" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Want more tips and ideas?</strong> We&#8217;ve got 130+ for you!

<h3>4. Reduce unused JavaScript</h3>
<p>Number three on our list is, you guessed it, another recommendation that Google often lists at or near the top of its PageSpeed Insights reports. Because if we’re going to do the work, why not go after the most profitable outcomes, right? In this case, we’re talking about reducing unused JavaScript.</p>
<p>A quick note: you’ll often see code <em>compression </em>(as opposed to reduction) also listed in this report, but in my experience, the potential savings are generally far lower. Den, for instance, can save a mere 4 KiB of data from compression, compared to reduction, which can save them 332 KiB.</p>
<p>In my experience, the biggest offenders here are nearly always third-party scripts. Scripts from Google Tag Manager, various ad platforms, Google Analytics, and the like, can really hinder speed (when they are not needed). Let’s check out the report.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-javascript-savings.webp" alt="pagespeed insights report javascript" width="856" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85361" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-javascript-savings.webp 856w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pagespeed-javascript-savings-480x336.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 856px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For their part, you can see that most of Den’s issues are coming from the variety of snippets they are firing through Google Tag Manager. Now, the idea is not to remove all of these. It’s simply to go through and see what you really need and what you don’t. For instance: are you firing a Facebook pixel on a landing page you specifically set up for a Google Ads campaign? Are you firing a HotJar pixel on your product page, despite not including it in the split test you’re running? Are you firing an instance of Google Analytics from Google Tag Manager when you already have it hard-coded into the header of your site?</p>
<p>For their part, Google has some <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/unused-javascript/?utm_source=lighthouse&amp;utm_medium=lr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">useful documentation</a> on how to reduce JavaScript in a given situation, depending on the CMS. Again, the idea is not to remove everything, just the stuff you’re not using.</p>
<p>Keep in mind: saving 332 KiB of bandwidth is great, but it’s possible that you just accomplished that by compressing a single image. That is not to dissuade you from tackling this step, but simply to hammer home that you should be spending your time on the items in the report that are going to yield you the greatest savings.</p>
<h3>5. Leverage a Content Delivery Network (CDN)</h3>
<p>A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of distributed servers placed in data centers across various geos. Its primary purpose is to deliver content and other assets (think: images, videos, scripts, stylesheets, etc.) to users <strong>more efficiently and reliably.</strong></p>
<p>CDNs work by<strong> caching content in edge servers located closer to end-users</strong>. This reduces the physical distance data needs to travel, which thereby decreases latency and improves speed. Here’s a quick visual of what that looks like in practice:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/content-delivery-network.webp" alt="how content delivery network works" width="843" height="378" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85362" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/content-delivery-network.webp 843w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/content-delivery-network-480x215.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 843px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Implementing a CDN provides several benefits that contribute to improving site speed. Here are the top 3:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reduced latency.</strong> By delivering content from servers closer to the user&#8217;s location, CDNs minimize the time it takes for data to travel, significantly reducing latency and improving page load times.</li>
<li><strong>Load balancing.</strong> CDNs distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers, preventing any single server from becoming overwhelmed and ensuring consistent performance even during periods of high traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Caching static content.</strong> CDNs cache static content like images, CSS files, and scripts, storing them on edge servers for faster retrieval. This reduces the load on the origin server and speeds up content delivery.</li>
</ol>
<p>To set up a CDN, all you have to do is choose a reputable provider, configure the settings to specify which content to cache and how it should be delivered, and integrate it with your site.</p>
<h3>6. Enable browser caching</h3>
<p>Browser caching is the process of <strong>storing resources locally</strong> on a user&#8217;s device the first time they visit a website. These resources are then <strong>reused for subsequent visits</strong>, rather than being downloaded from the server again. Caching is a huge lever for increasing site speed, and it can provide the very pleasant double whammy of reducing hosting costs.</p>
<p>To set up browser caching, the first thing you need to do is configure your server to include cache-control headers in HTTP responses. These headers specify how long a browser should cache resources before checking for updates. Here&#8217;s a basic approach:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Edit server configuration.</strong> Access your server&#8217;s configuration file (such as .htaccess for Apache servers or nginx.conf for Nginx servers).</li>
<li><strong>Add cache-control headers. </strong>Include directives like &#8220;Cache-Control&#8221; or &#8220;Expires&#8221; to specify the caching duration for different types of resources. For example, you can set a longer expiration time (i.e., one year) for static resources like images, CSS, and JavaScript files, and a shorter expiration time for dynamic content like HTML pages.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/cache-control-headers.webp" alt="cache control headers" width="871" height="438" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85363" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/cache-control-headers.webp 871w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/cache-control-headers-480x241.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 871px, 100vw" /></li>
<li><strong>Check your status.</strong> After making changes, pop your website back into PageSpeed Insights to see how much of an improvement was made!</li>
</ol>
<p>By implementing browser caching effectively, you can enhance your site&#8217;s performance, reduce server load, and provide a faster and smoother browsing experience for your visitors.</p>
<h2>Increase your website speed, increase your revenue</h2>
<p>It’s really that simple. Speed was important before Google ever made it a ranking signal because of its impact on the user experience. But now that Google is actively using signals like Core Web Vitals to determine where your site should rank in comparison to your competitors, it’s no longer something business owners and marketers can ignore. <em>Especially</em> in today’s age of mobile proliferation and instant gratification, where consumers want the information they want, where they want it, right now.</p>
<p>So the next time you dive into a PageSpeed Insights report, think not about how mundane or overly technical it all seems; think about how much money you’re going to make by taking these three simple steps. Good luck!</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a recap of how to increase website speed:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Compress and convert (i.e. “optimize”) your images</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Lazy load your images</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Optimize for mobile first!</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Reduce unused JavaScript</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Leverage a Content Delivery Network (CDN)</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Enable browser caching</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re reading this, chances are you already know how powerful a tool search engine optimization (SEO) can be to win business. Increasing your visibility and rankings in search results is one of the most efficient ways to scale revenue online.</p>
<p>But because Google’s algorithm is constantly changing, and the search engine giant takes steps daily to make the search results more relevant for users, what constitutes an “effective” SEO strategy changes frequently.</p>
<p>That means what worked in 2012 may not work in 2024, and what SEO marketers did <em>last month</em> may already be outdated.</p>
<p>This guide exposes seven SEO strategies you <em>shouldn’t </em>use because Google’s algorithm has made them obsolete.</p>

<h2>7 outdated SEO tactics to avoid</h2>
<p>The seven <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/seo/">SEO strategies</a> on this list were winners at one point, but they’ll no longer help your pages <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-rank-higher-on-google/">land high up in search results</a>. Even worse, a few could entice Google to penalize your website.</p>
<div id="stuffing-keywords"></div>
<h3>1. Stuffing keywords</h3>
<p>Picture this: you’re looking for a way to keep your patio warm during the cooler months and stumble upon this article about types of firepits.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-firepits.webp" alt="example of keyword stuffing in online content" width="641" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85258" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-firepits.webp 641w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-firepits-480x449.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 641px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This feels like a webpage from 2005, but sadly,<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/03/21/dangers-of-keyword-stuffing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> keyword stuffing</a> like this still exists. Some marketers and content creators still make the<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/seo-mistakes/"> SEO mistake</a> of believing that the more times a keyword and its variations are jammed into an article, the better their chance of ranking for said keywords.</p>
<p>You don’t read many articles like this anymore because Google is doing everything possible to push them down the rankings.<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/serp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Search engines</a> today look for relevant, helpful content above all, and while a post like the above is certainly relevant, it does not rise to the level of providing actual value.</p>
<p>Why? Because the content creator is shooting for traffic first and value second. Remember that concept, as it applies to pretty much every outdated strategy on this list.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f50e.png" alt="🔎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Need help finding the right keywords?</strong> Try our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">Free Keyword Tool</a>!</p>
<div id="using-unedited-ai-content"></div>
<h3>2. Using unedited AI content</h3>
<p>Regardless of your opinion on<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/ai-content-marketing/"> AI’s use in marketing</a>, it has made<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/ai-prompt-examples/"> content creation</a> much easier. Why spend hours researching and composing a post about fire pit tables, for example, when you can just tell<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/06/how-to-use-chatgpt-for-small-business-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ChatGPT</a> to spin you up a quick 750-word post and copy and paste the product onto your blog?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-chatgpt.webp" alt="example of helpful seo prompt in chatgpt" width="882" height="513" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85259" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-chatgpt.webp 882w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-chatgpt-480x279.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 882px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The right </em><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/08/chatgpt-prompts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>prompt on ChatGPT</em></a><em> can help you brainstorm content ideas. </em></p>
<p>The reason, if you’ve ever tried this approach, is that the result is pretty bad. AI <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-copywriting-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content creation tools</a> are still not good enough, without significant coaching, to create long-form content that is unique, relevant, useful, and, above all, human.</p>
<p>With enough time and effort, you can coax some of these things out of ChatGPT, but if you’re relying solely on AI to create engaging content, you’re going to come up seriously short. Google’s quality content guidelines (known as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/14/google-e-e-a-t">E-E-A-T</a>) call for content written by credible authors with personal experience in the topic.</p>
<p>By all means, use <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/ai-in-marketing-examples/">AI in your marketing</a>. It’s crazy good, and it works! But use it for what <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-in-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI is best at</a>, like topic ideation, creating frameworks, and sorting out large collections of data. But do not think of it like an author who is going to create compelling content that will rank on search engines.</p>
<div id="farming-out-content"></div>
<h3>3. Farming out content</h3>
<p>Another thing Google’s E-E-A-T guidelines made clear is that, ideally, content from topic experts should take priority in search results (although <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-overviews-breaking-search" rel="noopener">AI Overviews</a> muddy that message).</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean that if you run a roofing company, you must hire authors with doctorates in roofing systems to create all your content. But, they should at least be credible and knowledgeable about roofing, or have demonstrated knowledge in whatever subtopic they write about.</p>
<p>The problem with farming out content to creators without knowledge of a topic is that it will be created for quantity, not quality—which is something Google warns against. Not to mention, quality control can be extremely difficult if you’re getting a whole bunch of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post" rel="noopener">blog posts</a> produced very quickly and without any expertise included in them.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t to say you can&#8217;t and shouldn&#8217;t outsource content if that&#8217;s part of your strategy. But you should be choosing authors or businesses with experience in your niche.</p>
<div id="creating-pages-for-every-keyword-variation"></div>
<h3>4. Creating pages for every keyword variation</h3>
<p>In the early days of search engines, Google’s algorithm could not understand complex search queries. If you were looking to do some research on what food to feed your pup, you probably would have just searched “dog food” or “dog food near me.”</p>
<p>Today? You’re probably searching for something like, “What is the best natural dog food for my Alaskan Malamute?” Not only will Google understand what you’re asking, it will actually return a result relevant to that query.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-dog-food.webp" alt="google search results for dog food search" width="901" height="587" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85260" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-dog-food.webp 901w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-dog-food-480x313.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 901px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Google’s algorithm has gotten way better at understanding niche keywords.</em></p>
<p>As<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/2024-google-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Google’s algorithm</a> has gotten more sophisticated and better at understanding complex queries, the way we search has changed, too. We now expect hyper-relevant results for anything that pops into our brains.</p>
<p>For SEOs and search marketers, creating several pages targeting slight variations of the same keyword is an outdated SEO tactic. You don’t need to create a page for “dog food” and one for “food for dogs” because the search intent is the same.</p>
<p>Now, if a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/related-keywords" target="_blank" rel="noopener">related keyword</a> has high search volume and is returning different results than your base keyword, then target it with its own page. But more often than not, Google is good enough to understand that people who use similar, but not exactly the same, words in a search may actually be searching for the same thing.</p>
<p>How can you tell whether a variant deserves its own page? Google it and see if the results are unique.</p>
<div id="using-nongranular-keyword-and-domain-data"></div>
<h3>5. Using non-granular keyword and domain data</h3>
<p>SEO is such a competitive game nowadays. Gone are the days when you could simply spin up a blog post targeting any old keyword, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/04/internal-linking" rel="noopener">throw in a couple of internal links</a>, and rank on page one. More businesses and marketers than ever are putting resources into this channel, so without a data-backed strategy, you’ll have a hard time getting traffic from search engines this way.</p>
<p>To compete, you’ll need to get granular in the data. At the very least, this means understanding the monthly search volume and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/12/keyword-difficulty" rel="noopener">keyword difficulty</a> (aka the “competition”) of the keywords you are targeting. You want to target keywords that get some search volume but aren’t so competitive that you’ll never win a place on the results page.</p>
<p>You can go much deeper into your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/local-keyword-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keyword research</a> and use an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-seo-tools" rel="noopener">SEO tool</a> to find things like the number of backlinks the existing pages have (Google often ranks content with more backlinks higher).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-ahrefs.webp" alt="backlink report from ahrefs" width="873" height="515" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85261" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-ahrefs.webp 873w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-ahrefs-480x283.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 873px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Backlink reports, like this one from Ahrefs, give you more details to help you make smart keyword strategy decisions. </em></p>
<p>You can continue digging deeper to see the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-domain-authority/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">domain authority</a> of the pages you’ll compete against and other pieces of data that help you choose the best keyword strategy.</p>
<p>In short, take the steps necessary to go past the broad and into the granular, and you’ll think like a modern SEO.</p>
<div id="buying-links"></div>
<h3>6. Buying links</h3>
<p>This one is a bit complicated. If you’ve ever embarked on a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/link-building" rel="noopener">link-building campaign</a>, you know that link outreach has a relatively low success rate. It’s extremely challenging. Buying guest posts and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/06/21/b2b-link-building" rel="noopener">backlinks</a> from a vendor is way easier. And contrary to popular belief, buying backlinks isn’t strictly against Google’s policies, but they say you should tag them as such.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-buying-links.webp" alt="google policy on buying links" width="821" height="337" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85262" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-buying-links.webp 821w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-buying-links-480x197.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 821px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#:~:text=Google%20does%20understand%20that%20buying,to%20the%20tag." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Google’s policy</em></a><em> on buying and selling links. </em></p>
<p>In general, though, we don’t suggest buying links because it’s difficult to discern the link’s credibility. Instead, we recommend building links organically by creating linkable content and promoting it to potential linking websites.</p>
<p>No matter how you acquire them, don’t chase spammy or non-relevant links purely to increase your page authority and impress Google. For example, don’t push for a link to your healthcare website from a website that sells toilets because it will likely hurt, not help, your ability to rank.</p>
<p>Here’s a shortcut to make this distinction. If someone reading a web page would genuinely benefit from clicking a link to your website, then it’s a valid backlink to chase.</p>
<div id="spamming-comments-with-links"></div>
<h3>7. Spamming comments with links</h3>
<p>In the Wild West of early SEO, webmasters often plastered their website’s links in comment sections, forums, and discussion boards to make it look like they had tons of backlinks. Google quickly realized that this wasn’t a good power for marketers to have. The search engine cracked down on this by eliminating these links from consideration when determining <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/12/domain-authority" rel="noopener">ranking authority</a>.</p>
<p>Chances are, if you’ve written or read a blog before, you’ve probably seen at least one comment that looks like this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-canada-goode.webp" alt="example of spammy comment" width="671" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85263" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-canada-goode.webp 671w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-canada-goode-480x429.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 671px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A spammy comment like this is doing this site no favors. </em></p>
<p>Google has gotten wise to this tactic, so spamming comment sections across the internet with your links will not improve your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/17/website-visibility" rel="noopener"> search visibility</a>.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t comment. Consider the principles we laid out at the start of this post, like quality over quantity. Be useful, helpful, and relevant. Don’t try to manipulate the algorithm. Posting links in comments may not earn you points with Google. Still, if you’re providing value and contributing to the discussion, you can<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/07/23/referral-traffic-links" rel="noopener"> drive referral traffic</a> and increase your<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/brand-awareness-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> brand awareness</a>, which can aid in your overall SEO efforts.</p>
<h2>Don’t kill your outdated SEO tactics; adapt them!</h2>
<p>If you made it all the way through this post, you probably noticed a theme. Never shun a tactic merely because it is outdated. Learn from it instead. In telling us what we shouldn’t do, most of these tactics provide an exact roadmap for how we should approach driving visibility and business value through SEO (see how <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-evolution-in-2024">SEO is evolving</a>).</p>
<p>Here’s how you can turn each of these outdated SEO tactics into winning strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stuffing keywords:</strong> Use relevant keywords organically.</li>
<li><strong>Using unedited AI content:</strong> Use AI to brainstorm or summarize data.</li>
<li><strong>Creating pages for every keyword variation:</strong> Create content that addresses related topics with unique search intent.</li>
<li><strong>Using non-granular keyword and domain data:</strong> Use keyword tools to find volume and competition data that help you choose the best keywords to target.</li>
<li><strong>Buying links:</strong> Look for ways to get relevant links from credible websites.</li>
<li><strong>Spamming comments with links:</strong> Engage thoughtfully in comments and discussion boards, adding links only when they aid the conversation.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re a business owner or marketer, you’ve probably seen a bunch of Reddit results in search results, and you might be wondering what the deal is. If you don’t know, Reddit is the internet’s collective subconscious, a platform where folks from all walks of life can go to talk about their experiences, post content, and learn about topics that interest them.</p>
<p>Because of its relative lack of structure compared to other social media platforms, Reddit doesn’t get a ton of love among business owners looking to promote their products and services. And that is a huge missed opportunity. Because when used correctly, Reddit can seriously buoy your marketing efforts and become a valuable stream of revenue for your business.</p>
<p>In this post, we’re going to discuss precisely that. Let’s walk through how Reddit works, then talk about five strategies you can use to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">drive traffic</a> from this unique platform.</p>

<h2>What is Reddit?</h2>
</div>
<p>With over <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/reddit-users">500 million</a> users, Reddit is perhaps the world’s biggest discussion board.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/number-of-reddit-users.webp" alt="chart showing number of reddit users through 2028" width="678" height="532" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83988" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/number-of-reddit-users.webp 678w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/number-of-reddit-users-480x377.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 678px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Number of past, current, and projected Reddit users by year. </em></p>
<p>You can separate Reddit’s value props into three main buckets: <strong>social news aggregation, content rating, and discussion</strong>. All of Reddit’s content is <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/28/user-generated-content">user-generated</a>, meaning users create their own posts, many of which contain links, images, and videos.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-user-generated-content.webp" alt="example of question in reddit subreddit with answer" width="871" height="491" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83990" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-user-generated-content.webp 871w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-user-generated-content-480x271.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 871px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>These posts are organized in user-created boards called &#8220;subreddits,&#8221; depending on their topic or theme. Subreddits typically include topics like technology, news, movies, and gaming, but really, a subreddit could exist for <em>virtually any subject imaginable</em>.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of Reddit’s key features:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Subreddits</strong>. As mentioned, these are individual communities within Reddit, each dedicated to a particular topic. They are denoted by the prefix &#8220;r/&#8221; followed by the topic name, r/memes, r/dankmemes, and r/WatchPeopleDieInside (we told you, there’s a subreddit for everything.)</li>
<li><strong>Posts and comments.</strong> Posts within subreddits include text, links, images, and videos. Users then comment on these posts to create threads.</li>
<li><strong>Voting system.</strong> Reddit uses an upvote and downvote system that allows users to “rate” content. Posts and comments with more upvotes appear higher on the page, increasing their visibility, while those with more downvotes become less visible.</li>
<li><strong>Karma</strong>. Users earn karma points when their posts or comments are upvoted. Karma serves as a rough measure of a user&#8217;s contributions to the community.</li>
<li><strong>Moderation</strong>. Each subreddit is moderated by a team of volunteers who enforce community-specific rules and Reddit&#8217;s overall content policies. They have the authority to remove posts, ban users, and manage discussions within their subreddit.</li>
<li><strong>Reddit Gold/Premium</strong>. Reddit offers a premium subscription service called Reddit Premium, which provides an ad-free experience, access to a private subreddit, and other perks.</li>
</ol>
<p>The main draw of Reddit is precisely that: it’s open. As long as users follow the rules of a given subreddit, they are allowed to post candidly about whatever topic intrigues them. For that reason, people not only flock to Reddit for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/19/brand-community">community</a>, but to find unfiltered answers to questions that they may not be able to find anywhere else on the internet.</p>
<p>Posing a question on Reddit is like posing it to an enormous, virtual living room of interested parties. The answer may not always be what you want, but you’ll get no shortage of opinions.</p>

<h2>Why is Reddit important?</h2>
</div>
<p>Because of its diverse user base and wide range of content, Reddit is an extremely popular platform for discussing current events, sharing personal stories, and seeking advice. Depending on your vertical and business, that means it can <em>also </em>be an extremely valuable platform from which to drive traffic.</p>
<p>And, not only that, but <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2024-google-algorithm-updates">Google’s recent algorithm update</a> has made Reddit even more prominent on the SERP. Many queries now contain a link to Reddit or a “Discussions and forums” section that typically includes links to subreddits.</p>

<h3>1. Find the subreddit where your customers are engaging</h3>
</div>
<p>Let’s say you’re a roofing company in California. You want to find potential customers who are actively searching for roof replacements or services. In all likelihood, you’re going to have a difficult time finding a subreddit where homeowners are <em>just </em>talking about roofs. Why? Because roofs on their own are not all that interesting.</p>
<p>That said, a quick Google search for “roofing california reddit” shows that there are some interesting subreddits upon which you, as the business owner, may lurk to search for customers:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-find-subreddit.webp" alt="example of subreddit showing in serps for roofing search" width="869" height="445" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83992" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-find-subreddit.webp 869w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-find-subreddit-480x246.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 869px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The first listing here is a post within a subreddit called r/Roofing. The forum description reads as follows: <em>Greetings! This sub is for questions, interesting pics or videos and stories about roofing. We welcome roofers, handy-people, homeowners and anyone else who is roof-curious.</em></p>
<p>As a roofing contractor, this is going to be a really interesting subreddit to hang out on. Granted, the group does not consist exclusively of homeowners (i.e. potential customers), but even posts from other contractors can help you glean information about the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/21/competitive-analysis-templates">competitive landscape</a>, pricing, and other useful information that can win you business.</p>

<h3>2. Be useful first; promote second</h3>
</div>
<p>Most subreddit moderators are extremely wary of users who are just in the thread to promote their products and services, and rightly so. As such, if you hop right into a discussion with a link to your website, and if you do this multiple times, you risk not only alienating yourself from the discussion but getting banned altogether.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-be-useful.webp" alt="example of banned user comment" width="936" height="353" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83993" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-be-useful.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-be-useful-480x181.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Breaking the rules is a surefire way to get banned from the sub, and the majority of subreddits contain rules prohibiting “excessive self-promotion.” But guess what? You’re not here to promote your products anyway. You’re here to be <em>useful </em>and <em>provide value. </em></p>
<p>Just like a door-to-door salesman, your job when you enter the subreddit is, first and foremost, to <em>help people. </em>Using our roofing example, that means that if a consumer wants some help pricing out a job, you don’t jump right in and offer them a quote and ask for an appointment.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-subreddit-tips.webp" alt="example of posting useful content, not promotional, on reddit" width="651" height="424" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83994" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-subreddit-tips.webp 651w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-subreddit-tips-480x313.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 651px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Instead, you might try giving them some insight into <em>why </em>the quotes they’ve gotten look the way that they do, how <em>you</em> would estimate their roof if you were doing the job, and <em>why</em> you would charge that much for the job. At that point, if the homeowner likes the value you have provided, he is likely to follow up with another question, at which point you can offer to have a call or come out for an in-person appointment.</p>

<h3>3. Post your own content</h3>
</div>
<p>The key to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-smart-bidding">driving traffic from Reddit</a> is being an <em>engaged user</em>. Being an engaged user doesn’t mean jumping into the platform every few weeks to post a link. It doesn’t even mean answering questions every now and again with a valuable tip. It means <strong>being frequently involved in, and contributing to</strong> the subreddits on which your customers are having discussions.</p>
<p>You want to be seen as a valuable member of the community. Someone who has experience and credibility in your vertical, and who people can turn to when they are looking for answers. The most straightforward way to do this is by posting your own content, rather than merely commenting on the posts of others.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-post-own-content.webp" alt="example of AMA post on reddit" width="473" height="388" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83995" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-post-own-content.webp 473w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-post-own-content-300x246.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px" /></p>
<p>Posts like this AMA (Ask Me Anything) show users that you are a dedicated member of the community first, and a business owner second. That you are not afraid to be seen leading a discussion about your vertical, not just participating in or commenting on one.</p>
<p>Consistently post your own useful content, and you won’t ever need to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">promote your services</a>; customers will ask you for them.</p>

<h3>4. Give your products and services away</h3>
</div>
<p>As we mentioned at the start of this post, Reddit is the internet’s collective subconscious. Its superego. And if there’s one thing the ego loves, it’s free stuff. The idea that you, the consumer, are worthy of receiving something of value in exchange for absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>If you’re going to promote your products and services in a subreddit, hosting a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/giveaway-ideas">giveaway</a>, sweepstakes, or contest is perhaps the most effective way to do so. This strategy allows marketers to deflect the ill will typically shown to users who self-promote while igniting a competitive interest among potential customers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-give-away-products.webp" alt="example of mod approved reddit giveaway" width="663" height="438" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83996" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-give-away-products.webp 663w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-give-away-products-480x317.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 663px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you’re a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/11/google-local-service-ads">service business</a>, this could mean giving away a free inspection or a discount on one of your services. If you’re an ice cream shop owner, it could mean going to your local subreddit and posting a two-for-one special. If you&#8217;re an ecommerce brand, it could mean driving traffic to an external <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">landing page</a>, where users can enter their names and email in exchange for entering to win a gift package from your brand.</p>
<p>However you choose to give your products and services away, you can rest assured that doing so will help you drive invaluable <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-competitors">traffic</a> and exposure for your business.</p>
<div id="cultivate-a-following">

<h3>5. Cultivate a following</h3>
</div>
<p>If you can find the right subreddit, you’ve already <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">found your audience</a>. But unless you’re <em>known</em> in the community, you haven’t yet captured your audience. And if you haven’t yet captured your audience, they’re not <em>your </em>audience.</p>
<p>If you want to cultivate a real following on Reddit, you need to be a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/09/21/thought-leadership-marketing">thought leader</a>. Thought leaders like Jason Calanicas and Elon Musk use Reddit to grow their brands by being thought leaders. They run companies and have business interests, but they use Reddit as a means of swiftly growing their engaged audience.</p>
<p>Pop over to Jason’s Reddit profile and you’ll see that he’s not just posting about his podcast. He’s actively engaging in a number of discussions on a variety of topics he is interested in.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-cultivate-following.webp" alt="example of Jason Calanicas reddit profile" width="665" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83997" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-cultivate-following.webp 665w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drive-traffic-from-reddit-cultivate-following-480x432.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 665px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Why would a guy worth $100 million spend his time perusing subreddits? One, because he enjoys being a part of the discourse, and he has a variety of interests.</p>
<p>But two, it’s because he understands the power that Reddit offers thought leaders when it comes to audience cultivation. The ability to pop into a thread at any time and offer a relevant fact, opinion, critique, or piece of advice, is what makes Reddit such a unique and useful platform for content creators and brands alike.</p>
<h2>Traffic on Reddit belongs to the most engaged and creative</h2>
<p>There you have it, in a nutshell. If you <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/limited-time-offers/">want to drive traffic</a> from Reddit, you need to be thoughtful, engaged, and creative.</p>
<p>Remember to post your own content, be useful above all, and give away your products and services. Follow these strategies to a tee, and you’ll see the rewards many times over.And if you&#8217;re interested in paid Reddit ads, check out this guide to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/generative-engine-optimization">see how much they&#8217;ll cost</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Your SEO headline, or meta title, can make or break the success of your page or blog post. Here's how to write one that works. </p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-headline">How to Write SEO Headlines That Rank &#038; Get Clicked</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The benefits of good SEO are numerous. “Free” visibility in Google’s search results. An expanded brand presence beyond traditional modes of advertising. A steady stream of qualified traffic via keywords for which your target customers are searching. And, as typically follows qualified traffic: higher conversion rates, and more revenue.</p>
<p>As for the method? The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/30/seo-basics">basics of SEO</a> haven’t changed all that much, even with the volatility of ever-evolving search algorithms.</p>
<p>One such factor that has remained pretty consistent is the SEO headline, otherwise known as the meta title. Representing half of your page’s ever-important <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/meta-tags">meta tags</a>, the SEO headline plays a critical role in your content’s ability to generate organic traffic. In this post, we’re going to dive into precisely what an SEO headline is, explain why it is so important, and walk through how to write SEO headlines that generate real value for your business.</p>

<h2>What is an SEO headline?</h2>
<p>Before we dive into how to write impactful SEO headlines, we need to understand what exactly we’re talking about. There are two components of any piece of content that you may be thinking of as an “SEO headline.”</p>
<p>The first is your page header, or H1. The page header, typically, appears physically at the top of your web page. In this post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/meta-description">on meta descriptions</a>, for instance, the H1 is “The importance of Meta Descriptions for SEO”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/example-of-on-page-h1.webp" alt="example of on page h1 from wordstream website" width="854" height="383" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83863" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/example-of-on-page-h1.webp 854w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/example-of-on-page-h1-480x215.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 854px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>H1 refers to the actual HTML that is marking up and can be seen on the page. Most of the time, when you create a page or blog post, your CMS (Content Management System) will, by default, set your meta title to be the same as your H1. This can be fine in some situations, but not all. To understand why, we need to understand the difference between an H1 and a meta title.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Looking for ways to drive people to your site?</strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website</a></p>
<div id="meta-title-vs-h1"></div>
<h2>What’s the difference between a meta title and an H1?</h2>
<p>While your H1 appears physically on the page, your <em>meta title </em>is the element that actually appears in the search results. Here’s how the meta title element looks in your HTML markup:</p>

<p>Here’s how it looks in the search results:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/example-meta-title-and-description.webp" alt="example of seo headline and meta description on serp" width="769" height="228" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83865" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/example-meta-title-and-description.webp 769w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/example-meta-title-and-description-480x142.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 769px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>And here’s how it looks in a typical CMS (Shopify, in this example).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/example-of-seo-headline-shopify-cms.webp" alt="example of seo headline in shopify cms" width="852" height="362" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83866" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/example-of-seo-headline-shopify-cms.webp 852w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/example-of-seo-headline-shopify-cms-480x204.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 852px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>At the top of the page, we entered our H1, which Shopify then duplicated by default to create the meta title. But as you can see, Shopify then gives the content creator the ability to edit the meta title to make it meaningfully distinct from the H1.</p>
<p>Both the H1 and meta title are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-ranking-factors-2025">ranking factors</a>, in that they allow Google to understand what your content is about, how relevant it is to a given search query, and where to rank it in the search results. However, given the distinct purpose each serves, there are some key differences you should keep in mind when writing each.</p>
<h3>Why your meta title and H1 might be different</h3>
<p>Here are some key differences to keep in mind when thinking about how your meta title might differ from your H1:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Length. </strong>As we’ll discuss below, Google truncates all meta titles in the search results after 60 characters. That means that your title has to be clear, concise, and not exceed that limit, or else you risk losing key aspects of it. Your H1, on the other hand, can be as long as you want, technically speaking. Once the reader is on your web page, a little added description in the headline can add important context that you may have had to leave out in your meta title.</li>
<li><strong>Tone. </strong>Your meta title often needs to stand out meaningfully from the other listings in the search results in order to generate a click from the user. That means that it might contain tone–thing like urgency, positive or negative sentiment, and even alarmism–that aren’t quite as necessary once someone hits the page.</li>
<li><strong>Structure. </strong>It may be necessary to remove or reorder certain words and phrases that are relevant to your content, but don’t do a ton of work in the search results.</li>
</ol>
<div id="importance-of-meta-title-or-seo-headline"></div>
<h2>The importance of your meta title or SEO headline</h2>
<p>Now that we understand the key differences between a page header and a meta title, and before we walk through seven strategies to writing effective meta title, we need to hammer home the importance of your meta title, or SEO headline.</p>
<p>Your meta title acts as the gateway to your content. It is the first and most prominent thing a reader sees when deciding whether or not to navigate to your site. As such, each word has to be selected very carefully, and with the user in mind.</p>
<p>We’ve mentioned the fact that truly compelling and relevant headlines can increase your rankings. That’s not just anecdotal–it’s data-backed. According to one <a href="https://backlinko.com/google-ctr-stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Backlinko study</a>, the top-ranking result on a Google SERP has an average click-through rate (CTR) of about 27.6%. The link in position two has a CTR of 15.8%.</p>
<p>That means that one slightly more relevant or catchy title can gain you another 10-12 sessions per 100 users that see your listing. If 4% of your organic sessions convert to sales, well–you can do the math, and you can start to see how important that lift in the search results is.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seo-headline-examples-on-google.webp" alt="seo headline examples of google" width="891" height="564" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83867" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seo-headline-examples-on-google.webp 891w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seo-headline-examples-on-google-480x304.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 891px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Consider the above search result, for the keyword “how to write a great headline.” All three of these headlines are powerful, and for different reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>The first is the most relevant to the query.</li>
<li>The second contains the highest number (73), indicating that it contains the most information.</li>
<li>And the third contains a brand name that signifies prestige and credibility.</li>
</ol>
<p>This ends up having a flywheel effect. These listings get higher click-through rates than their competitors because they rank higher. But they also rank higher because their high-click through rate, by virtue of their appealing titles, signal to Google that their listings provide the most helpful content for the user.</p>

<h2>7 keys to writing SEO headlines that rank and drive traffic</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve discussed the importance of writing effective SEO headlines, and the benefits you can enjoy by doing so, let’s walk through 7 keys to doing exactly that.</p>
<h3>1. Target a keyword</h3>
<p>Your meta title and H1 both <em>need</em> to target a keyword. That keyword should be <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords">informed by keyword research</a>, highly relevant to the search query, and, if possible, have strong search volume and low competition.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wordstream-free-keyword-tool-homepage.webp" alt="wordstream free keyword tool" width="854" height="424" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83868" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wordstream-free-keyword-tool-homepage.webp 854w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wordstream-free-keyword-tool-homepage-480x238.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 854px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You can use a tool like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">WordStream’s Free Keyword Tool</a> to find relevant keywords.</em></p>
<p>This is where character count and structure come in. If your target keyword comes <em>after </em>the first 60 characters in your H1, you can and should move it to the beginning of your meta title. Generally speaking, your target keyword should always appear at or near the beginning of your meta title.</p>
<p>Because you only have 60 characters to work with, you want to make sure that keyword doesn’t get omitted. If it does, both your user and the search engine will struggle to understand what your content is about.</p>
<h3>2. Stick to character count best practices</h3>
<p>We’ve mentioned ideal character count a couple times, and we need to hammer it home here. If you want to double check whether your title is at risk of truncation in the search results, <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/title-tag">Moz has a great preview tool</a> that you can use to see how it’s going to look to the casual searcher.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seo-headline-use-character-count.webp" alt="seo headline best practices - use character count preview" width="836" height="359" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83869" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seo-headline-use-character-count.webp 836w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seo-headline-use-character-count-480x206.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 836px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is of course important in ensuring your target keyword doesn’t get removed, but doubly so if you’re including secondary keywords, calls-to-action, your brand name, or a vital piece of contextual information that your readers should know. You never want to exceed that 60 character limit.</p>
<h3>3. Have a call-to-action</h3>
<p>Whether you’re promoting a product page, your homepage, or a blog, a call-to-action is a great way to encourage clicks-through from the search results.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">Calls-to-action</a> are more typically seen at the end of meta descriptions, but you can double their effectiveness by including them in your headline. Titles like “Check Out These X” or “Find Out Why Y” can be incredibly seductive for users, especially when the majority of listings aren’t going to contain calls-to-action in their titles.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4da.png" alt="📚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide download</strong> &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download">The 36 Best Call to Action Phrases Ever (&amp; Why They Work)</a></p>
<h3>4. Leverage your brand whenever possible</h3>
<p>Whether your domain has been around for 10 years or 1 year, your brand has authority. Your homepage, product pages, and core page (i.e. your “core pages”) should all contain your brand name <em>after </em>the relevant keyword and a dash.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seo-headline-brand-in-meta-example.webp" alt="example of using brand in seo headline" width="853" height="385" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83870" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seo-headline-brand-in-meta-example.webp 853w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seo-headline-brand-in-meta-example-480x217.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 853px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This signals to users familiar with your brand not only that you stand by your content, but that this is a page or a piece of content produced by a brand they can trust.</p>
<p>When writing a meta title for a blog post, case study, or other piece of long-form content, you may not have enough space to include your brand name. But you will find instances in which your SEO headline contains, say, only 45 characters. When this happens, don’t be afraid to add your brand name for that extra piece of credibility.</p>
<h3>5. Be bold and stick out from the pack</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, your user may browse up to 20-30 organic listings before they click on the one they want. It certainly helps if you’re ranked at the top of the pack. But even if you’re at the bottom of page one or the top of page two, a <strong>bold </strong>headline can go a long way in increasing your click-through rate.</p>
<p>Using powerful descriptors like “absolute” (i.e. the absolute best), “essential,” and “crush” (i.e. crush the competition) show users that your listing contains powerful content that will in turn empower them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seo-headline-tip-bold-language-example.webp" alt="example of seo headline with bold language" width="855" height="416" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83871" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seo-headline-tip-bold-language-example.webp 855w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seo-headline-tip-bold-language-example-480x234.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 855px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you’re writing a blog post, try being incendiary with a title like “Here’s Why Everything You Know About X Is Wrong,” or conveying extreme urgency with a title like “Y Statistics You Need to Know Right Now” in order to stick out in a bland search results page.</p>
<h3>6. Use numbers and lists to convey clarity of purpose</h3>
<p>Numbers and lists tell users exactly what they’ll be getting if they click on your listing. If you’re outlining the top 5 coffee makers in the market, make sure your title contains “top 5 coffee makers.” If the bottom of your blog post contains 3 free templates, make sure your title contains the number 3 explicitly.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seo-headline-example-with-numbers.webp" alt="example of seo headline with number" width="841" height="379" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83872" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seo-headline-example-with-numbers.webp 841w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seo-headline-example-with-numbers-480x216.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 841px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If possible, use higher numbers. Readers love having a lot of options to choose from, even if the amount of content within each option needs to be somewhat limited due to length constraints.</p>
<h3>7. Test frequently!</h3>
<p>Testing is always a must when it comes to copywriting, and it’s no different for SEO headlines. There’s nothing quite as satisfying as adding in some powerful descriptors, a particularly positive or negative sentiment, or a higher number to your meta title, then logging into Search Console a week later to see that your click-through rate has increased by 20%, or your ranking has increased by 3 spots.</p>
<p>This also signals to Google that you’re keeping your content fresh. As such, you should <em>always </em>be tinkering with your headlines to see what works and what doesn’t.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Staying one step ahead of the competition is critical. It’s no longer enough to focus on one’s own business, product offerings, customer service, operations, and the like. Business owners need to be actively engaged in collecting insights and data points about the state of their competition. Heck, how are you supposed to know how to win if you don’t know who is running the race and how they’re running it?</p>
<p>In fact, the discipline of collecting competitive insights isn’t simply about gauging the business landscape in your particular vertical. It’s about actively improving your business. Why? Because whether you like it or not, your competitors are, in all likelihood, succeeding in some way that you’re not. They’re failing in some way you’re not. And when you truly start to analyze these successes and failures, you’re in for a veritable goldmine of ideas about how to improve your own operations.</p>
<p>In this post, we’re going to run through seven of the most actionable insights you can collect on your competitors. We’ll show you where to find them, and what they mean. And most importantly, we’ll show you what to <em>do </em>with this data to make <em>more</em> revenue in the form of <em>greater</em> market share this year.</p>
<h2>Top competitive insights to collect</h2>
<p>There are a ton of ways to go about collecting (and analyzing) <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/competitive-positioning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">competitive</a> insights, and that’s exactly what we’re here to talk about today. Here are the top competitive insights we’re going to cover:</p>

</ol>
<p>Let’s dive in.</p>
<div id="products-features-positioning-pricing-analysis"></div>
<h3>1. Product suite, features, positioning, and pricing</h3>
<p>Products, features, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/20/product-positioning">positioning</a>, and pricing are probably the most important competitive insights you can collect. Why? Because if your products and services aren’t positioned or priced correctly, no amount of marketing or competitive research is going to allow you to beat your competitors.</p>
<p>For pricing, try using a competitive pricing tool like <a href="https://hello.pricelabs.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PriceLabs</a> or <a href="https://www.repricer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Repricer</a>. Or try pricing your products or services how they are actually valued. Look at your competitors’ websites. How are they packaging their offerings? What prices are they using? How is your product meaningfully better than theirs? How is it worse? Do you use better materials? Do you have better customer service? How are they positioning their offering as better or different than the other offerings on the market?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-pricing.webp" alt="example of pricing options from competitor for competitive insights" width="884" height="511" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83700" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-pricing.webp 884w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-pricing-480x277.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 884px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>With regard to price, you may be tempted to undercut your competitors to win more business. But consider what having a lower price says about your product. In fact, consumers will often choose the higher price because they believe a higher price equates to a higher value. And for consumers looking for a lower price, an honest conversation with your sales team about <em>why </em>you are priced higher than your competitors (because your product is better!) is often enough to win the sale.</p>
<p>A good ole’ <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/12/20/swot-analysis">SWOT analysis</a> can help you keep track of these competitive insights.

<div id="review-credibility-analysis"></div>
<h3>2. Review and credibility analysis</h3>
<p>You can use a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/competitive-analysis">competitive analysis</a> tool to analyze reviews en masse, but if you’re cash-strapped, you’ll be happy to hear that this step is completely free. Just head to your competitors&#8217; pages on Yelp, Google Business, Amazon, Trustpilot, and the like. Anywhere your competitors’ customers have gone to tell the world exactly how they feel about them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-review-example.webp" alt="example of review from competitor" width="878" height="497" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83701" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-review-example.webp 878w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-review-example-480x272.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 878px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>We used a restaurant example here, but whether you’re a software company, a roofing company, or an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/04/ecommerce-statistics">ecommerce</a> brand, reviews are where you go to understand where your competitors are falling short of their customers&#8217; expectations, where they are meeting them, and where they are exceeding them.</p>
<p>Do they take too long to respond to a support chat? That’s an area where you can beat them. Is there a particular feature one customer wishes they had? That’s an area where you can beat them. Are customers responding positively to your competitors’ pricing? Well, you may want to consider lowering your prices a touch to compete for that business.</p>

<h3>3. Authority and top-level SEO analysis</h3>
<p>Page and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/12/domain-authority">domain authority</a> are a huge factor in your competitor’s ability to outrank you in the search results. Authority is measured on a scale of 0-100, and is essentially the fruit of your greatest ally in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/13/off-page-seo">off-page SEO</a> (Search Engine Optimization): backlinking.</p>
<p>Does your competitor have a lot of links from other websites? Are they quality links from reputable sites with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/13/content-creation">strong content</a>? These are the questions you need to ask yourself, and you’ll find the answers in tools like Semrush, Ahrefs, and Moz: any tool that measures authority and can show you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/27/backlink-audit">your competitors&#8217; backlink profiles</a>.</p>
<p>To find this competitive insight, try typing the name of your domain into Ahrefs, and click on the “Organic Competitors” tab. Note: you will need a paid version of this tool or a free trial to see this competitive insight.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-organic-traffic.webp" alt="example of competing domains organic traffic" width="884" height="527" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83703" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-organic-traffic.webp 884w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-organic-traffic-480x286.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 884px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As you can see, Ahrefs gives us a nice scatter plot of how we compare to our competitors in terms of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/03/organic-traffic">organic traffic</a>, number of pages in the search results, domain rating (or authority), number of organic keywords, and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-competing-domains.webp" alt="example of competing domains in ahrefs" width="857" height="396" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83702" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-competing-domains.webp 857w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-competing-domains-480x222.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 857px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>4. Content gap, top keywords, and top pages</h3>
<p>Since we’re talking about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO</a>, we might as well follow this thread to our content gap analysis. This competitive insight shows you which pages or keywords are generating the most organic traffic for your competitors <em>that you do not rank for</em>. This is yet another tab within tools like Ahrefs, Semrush, and Moz, and it looks like this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-keyword-gap.webp" alt="example of keyword gap tool" width="840" height="348" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83704" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-keyword-gap.webp 840w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-keyword-gap-480x199.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 840px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There are a number of ways to slice and dice this report. You can see which keywords your competitors rank for on page one that you rank for on page two. You can see which keywords you don’t rank for at all that you <strong>should</strong> rank for. You can sort by traffic. You can also simply pull a list of your competitors&#8217; top organic keywords by traffic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-keyword-rankings.webp" alt="example of keyword rankings report" width="883" height="535" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83705" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-keyword-rankings.webp 883w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-keyword-rankings-480x291.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 883px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Creating a content plan and not sure where to start? Head to the “Top Pages” tab, search for “blog” in the URL, and see where the lion’s share of your competitors’ organic blog traffic is coming from.</p>
<p>However you choose to do it, these reports will start to give you a great idea of what type of content you need to create, and what <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/organic-keyword">types of keywords</a> you need to target, in order to enjoy the same organic success as your competitors.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f50e.png" alt="🔎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Need help finding the right keywords?</strong> Try our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">Free Keyword Tool</a>!</p>
<div id="backlink-analysis"></div>
<h3>5. Backlink analysis</h3>
<p>Once we have a high-level hold on how we compare to our competitors organically, we can start digging a bit deeper. It looks like the competitor at the top of the list, the one with whom we share the most common keywords, is crushing us in organic traffic. How have they accrued the domain authority to outrank us on so many critical keywords?</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at their backlinks. We can do this by clicking on the “Backlinks” tab after searching their domain.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-backlinks.webp" alt="example of backlink analysis for competitive insights" width="727" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83706" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-backlinks.webp 727w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-backlinks-480x396.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 727px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>We can see here that the first two websites linking to our competitor have really strong authority (92). If we scroll down the list, not only do we start getting a sense of what kind of links we need to accrue in order to compete, but we can start to mark down some great targets for link outreach.</p>
<div id="paid-keyword-strategy-analysis"></div>
<h3>6. Paid keyword strategy</h3>
<p>We’ve discussed how to use your competitors’ <strong>organic</strong> keywords to buoy your business; now, let’s look at a paid keyword report. Once again, you can find this report in a tool like Semrush.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-paid-keywords.webp" alt="example of paid keyword report" width="814" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83707" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-paid-keywords.webp 814w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-paid-keywords-480x353.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 814px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You can see that once we enter a competitor’s domain, we can see who they are competing with, how much paid search traffic they are getting, where their ads are positioned, and most importantly, their top paid keywords. Hop over into the Ad Copies tab, and you can see what messaging they’re using for each of these top keywords:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-advertising-research.webp" alt="report that shows where keywords are being used" width="804" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83708" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-advertising-research.webp 804w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-advertising-research-480x358.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 804px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you’re running Google Ads on the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/05/20/google-adwords-search-versus-display">search network</a>, this is invaluable insight. Understanding where your competitors are getting business from on the search network, and how they’re doing so, can tip you off on what types of keywords you should be bidding on, what your ad copy might look like, and how many clicks and leads you can expect to get from those ads.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Worried you&#8217;re falling behind your competitors in Google Ads?

<h3>7. Paid social creative strategy</h3>
<p>If you’re running any kind of visual advertising–be it Facebook, Instagram, Display, or Out-of-Home–you’re going to want to get familiar with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Ads Library</a>.</p>
<p>With this library, you can search for any of your competitors’ brands and see exactly what kind of creative they are running:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-meta-ads-library.webp" alt="meta ads library to collect competitive insights" width="886" height="513" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83709" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-meta-ads-library.webp 886w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-meta-ads-library-480x278.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 886px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This an awesome sneak peek into your competitor&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/18/social-media-advertising">paid social strategy</a>. Here you’ll find what types of messaging your competitors use to promote their products, what call-to-actions they use, promotions, ad types, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/08/landing-page-examples">landing pages</a>, and more. You can use this information to do any number of things: inspire your own campaigns, go after a different segment of the market, innovate your products, develop new creative strategies, and more.</p>
<h2>Get better competitive insights, build a bigger business</h2>
<p>When it comes to competitive insights, the point of diminishing returns comes when you’re focusing <strong>more on your competitors than on yourself</strong>. But so few business owners are able to think beyond the scope of their own day-to-day operations. The truth is, <strong>even small investments in competitive research</strong> and analysis can go a long way.</p>
<p>Focus on these seven competitive insights, and you’ll be well on your way to winning business over your competitors.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re in the mindset of analyzing where your business fits into your competitive landscape, you’ve probably heard of a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/12/20/swot-analysis">SWOT analysis</a>. Running a SWOT analysis allows business owners and leaders to take a frank look at their operations and determine the <strong>strengths, weakness, opportunities, and threats</strong> that they face in their niche.</p>
<p>Because if you don’t know what you do well, and what you don’t, how is it possible to grow and get better? It’s this question that a SWOT analysis seeks to answer, and it does so by providing a simple framework by which business owners can assess and optimize.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through a quick primer on what exactly a SWOT analysis is, and how to complete one effectively. Then, we’ll give a rundown of three SWOT analysis examples that you can use to see this powerful framework in action.</p>

<h2>What is a SWOT analysis?</h2>
<p>As mentioned, a SWOT analysis is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the <strong>strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats</strong> facing a business. SWOT analyses can also be undertaken for individual projects and decision-making processes, but for the sake of this post, we’ll stick with the broader, more popular definition.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/swot-analysis-chart.webp" alt="swot analysis chart" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76075" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/swot-analysis-chart.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/swot-analysis-chart-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>To put it succinctly, a SWOT analysis provides a structured framework for understanding both <strong>internal and external factors</strong> that can impact the success or failure of your business. Strengths and weaknesses are internal. Opportunities and threats? These are external. Here’s how each of these components are typically defined:</p>
<p><strong>Strengths</strong>: Internal attributes and resources that give an organization an <em>advantage</em> over others in achieving its objectives. These include things like skilled personnel, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/06/online-reputation-management">strong brand reputation</a>, powerful technology, and efficient processes.</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: Internal factors that <em>hinder</em> an organization&#8217;s performance or competitiveness. These could include lack of resources, outdated technology, poor management practices, or inefficient processes.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunities</strong>: External factors or situations that an organization can <em>exploit</em> to its advantage. These include things like emerging markets, product innovation, changes in consumer preferences, or favorable regulatory changes.</p>
<p><strong>Threats</strong>: External factors that could potentially cause trouble for the organization. These include things like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/21/competitive-analysis-templates">increased competition</a>, economic downturns, changing market trends, or regulatory challenges.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the goal of the SWOT analysis is to make it easier for business owners and stakeholders to <strong>make informed decisions</strong> and <strong>create effective strategies</strong> to achieve their goals and win more business.</p>

<h2>SWOT analysis examples</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve established a working definition of SWOT analysis, let’s dive into some examples. As we’re walking through each example, think about how you can use the information in the example to inform your own self-analysis.</p>
<div id="disney-swot-analysis-example"></div>
<h3>SWOT analysis example #1: Disney</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/disney-swot-analysis-example.webp" alt="disney swot analysis example chart" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83672" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/disney-swot-analysis-example.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/disney-swot-analysis-example-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Strengths</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Robust cash flow</strong>. Disney has always boasted formidable cash flows, enabling the company to diversify investments across various sectors. With a consistent flow of $5 billion plus, this financial stability relieves pressures on business operators and stakeholders.</li>
<li><strong>Expansive suite of networks</strong>. Disney&#8217;s suite of networks is nothing short of impressive, encompassing a wide array of renowned brands. From Miramax and ABC to ESPN, Starwave, Pixar, Marvel, and beyond, this portfolio amplifies revenue streams and fortifies their market presence.</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/disney-network-matrix.webp" alt="chart of disney's networks for swot analysis" width="875" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83654" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/disney-network-matrix.webp 875w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/disney-network-matrix-480x329.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 875px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Disney’s impressive suite of networks.</em></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Prestigious brand value.</strong> Disney&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/23/how-brand-your-business">brand</a> is iconic and instantly recognizable. Whether it&#8217;s a movie or merchandise, the presence of Walt Disney Studios or Company symbolizes trust, recognition, and creativity.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Weaknesses</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reputational challenges.</strong> Disney has grappled with allegations of racism and workplace safety issues in recent years, tarnishing its once-spotless reputation. Over 700 Walt Disney World performers lodged complaints about unsafe working conditions, prompting backlash when Disney retaliated against their demands for testing and safety protocols.</li>
<li><strong>Untimely product innovation.</strong> Disney&#8217;s product development team has struggled to anticipate and capitalize on emerging trends, resulting in missed opportunities compared to competitors. While other companies swiftly respond to consumer demand with targeted <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/ad-campaigns">campaigns</a>, Disney has faltered in seizing such opportunities, hampering its ability to stay ahead in the market.</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/disney-streaming-chart.webp" alt="disney streaming share chart as part of swot analysis" width="605" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83656" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/disney-streaming-chart.webp 605w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/disney-streaming-chart-480x476.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 605px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Disney+ has made strides, but still lags behind Netflix because Disney was late to the streaming game.</em></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Challenging acquisitions.</strong> While acquisitions often spur growth, some can burden a company with long-term financial challenges. Disney&#8217;s acquisition of 21st Century Fox, though initially promising, has weighed heavily on its profitability.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Opportunities</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Global expansion. </strong>With its unparalleled <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">brand recognition</a>, Disney holds a special place in the hearts of many, making it a prime choice for businesses seeking effective branding strategies. Teaming up with Disney can offer significant advantages and opportunities for marketing and promotion.</li>
<li><strong>New theme parks worldwide.</strong> Beyond its presence in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Paris, and Shanghai, Disney has the potential to capitalize on emerging markets by establishing new theme parks. Expanding into economies with a burgeoning middle class and improving economic conditions presents a ripe opportunity for further growth and revenue generation.</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/walt-disney-locations.webp" alt="walt disney world and land locations across the world" width="894" height="380" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83657" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/walt-disney-locations.webp 894w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/walt-disney-locations-480x204.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 894px, 100vw" /></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Expanding Disney+.</strong> Disney+ has rapidly gained traction, generating substantial revenue. By strategically expanding Disney+ into both developed and emerging markets, Disney could transform the streaming service into a multi-billion-dollar powerhouse.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4da.png" alt="📚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free guide download</strong> &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download">The 36 Best Call to Action Phrases Ever (&amp; Why They Work)</a></p>
<h4>Threats</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Increase in piracy.</strong> The surge in piracy, fueled by customers&#8217; desire for specific content rather than bundled offerings, poses a significant threat to Disney&#8217;s revenue and profitability. The widespread adoption of streaming services like Disney+ has intensified this issue, with peer-to-peer sharing making it easier for pirates to take advantage.</li>
<li><strong>Tighter regulations.</strong> The US Justice Department&#8217;s proposed revisions to regulations, such as the Consent Decree, could reshape the landscape between Hollywood studios and movie theaters. This shift has the potential to dismantle the advantage enjoyed by major production houses like Disney.</li>
<li><strong>High expense toll.</strong> Disney&#8217;s longstanding commitment to investing heavily in its workforce, employee development, and training has been a hallmark of its operations. However, with salary wages on a constant upward trajectory, Disney’s profits stand to take a serious hit.</li>
</ol>
<h4>3 takeaways from Disney’s SWOT analysis</h4>
<p>Here are our top three takeaways from Disney’s swot analysis.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Maximize financial stability</strong>: Take a cue from Disney&#8217;s robust cash flow and prioritize financial stability. Ensure consistent cash flow to diversify investments and weather uncertain economies.</li>
<li><strong>Cultivate brand value</strong>: Learn from Disney&#8217;s iconic brand value and invest in brand-building efforts. Foster trust and recognition among your customers through consistent <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/08/brand-story">branding and storytelling</a> that resonates with your audience.</li>
<li><strong>Embrace innovation</strong>: Disney&#8217;s challenges with product innovation underscore the importance of staying agile and responsive to market trends. Foster a culture of innovation within your organization and prioritize continuous improvement to meet the needs of your customers.</li>
</ol>
<p>By leveraging these lessons, you can enhance your business ops, capitalize on opportunities, and drive sustainable growth.</p>

<h4>Strengths</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Brand equity.</strong> McDonald’s is a <em>dominant</em> brand, and its golden arches are iconic.

<li><strong>Technological prowess.</strong> McDonald’s remains at the forefront of technological innovation. From self-service kiosks that streamline ordering and payment processes, to impressive drive-through efficiency, McDonald’s consistently offers innovative solutions to its customers.</li>

<h4>Weaknesses</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Employee satisfaction.</strong> Dissatisfaction among McDonald’s franchise employees regarding wages has been a persistent issue. Many feel that their hours of hard work are not adequately compensated. Moreover, since franchisees operate independently, wage disparities exist across locations. In response to this criticism, McDonald’s has pledged to address the wage disparity issue across all its restaurants by 2024.</li>
<li><strong>The food concern.</strong> While McDonald’s enjoys widespread popularity due to its taste and convenience, it&#8217;s undeniable that fast food poses health risks. Its food is laden with excess calories and lacks essential nutritional value, contributing to obesity, particularly among children and teenagers. Given McDonald’s significant market share, it becomes a major contributor to the obesity epidemic.</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Documentaries like Super Size Me brought to light McDonald’s contribution to obesity in America.</em></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Business model.</strong> McDonald’s franchising strategy, while instrumental in global expansion, presents inherent challenges. Franchise ownership makes it challenging to maintain consistent operational standards across locations, leading to variations in quality and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/04/customer-experience-strategy">customer experience</a>. Consequently, the brand&#8217;s performance may fluctuate between regions and even within the same country.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Opportunities</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Business expansion. </strong>McDonald’s, currently spanning more than 120 countries, aims to achieve a global presence, and has the blueprint to reach every corner of the globe.</li>
<li><strong>Menu evolution.</strong> McDonald’s has the opportunity to overcome a key weakness by expanding its menu offerings. Embracing the trend towards healthy alternatives, like organic and fresh menu items, would cater to health-conscious consumers seeking better lifestyle choices.</li>
<li><strong>Sports sponsorship.</strong> McDonald’s consistently and strategically aligns with the excitement and passion of sports fans. McDonald’s recent move to become the new title sponsor for the French Ligue 1, for instance, shows its commitment to engaging sports enthusiasts and expanding brand visibility on a global scale.</li>

<h4>Threats</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Emerging consumer preferences.</strong> In the dynamic landscape of consumer trends, adaptability is paramount for business survival. With a growing inclination towards clean and healthy eating habits, fast-food giants like McDonald’s face the challenge of staying relevant amidst shifting preferences. As more individuals opt for cleaner alternatives over traditional junk food, the fast-food industry could undergo significant transformation in the coming years.</li>
<li><strong>Competition dynamics.</strong> While McDonald’s currently reigns supreme in the fast-food industry, the landscape is far from devoid of formidable <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/articles/ultimate-guide-to-keyword-competition">competition</a>. Direct rivals like Burger King and Wendy’s engage in relentless marketing battles, offering similar fare of fries and burgers to entice customers. Moreover, indirect competitors such as KFC and Chipotle pose additional challenges, catering to varied tastes within the fast-food realm.</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>While McDonald’s still enjoys huge market share, competition is ever-lurking. </em></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Economic uncertainty.</strong> The broader economic climate plays a significant role in shaping consumer behavior, particularly in discretionary spending. Economic downturns pose a tangible threat to fast-food sales volumes, as consumers tighten their belts and reduce dining out expenditures.</li>

<h3>SWOT analysis #3: Google</h3>
<h4><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-swot-analysis-example.webp" alt="google swot analysis example chart" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83674" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-swot-analysis-example.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-swot-analysis-example-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></h4>
<h4>Strengths</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Position as search engine market leader.</strong> Google&#8217;s dominance in the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/serp">search engine realm</a> is unparalleled, commanding an estimated <strong>91% market share globally</strong>, with even higher figures in certain regions like Europe. This commanding position not only attracts a vast array of advertisers and partners but also grants Google access to invaluable user data, fueling continuous improvement in search algorithms and user experience.</li>
<li><strong>Huge user base.</strong> Google&#8217;s strength lies in its extensive user base, providing a wealth of data for insights into user behavior and emerging trends. This robust market position enables Google to deliver highly relevant search results, enhancing the overall user experience.</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-market-share-chart.webp" alt="google market share chart" width="599" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83662" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-market-share-chart.webp 599w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-market-share-chart-480x480.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 599px, 100vw" /></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Culture of product development.</strong> Renowned for its innovative culture, Google fosters an environment that encourages experimentation and the pursuit of new ideas. This commitment to innovation distinguishes Google from its competitors and drives its ongoing success.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Weaknesses</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Revenue vulnerability.</strong> Google&#8217;s disproportionate reliance on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/24/digital-advertising">advertising</a> revenue, constituting over 80% of its total income, has fueled immense financial success. However, this heavy dependence also exposes the company to significant vulnerabilities. Heightened competition for ad revenue, compounded by the entry of new market players, threatens Google&#8217;s future financial stability.</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-revenue-streams.webp" alt="chart of google revenue streams" width="628" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83663" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-revenue-streams.webp 628w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-revenue-streams-480x457.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 628px, 100vw" /></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Privacy policy backlash</strong>. Despite offering a diverse array of services reliant on consumer data, Google has encountered substantial backlash over its privacy policies. Particularly concerning internet search practices, consumer concerns about data collection and transparency have eroded trust and prompted a shift towards platforms with more robust privacy policies. Despite Google&#8217;s efforts to address these concerns through new privacy features, lingering skepticism poses a significant threat to its ability to retain and attract users.</li>
<li><strong>Android ecosystem limitations.</strong> Despite commanding a significant market share with its Android operating system, Google faces constraints in controlling the devices utilizing this platform. These limitations, including restricted access to hardware features and challenges in uninstalling pre-installed applications, hinder Google&#8217;s ability to optimize user experience and innovation within the Android ecosystem.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Opportunities</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cloud computing.</strong> Despite Google&#8217;s trailing position behind industry giants like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, cloud computing presents a significant growth opportunity. Businesses increasingly shift their IT infrastructure to cloud platforms, with spending reaching closing in on $100 billion. Google stands poised to capitalize on this expanding market, leveraging its resources to bolster its market share and compete more effectively.</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-cloud-computing.webp" alt="google cloud computing capabilities" width="875" height="467" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83665" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-cloud-computing.webp 875w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-cloud-computing-480x256.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 875px, 100vw" /></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Virtual reality ventures.</strong> The artificial reality and virtual reality (AR and VR) market offer immense potential for Google&#8217;s investment. With user numbers expected to soar to 2.5 billion by 2027, Google remains well-positioned to enhance its VR offerings and establish a stronger presence in this evolving sector.</li>
<li><strong>Revolution in AI.</strong> The emergence of AI-driven chat responses like ChatGPT has captivated global attention since late 2022, reshaping online interactions and posing a challenge to established players like Google. Competitors like Microsoft have swiftly entered the arena and established dominance. These developments underscore the vast potential in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/15/ai-marketing">AI and machine learning</a>, offering Google numerous opportunities for success.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Threats</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Market disruption by emerging competitors.</strong> The ascent of emerging technologies challenges Google&#8217;s market dominance, making strategic responses crucial. For instance, Google&#8217;s market response to ChatGPT&#8217;s emergence led to significant market value losses. Furthermore, in online advertising, platforms like Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and Amazon offer targeted use cases for advertisers, intensifying competition.</li>
<li><strong>Persistent legal battles and privacy concerns.</strong> Despite its stature, Google faces a barrage of lawsuits, exposing it to financial and reputational risks. While some lawsuits may lack merit, others, particularly intellectual property claims, can result in significant damages. Google&#8217;s<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/22/customer-data-privacy"> privacy policies</a>, including data collection and usage practices, have drawn criticism, undermining user trust and brand reputation.</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-privacy-controls.webp" alt="google privacy controls" width="871" height="445" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83666" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-privacy-controls.webp 871w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/google-privacy-controls-480x245.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 871px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Google has had to double-down on Privacy to help assuage consumer concerns.</em></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Competitive dynamics within Alphabet Inc.</strong> As one of the world&#8217;s largest conglomerates, Alphabet Inc faces intense competition across diverse sectors, including search, entertainment, autonomous vehicles, and cloud computing. Competitors like Bing and DuckDuckGo challenge Google in search, while platforms like Netflix, Hulu, and Vimeo compete in the entertainment space. This intense competition places pressure on Google to continually innovate, and diminishes its bargaining power in negotiations with partners and stakeholders.</li>
</ol>
<h4>3 key takeaways from Google’s SWOT analysis</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Leverage market leadership. </strong>As a business owner, you can emulate Google&#8217;s success by focusing on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/09/21/thought-leadership-marketing">thought and product leadership</a> in your industry.</li>
<li><strong>Diversify revenue streams</strong>: Over-reliance on one source of revenue can really leave you open and vulnerable. Make sure you diversify revenue streams to mitigate risk.</li>
<li><strong>Embrace emerging technologies</strong>. Always stay abreast of technological trends in your industry, and invest in emerging technologies when necessary.</li>
</ol>
