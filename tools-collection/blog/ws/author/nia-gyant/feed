										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Time-consuming. That’s one way to describe posting to social media, reviewing analytics for each platform, and handling other aspects of social media marketing manually. No wonder social media management tools are in such high demand.</p>
<p>But with so many to choose from—and some with hefty price tags—you may struggle to figure out which tools are both good and affordable. This list will end that struggle, breaking down both the zero-cost features of the best free social media management tools and their paid options.</p>

</ul>
<p>While the free version is fairly standard, Buffer is a great tool to start out with if you plan to scale your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business">social media marketing efforts</a> up. Take a look at some of the perks of its paid options.</p>

<p><a id="friends"></a></p>
<h2>Friends+Me: Best for beginners</h2>
<p><a href="https://friendsplus.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Friends+Me</a> is a lesser-known social media tool but a good one if you’re looking for a simple tool to get you started.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Number of users:</strong> 2</li>
<li><strong>Number of profiles:</strong> 2</li>
<li><strong>Platforms supported:</strong> Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest</li>
<li><strong>Scheduling:</strong> Available for 5 posts per queue (2 queues included on the free plan)</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FriendsMe.png" alt="best social media management tools - friends and me" width="720" height="655" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61064" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FriendsMe.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FriendsMe-480x437.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>

On the bright side, even the free plan allows for team collaboration with up to one member, which is uncommon among free <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/07/25/social-media-management-tips">social media management</a> tools.</p>

The simplest way to systemize this? Use an online survey tool. Many such tools:</p>

<li>Make it possible to reach out to and start collecting data and feedback from large groups of people <em>today</em></li>
<li>Offer data analysis features to help you make sense of (and act on) the feedback you receive.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The 8 best free online survey tools</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s never been easier to get the raw insights you need to improve your business. Here are the eight best survey tools to help you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Google Forms</li>
<li>SurveyMonkey</li>
<li>Typeform</li>
<li>Jotform</li>
<li>SoGoLytics</li>
<li>SurveyPlanet</li>
<li>Zoho Survey</li>
<li>Crowdsignal</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Google Forms: Best 100% free tool</h3>
<p>Google is known for offering some of the best and most widely-used free business tools. <a href="http://forms.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Forms</a> is one of them.</p>
<ul></ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/best-free-online-survey-tools-google-forms-example.png" alt="best free online survey tools - google forms" width="720" height="696" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60704" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/best-free-online-survey-tools-google-forms-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/best-free-online-survey-tools-google-forms-example-480x464.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Noteworthy free features</h4>
<p>Some of Google Forms&#8217; best features are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Responses to spreadsheets.</strong> Have responses sent to Google Sheets automatically to view, filter, and sort your data any way you want.</li>
<li><strong></strong> Use your logo, branded banners, and brand colors to keep your brand experience consistent.</li>
<li><strong>Skip logic and page branching.</strong> Create customized, frictionless experiences for survey participants by guiding them through your survey in a structured manner (and with thoughtful questions that yield without forcing them to answer irrelevant questions).</li>
<li><strong>Media options.</strong> Add images or videos to give survey takers context or instructions.</li>
<li><strong>Data analysis features. </strong>See the percentage of participants that selected a certain answer to spot patterns at a glance and, as a result, make more informed decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you&#8217;ll see, most free online survey tools are actually free<em>mium</em> tools. Or, if not, they have limited functionality. Google Forms is not only a 100% free tool but Google also has been generous as far as features are concerned.</p>
<h3>2. SurveyMonkey: Best for short surveys</h3>
<p>With &#8220;20 million questions answered daily,&#8221; <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SurveyMonkey</a> is one of the leading online survey tools.</p>

<h4>Noteworthy free features</h4>
<p>SurveyMonkey&#8217;s free plan offers access to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Three collectors.</strong> Send your surveys to participants via up to three modes including links, website embeds, and email.</li>
<li><strong>40 short survey templates.</strong> Spend less time creating surveys by modifying existing ones.</li>
<li><strong>A filter.</strong> Compare how different groups of participants responded to your survey questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The free version of this survey tool will work if you create short, straightforward surveys and don&#8217;t need bells and whistles.</p>
<h4>Paid plans and features</h4>
<p>SurveyMonkey has paid plans for individuals, teams, and enterprises.</p>

<h3>3. Typeform: Best user experience</h3>
<p>Like SurveyMonkey, <a href="https://www.typeform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Typeform</a> is probably one of the first tools that come to mind for online survey creation as it&#8217;s known for being an effective way to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-get-customer-feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gather customer feedback</a> and data. In fact, the company claims that 87% of users get deeper insights with its tool than with alternative online survey tools.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maximum number of surveys:</strong> Unlimited</li>
<li><strong>Maximum questions per survey:</strong> 10</li>
<li><strong>Maximum responses:</strong> 10 responses per month</li>
</ul>

<h4>Noteworthy free features</h4>
<p>The free Typeform plan includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Logic jumps.</strong> Usually a paid feature, logic jumps allow survey-takers to skip to the questions that are most relevant to them based on their responses.</li>
<li><strong></strong> Send collected data to other apps with Zapier, Automate.io, Slack, HubSpot, and other integrations.</li>
<li><strong></strong> Create surveys from scratch or use one of Typeform&#8217;s templates as a starting point.</li>
<li><strong>Data downloads.</strong> Download survey insights and store them where it&#8217;s most convenient for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>From start to finish, Typeform is the cream of the crop as far as user experience goes. Not only is the onboarding process quick and easy, but it also gives users a taste of what it&#8217;s like to fill out Typeforms, giving them confidence in their decision to sign up. Plus, the overall user interface is simple, minimal, modern, resulting in efficient survey creation and great experiences for survey respondents.</p>
<h4>Paid plans and features</h4>

</ol>
<p>Enterprise plans are also available if you need custom response limits and seats, custom domains and branding, Single Sign-On, etc.</p>
<h3>4. Jotform: Most complete freemium plan</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.jotform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jotform</a> is another one of the most popular online survey tools and for good reason. It&#8217;s packed with flexible features to help you create sophisticated surveys, even on the free plan.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maximum number of surveys:</strong> 5</li>
<li><strong>Maximum questions per survey:</strong> 100</li>
<li><strong>Maximum responses:</strong> 100 per month (with total submission storage of 500)</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/best-free-online-survey-tools-jotform.png" alt="best free online survey tools - jotform" width="720" height="426" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60697" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/best-free-online-survey-tools-jotform.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/best-free-online-survey-tools-jotform-480x284.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Noteworthy free features</h4>
<p>What stands out about Jotform&#8217;s free plan?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thousands of templates.</strong> Jotform claims to have the largest selection of free templates available online and, with more than 7,000 listed, that&#8217;s not hard to believe.</li>
<li><strong>100+ integrations.</strong> Automatically sync form data with tools you already use for time-savings and better information management.</li>
<li><strong>40+ payment gateways.</strong> Some online survey tools offer no payment gateways or only a few such as PayPal and Stripe. With Jotform you get access to more than 40 so that you can accept payments with ease.</li>
<li><strong>100+ widgets.</strong> Go beyond basic form fields and elements. Add widgets for e-signatures, form calculations, checklists, inventory, PDF embeds, and much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although free, this plan is by no means basic.</p>
<h4>Paid plans and features</h4>
<p>Jotform has four paid versions as well.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bronze at $29 per month:</strong> Includes up to 25 forms, up to 1,000 monthly submissions and 10,000 total submissions, 250 fields per form, and no Jotform branding.</li>
<li><strong>Silver at $39 per month:</strong> Includes up to 50 forms, 2,500 monthly submissions and a 25,000 submission storage total, HIPAA compliance, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Gold at $99 per month:</strong> Includes 100 forms, 10,000 monthly submissions and up to 100,000 total submissions, and 1,000 monthly payment submissions.</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise, which requires a custom quote:</strong> Includes unlimited everything, custom domains, white-labeling, and more.</li>
</ol>
<p>Jotform has more limits to keep up with than other tools—monthly and total submissions, monthly form views, fields per form, monthly payments submissions, and available space. So, if you create a lot of surveys, you&#8217;ll need to monitor your usage. However, the quality and completeness of the survey tool itself can make that extra task on your to-do list worth it.</p>
<h3>5. SoGoLytics: Best for scaling</h3>

<h3>Bonus tool: Qualaroo</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for something a little more advanced, you might consider the contextual online survey tool <a href="https://qualaroo.com/online-survey-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qualaroo</a>. This app isn&#8217;t free but does offer a free trial so you can see if it&#8217;s right for you.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/online-survey-tools-qualaroo.png" alt="online survey tools - qualaroo" width="720" height="354" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57444" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/online-survey-tools-qualaroo.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/online-survey-tools-qualaroo-480x236.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Rather than using traditional email surveys, Qualaroo lets you ask the right question to the right person at the right time. The questions are asked via unobtrusive &#8220;Nudges&#8221; and the responses are processed through its proprietary Sentiment Analysis technology. This runs on IBM Watson, a powerful natural-language-processing AI that gives you actionable user insights.</p>
<h4>Noteworthy features</h4>
<ul>
<li>Unlimited Nudges.</li>
<li>Feedback campaign consultation.</li>
<li>Advanced export capabilities.</li>
<li>Pre-made templates.</li>
<li>Integrations with Google Analytics, Marketo, Zapier, Slack, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Qualaroo pricing starts at $80/month and offers a free trial for you to check out all the features. Regardless of the plan chosen, every Qualaroo user gets the core features that every good survey software needs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Engagement options &#8211; </strong>In-Product Nudge<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, Link Nudge<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, website overlay, lead gen form, and NPS</li>
<li><strong>Survey customization &#8211; </strong>branching and skip logic, visual customization, and Nudge placement</li>
<li><strong>Audience targeting &#8211; </strong>behavioral, URL, and technology</li>
</ul>
<h2>Which is the best online survey tool?</h2>
<p>While the best online survey tool for you will ultimately depend on your business needs and budget, I’d recommend starting with Google Forms or Jotform. Both give a ton of value away for free.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re after a modern, minimal, seamless user experience—for yourself and the people you&#8217;ll be surveying—Typeform is worth trying.</p>
<p>Looking to do frequent and/or large-scale surveys now or in the future? SoGoSurvey&#8217;s free and paid plans make creating online surveys easy no matter what stage you&#8217;re at now or are aiming for down the road.</p>
<p>And, of course, you can also try the other survey tools on this list to find the best fit. But before you do, prioritize what features you need now <em>and</em> consider how your needs may evolve. That way, you can start off with the right tool and hopefully save yourself the hassle of having to switch later on.</p>
<p>Why not take five minutes to make a list of your priorities now and see which tools on our list match them?</p>
<p>To recap, here are the best free online survey tools:</p>
<ol>
<li>Google Forms: Best 100% free tool</li>
<li>SurveyMonkey: Best for short surveys</li>
<li>Typeform: Best user experience</li>
<li>Jotform: Most complete freemium plan</li>
<li>SoGoSurvey: Best for scaling</li>
<li>SurveyPlanet: Best unlimited freemium plan</li>
<li>Zoho Survey: Best for Zoho users</li>
<li>Crowdsignal: Best for WordPress users</li>
<li></li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A wise person once said, “We’re all in the same room—the room for improvement.” That couldn’t be more accurate when it comes to websites. But while we should always be brainstorming ways to improve their performance, it’s <em>not</em> always easy to spot problem areas or opportunity gaps on our own.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/best-free-website-graders-website-statistics-e1648753398191.png" alt="best free website graders - website statistics" width="719" height="415" class="aligncenter wp-image-59593 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/best-free-website-graders-website-statistics-e1648753398191.png 719w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/best-free-website-graders-website-statistics-e1648753398191-480x270.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 719px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.witsdigital.com/blog/importance-of-a-good-website-for-business-1024" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>That’s where website grader tools come in handy, since they perform evaluations for you and provide actionable reports based on the findings. Today, let’s look at 11 <em>free</em> website graders for content, search engine optimization, accessibility, and other aspects of websites including marketing.</p>
<h2>SEO website graders</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO</a> is complex. It takes a lot of work to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/19/get-on-first-page-google">get on the first page of Google</a> <em>and</em> stay there. If you’re not a pro, it’s tough to accurately determine how you’re doing with it. And even if you are, it’s helpful to have tools to double-check that you’ve covered all your bases.</p>
<h3>1. Google PageSpeed Insights</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/24/page-speed">Page speed</a> is an essential part of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/28/technical-seo">technical SEO</a>. Visitors won&#8217;t and don&#8217;t wait around long; if your site is slow, they simply bounce and go elsewhere.</p>
<p>This is where <strong><a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google PageSpeed Insights</a></strong> comes in. It’s a page speed grader that scores your mobile and desktop sites based on the number and severity of performance issues, including your Core Web Vitals—which came onto the scene in spring 2021 with the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/19/core-web-vitals-google-page-experience-update">page experience update</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pagespeed-insights-website-grader-1.png" alt="best website graders - pagespeed insights" width="720" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59552" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pagespeed-insights-website-grader-1.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pagespeed-insights-website-grader-1-480x400.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Its report tells you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/02/improve-core-web-vitals">how to improve your Core Web Vitals</a> and take advantage of opportunities, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text compression</li>
<li>Image sizing</li>
<li>CSS minification</li>
<li>JavaScript execution time</li>
<li>Text visibility during Webfont load</li>
</ul>

<p>Some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/22/google-page-speed">page speed optimization techniques</a> are simple enough for beginners to do themselves. However, other things you may want some expert help with for best results.</p>
<h3>2. LocaliQ Free Website Grader</h3>
<p>While Core Web Vitals are important, they&#8217;re only a subset of a long list of Google ranking factors—both technical and content—that you need to optimize your site for if you want to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">increase traffic</a>.</p>
<p>While all-in-one <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/09/18/best-keyword-research-tools">SEO and keyword research tools</a> like Ahrefs and Semrush can help with your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/01/17/seo-content-beginners-guide">SEO content</a> optimizations, the reports are comprehensive and require knowledge of much more than just the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/30/seo-basics">SEO basics</a> to understand them.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://localiq.com/localiq-grader/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LocaliQ&#8217;s Free Website Grader</a></strong> performs an instant audit of your <a href="https://localiq.com/products/websites-landing-pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a> that checks for a mix of technical and content SEO factors, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meta tags</li>
<li>Word count</li>
<li>Broken links</li>
<li>Backlinks</li>
<li>Code quality</li>
<li>Image optimization</li>
<li>Sitemap</li>

<li>Mobile-friendliness</li>
</ul>
<p>The report prioritizes the results, puts them into plain language for you, and you can click on each result to get an explanation with action items.</p>

<h3>3. WebFX SEO Checker</h3>
<p>WebFX’s <strong><a href="https://www.webfx.com/seo-checker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO Checker</a> </strong>grades your website based on a similar set of factors, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Site speed</li>
<li>URL optimization</li>
<li>Meta tags</li>
<li>The user and SEO-friendliness of your content</li>
<li>Image optimization</li>
<li>Your website&#8217;s backend code</li>
<li>Internal links</li>
<li>Site security</li>
<li>Mobile-friendliness</li>
<li>Crawlability and indexation</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these factors, it assigns your site an SEO score of between zero and 100, with 70 to 100 being the ideal range.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/best-free-website-graders-webfx-score.png" alt="best free website graders - webfx scorecard" width="420" height="317" class="aligncenter wp-image-59580" /></p>
<p>The full report then goes on to provide actionable recommendations, many of which you can use right away.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/best-free-website-graders-webfx-report.png" alt="best free website graders - webfx report sample" width="477" height="639" class="aligncenter wp-image-59581" /></p>
<h2>Website content graders</h2>
<p>Next up we have website content graders. These graders don&#8217;t evaluate your content against <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/09/google-ranking-factors">direct SEO ranking factors</a>, but the readability of your copy. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/04/seo-content-readability">Readability</a> impacts how long users stay on your page, whether they return, and how they engage with it—all of which factor into your rank.</p>
<h3>4. VT Writer</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.claritygrader.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>VT Writer</strong></a> (formerly Clarity Grader) allows you to upload and analyze documents and portions of text or, even better, just pop in your domain and get a full page or website analysis.</p>
<p>It can help you make your content clearer and easier to read by calling your attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long sentences</li>
<li>Passive voice</li>
<li>Average sentence length</li>
<li>Two types of readability scores (Flesch and LIX)</li>
<li>Reading grade level</li>
</ul>
<p>To make adjustments easier to implement, VT Writer shows the piece of content referenced for each recommendation. That way, you don’t have to sift through your content to find and change it. Plus, it often gives specific suggestions for improvement as well.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/free-website-graders-clarity-grader.png" alt="" width="720" height="571" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59579" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/free-website-graders-clarity-grader.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/free-website-graders-clarity-grader-480x381.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>While you need to sign up to use this tool, you can get insights on up to 10,000 web pages or documents within 14 days with the free account.</p>
<h3>5. Hemingway Editor</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://hemingwayapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hemingway Editor</a> </strong>isn’t a typical website or marketing grader that you pop a website URL into and get an audit report from. It’s designed to help you optimize individual pages. However, it does provide a readability rating based on the reading grade level of your content.</p>
<p>On a more granular level, this rating relates to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of adverbs you use, which often have more forceful, impactful alternatives.</li>
<li>Opportunities to use active voice instead of passive.</li>
<li>How many complex phrases are present that have simpler alternatives.</li>
<li>The number of hard to read and very hard to read sentences, making optimizing for clarity easier.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/best-free-website-graders-hemingway-editor.png" alt="best free website graders - hemingway editor" width="720" height="521" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59583" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/best-free-website-graders-hemingway-editor.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/best-free-website-graders-hemingway-editor-480x347.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>While there’s a one-time fee for the desktop version of Hemingway, the web app is a 100% free tool.</p>
<h2>Accessibility website graders</h2>
<p>No matter who lands on your site—individuals with disabilities included—<em>everyone</em> should be able to enjoy a positive, seamless user experience. How do you know if your site delivers that kind of experience? There are graders for that!</p>
<h3>6. Accessibility Test</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://accessibilitytest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accessibility Test</a> </strong>allows you to test both single pages and full sites. It analyzes and scores both using thousands of tests from four leading accessibility tools and resources. It identifies and provides recommendations for a variety of problems, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Missing alt text for images</li>
<li>Empty headers</li>
<li>Non-descriptive link text</li>
<li>Missing form labels</li>
<li>Low contrast between background and foreground colors</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/accessibility-test-website-grader.png" alt="free website graders - accessibility test sample report" width="720" height="638" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59584" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/accessibility-test-website-grader.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/accessibility-test-website-grader-480x425.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It even provides context examples so you know where on your site or page these issues appear and can fix them quickly.</p>
<h3>7. SortSite</h3>
<p>The free version of <strong><a href="https://www.powermapper.com/products/sortsite/checks/accessibility-checks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SortSite</a> </strong>checks 10 pages and images, which makes it ideal for <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-website-design-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small business websites</a>. While it technically also evaluates browser compatibility, search engine issues, W3C standards issues, and usability problems, its accessibility checker is excellent. It identifies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level A issues</strong> that make using a site impossible for some people, such as links without underlines</li>
<li><strong>Level AA issues</strong> that make using a site very difficult for some, including low contrast between background and foreground colors</li>
<li><strong>Level AAA issues</strong> that make a site difficult to use, such as non-descriptive link text</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/powermapper-website-grader.png" alt="best free website graders - powermapper sample report" width="720" height="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59582" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/powermapper-website-grader.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/powermapper-website-grader-480x333.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The report, of course, also explains how to correct problems and what page they’re found on. Granted, some of the language for more technical aspects of the report like CSS can be tricky to understand if you’re not familiar with them. But there are plain English explanations as well, which are helpful.</p>
<h2>Other stellar website graders</h2>
<p>Your website doesn’t just exist to look pretty; it’s meant to be a cornerstone of your business’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/12/growth-marketing">growth strategy</a>. Here are some more website graders to help you figure out whether your current site is fulfilling that important role.</p>
<h3>8. Nibbler</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://nibbler.silktide.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nibbler</a> </strong>is a free website grader that provides an overall grade for your website <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/03/29/ux-conversion-rates">user experience (UX)</a>, along with 4 specialized grades focusing on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> How accessible a site is for mobile and disabled users</li>

</ul>

<div class="section__inner section__inner--column_seperator">
<div class="column">
<div>
<p><span lang="EN">Come for the monetary gain; stay for the endless other benefits. That’s how the story goes for many businesses that commit to developing authentic, attractive, and memorable brands. As a result of intentional brand-building, they enjoy gains that range from boosted engagement to increased influence and the ability to reel in other brands that gladly pay to share their spotlight. For them, it’s the key to real prosperity in business. It can be the same for you.</span></p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/brand-affinity-adwords-scaling-1.jpg" alt="brand affinity can improve adwords and facebook ad performance" width="800" height="407" /></div>
<p><span lang="EN">However, successfully harnessing the full power of branding to strengthen your business requires much thought, planning, and consistent effort. So you need to understand what brand personality and brand messaging are, the importance of both, and how to shape them to create a lasting brand that’ll bring you lasting success. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re covering in this post.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">What is brand personality and why should you care?</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">We all understand what “personality” is in an everyday context. It refers to the combinations of distinct characteristics and qualities that make people recognizable and, hopefully, attractive to others. That definition remains the same when it comes to <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/14/use-branding-to-improve-advertising">branding</a>. </span></p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/brand-personality_0-1.png" alt="chart comparing popular companies and their brand personalities" width="792" height="389" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://medium.com/ebaqdesign/brand-personality-traits-of-top-brands-19c58890770f">Image source</a></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Just as every person has a personality, so does every brand. And just as an individual’s personality affects how others view and interact with them, your brand’s personality impacts how people view and interact with your business. It can make the difference between struggling to get by and:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Retaining more <a href="/blog/ws/2016/11/10/customer-loyalty">loyal customers</a> and turning them into brand advocates.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Bringing in a steady stream of new customers.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Building credibility and authority within your industry, which fuels more of the above.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">So, of course, you don’t want to leave the development of your brand personality to chance. If you want the benefits of having a brand, you have to go after them strategically. How?  </span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">4 ways to develop your brand personality</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Consider four crucial steps in the process of defining your brand personality. </span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">1. Decide who you are FIRST</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Many brands decide who they are AFTER launch and tailor their messaging as things shake out. That’s a waste of time, money, and resources. Instead of playing catch up, <a href="/blog/ws/2019/02/12/google-tag-manager">streamline</a> things from the start.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Choose your <a href="/blog/ws/2021/06/09/company-core-values">core values</a> and the drivers behind your work BEFORE ever coming to market. Highlight your priorities, specialties, and your <a href="/blog/ws/2021/01/13/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing">emotional</a> appeal. If these are the foundation for your brand identity, the rest will fall into place much easier. Why? Because, in selling your unique brand, you’ll stand out from others who are simply selling non-distinct <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">products and services</a>.</span></p>
<p><em><strong>Related:</strong> </em>Defining your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/brand-purpose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand purpose</a> can help you with this crucial step!</p>
<h3><span lang="EN">2. Enlist the help of family &amp; friends</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Outside perspectives can be extremely helpful when trying to gain clarity on what your brand personality should be. And who better to shed light on who you are and what you’re all about than the people who know you best?</span></p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/brand-personality-family-friends-1.png" alt="how to develop a memorable brand personality—two happy friends" width="800" height="533" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/man-and-woman-sitting-on-chair-in-front-of-desk-1346197/">Image source</a></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Ask your family and friends to describe you as an individual and <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/27/facebook-ads-for-entrepreneurs">entrepreneur</a> (not your brand). You should end up with a decent list of characteristics and traits, especially after doing your own brainstorming too. You can then analyze the list to see how your characteristics<em> do </em>carry over into your business and how they <em>could</em> carry over into your branding.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">For example, let’s say that you sell makeup to women in their 20s. When asked, your family and friends described you as a bright ray of sunshine in their lives. Given that feedback, it would make sense to adopt a positive, uplifting brand personality and voice. This is just one example of how <a href="/blog/ws/2020/01/24/customer-feedback">feedback from others can be applied </a>to help you develop cohesive branding.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">3. Get to know your audience</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">As much as your brand personality has to do with who <em>you</em> are, it also relates to who your audience is. Your branding could be a perfect reflection of what your business is all about. But if it doesn’t resonate with your audience, what does it matter?</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">So don’t develop your branding blindly or based on assumptions about your<a href="/blog/ws/2014/09/18/beginners-guide-to-target-markets"> target market</a>. Speak to current and potential customers often, observe them, and do your research to find out how they perceive your brand in comparison to competitors. Then, weave what you learn into your brand personality.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">4. Nail down your brand voice</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">An important part of brand personality, voice can make or break your efforts. <em>How</em> you choose to communicate determines whether or not you can successfully breathe life into the traits and characteristics you define as part of your brand personality. You’ve got to get it right.</span></p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/brand-voice_0-1.png" alt="how to develop a memorable brand personality—venn diagram intersecting your unique personality and how you want to appear" width="800" height="523" /></div>
<p><span lang="EN">Should your voice and tone be funny or serious? Sophisticated or causal? Old-school or always on-trend? It could be one or several depending on your style, audience, industry, and other factors. Whatever you choose, though, the main thing is that you keep your voice consistent. After all, your voice exists everywhere your brand does; you want it to be recognizable and memorable no matter where people hear it. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Once you’ve done the work of defining who you are, gathering feedback from those close to you, getting to know your audience, and settling on your brand voice, what next? You can move on to crafting your brand message. </span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">What brand messaging is and why you need it</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">As mentioned, <em>how</em> you communicate with your audience matters. Equally important, though, is <em>what</em> you communicate to them (AKA your brand messaging).</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Over the years, FedEx’s slogans have provided excellent examples of strong, enduring brand messaging. Take a look at a handful of those slogans and notice what they all have in common.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">We Live To Deliver</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Our Most Important Package is Yours</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">When It Absolutely, Positively Has to Be There Overnight</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Did you catch it? All three highlight the company’s singular focus: Getting your packages delivered. All of FedEx’s messaging across its website and other <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/25/benefits-of-content-marketing">content</a> highlights this same commitment. Even its visual branding including the brand colors and the arrow in its logo never deviate from the main message. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Take this as a lesson. A dialed-in message that appeals to the core values, needs, and wants of your audience will always perform better than an unfocused and inconsistent one. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Walmart is another noteworthy example of this. Since its core message centers on <a href="/blog/ws/2016/08/18/ppc-money-saving-checklist">saving money</a>, it’s no surprise that words like “discount”, “rollback”, and “clearance” are a common staple across the company’s content. And that’s not to mention calls to action such as “be the first to save!” and “start with everyday low prices.”</span></p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/brand-personality-walmart_0-1.png" alt="how to develop a memorable brand personality—walmart logo and tagline" width="794" height="237" /></div>
<p><span lang="EN">The takeaway? When you have an <a href="/blog/ws/2018/04/25/event-marketing">established brand</a> message and allow it to inform your decisions, your overall marketing becomes both simpler and more effective. Whether you’re writing blog posts, landing pages, ads, Instagram captions, emails, or even your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/16/elevator-pitch-examples-templates">elevator pitch</a>, your brand message will point true north. Even better, it’ll capture and hold the attention of your audience.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">4 keys to crafting strong brand messaging</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Now that we know what strong brand messaging looks like and why it’s important, let’s dive into how to create it.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">1. Let your core values lead the way</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">What’s important to you? What motivates you to do what you do every day? What rules do you and your team live by? All of these questions tie back to a main ingredient of every solid brand—<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/09/company-core-values">core values</a>. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Determine what yours are, figure out which ones you have in common with your audience, and use those as the foundation for your brand messaging. Tie everything back to them and you <em>will</em> attract more of the right people to your business (who’ll then tell other like-minded people about you).</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">2. Consider your offerings and audience</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">As with developing your brand personality, you’ll want to consider your potential customers when crafting your message. But it’s also essential to make sure it’s a match for what you’re offering, whether you sell products or services or both. </span></p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/brand-personality-nike-1.png" alt="how to develop a memorable brand personality—nike logo and tagline" width="800" height="360" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://www.brandchannel.com/2013/07/03/nike-celebrates-25-years-of-just-do-it/">Image source</a></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Take, for example, Nike’s “Just Do It” slogan. It matches Nike’s workout products because it centers on taking action. It also matches the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">audience</a> (fitness enthusiasts) because it encourages being bold and forging ahead, which they value.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Be sure that <em>your</em> message is aligned with what you offer and to who.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">3. Get inspiration from successful companies</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Besides the major brands we’ve discussed, there may be others—in or outside of your industry, large or small—whose messaging resonates with you. Think about why. Learn from what those brands are doing and use the inspiration as <a href="/blog/ws/2016/12/20/creative-advertising-ideas">creative and strategic fuel </a>for your efforts. </span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">4. Don’t overthink it and don’t overdo it</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">It’s easy to get overwhelmed thinking about how to appeal to absolutely every potential customer you might come in contact with. But fretting over that is a surefire way to alienate and confuse your audience, which would only push you away from your business goals. Be resolved to keep your brand messaging as simple as possible. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Ulta Beauty does this with great success. Even though the company has two messages—“All Things Beauty. All In One Place” and “Welcome To The Fun Side Of Beauty”—they both revolve around one thing. Ulta doesn’t try to appeal to anyone who doesn’t love beauty and having fun with beauty products. They don’t try to incorporate home goods or any other topics into their messaging; it’s all beauty all the time.</span></p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/brand-personality-ulta-1.png" alt="how to develop a memorable brand personality—ulta beauty logo and tagline" width="800" height="518" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><a href="https://onebellevueplace.com/ulta-beauty-opens-new-location-in-nashville-on-february-23/">Image source</a></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">So ask yourself: What message(s) will get my main point across to the majority of my audience in the most straightforward way? Once you have an answer, leave it at that. </span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">To enjoy the benefits of strategic branding…</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">As you can see, a fair bit of work goes into <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/01/brand-strategy">developing a brand </a>personality and message worth taking notice of and remembering. For that investment of time, energy, and resources to pay off, consistency is vital. Once you decide on personality traits, take on a certain voice and tone, and choose a message, don’t stray from it (unless, of course, A/B tests or the direction of your company dictate change).  </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">To help you build trust with your audience and increase brand awareness by staying “on brand” at all times, why not create a brand guide? By having your guidelines in writing, you and your team can stay on the same page and enjoy the many benefits that consistent, thoughtful branding can bring!</span></p>

<h2><span lang="EN">How to develop your brand strategy</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Developing a long-term plan for <a href="/blog/ws/2018/04/25/event-marketing">building your brand</a> can seem like an overwhelming task. Where do you start? There are 10 steps that can give you a solid foundation on which to build.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">1. Pick your niche(s)</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Catering to a <a href="/blog/ws/2014/10/28/niche-marketing">niche market</a> may involve offering specialized services, serving specific audiences, or limiting your focus to certain products that best serve the needs of your customers. Why can “niching down” be a smart strategic move? </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Benefits include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">More time and energy to focus on creating the best possible <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">products, services</a>, and experiences for your customers.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Reduced waste of resources (including money).</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">The ability to charge a premium for your specialized expertise.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Differentiation from competitors who appeal to different or more general audiences (perhaps with different or more general offerings also).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Rather than spreading your resources thin trying to be all things to everyone, you can allocate them where they’ll do the most good.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">That’s not to say that you <em>must</em> focus on one narrow audience, service or product, though. Businesses can successfully cater to several different niches. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">To lay the foundation for <em>your</em> brand strategy, determine where it would be most worthwhile for you to focus. Considering what you enjoy most and excel at will give you a good start and put you on the path to a dialed-in brand image that supports your <a href="/blog/ws/2021/01/04/best-marketing-strategies-2021">marketing strategy</a>. </span></p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/effective-brand-strategy-what-is-a-niche-1.png" alt="Effective brand strategy chart defining &quot;what is a niche&quot;" width="680" height="680" /></div>
<h3><span lang="EN">2. Define your business and marketing goals</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">The whole point of a strategy is to reach a goal (or goals). So, in developing your brand strategy, you can’t forget to consider your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-plan-goals-objectives-for-small-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short and long-term goals</a>. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Think of where you want your business to be next month, next year, and in a few years from now. Would you like to increase your customer base by a certain percentage? Is establishing a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-run-customer-loyalty-programs/">customer loyalty program</a> in the cards for you? Do you eventually want to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/grand-opening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open another location</a>? </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">In any case, keep your core <a href="/blog/ws/2020/06/15/marketing-objectives">objectives</a> front and center as you decide what brand strategy will harmonize with your marketing efforts and get you to your goal.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">3. Conduct brand research</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Building a brand strategy in a bubble is a bad idea. It’s important to understand how your competitors and other businesses your audience engages with are branding themselves. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Of course, you don’t want to be a copycat. However, you <em>can</em> learn a ton from what’s working for them, how your audience responds to certain tactics, and even what your competitors <em>aren’t</em> doing in their branding. Looking at existing brands can give you both creative inspiration and strategic insights to help you set yourself apart from the crowd.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">4. Spotlight what makes you different</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Even if what you offer isn’t truly unique or one-of-a-kind, you can still stand out as different. How? Your brand messaging is one key. </span></p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/effective-brand-strategy-starbucks-dd_0-1.png" alt="brand strategy-starbucks dunkin donuts cups" width="720" height="391" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/regionals/north/2013/06/01/dunkin-donuts-and-starbucks-battle-out-for-coffee-supremacy-greater-boston/QK33ZCIAGcTNO04aVH6vJN/story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Take, for example, the commercial coffee chains Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts. Both sell similar products, but their brand strategies convey different messages to very distinct audiences. And both brands are successful. The same can be true in your case.    </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">You can customize your brand strategy and differentiate your business with: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN"><a href="/blog/ws/2016/12/07/company-mission-statements">Mission</a> and vision statements that are personal to you</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Core values that are at the heart of what you do and that are shared by your customers</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">A crystal clear description of the unique way you solve a common problem</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">A crystal clear description of the way you solve an <em>uncommon</em> but notable problem</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">A focus on an uncommon or unique characteristic of your target audience</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">The unique customer experience you create for your customers</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Let’s say you own a pizzeria. Yes, there are lots of other pizzerias out there. However, yours is unique in that you serve authentic Italian brick-oven pizza in a setting that takes your customers straight into the heart of Sicily. Your purpose isn’t just to make tasty pizzas; it’s to deliver an authentic Italian experience that locals can’t find elsewhere in the area. </span></p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/effective-brand-strategy-pizzeria_0-1.png" alt="whole pizza" width="702" height="528" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pizza_varieties_by_country#Italy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Now substitute your actual business type in place of the pizzeria. The main question remains the same. What can you offer customers that they can’t get from <a href="/blog/ws/2016/02/18/ppc-competitor-analysis">your competitors</a>?</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">5. Think of your business as a person</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Every person has a unique personality. So does every business. In both cases, though, not every personality is memorable. To prevent having a forgettable brand, it can help to envision your business as a person (real or imagined). </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Ask yourself: If my business were a person, what kind of person would it be? What traits and characteristics would make it appealing, influential, or memorable? How would others describe their voice, tone, and style?  </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">This exercise can help you visualize the attributes of your business you want to highlight in your brand strategy and the best way to go about doing that. </span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">6. Craft an exceptional customer experience</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/19/customer-marketing-strategies">Customer experience</a> is the great equalizer of businesses. Sure, a competitor might offer the same products or services at a cheaper price, but if they treat their customers poorly or fail to address small but significant details, it won’t matter. People are willing to spend a little more money or time for a better experience. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Plus, satisfied customers can become mini-marketers for your business, spreading the word about their positive experience, writing <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">customer reviews</a>, and recommending you to others like them.</span></p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/effective-brand-strategy-customer-experience-1.png" alt="smiley faces indicating customer experience with a brand" width="784" height="504" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.hotjar.com/customer-experience/">Image source</a></span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">So think beyond how you can deliver a <em>decent</em> experience or even just a slightly better one than your competitors do. Deliver the <em>ideal</em> experience for your customers. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">What additional bases can you cover to show your customers that you truly stand for what you say you do? What aspects of your brand can you translate into action when it comes to <a href="/blog/ws/2020/05/21/client-communication-during-covid-19">communicating</a> with, serving, and supporting your customers? Additionally, how can you<a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/16/get-more-google-reviews"> make it easy for your customers to share their positive experiences with you</a>, especially online? </span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">7. Get involved with your community</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Embracing your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/tips-to-help-your-business-build-a-sense-of-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local community</a> can do wonders for your business. People love to support local businesses and often make the conscious choice to frequent them over large chains. Plus, in contrast to larger companies, you make it possible for people to <a href="/blog/ws/2015/12/23/humanize-brand">put a face to your brand</a>, making it more appealing and human.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Personally connecting with customers has a twofold advantage. One, it’s an excellent way to build relationships, establish a great reputation, and turn <a href="/blog/ws/2016/11/10/customer-loyalty">loyal customers</a> into brand advocates who willingly share their positive experiences with your business. Two, the more you engage with your customers, the better you’ll understand their needs. The insights you gather will allow you to provide more tailored solutions, which means happier customers! </span></p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/effective-brand-strategy-microphone-1.png" alt="microphone as symbol of brand voice" width="720" height="480" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.business2community.com/small-business/marketing-small-business-local-community-events-02021150">Image source</a></span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">What are some ways you can get involved in your community? You could connect with other small business owners, attend local events, feature your best customers on your<a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business"> social media pages</a>, or even sponsor children’s sports teams from nearby schools. All of these strategies will bring you closer to your customers while incentivizing them to support your business.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">8. Create and maintain a high-quality blog</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">A well-maintained business blog can bring many benefits including <a href="/blog/ws/2020/11/17/website-visibility">increased online visibility</a> and an increase in sales. Yet, it can also be a surefire way to develop your brand. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">As mentioned, branding is all about making your business easily identifiable in a crowd and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post">blogging</a> happens to be an excellent way to communicate the unique personality and intent of your company.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Just be sure to choose topics that are relevant to your audience and make your posts easy to read, adding images to hold attention and improve user experience. And don’t be afraid to add some personality to the information you’re relaying. Think about how you would personally converse with a customer about your business or a specific piece of advice, and try to maintain that conversational style when writing your posts.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">9. Develop your visual identity strategically</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Strategy is just as key when deciding on <a href="/blog/ws/2020/12/22/visual-marketing-tools">visual</a> branding as it is when crafting your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">messaging</a>. For example, choosing brand colors is not solely a matter of personal preference. Color psychology should be a guiding factor. After all, research has shown that between 62% and 90% of snap <span lang="EN"><a href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/5bfc8dbab40b9d7dd9054f41/1543532666986-BMMODURVW298JMOT89H4/170803-infographic-psychology-of-colors-small.jpg?content-type=image%2Fjpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">judgments made by customers are based on color</a><span lang="EN">. Why? </span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Different colors elicit different emotions and responses, which you can use to influence the way people view and interact with your brand. </span></p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/effective-brand-strategy-color-branding-1.png" alt="chart of colors and what they can represent for a brand" width="750" height="482" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN"><a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/the-psychology-of-color-how-to-use-colors-to-increase-conversion-rate/">Image source</a></span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">For example, consider the “vibes” associated with some colors:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Blue can convey dependability and trust, among many other things, making it the most popular and meaningful color by far.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Purple is another favorite and it’s associated with royalty, creativity, and optimism.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Red brings to mind passion, excitement, and boldness, along with several opposites including danger <em>(so be careful with this one!)</em></span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Green often represents concepts such as <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/28/growth-strategy">growth</a>, health, and safety.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Yellow is associated with warmth, brightness, and optimism.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Black and white can both be used to convey class, confidence, and simplicity.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">And this is just a taste of the many positive and not-so-positive connotations associated with various colors and shades. There are many nuances to keep in mind so, from your logo to your website design and beyond, be sure to choose your brand colors wisely. Only if you do will your visual branding support your larger brand strategy and bring you more business.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">10. Unify your social media accounts </span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Besides your website, your social media accounts are among the most easily accessible representatives of your business online. In other words, your accounts provide a prime opportunity to distinguish your brand from the start of a potential customer’s engagement with you.  </span></p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/effective-brand-strategy-social-media-1.png" alt="twitter, instagram, facebook logos " width="624" height="350" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN"><a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-ideas/">Image source</a></span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Whether you use Twitter, <a href="/blog/ws/2018/07/02/facebook-marketing-for-small-business">Facebook</a>, Instagram, or other platforms, maintain a cohesive voice and visuals. This will ensure that your followers and potential customers are being met with the same consistency and reliability they’d expect if they were to do business with you.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">Why put the work into your brand strategy?</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Your brand starts with you but, ultimately, it ends with the perception people have of your business and the actions they do or don’t take as a result. (Actions like filling out a form—which is a <a href="/blog/ws/2021/04/12/first-party-data">first-party data collection</a> tool that will become increasingly important in a cookieless world.)</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">By shaping every aspect of your brand purposefully, you can have a positive impact on the perception and response of your audience, not to mention <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/14/use-branding-to-improve-advertising">supercharge your advertising</a>. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Whether your business is large or small, old or new, prioritizing your brand strategy will pay off in more ways than one. Do you want stronger relationships with your audience, a better reputation, more exposure, and increased revenue? If so, put the work into this invaluable part of your small business plan.</span></p>

<h2><span lang="EN">What is a sales promotion?</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">A sales promotion is any undertaking by an organization designed to<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-increase-sales-for-your-business-on-a-budget/"> increase sales</a> or encourage the use or trial of a product or service. Sales promotions take many different forms, but they all focus on persuading a target audience to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/04/nurture-marketing">become customers of a business</a>.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">Sales promotions can be announced over free channels like social media, email, or your website; or they can be the focal point of your paid advertising campaigns such as with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/05/linkedin-advertising">LinkedIn ads</a> or Google Ads. An effective sales promotion uses imagery, <a href="/blog/ws/2020/01/22/marketing-copy">effective copy</a>, and logic to appeal to the needs, values, and emotions of your target audience, and invites them to purchase your products or services with an incentivizing offer.</span></p>

<h2><span lang="EN">The purpose of a sales promotion</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">At first, it might seem that offering promos and deals is a self-destructive behavior that shortchanges your business. That would be terrible…if it were true. In reality, though, your business benefits from sales promotions just as much as your customers:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN"><strong>Minimize risk:</strong> A balanced approach to promotions minimizes risk to your company. In other words, so long as you’re not offering endless, outrageous deals that wouldn’t be sustainable for your business, your promos are likely to create win-win situations. </span></li>
<li><span lang="EN"><strong>Make a profit:</strong> The sense of urgency and desire created by short-term offers means that your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/03/increase-sales-online">sales can increase significantly</a>. In fact, you could end up making more profit than you would if you were doing business as usual.</span></li>
<li><strong>Attract new customers: </strong>No better way to catch the eye of someone new than with an exciting offer</li>
<li><span lang="EN"><strong>Retain customers: </strong>Deals and discounts <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/07/customer-engagement-strategy">keep your customers engaged</a> and happy; and you know what that means. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/18/loyalty-marketing">Loyalty!</a></span></li>
<li><strong>Speed up your <a href="sales%20cycle">sales cycle</a>: </strong>Promotions are great top-of-funnel offers that can get prospects on your nurture path.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the list goes on. You can get rid of aging product, increase product awareness, promote a new product, activate dormant customers, and improve your brand reputation.<a href="#universal-sales-promotion-examples"></a></p>

<h3><span lang="EN">1. Google Business offer posts</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Did you know that you can run promotions on your Google business listing? Your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/06/08/what-is-google-my-business">Google My Business account</a> dashboard allows you to create four different types of social posts: Offers, Updates, Events, and Products. </span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN">2. Free samples</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Although many businesses temporarily suspended this promotion strategy for <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/18/post-covid-19-customers">customers during COVID-19</a>, it can still be referenced as one of the best sales promotion examples out there. By offering free samples to all in the store regardless of whether they purchase something, this strategy (employed by businesses like Costco and Whole Foods) introduces consumers to products they may not have considered before, and oftentimes cordially <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/03/increase-sales-online">encourages them to buy</a>. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Do you have a product that you’re trying to sell? Give out samples! While this works best with food (both in-store and at farmer&#8217;s markets), it can also be used by spas and salons—with tester lotions, perfumes, or aromatherapy products. The bottom line is that people like things they can try before buying.</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN">3. Buy one, get one free promotions</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Buy one, get one free deals (aka BOGO) are among the most popular types of sales promotions. Offering two of an in-demand product at a reduced price and for a short time creates a sense of urgency that can boost sales. It can also clear stock, which is why, within business circles, BOGO promos are often referred to as “self-liquidating”. </span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/sales20promotion20examples20buy20one20get20one20free20papa20johns20pizza_0.png" alt="sales promotion examples buy one get one free papa johns pizza" width="400" height="535" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="EN">The great thing is that these promotions <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/01/marketing-ideas-for-small-businesses">rarely cost anything</a>. In fact, they’re designed to <em>increase</em> revenue. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">For example, let’s say you pay $3 for a product that you sell for $10. If you offer a 50% discount, you’d be making $2 from selling just one at the discounted price. However, running a BOGO discount means you can sell one item at full price minus your cost for two items so, in the end, you’d be earning $4. With more people buying that product as a result of your promo, <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/07/agency-profitability-metrics">your profits would soar</a>. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong><span lang="EN">The great thing is that these promotions rarely cost anything. In fact, they’re designed to <em>increase</em> revenue.</span></strong></p></blockquote>
<p><span lang="EN">BOGO deals work with more than just product-based businesses; they also work for service-based businesses. Fitness studios, spas, salons, consultants, and trainers can offer BOGO deals on their classes or trainings to fill their schedules or <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing/marketing-during-slow-economy-recession/">get new clients during a slow season</a>. Since service-based businesses are more time- than product value-related, the only cost is time. So especially if you have time to spare, this is a perfect promotion to try.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">4. Cashback promotions</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Many consumers would agree that it doesn’t feel as bad to spend money when you get some in return. It’s almost like paying less from the start and then having extra money to get other desirable products.</span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/sales20promotion20examples20get20cash20back_0.png" alt="sales promotion examples get cash back" width="330" height="516" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p><span lang="EN">Plus, giving back to customers in this way usually results in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/11/10/customer-loyalty">more loyalty and business from them</a>. This kind of offer is a win-win for both you and your customers.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">5. Lifestyle discounts</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Lifestyle discounts are those that apply to a particular profession, age group, or demographic.—usually one associated with an ID. They commonly available for:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Teachers</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Students </span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Veterans</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN">Seniors</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">While you can offer these promotions year-round, there are also months and days of the year dedicated to specific groups of people, so be sure to take advantage of that. For example, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/back-to-school-marketing-ideas/">back to school discounts</a> are <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/10/september-marketing-ideas">great September promotions</a>, while August is home to National Senior Citizen&#8217;s Day. Keep an eye on your calendar for these <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/21/october-marketing-ideas">monthly marketing themes </a>so that you can plan your promos well in advance and maximize their results! </span></p>

<h3></h3>
<h3><span lang="EN">6. Flash sales and discounts</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">A flash sale creates a sense of urgency among your customer base to buy <em>now</em>. So especially if you have a business that does a lot of online sales, flash sales may be one of the more effective sales promotion strategies for you.</span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/sales20promotion20examples20flas20sale20promo20code.png" alt="sales promotion examples flash sale promo code" width="800" height="510" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="EN">There are at least two ways to go about this type of sales promotion. One, you could do a flash sale once or twice a year. Or, two, you could do one on a set schedule each month so that people are anticipating the event and prepared to make purchases on short notice.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">In either case, be sure to utilize social media and email marketing campaigns to announce when the sale will be happening. You can even create a fun branded hashtag to get your audience hyped to buy!</span></p>

<h2><span lang="EN">Sales promotions that encourage repeat business</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Repeat business is often the best business. Your loyal customers are often the ones to spend the most on your offerings and will gladly <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">spread the word about your products and services</a>. </span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">7. Vouchers and coupons</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">You can offer vouchers and coupons via email, your website, or print materials such as product packaging, catalogs, and so on. They are a great way to thank your current customers and to encourage them to continue doing business with you.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">One way to really get people excited about their next purchase with you is to offer a mystery coupon. Not only is it <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/04/interactive-content">interactive</a>, but it also makes customers feel as if they’re playing a game and getting more than just a run-of-the-mill discount.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="EN">If you do give this a try, be sure to capitalize on every opportunity with a multi-pronged campaign and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/02/landing-page-tips-and-tricks">strategically-crafted landing page</a>. Even after they’ve clicked through to find out their discount, continue to advertise sale items or your most popular merchandise to further entice them to cash in on their coupon.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="EN">Too, you can make use of coupons to recover potential customers who’ve abandoned their carts. As of 2020, around <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/457078/category-cart-abandonment-rate-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">88% of online carts are abandoned</a>. However, offering discounts to customers who may previously have only been window shopping may be the nudge they need to complete a purchase.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>88% of online carts are abandoned, but offering promotions to your window shoppers just may be the nudge they need to complete a purchase.</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3><span lang="EN">8. Charitable cause promotions</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Why not kill two birds with one stone? Make an impact in your community while attracting more customers with a charitable sales promotion.  Let your customers know that for a certain period of time, a portion of your proceeds will go to a charity you support. Or you can make this an ongoing  initiative as Necker&#8217;s Jewelers does in the example below.</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN">9. Free shipping and returns</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">In addition to coupons, which we discussed earlier, what’s another cure for a ton of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/17/shopping-cart-abandonment">abandoned shopping carts</a>? Four words: Free shipping. Free returns. Free shipping eliminates one of the last obstacles that could prevent people from completing their orders. This is key because hesitation can be present even when a customer has done business with you before and likes what you offer.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="EN">On the other hand, free shipping eliminates the anticipation of the hassle that is paying for return shipping. By getting rid of both forms of friction, you can encourage more repeat purchases from your product-based business. </span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN">10. Loyalty program promotions</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Rewards and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-run-customer-loyalty-programs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loyalty programs</a>—even those that don’t necessarily pay off immediately—can be a powerful motivator for customers. Here are a few approaches you might consider. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">You could double or triple <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/18/loyalty-marketing">loyalty</a> points for a limited time, which can be a great incentive to buy. You might even offer a “lump sum” of points for signing up for your loyalty program, which could move customers to buy more than they would have initially.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Punch cards are also a well-known option, which makes customers eligible for a special offer after a certain number of purchases. Some businesses even offer a small discount every time customers use their cards.</span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/sales20promotion20examples20loyalty20marketing20promotions.png" alt="sales promotion examples loyalty marketing promotions" width="791" height="493" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="EN">This tactic, of course, keeps customers coming back for the rewards, but also ensures you’ll <a href="/blog/ws/2020/06/23/managing-cash-flow">make enough cash </a>to keep you in the green after providing discounts.</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN">11. Joint promotions</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Whether your company owns several brands or you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/26/partner-marketing">partner with companies in similar or related industries</a>, you can make use of joint sales promotions. All you have to do is bundle products or services from each brand into a package and promote it via the other brand(s). Your partners can do the same for you, which means free promotion for both of you. </span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/sales20promotion20examples20joint20promotions.png" alt="sales promotion examples joint promotions" width="800" height="326" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="EN">This type of arrangement can extend the reach of your brand. It familiarizes new potential customers with what you offer and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/11/get-more-conversions">increases the likelihood that they’ll convert </a>in the future. <span lang="EN">The partnership between Red Robin and the X-Men Wolverine franchise is a fine example of a joint promotion.</span></span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/sales20promotion20examples20joint20promo20red20robin.png" alt="sales promotion examples joint promo red robin" width="800" height="531" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="EN">Red Robin offered discounts to patrons who showed up for a burger with their Wolverine ticket stub in hand. While they may not have received a discount for the actual movie, the film benefitted from attracting people who were more excited about the burger at the end of the tunnel than the movie itself.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">12. Social media contests and giveaways</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/05/11/instagram-giveaways">A contest or giveaway on Facebook</a>, Instagram, or your target audience’s social platform of choice is a great way to get new customers interested in your business and <a href="/blog/ws/2016/10/19/get-more-instagram-followers">gain more quality followers</a>. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">For example, one common method is to require followers to tag a certain number of people in the comments, or post to their stories, to be entered to win. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="EN">If you can get your existing audience excited enough about your contest or giveaway, this is basically guaranteed exposure.

This boosts the probability of meaningful engagement and sales in the future. </span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">13. Shopping sprees</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">One of the most exciting in-store sales promotions you can do is an “enter to win” contest that gives the winner a shopping spree in your store. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Of course, you have to be careful not to leave too much merchandise up for grabs because that could end up costing you dearly.

This <a href="/blog/ws/2014/04/28/user-generated-content">user-generated content </a>can put your business on the radar of potential customers and encourage them to check out what you offer.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">14. Give branded gifts or bundles</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Additional value for less can be very enticing, so you may bundle together your most popular or closely-related services for a reduced price. This is an excellent way to get people talking about your business. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Alternatively, you can offer branded gifts to existing customers and others. The more loyal a supporter of your brand, the more often they’ll use your branded gifts. Who knows how many people will find out about, be reminded of, and check out your brand as a result? </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Both bundles and branded gifts can spark a good deal of new interest in your business.</span></p>

<h3><span lang="EN">15. Referral discounts</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Bringing new customers into the fold should always be on your radar. One way to keep the new customers rolling in is to offer discounts when current customers refer a friend or promote you on social media. </span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/sales20promotion20ideas20referral20promotions_0.png" alt="sales promotion ideas and examples referral promotions" width="582" height="623" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="EN">Alternatively, you could give money that can be put toward a customer’s next purchase. In either case, you’ll need to decide if the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/06/referral-marketing">referral</a> alone is enough or if the discount is only applied after the new customer makes a purchase. If you choose to offer a discount regardless of whether or not anything is purchased, try to place a threshold on the number of referrals required before the discount takes effect. For example, get 25% off your next visit if you make three referrals.</span></p>
