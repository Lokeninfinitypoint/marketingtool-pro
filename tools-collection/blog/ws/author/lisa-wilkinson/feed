										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Budgeting seems to be the topic on everyone’s minds lately and I can’t help but think that this is due to Google’s subtle, or not so subtle, ways of telling you when you need to raise your bids and budgets. Google now has the ability to show you trends with your keywords, where you “should” be at for positioning and Max CPC’s, and other various tools that are likely to raise your budgets. I don’t think Google is wrong in what they say but I definitely think they have a sneaky way of not really explaining the <em>why</em> to customers.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2009/05/26/limited-by-budget">Way back in 2009</a>, Google introduced their way of showing you when you need to adjust your <a href="/blog/ws/2016/10/26/marketing-budget">marketing budget</a> to better fit their needs … I mean <em>your</em> needs and help you get more impressions and clicks. They call this tactic “your campaign is ‘limited by budget.’”</p>
<h2>Is “Limited by Budget” Just a Google Ads Scam?</h2>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/limited-by-budget-in-adwords-1.png" alt="limited by budget" width="207" height="118" /></div>
<p>We all have a secret, or for some, not so secret skepticism toward anything Google suggests to us regarding our money and budgets. This is the go-to cautionary move, considering we all know <a href="/blog/ws/2012/01/23/google-revenues">how much money Google makes</a> and we all know how much we spend in Google Ads (formerly known as AdWords). In all fairness to Google, I don’t think this is too much of a “make money” tactic and more of a “hey maybe you should take a look at your account” tactic. Obviously we know they want to make more money but I think they sometimes have a point when they tell you that your campaign(s) are “limited by budget.” For me there is one main reason for this and it can be easy to see once you diagnose the problem.</p>
<p>Here’s the problem: you can’t put all your eggs in one basket and expect everything to be evenly spread. What I mean by this is, you can’t put all your keywords or ad groups in one campaign and expect Google to evenly spread your budget throughout the day. There are always going to be certain keywords that are budget suckers and those are the ones Google seems to always show. Google will base a lot of what they show on trends and if they find a couple of keywords that seem to work, they will show those over some of your other similar keywords, even if those keywords are a better fit. If your campaign(s) seem to always be limited by budget, I can almost guarantee that if you look at the data on your ad groups, you will most likely see that <strong>one ad group is miles above the cost of the other ad groups</strong>. With this, you will notice that there are also ad groups that are getting no traffic whatsoever. So what do you do?</p>
<p>[<strong>MORE</strong>: <a href="/blog/ws/2011/12/07/ppc-budget-best-practices">PPC Budget Best Practices</a>]</p>
<h2>What to Do When Your Campaigns Are Limited by Budget</h2>
<p>What you need to do is (in any order):</p>
<h3>Find those ad groups or keywords that are taking up most of your daily budget on a monthly basis.</h3>
<p>This is easy to diagnosis because, like I said before, there are always ad groups or keywords that have a 30-70% higher cost than the others.</p>
<h3>NEVER move your high-traffic/high-volume keywords out, ALWAYS move your low hanging fruit.</h3>
<p>Take those ad groups and keywords that are seeing little to no traffic and create a new campaign for these with their own budgets. It is important to make sure your low-volume keywords can see some of that daily budget and ensure traffic starts coming in. Also, make sure that the budget isn’t over what you can afford. Remember, <a href="/blog/ws/2013/02/15/adwords-budgeting">not all budgets are created equal</a>, and it is important to make sure to never go over your comfort zone with your budgets. Think about it, if your high-traffic ad groups have their own budgets, those will continue to show and now your low-volume ones will see more traffic with their own budget. You never want to lose that historical data on keywords that are performing, so it makes more sense to take out those that aren’t doing as well; those that have little to no traffic will not be affected as much!</p>

<p><span></div></div></span></p>
<h3>Look at the metrics on the keyword level and you will probably notice a trend.</h3>
<p>You will see that there are usually 1-5 keywords that are sucking up most of the budgets and costs and leaving little to no budget for the rest of the keywords. My rule of thumb when looking at these keywords is: if those top three keywords that are sucking up most of your budget are not your biggest converters or money makers for your business, then they should be <a href="/blog/ws/2011/10/13/when-to-pause-keywords">paused</a> or optimized better.</p>
<p>I know what you are thinking: “Those are my high-traffic keywords, why would I want to pause them?” You want to pause them because these really aren’t doing anything for your business other than costing you money. There are probably more suitable keywords in your ad group that will convert better for you if it wasn’t for those costly keywords. Trust me, Google will find a way to spend your money, so do not be afraid to try pausing those costly keywords. Check the data and metrics on those keywords and you will find they are usually costing more and not converting at the rate they should be. They are usually those broad, more generic keywords that will drive traffic but not that qualified traffic you are looking for.  Like I said, those longer tailed keywords or more suitable keywords will start to show up more often and probably convert a whole lot better than the costly ones.</p>
<h3>Think outside of the box.</h3>
<div style=text-align:center;><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/out_of_the_box_661595-1.jpg" alt="AdWords Limited by Budget" width="500" height="454" /></div>
<p>Don’t just look at the obvious metrics, dig a bit deeper. Just because you moved those low hanging keywords and ad groups into their own campaigns with their own budget, does not always guarantee better performance. Everyone always resorts to raising the budget because Google says to do so, but there are other metrics to look at that may help. Typically those keywords are not being shown due to budget issues, and raising your daily budget and adjusting to make new campaigns will help, but you may also want to take a look at the Max CPC’s and the <a href="/blog/ws/2013/02/22/click-through-rate-by-ad-position">average position</a> when doing this. Giving something its own budget will not guarantee top of page or <a href="/blog/ws/2013/04/10/best-ad-position">the number one spot</a>, so make adjustments when you look at the metrics and this will really help you optimize that low hanging fruit. This isn’t always necessary, but PPC is never a guarantee, so the more experimenting you can do, the better your account will perform.</p>
<p>There are definitely countless ways to curtail this problem but this is what I have found successful from helping others with their accounts. If you really think about it, it all makes perfect sense. Of course, you may have the best structure and never have to worry about this but for those of us who never get it right the first time, this is something you are always going to be dealing with (unless you are one of the few that always says “Google never seems to spend all the daily budget” and for those few, that’s a whole other topic and easier to solve!).</p>
<p>Paid search is definitely not a set it and forget it type of industry and there is always going to be some experimentation happening. So make sure to try new things, think outside of the box and you will be golden! If you have any questions or would like to weigh in on this discussion, feel free to leave a comment below!</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Important: <strong>Modified broad match is no longer </strong>as of February 18, 2021. So sad! Here&#8217;s what you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/10/modified-broad-match-going-away">announcement about modified broad match going away.</a></li>
<li>Try these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/08/how-to-win-google-ads-broad-match">tips for using broad match in response to the change</a>.</li>
<li>Learn how to use<a href="/blog/ws/2021/06/08/broad-match-audience-targeting-google-ads"> broad match + audience targeting</a> as a solid workaround.</li>
</ul>
<p>Almost every week a client asks me, “What do those plus signs mean?” and I am constantly reminded that even though this <a href="/keyword-match-types">keyword match type</a> is fairly common, there are still a lot of people who have no idea it exists.</p>
<p>If you haven’t caught on yet, this match type is known in Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords) as the Broad Match Modifier, but it is more commonly and widely known as simply Modified Broad. People tend to shy away from using this match type because they don’t understand what it means or how it works. It can also be a time-consuming task to add the plus signs to each of those <a href="/blog/ws/2017/10/18/adwords-keywords">keywords</a> you want to switch, but in the long run, this match type can be a big help to your account.</p>
<p>Essentially the idea is that whatever keyword you put the plus sign in front of is a “modifier” to the broad match keyword. You can add a plus sign to only one or two words in the keyword or to all words in the keyword. So, whichever word(s) you end up putting a plus sign in front of, Google will recognize as a “modifier” and <strong>will make sure that those words are always in the search query no matter what</strong>.</p>
<p>As an example, if you sell furniture and you are bidding on the keyword “red leather couch” on a phrase match type (meaning, those words in that exact order must be in the search query), you could be missing out on relevant traffic – queries that have similar intent but different phrasing. On the other end of the spectrum, if you are bidding on the same keyword on a broad match type, you may be bringing in too much irrelevant traffic or too much traffic in general.</p>
<p><strong>This is where modified broad comes in handy.</strong> If you put the plus sign in front of red, leather and couch, like so:</p>
<p>+red +leather +couch</p>
<p>you are telling Google, I want to make sure that my ad DOES NOT show up for any search queries unless all three words are in it, and it doesn’t matter what order those keywords show up in. So someone searching for just “leather couch” you would not see your ad, because “red” was not in that search query, but if someone searches for “Leather couch in red” or “looking for a leather couch in red” you would show up, because all three words with a plus sign in front of them were in the search query.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/modified_broad_match_diagram-1.jpg" alt="Broad Match Modifier Explained" width="975" height="655" /></div>
<p>You also have the ability to put the plus sign in front of certain words instead of all words in the keyword. This is typically good for those branded terms you want to make sure always show up or for certain items that you sell. So, using the example from above, if you are bidding on the keyword “red leather couch” and you want to make sure that you always show up with search queries containing the words leather and couch, but you don’t care if the word red is there, you can add a plus sign in front of leather and couch and leave red alone. Bidding on this keyword (red +leather +couch) will ensure that you show up for those searching for leather couches, but you can also show up for keywords associated with the word “red”; someone searching for “leather couch in burgundy” or “in need of a crimson leather couch” has the potential for your ad to show.</p>

<h2>When to Use Modified Broad Match</h2>
<p>So now you are probably thinking, this is all great information but when and why would I use this match type? There is no definitive answer to this question but there are several factors you can use to make that decision. I typically tell people, and those of you who have talked to me before have probably heard this, that if something needs to be in a certain order you want to stick with a phrase match type; modified broad match type may not be the best option for you. This is typical for those branded terms or certain phrasings that only make sense to keep in that order.</p>
<p>For example: If you were to advertise for the Boston Police Department because they wanted to bring awareness to the upcoming civil service exam, you would most likely want to bid on the keyword “Civil Service Exam” on a phrase match type. This is because it would not make sense to show your ad for any other phrasing of those words. Examples like this are some reasons you would want to stay away from modified broad match types. If you don’t care what order they show up in, as long as all the words in the keyword are there in the search query, then modified broad match type will be a great in-between for you going from a broad match type to something a little more restrictive. To me, phrase match is almost telling that searcher what they need to type in for you to show up, but especially with Google, you never know what people are going to search for, so modified broad will help you get that traffic but not restrict it so much that no one will see your ad.</p>
<p>I may be a little biased because I typically think broad can be a bit more work in the upkeep department, which doesn’t make it a bad match type to use but you need to be consistent about adding negatives and monitoring the performance of those keywords. Broad keywords are usually going to have high impressions and not always the most clicks, which will lead to low click-through rates. This would be another great example of why you may want to switch your match types. Going along with the theory of phrase vs. modified broad that I just talked about, this would be a situation where you may not want to restrict your keywords to phrase, so by switching to modified broad, you can cut out a lot of that irrelevant and unqualified traffic but still keep those keywords to a fairly broad match type. One thing to keep in mind, if you are used to the high amount of traffic broad match keywords bring in, you may be surprised with a drop in impressions, but this is not something to immediately worry about, those keywords will still bring in a good amount of traffic over time.</p>
<p>There are definitely pros and cons to all the different match types and it can be confusing, but the more you know about them, the better off you and your account(s) will be. Take caution when changing your match types and make sure to remember that <strong>when you switch your match types, Google does consider this a new keyword</strong>. You may not see the metrics you are looking for right off the bat but keep in mind, Google Ads is not a set it and forget it type of process, so keep track of your changes. Don’t be afraid to revert anything or change any match type if you need to, because nothing in Google Ads is permanent; most things are trial and error, so it’s ok to make mistakes.</p>
