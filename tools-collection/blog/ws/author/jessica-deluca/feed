					<description><![CDATA[<p>Writing your own ad copy for your paid search campaigns can be an intimidating task for most. To make your life a little easier, we outlined our favorite tips for organizing your process and writing great ad copy at scale.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/14/writing-ad-copy-at-scale">6 Tips for Writing Ad Copy at Scale</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN">So here you are, staring at a million empty cells on an Excel spreadsheet, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/03/brainstorming-techniques">brainstorming</a> your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/20/call-to-action-buttons">best calls to action, aka CTA’s</a><span lang="EN"> and your catchiest taglines; you&#8217;ve got your best keywords sticky-noted to the computer screen as you write. We see you, writing ad copy is a little intimidating. Writing ad copy at scale? Even scarier. </span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">You might find yourself here because you’re building out a new account, creating a new campaign, or just editing your existing ads after Google has introduced its newest and shiniest ad type, like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/10/responsive-search-ads">responsive search ads</a>. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Whatever it may be, sitting and waiting for a creative epiphany and attempting to channel your inner advertising visionary genius can be frustrating, to say the least. On top of that, it’s crucial to stay on your toes as <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-lets-advertisers-add-a-third-headline-to-text-ads/265209/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google constantly updates</a><span lang="EN"> the details of its ad capabilities and features; it’s a lot to keep up with. That’s why we’ve outlined our best tips for writing paid search ads at scale, so you can take a deep breath and feel a little more confident in your quest to conquer the beast that goes by the name of PPC advertising. </span></span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">1. Stop! Close that spreadsheet! Research! Before anything else!</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">For a lot of people, doing your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/15/copywriting-tips">ad copywriting</a> research might mean googling <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/14/ppc-ad-copywriting">best practices</a><span lang="EN">. This isn’t necessarily <em>bad </em>practice, but it’s not the only research you should be doing. In reality, ad copy best practices aren’t one-size-fits-all. The most successful CTA’s for one industry or company may not be best for your business. So, how do you overcome that, you ask? </span></span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Start searching the way you would imagine your target market searches for you. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/08/15/ad-copywriting-tips">See how your competitors are baiting them in</a><span lang="EN">, and start to identify ways to infiltrate that space. Your process should start with some strong keyword research. You can’t <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/03/how-to-write-exceptional-ppc-ad-copy">successfully write an ad for your target market</a> without at least showing up when they’re searching for you! Figure out what keywords are important for your business to include in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/22/google-ad-copy-mistakes">ad copy</a> so you can get in front of your most worthwhile audience. Trying to see things from a prospect’s perspective within your buyer’s journey will do wonders for your ability to match their intent and drive engagement with your ad. </span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Here’s a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide">guide to getting started with keyword research</a><span lang="EN">, and here are some of our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/09/competitor-keywords">favorite competitive keyword research tools</a><span lang="EN">.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">This research also helps you better understand your target market, and can assist you in nailing down some solid buyer personas even further. What’s your target audience searching for? How are they wording it? What are the most common keywords? Who are your PPC competitors? We’ll talk more about that a little later, but standing in your potential customers’ shoes before any cells on the Excel sheet get filled in is the ultimate goal here. </span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">2. Organize yourself before you start</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">I know, I know, I said I was offering tips for writing ad copy <em>at scale</em>, but that research advice is pretty standard with any amount of ads you’re writing, so hold tight, and also, you’re welcome. Here’s where the tips are a little more technical/process oriented. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">I start by organizing a spreadsheet (those empty cells I keep referencing) and filling in the ad group and campaign columns before anything else. The ad group includes the keywords I’m optimizing for, so including them within the headlines is crucial to matching search query intent and gaining exposure. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Here’s what the organization of the process looks like, from a spreadsheet to a live ad on the world wide web! They grow up so fast. </span></p>

</div>
<h2><span lang="EN">3. Make multiple variations within each ad group</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Creating a few different variations for each ad group you’re writing for is your best bet. This way, you can measure the success of them against each other, and yes I’m gonna say it again, gain a better understanding of your audience and their behavior. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">If that doesn’t convince you, consider how creating multiple variations for the same ad also broadens your reach. Some segments of your target audience might be more inclined to click on an ad with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/08/positive-vs-negative-ads">a more negative tone</a><span lang="EN">, offering a solution to a problem, and some might be more interested in a positive tone that highlights an opportunity. </span></span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="10ece180-e46a-4650-98e9-543b7a0ce33b" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">But what kind of emotional ad will appeal the most to your target audience? The only way to find out: Make. Multiple. Variations. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">When you’re writing a few different variations for the same ad group, it’s easy to run out of thesaurus suggestions for your wording. Rather than using a bunch of synonyms in your ad varying efforts, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/20/ppc-ad-copy">focus more on the tone of your messaging</a><span lang="EN">. For example, you could write two ads with a positive tone, and two with a more negative tone. One of each could include a question in the headline, and the others could be more statement-driven. Here’s an example of creating different variations for the same ad:</span></span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="c3e37867-c720-4268-9112-c671270ff9c7" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Notice how they’re all being written for the same AdWords Grader campaign, but using a slightly different messaging and tone. The first and third variations are focused more on appealing to the people searching for guidance on the new platform. They identify a pain point for searchers, and offer support and solutions to those problems that may prompt them to click on the ad. The second and fourth variations are geared towards those who are less emotionally engaged with the AdWords changes, but may still be searching for guidance. The slight variations in wording, perspective, and tone broaden your message and help your ad appeal to the largest and most favorable audience possible.</span></p>

<p><span></div></div></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">No matter how blocked you may feel in the creative process, do your best to tackle one ad group at a time. It gets complicated when you jump back and forth between ad groups, and it can also hurt the fluidity of your messaging. If you’re feeling particularly blocked, skipping the descriptions and working on other ad groups is the way to go. You’ll have to refresh your memory when you go back later to write them, but it won’t mess with the flow of your headlines, which are probably the most important parts of your ads. </span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">4. Open all the landing pages your ad will direct clicks to</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">While you’re writing your ads, have <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/10/high-converting-landing-pages">the landing pages they’ll direct people to</a><span lang="EN"> from the SERPs open in front of you. You might be thinking, “I know everything on the landing page and what it means, I wrote it,” but I’m still recommending it. </span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">When you’re <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/03/copywriting-examples">writing ad copy</a> at scale, sometimes all the ad groups mush together in your brain and you start losing the connection between the ad and the specific page it’s bringing people to. With the landing page open, not only do you avoid writing landing page copy that’s irrelevant to the matching ad, but it can help you ensure that the people clicking on the ad know what they’re being directed to, which helps you avoid high bounce rates, low CTR, and brief page visits. Focus on making the customer’s journey from the ad to the landing page as seamless and fluid as possible within the messaging.  </span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">5. Even while diversifying voice, keep your message consistent</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Ok, now that you’re all set up and organized in writing your ad copy, let’s talk about the <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSContentDLCopywritingToolkit.html?camplink=InContentCTA">technicalities within the actual messaging</a><span lang="EN">. Remember what I said about diversifying your message across variations of the same ad group? Varying with positive/negative tones is good advice, but <span lang="EN">let&#8217;s talk about some alternative ideas to test your ad copy.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">If you haven’t already, you should have come across some common <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points">pain points</a><span lang="EN"> for your target market when you were doing your research on keywords, search queries, and customer personas. What is it about your business that improves the lives of your customers? What do you offer to fix, or make easier/more efficient for your customers? </span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Your value proposition should be highlighted one way or another throughout your ad copy. Put yourself in your customers’ shoes (yes, I said it again) and focus on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/21/features-vs-benefits">emphasizing the benefits</a><span lang="EN"> your business provides them with over the features of your product. Speak to, and offer solutions for, your market’s most common pain points. For example, at WordStream, we’re offering customers the optimization of their online advertising with superior, easy to use software and expert guidance (humble brag). Instead of all of our ads saying “Our Software Can Grade Your Google Ads Account,” they’ll say things like “More Leads for Your Business.” That’s the true end benefit. To make your ads stand out, mirror the customer’s ultimate goal in your copy.</span></span></p>

<h2><span lang="EN">6. Test till you drop</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">The value of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/06/16/ab-testing-tips">regularly running A/B tests</a><span lang="EN"> on your PPC ads is impossible to overlook. You can monitor the engagement of one version of an ad directly against another, and gain real, actionable insight into writing more successful ads. </span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Try testing different CTA’s, tones, wording, verbs, numbers in headlines, questions, capitalization of certain letters; the limit does not exist! I know sometimes it’s hard to imagine that little tweaks in the wording would make any significant difference in engagement, but they really can.</span></p>

</div>
<p><span lang="EN">In the end, there are no rules here; <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/13/adwords-ad-variations">test whatever you think is worth testing</a><span lang="EN">. By regularly testing them as they roll out for your campaigns, you’ll be able to constantly improve the success of your ads. It’s as simple as:</span></span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The Megaphone of Mainstreet's SCORE 2018 report on women-owned businesses provides us with the data to debunk some vastly outdated myths surrounding women's role as entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/05/women-in-business">5 Myths about Women in Business (Debunked)</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, a lot of common misconceptions surrounding women’s place (and capacity for success) in business still exist today.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Luckily for us, when it comes to myths, common misconceptions, stereotypes, you name it, <a href="https://www.score.org/resource/megaphone-main-street-women-entrepreneurs">SCORE’s spring 2018 “The Megaphone of Main Street”</a> data report on women-owned businesses is here to set the record straight.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After checking the report out, we decided to dive deep into the points we hear most frequently, the ones most of us have been conditioned to accept as fact, and provide you with data and real-life examples to rewrite the narrative.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here’s the short list:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Men are more likely to start their own business</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Women-owned businesses are mostly “lifestyle” businesses</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Men-owned businesses produce more revenue</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Women-owned and men-owned businesses face the same level of difficulty in acquiring financing</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Men-owned businesses feel more confident in the success of their business</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">With that, let’s kick these myths to the curb and recognize the tools and traits <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/12/15/controversial-answers-to-common-startup-questions-dharmesh-shah">successful entrepreneurs</a> actually possess.</p>
<p dir="ltr">(Hint: you won’t find gender on the list.)</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">MYTH: Entrepreneurs are virtually all men, because men are more likely to start their own business</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Nope! According to the Megaphone of Main Street, women are more likely than men to start a business, with 47% of women vs 44% of men poled answering yes to starting a business in the last year. And this number’s on the rise, increasing by 45% in the last 10 years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let’s take look at how this translates to real life. Here’s a (very) short list of companies you might’ve heard of with some badass women at the helm:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">IBM, Ginni Rometty</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">PepsiCo, Indra Nooyi</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Oracle, Safra Catz</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">General Motors, Mary Barra</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Lockheed Martin, Marillyn Hewson</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Women make up 38% of the 28 million <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/07/15/adwords-small-business-strategy-guide">small businesses</a> operating within the United States, and employ nearly 9 million people, all the while generating $1.6 trillion in revenues. So, mark this one as debunked. Not only are women making up more than a third of small businesses, they’ve proven to be even more likely to start their own in the first place.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">MYTH: Women-owned businesses are mostly “lifestyle” businesses</h2>
<p dir="ltr">No, not at all.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lifestyle businesses are businesses run for the purpose of sustaining a certain level of income and no more, with little focus on growth or revenue success. Lifestyle businesses are great and all, but it would seem as though the 62% of women entrepreneurs that depend on their business as their primary source of income would disagree with this one.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Women are also more likely than men to start businesses in the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/03/10/healthcare-marketing">healthcare</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/08/04/higher-education-marketing">education industries</a>, and 19% of women-owned businesses operate in the service industry, compared to the 15% of men-owned businesses that do.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you don’t live under a rock, you’ve most likely heard of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/24/best-instagram-marketing-campaigns">Orangetheory</a>, known for its high-intensity workouts crafted with a mix of cardio, endurance, and strength training. Its CEO, Ellen Latham, founded the business in 2010 and topped 2017 as Forbes’ fastest growing women-owned business with $451 million in sales and 700 franchises nationwide.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Orangetheory’s certainly not the only example, but I could honestly go on forever. We’ll save my time and yours with this infographic that shows the percentage breakdown of women-owned businesses in some major industries.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="518d78bd-1420-4e6c-bd81-39572493a43d" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">Let’s go ahead and correct that to, “women-owned businesses operate in whatever industry they damn well please.”</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">MYTH: Men-owned businesses produce more revenue</h2>
<p dir="ltr">15.5% of both men-owned and women-owned businesses predicted static revenues in 2018, and 9.5% of men-owned predict a decrease in revenue, vs the 9% prediction from women-owned.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here’s another handy infographic focusing on the incredible impact women-owned businesses have had on the economy. With an annual revenue of $1.3 trillion, it’s safe to say women-owned businesses aren’t just surviving when it comes to revenue production, but they’re cashing in, big time.</p>

<p dir="ltr">It’s undeniable that women-owned businesses are producing results, so we’re thinking you’ll have a similar reaction to this next one as we did.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">MYTH: Men that own businesses feel more confident in the success of their business</h2>
<p dir="ltr">As previously mentioned, there’s really no difference in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/12/14/new-success-reports">reported success</a> between men-owned and women-owned businesses. Of the entrepreneurs that participated in the study, 33% of the men and 34% of the women reported that their business was struggling (we’re all in this together!), and 32% of both men and women reported that their businesses are maintaining their current size. 28% of men and 29% of women reported that their business is expanding in size and revenue, and 7% of men vs 5% of women reported aggressive expansion.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">MYTH: Women-owned and men-owned businesses face the same level of difficulty in acquiring financing</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Not even close, but it stinks to have to disprove this one. Unfortunately, the financing of ventures is where the real gender disparity lies is the business world. So much so, that a 2014 Senate study found that despite making up 38% of all small businesses, only 4% of all small business loans go to women.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a result, men are more likely than women to seek financing for their business in the first place (34% compared to 25%), and the women that do are still less likely to succeed in acquiring the financing their business needs to grow (38% compared to 31%). In order for the amount of women-owned businesses to continue to increase every year, this number has to start to change.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But how do we fuel that change? What a lovely way to Segway into the real difference-maker for success in business…</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The Power of Mentorship</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The results of the study are hard to ignore; entrepreneurs with access to a mentor are 5 times more likely to start a business than those without access to one, and women entrepreneurs, specifically, find greater success, regardless of the gender of their mentor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The truth is in the numbers: 87% of businesses owned by entrepreneurs with access to a mentor are still in business after one year, compared to 75% of those without.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The relationship between a male mentor with a female business owner reported the same satisfaction level regarding helpfulness, open-minded listening, respect, and relevant advice. Suffice it to say, business-owners benefit from the experiential wisdom of those who have previously lived through the woes of starting and running their own businesses, and gender has proven to deserve no place in the conversation. Rather, respect and competence are cited as the most relevant factors driving the success of a mentor-mentee relationship.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With the number of women entrepreneurs increasing every year, and considering the challenges women-owned businesses still face in their financing efforts, mentorship for women-owned businesses is a must. However, the role of mentorship is not only vital to the continued presence and success of women-owned business, but the future of business entirely.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you still believe any of these myths, there’s really only one thing left to say: Scoreboard.</p>
