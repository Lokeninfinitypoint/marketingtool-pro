<h2><span>How to use these holiday email templates</span></h2>
<p>This post contains both the copy and creative you can use for your holiday customer appreciation emails. These emails are longer and more personalized—great for your most loyal customers or for businesses with a small client base. If you want shorter, more general copy, head on over to my <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/28/christmas-holiday-greetings-wishes">holiday greetings and messages</a>.</p>
<p>The copy is written below and also pasted into the templates in Canva, which you can access with a free Canva account! <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAFS6Zdax_I/xHDp77z3_8atpm-JFddOQA/view?utm_content=DAFS6Zdax_I&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=publishsharelink&amp;mode=preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here&#8217;s the link to the templates in Canva</a>.</p>

<h2><span>Holiday customer appreciation email tips</span></h2>
<p><span>In such a short piece of content as this, small details have big effects. Here&#8217;s how to get it right.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><span>Keep it short and use a conversational tone. This is an e-toast, not a live journal.</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Be warm and positive, but not overly hyped. The holidays can be difficult for many people. </span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Make it visual with some graphics or a team photo.</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Share your growth and achievements to give customers a reason to stay confident in your business.</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Make it about them. The growth you achieved with their support. Express gratitude!</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Connect it back to your mission. Not your value prop.</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Focus on the future. Speak to an ongoing relationship, but not through a CTA or sales promotion. You can (and should!), however, incorporate CTAs into a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/08/year-in-review-email-examples">year-in-review email.</a></span></li>

<h2>Words &amp; phrases to make your holiday email message authentic</h2>
<p>Take a gander through these <a href="/blog/ws/2021/01/13/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing">words and phrases </a>you can use that the other gajillion businesses out there aren&#8217;t using:</p>
<h3>Instead of &#8220;valued customer&#8221;</h3>
<p>Don’t call them valued, make them FEEL valued through your messaging.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dear customers</li>
<li>To our awesome customers</li>
<li>To our customers near and far, old and new</li>
<li>To all of you</li>
<li>To each and every one of you</li>
<li>To the Baker &amp; Co. family</li>
<li>To the SparkLife community</li>
<li>To you and your families</li>
<li>Dear customers, partners, and your families</li>
<li>Friends</li>
<li>First name (if you have a small list and can MANUALLY do it).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instead of &#8220;exciting year&#8221;</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s been a&#8230;</p>

<li>Bright</li>
<li>Spirited</li>
<li>Rousing</li>
<li>Rigorous</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8230;.year!</p>
<h3>Instead of &#8220;As we approach&#8230;&#8221;</h3>
<p>Any &#8220;as we.&#8221; As we approach, enter, wind down, you know them all. How about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every year, I/we</li>
<li>If you’re like us, you are&#8230;</li>
<li>As the saying goes&#8230;</li>
<li>One of my favorite quotes is</li>
<li>Ask a question</li>
<li>Whether this email finds you ___ing, ____ing, or ___ing, we hope it finds you well!</li>
<li>As I sit here listening to [unique/meaningful/inclusive song name]</li>

<li>As I write this email, I’m watching the snow falling outside my window for the first time this year.</li>
<li>As it turns out&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instead of &#8220;take this opportunity to&#8230;&#8221;</h3>
<p>Take THIS opportunity to  remove yourselves from the mileu by using phrases like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Words can&#8217;t describe our&#8230;</li>
<li>We&#8217;re reaching out to say&#8230;</li>
<li>We want you to know that&#8230;</li>
<li>We extend our deepest&#8230;</li>
<li>It is with pride and joy that we&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instead of &#8220;thank you for your support&#8221;</h3>
<p>Nothing wrong with this statement, but make it better with specifics.</p>
<p>Thank you for&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Trusting us with your ____</li>
<li>Using ____ for your ____ needs.</li>
