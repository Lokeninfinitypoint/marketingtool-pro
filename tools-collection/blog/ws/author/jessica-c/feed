										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a small business owner, your ability to understand and connect with your target audience is paramount. In fact, your success hinges on it!</p>
<p>By identifying your ideal customers&#8217; needs, motivations, and pain points, you can gain insight into them on a deeper level and develop compelling messaging that resonates and drives results. This is where buyer personas come in.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buyer-persona-matrix.webp" alt="buyer persona matrix" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74384" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buyer-persona-matrix.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buyer-persona-matrix-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In this article, we&#8217;re sharing five helpful buyer persona examples along with everything you need to know to build your own, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The definition of a buyer persona</li>
<li>Why creating these detailed profiles is important for your business</li>
<li>Steps to create buyer personas</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s dive in!</p>
<h2>What is a buyer persona?</h2>
<p>A buyer persona is a fictional representation of your ideal customers that helps you and your team better visualize and communicate to your target audience.</p>
<p>Imagine you are the owner of a small plant container business. Perhaps there are three typical types of customers you currently have or target in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/26/marketing-channels">marketing</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Individuals looking for seasonal plant styling for their homes.</li>
<li>Local businesses that need plants for their shops and offices.</li>
<li>People who gift plants for special occasions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, for each of these, imagine you combine all the most common qualities into one fictional person representing that ideal customer. This generalized description is what we call a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/23/buyer-personas">buyer persona</a>. While the persona is fictional, the detailed profile is based on everything we know about our current and future customers.</p>
<p>Based on data and research, a buyer persona typically includes but is not limited to the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demographic information: Age, location, education, occupation, income, etc.</li>
<li>Psychographic information: Values, interests, lifestyle, etc.</li>
<li>Behavioral information: Goals, pain points, shopping habits, decision-making process, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why create buyer personas for your business?</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve covered what buyer personas are, let’s look at why developing them is a crucial step for your business.</p>
<p>Buyer personas are essential for several reasons:</p>
<h3>More effective marketing</h3>
<p>As a small business, you are likely always looking to attract new customers. Buyer personas will provide the information needed to craft persuasive campaigns more likely to convert your prospects into long-term customers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/personalized-marketing-effectiveness-stat.jpg" alt="stat that shows the importance of personalized marketing messages" width="936" height="346" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74390" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/personalized-marketing-effectiveness-stat.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/personalized-marketing-effectiveness-stat-480x177.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Enhanced sales performance</h3>
<p>Buyer personas are an excellent <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/09/b2b-sales-strategies">sales enablement tool</a> that will allow your sales representatives to visualize who your customers are and better understand them. These profiles will also provide them with data-driven background information to inform their messaging and discussions.</p>

<h3>Informed product development</h3>
<p>As you and your team use buyer personas in your sales and marketing efforts, the unique <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/types-of-customer-needs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">needs of your customers</a> will become clear. You will then be able to pivot to focus your time on the most important and lucrative segments of your business, including opportunities for product development as well as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/20/product-positioning">product positioning</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buyer-persona-example-benefits-farmers-dog.webp" alt="buyer persona example benefit - farmers dog search ad" width="936" height="554" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74391" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buyer-persona-example-benefits-farmers-dog.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/buyer-persona-example-benefits-farmers-dog-480x284.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For example, this <a href="https://localiq.com/products/search-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search ad</a> for The Farmer&#8217;s Dog suggests a product that&#8217;s geared toward pet owners who are cautious about what they feed their dog and are looking for &#8220;human-grade&#8221; food.</p>
<h3>Improved customer retention</h3>
<p>Your customers’ experience is of the utmost importance. Using buyer personas, you can better <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">personalize your sales and marketing efforts</a> to delight your customers and keep them loyal to your business.</p>
<p>As you can see, creating buyer personas is critical for all aspects of your small business.</p>
<h2>How to create buyer personas</h2>
<p>Developing buyer personas for your small business can be simple. Follow these steps to get started.</p>
<h3>Gather data</h3>
<p>Gather demographic, psychographic, and behavioral data on your current customers and prospects. Helpful resources for this process could be historical or new <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-feedback-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer surveys</a>, intel from your sales team, <a href="https://localiq.com/products/marketing-dashboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analytics</a> (website, <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/local-social-media-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media followers</a>, etc.), and any information you can glean from your competitors’ customer base (completing a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/12/20/swot-analysis">SWOT analysis</a> might be helpful here!).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/facebook-audience-insights-example-demographics.jpg" alt="facebook audience insights demographics for buyer persona example" width="563" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74388" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/facebook-audience-insights-example-demographics.jpg 563w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/facebook-audience-insights-example-demographics-480x512.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 563px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> This will likely be the most time-consuming step in the process, but conducting thorough research is essential to creating helpful buyer personas.</p>
<h3>Find similarities</h3>
<p>Review your gathered data, identify patterns and commonalities, and organize into customer groups. For example, you may discover that many customers who purchase your plants as gifts are young professionals who prioritize convenience and price. This would be one of your key <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/21/customer-journey-mapping">customer groups</a>.</p>
<h3>Build buyer personas</h3>
<p>Develop detailed fictional characters to represent each customer group you created. For these profiles, the more details you can include, the better! You want the personas to be as realistic as possible to make them memorable for your sales and marketing teams.</p>
<p>Give them ages, hobbies, goals, challenges, and even a stock image of their appearance! When brainstorming names for your personas, consider using alliteration so your team can quickly recall them in their day-to-day work.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/munro-buyer-persona-example.jpg" alt="example of a visual buyer persona from munro" width="751" height="597" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71248" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/munro-buyer-persona-example.jpg 751w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/munro-buyer-persona-example-480x382.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 751px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use these details to quickly build a persona like the one above with a </span><a href="https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">free dedicated buyer persona builder from HubSpot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h3>Refine and update regularly</h3>
<p>The key to effective buyer personas? Keeping them up-to-date! The last thing you want to do is spend all the time researching and creating these detailed profiles, only for them to be obsolete a few months later. Regularly modify your profiles as your business evolves and your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audiences</a> shift. Scheduling these updates (e.g., once per quarter) will help ensure you keep the personas relevant and helpful for your team.</p>
<p>Investing time into developing accurate and memorable buyer personas can increase <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/09/lower-customer-acquisition-cost">customer acquisition</a> and loyalty, impacting your bottom line. So the effort you put forth will benefit your business in the long run.</p>

<h2>How to use TikTok hashtags</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s super simple to use TikTok hashtags. They work just the same as Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter. To create a TikTok hashtag, you type the pound/hash sign (#) followed by whatever you&#8217;d like your hashtag to be. #likethis</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tiktok-hashtags-how-to-add-a-hashtag-to-tiktok.jpg" alt="tiktok hashtags - screenshot of how to add a hashtag to a tiktok video " width="359" height="550" class="aligncenter wp-image-71019 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tiktok-hashtags-how-to-add-a-hashtag-to-tiktok.jpg 359w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tiktok-hashtags-how-to-add-a-hashtag-to-tiktok-196x300.jpg 196w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px" /></p>

<h2>TikTok hashtag tips</h2>
<p>Use these best practices to guide your TikTok hashtags strategy.</p>
<h3>Keep your TikTok hashtags relevant to your business</h3>
<p>Choose hashtags that complement the topic of your video content or campaign. While it can be tempting to jump for the most popular TikTok hashtags, you want your videos to be effective at reaching your unique <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-brainstorm-business-ideas">business goals</a>.</p>
<p>Use hashtags that connect to the content within your video as well as your business. This helps keep your brand looking more authentic rather than like you&#8217;re trying too hard to hop on the latest <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/tiktok-marketing-for-small-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok trend</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tiktok-hashtag-examples-dallas-aquarium.jpg" alt="tiktok examples from dallas world aquarium tiktok post" width="298" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71022" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tiktok-hashtag-examples-dallas-aquarium.jpg 298w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tiktok-hashtag-examples-dallas-aquarium-149x300.jpg 149w" sizes="(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px" /></p>

<h3>Try not to use<em> too many</em> hashtags</h3>
<p>Avoid cluttering your caption with too many hashtags (stick to 3-5 maximum). You have a limited amount of space for your TikTok caption (100 characters), so use it wisely with a curated list of hashtags. You want your TikTok videos to find the right audience, so focus on using the ones that will most likely resonate with them.</p>
<h3>Use the right combination</h3>
<p>Pair broad, popular, or trending hashtags with niche and branded hashtags for a better chance of reaching a more targeted audience (hint: popular does not always equal higher reach). That way, your TikTok hashtag strategy will strike a balance between increasing reach and relevancy.</p>

<p>Now that you have some basic best practices, let&#8217;s get into the hashtags to use in your posts!</p>
<h2>Best TikTok hashtags</h2>
<p>We know time is a precious commodity for your small business, and hashtag research likely isn’t at the top of your to-do list. That’s why we’ve compiled our recommendations for hashtags or types of hashtags that will get the attention of your customers and prospects.</p>
<div id="smallbusiness"></div>
<h3>Small business TikTok hashtags</h3>
<p>These hashtags are specifically designed to promote small businesses, which can be a powerful tool when competing with larger companies. While these are very broad hashtags, there are likely a handful of hashtags that businesses in your community use to reach the local population.</p>
<p>Check out community and business accounts in your area to see which hashtags they use regularly, and experiment to see if these help you reach your target audience. Additionally, using these hashtags can help you build relationships with other local business owners who may be willing to collaborate on future marketing initiatives.</p>
<p>These “shop small” and “local” hashtags can also attract customers passionate about supporting small and locally-owned businesses.</p>
<p>By using these hashtags that reference shopping small and supporting a person’s business instead of a faceless big-name brand, you are also <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2019/11/04/emotion-the-super-weapon-of-marketing-and-advertising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tapping into your customers’ emotions to persuade their decision-making</a>.</p>

<h3>Hashtags to get you on the FYP</h3>
<p>The “For You Page” (aka FYP) is TikTok’s algorithm-driven feed that serves up content to users based on their viewing history and interactions on the app. The FYP is the first feature users see when opening the app, so exposure on this feed is incredibly valuable.</p>
<p>By using “for you page” hashtags, businesses can potentially increase the likelihood of their content appearing on the FYP, reaching users that may otherwise not come across their small business account. While TikTok has never officially stated that using these hashtags will land your content on the FYP, many brands have seen success with this strategy.</p>
<p>Our recommendation? While there is no guarantee using these hashtags will get your content on the FYP, increasing your reach on the app is worth a shot. That said, if you are choosing between an FYP hashtag or a niche hashtag that is more tailored to your brand, stick to your niche!</p>
<p>There are a few TikTok hashtags that can help you get on the FYP, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>#ForYouPage</li>
<li>#ForYou</li>
<li>#FYP</li>
<li>#Explore</li>
<li>#Discover</li>
<li>#new</li>
