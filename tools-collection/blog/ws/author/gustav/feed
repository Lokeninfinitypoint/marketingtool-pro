										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years, the unwritten pact between you and search engines was simple: You publish useful content. Google sends you strangers. Some of them become customers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that pact is breaking up now.</p>
<p>Today, we’ll cover the realities of web traffic and share surefire ways to mitigate the impact of lower traffic, so you can continue to reach your most important goals.</p>

<div id="the-current-state-of-web-traffic"></div>
<h2>Website traffic is decreasing: Why?</h2>
<p>Today, more of your potential visitors are stopping short. They are getting their answers from an AI-generated paragraph, a Google AI Overview, or a Perplexity card, without ever touching your site.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ai-overviews-example-overview-screen.webp" alt="google ai overviews - screenshare" width="806" height="373" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92053" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ai-overviews-example-overview-screen.webp 806w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ai-overviews-example-overview-screen-480x222.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 806px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It’s not a blip. It’s systemic:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.similarweb.com/blog/marketing/seo/zero-click-searches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Over 65%</strong></a> of AI answers never link back to their sources.</li>
<li>Informational clicks are <a href="https://nonprofitnewsfeed.com/resource/new-search-data-show-why-nonprofit-traffic-is-screwed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>down 18–30%</strong></a> across multiple industries.</li>
<li>Zero-click searches now account for <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-search-zero-click-study-2024-443869" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>more than 60%</strong></a> of queries (and that number is still climbing).</li>
</ul>
<p>But here’s the thing most “<a href="https://searchengineland.com/if-ai-killed-your-seo-strategy-you-didnt-have-one-455946" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI is killing SEO</a>” takes miss: the traffic disappearing fastest isn’t your most valuable traffic. It’s the top-of-funnel, low-intent visitors; the ones looking for definitions, generic comparisons, and quick fixes.</p>
<p>The clicks that drive revenue (the ones from people ready to buy, book, or sign up) are still there. The challenge now is to defend that ground, squeeze more value from every visit, and open new channels that AI can’t take away.</p>
<p>What follows is not a list of band-aid tips. It’s a <strong>strategic, field-tested playbook</strong> for replacing the low-intent traffic AI has taken, maximizing what remains, and building a pipeline that’s resilient no matter how search changes next.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f50e.png" alt="🔎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Need help understanding the modern rules for SEO?</strong> Download our free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/how-to-do-seo-right?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SEOstrategies_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links/">How to Do SEO Right—Right Now!</a></p>
<div id="how-to-get-more-out-of-the-traffic-you-still-have"></div>
<h2>How to get more out of the traffic you still have to hit your goals</h2>
<p>When acquisition gets harder, efficiency becomes the growth lever.</p>
<p>Every visitor now carries more weight because there are fewer of them—and the proportion arriving with genuine purchase intent is higher than it was in the “big top-of-funnel” days. If they click and you can’t convert them, you’ve wasted the most expensive part of the funnel.</p>
<p>The first step isn’t to replace lost visitors. It’s to <strong>audit the revenue path for the visitors you still have</strong> and extract every bit of value before you spend a dollar or an hour chasing new clicks.</p>
<h3>1. Run a conversion rate optimization (CRO) audit</h3>
<p>If traffic is harder to win, every visit has to work harder for you. That’s where CRO comes in. Doubling your conversion rate doesn’t just give you more leads; it means you can hit the same revenue with half the traffic. Yet too many businesses treat <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization-marketing">CRO</a> as a one-off project instead of an ongoing discipline.</p>
<p>The stakes are higher now. As AI eats into low-intent clicks, the visitors who do make it to your site are more likely to be ready to buy. If your page loads slowly, your layout confuses them, or your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/09/call-to-action">CTAs</a> aren’t clear, you’re wasting the most valuable traffic you have—and replacing those lost conversions costs far more than fixing them.</p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p><a href="https://convertica.org/ecommerce-case-study-36-increase-in-revenue-per-visitor-on-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Convertica</a> published a case study on a supplement ecommerce brand that redesigned its mobile product table into a slider to reduce endless scrolling. That one change lifted order completions by 43.9% and increased revenue per visitor on mobile by 36%, with results statistically significant at a 98% confidence level.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/landing-page-cro-example.webp" alt="example of landing page mock up from convertica to increase conversion rate" width="452" height="850" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94236" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/landing-page-cro-example.webp 452w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/landing-page-cro-example-160x300.webp 160w" sizes="(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A mock-up of the landing page tweaks Convertica made to increase conversion rate.</em></p>
<p>Tom Winter, CGO &amp; Co-Founder of <a href="https://seowind.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEOwind</a>, has seen similar gains from small tweaks: <em>“Adding one dead-simple intent question to our signup form boosted completion rates by over 35%. Once users started, they felt invested in finishing. That tiny psychological nudge made all the difference.”</em></p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Don’t focus only on aesthetics&#8211;a new button color here, a fresh font there&#8211;without tackling the friction that’s actually costing you sales. A systematic CRO routine, especially on mobile, is what keeps the pipeline healthy.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use tools like Hotjar, Microsoft Clarity, or FullStory to identify where users scroll, linger, or drop off.</li>
<li>Audit mobile load speeds and resolve performance bottlenecks.</li>
<li>Test CTA placement, visual weight, and copy clarity.</li>
<li>Reduce required form fields based on submission data.</li>
<li>Make CRO reviews a monthly routine rather than an annual project.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Turn blog posts into lead magnets</h3>
<p>AI can summarize your posts, but it can’t give readers your unique resources. That’s where <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/15/lead-magnet-ideas">blog-specific lead magnets</a> shine. When the download or template is directly tied to the article’s topic, you’re meeting the reader at their exact moment of intent and pulling them deeper into your funnel.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/blog-lead-magnet-example.webp" alt="blog lead magnet example from lawn care company" width="900" height="703" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94238" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/blog-lead-magnet-example.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/blog-lead-magnet-example-480x375.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.getsunday.com/shed/lawn/how-to-start-caring-for-your-lawn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This blog post</a> about caring for your lawn and finding a custom plan is accompanied by a form to get a custom plan.</em></p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamara-omerovic-058775200/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tamara Omerovic</a>, Marketing Consultant at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/get-marketing-advice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marketing Advice</a> agency, has seen this play out firsthand: <em>“At Databox, we published articles teaching users how to build complex dashboards. After explaining the process, we offered a free, pre-built template. Because it solved the exact problem readers had, it converted exceptionally well.”</em></p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Offering the same generic lead magnet site-wide. A vague “join our newsletter” box doesn’t feel like a logical next step—it feels like a distraction. A better approach is to treat every high-traffic article as its own conversion opportunity and match the offer precisely to what the reader needs next.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<p>Start with your top 20 posts. Ask yourself: <strong>what tool, template, or shortcut would help readers take action on the advice they just read? </strong>Build that resource, place it right in the article, and test different placements and headlines to see what drives the most signups.</p>
<h3>3. Install exit-intent offers and popups</h3>
<p>As overall traffic drops, capturing email or interest from departing visitors becomes essential for maintaining the pipeline. An <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/22/popup-examples">exit-intent popup</a> is your final chance to engage visitors who are about to leave. It can turn a loss into a lead or even a sale.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/exit-intent-pop-up-example-madewell.webp" alt="exit intent popup example from madewell" width="900" height="542" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94239" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/exit-intent-pop-up-example-madewell.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/exit-intent-pop-up-example-madewell-480x289.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.madewell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p>Wisepops reports that the top-performing exit-intent popups (the top 10%) achieve conversion rates as high as <a href="https://wisepops.com/blog/exit-popup-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19.6%</a>, while the average exit-intent popup still converts about 2.9% of abandoning visitors into customers or subscribers.</p>
<p>But numbers only tell half the story. As <a href="https://oskarduberg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oskar Duberg</a>, a freelance content specialist, points out, “Exit popups don’t have to be digital guilt trips. I’ve always treated them like a friendly concierge: ‘Before you go, here’s something that might help.’ Done well, they catch fence-sitters in a helpful way and lift conversions without leaving a sour taste.”</p>
<p>The takeaway: The framing of the offer matters as much as the trigger itself. Treat the pop-up as helpful guidance, not a desperate grab for attention.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Test exit offers with real value (discount, resource, free trial).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/personalized-marketing">Personalize</a> based on user behavior (e.g., cart abandoners vs. blog readers).</li>
<li>Exclude logged-in users or recent customers to avoid friction.</li>
<li>Keep copy conversational and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/21/features-vs-benefits">benefit-driven</a> instead of pushy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Use dynamic CTAs based on user intent</h3>
<p>If you’ve lost some top-of-funnel visitors, the traffic you still get is more varied—and more precious. Serving each segment the next most logical step increases the odds they’ll take it.</p>
<p>A single static CTA assumes every visitor wants the same thing. They don’t. Dynamic CTAs adapt to who’s on your site and why they’re there, increasing relevance and clicks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/personalized-cta-examples-dentist.webp" alt="personalized cta examples dentist" width="835" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94240" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/personalized-cta-examples-dentist.webp 835w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/personalized-cta-examples-dentist-480x460.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 835px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.turtlecreekdental.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This dentist</a> uses different CTAs depending on the intent of the section or page of their website.</em></p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p>HubSpot changes CTAs based on user history.</p>
<ul>
<li>Returning visitors who’ve downloaded a guide get invited to a webinar or trial.</li>
<li>First-time blog readers get offered free templates.</li>
<li>Product page visitors get a “Talk to Sales” option.</li>
</ul>
<p>This progression ensures the CTA is contextually relevant, reducing friction.</p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Over-personalizing without enough data. If your segments are too narrow or based on incomplete signals, you risk showing mismatched offers that confuse visitors.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use tools like RightMessage, ConvertFlow, or HubSpot Smart CTAs.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/04/customer-segmentation-models">Segment</a> by traffic source, page type, or previous activity.</li>
<li>Test different offers for each segment and measure CTR and conversion rate lift.</li>
</ul>
<p>You cannot win the low‑intent game against AI. Instead, focus your resources where humans still click: specific, nuanced, commercial searches. These keywords reflect real purchase signals and give you an opening that AI cannot easily replicate.</p>
<h3>5. Target long-tail, specific, purchase-ready keywords</h3>
<p>AI summaries dominate at broad levels. But when queries get specific, AI cannot easily generalize, and users often click through to compare nuanced options.</p>
<p>Think of “best CRM” as a wide net, and “best CRM for freelance designers with client portals” as a precision spear. Volume might be lower, but the value of each click is much higher because the searcher has a clear intent to convert.</p>
<p>“Everyone’s chasing head terms. I’m hunting for bottom-of-the-funnel searches with verbs like ‘compare,’ ‘best for X,’ or ‘vs.’ That’s where the wallet opens,” said Tom. “AI might answer the ‘what,’ but it struggles with the ‘which one should I buy?”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/long-tail-keywords-example-mattress-comparison.webp" alt="example of long tail high intent keyword targeting for mattress brands comparison" width="900" height="670" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94246" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/long-tail-keywords-example-mattress-comparison.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/long-tail-keywords-example-mattress-comparison-480x357.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>“To find high-intent keywords AI hasn’t saturated, I go straight to the voice of the customer on sales calls. Prospects don’t use broad marketing lingo; they describe specific <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points">pain points</a>. That’s how I discovered winning terms like ‘signs of a disgruntled employee’ for an employee monitoring software client,” Tamara said.</p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p><a href="https://alphametic.com/hubspots-seo-crash-ai-overviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpha­metic analyzed HubSpot’s steep SEO traffic loss</a> and concluded that optimizing transactional content—such as product pages and use-case–specific landing pages—is more profitable and stable than relying on blog content. That reflects the shift toward targeting high‑intent, bottom‑of‑funnel queries.<a href="https://www.hotjar.com/customers/the-good/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a></p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Treating long‑tail targeting as a one‑time effort. As AI representations evolve, niche phrases can quickly become competitive, so stay agile and keep updating.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use tools like Ahrefs or Semrush to discover specific, high-intent queries.</li>
<li>Look for terms with words like “buy,” “compare,” or “for [use case].”</li>
<li>Create one highly focused <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/landing-page-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">landing page</a> per target keyword.</li>
<li>Review performance quarterly to identify new opportunities or saturation.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Need help finding the right keywords to target?</strong> Try our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">Free Keyword Tool</a>!</p>
<h3>6. Update content to emphasize commercial intent</h3>
<p>AI can summarize basic information. However, when content provides clear pathways toward decision-making—features broken down, outcome-oriented comparisons, tangible tools—readers are more likely to click and convert.</p>
<p>If a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post">blog post</a> ranks but attracts the wrong type of reader, reframe it with mid- or bottom-of-funnel intent. Add tools, comparisons, concrete use cases, or interactive elements that guide readers from curiosity to action.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/commercial-intent-blog-example-real-estate-agent.webp" alt="commercial intent blog example from real estate agent" width="900" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94241" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/commercial-intent-blog-example-real-estate-agent.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/commercial-intent-blog-example-real-estate-agent-480x427.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.livingindallastx.com/top-5-real-estate-teams-in-the-dallas-texas-area" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This real estate agent</a> highlights the top five teams in the area (including his own) to help him win over new clients actively searching for real estate teams to work with. </em></p>
<h4>Real-world examples</h4>
<p>VenturePact, a software development service, tapped into a common audience question: “How much will an app cost?” By publishing an interactive cost calculator via Outgrow, they gave readers a direct, personalized answer. In two weeks, <strong>traffic rose <a href="https://outgrow.co/blog/interactive-case-study-venturepact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15%</a>, conversion rates jumped 28%, and the campaign generated more than 11,500 qualified leads.</strong></p>
<p>The same principle works on more traditional blog posts. Oskar shared that one of his clients had a DIY guide pulling heavy traffic but producing zero leads. By reframing the piece into “DIY strategies (and when to get expert help),” adding common pitfalls, and naturally positioning the service as the solution, the article began generating conversions. “Traffic dipped slightly, but leads doubled,” he explained.</p>
<p>Together, these cases show that content isn’t just about volume. It’s about intent. Even small structural shifts—like adding an interactive tool or reframing advice to highlight next steps—can transform high-traffic dead ends into steady lead sources.</p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Dropping product-focused CTAs into content that doesn’t address the reader’s next step. If the offer feels out of sync with the context, you lose trust instead of gaining leads.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/10/content-audit">Audit blog posts</a> that get high traffic but low conversions.</li>
<li>Identify activation opportunities: places where a calculator, comparison, or widget fits naturally.</li>
<li>Use tools like Outgrow to build simple, relevant interactive assets (estimators, checklists, ROI calculators).</li>
<li>Reframe advice-driven content to highlight when your product/service is the natural solution.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Build pages that solve complex problems</h3>
<p>AI is quick but lacks depth. Content that offers thorough, multi-step frameworks, deep analysis, or industry-specific recommendations still wins clicks—and converts.</p>
<p>Complex queries require context, nuance, and depth. AI is not there yet, and readers will click into content that truly solves their layered questions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/problem-solving-page-example-education.webp" alt="problem solving page example from education company" width="900" height="502" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94247" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/problem-solving-page-example-education.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/problem-solving-page-example-education-480x268.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>

<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p>Swiss Gear partnered with conversion agency The Good. By integrating Hotjar heatmaps and user journey data, they optimized their mobile navigation and improved revenue per visit on mobile by <a href="https://capturly.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">28%</a>, reduced bounce rate by 8%, and increased time-on-site by 84%.<a href="https://www.hotjar.com/customers/the-good/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a></p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Creating long content without clarity. Complexity without structure becomes noise, not value.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Choose problems that cannot be resolved in a few paragraphs.</li>
<li>Layer text with visuals, videos, interactive flows, or downloads.</li>
<li>Interlink to relevant product or service pages to capture intent.</li>

<h2>How to own more of your audience with retention channels</h2>
<p>When low-intent traffic drains away, relying on discovery channels like search becomes a liability. The smartest marketers are shifting part of their focus from acquisition to ownership—building direct, durable connections with their audiences that no algorithm can sever.</p>
<h3>8. Double down on email marketing</h3>
<p>With <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/zero-click-searches">zero-click search</a> behavior on the rise, email gives you a direct, reliable line to your audience. It also lets you shape engagement into an ongoing experience rather than a one-off interaction.</p>
<p>Email is an owned channel that cannot be bypassed by AI. If someone is on your list, you control how and when they receive your content—without summaries, algorithm filters, or visibility risk.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-email-marketing-wordstream-true-classic.webp" alt="AI email marketing - email from True Classic" width="461" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93693" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-email-marketing-wordstream-true-classic.webp 461w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-email-marketing-wordstream-true-classic-231x300.webp 231w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px" /></p>
<h4>Real-world examples</h4>
<p>AirDNA used behavioral data synced with HubSpot to trigger targeted onboarding campaigns. The result: churn dropped by <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/case-studies/airdna" target="_blank" rel="noopener">45%</a> and onboarding completion rose 38%.</p>
<p>Oskar saw similar success by changing the <em>format</em> of email itself. “When search traffic dipped for a client, we launched a 5-day email mini-course. Each email was a short, punchy lesson, and open rates nearly doubled because people looked forward to the next one. It turned email from a broadcast into an event.”</p>
<p>Both cases show how <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/email-marketing-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email marketing campaigns</a> can carry more weight than just newsletters or promotions. Whether through behavioral triggers or serialized learning experiences, the key is to make emails feel relevant and worth anticipating.</p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Treating email as purely transactional. Over-promotion wears out subscribers quickly. Build value before you sell.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Audit opt-in points and make them visible in high-traffic areas.</li>
<li>Design email experiences (courses, serialized reports, themed content) instead of one-off blasts.</li>
<li>Use behavioral data to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-email-marketing">personalize campaigns</a> that reduce churn and improve activation.</li>
<li>Experiment with frequency and measure engagement closely before scaling.</li>
</ul>

<h3>9. Build a retargeting funnel</h3>
<p>As traffic volume falls, maximizing the value from existing visitors is critical. Few visitors convert on first touch. Retargeting creates follow-up paths to re-attract visitors who left without action.</p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p>While not tied to a single brand’s campaign, performance benchmarks from recent data show the effectiveness clearly: service-based businesses recover <a href="https://www.whatconverts.com/blog/retargeting-ad-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5–15%</a> of abandoned interactions and can cut abandonment by up to 26% using sequential messaging aligned to the funnel stage.<a href="https://www.whatconverts.com/blog/retargeting-ad-examples/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a></p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>One-size-fits-all messaging. A visitor who viewed pricing needs a different message than one who visited a blog post.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Build segmented audiences in ad platforms (e.g., users who visited pricing pages vs. blog content).</li>
<li>Create distinct messaging for each segment: reminder, social proof, then offer.</li>
<li>Use frequency caps to avoid ad fatigue.</li>
</ul>
<h3>10. Launch a free tool or calculator</h3>
<p>Tools don’t just drive traffic. They generate engagement, leads, and backlinks over time. Unlike static articles that AI can summarize away, interactive tools give users a reason to stay and return.</p>
<p>A lightweight tool offers interactive value that AI cannot replicate. It gets bookmarked, shared, and remembered.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/renovation-calculator-example.webp" alt="ai free tool example - renovation calculator" width="900" height="580" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94248" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/renovation-calculator-example.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/renovation-calculator-example-480x309.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This <a href="https://www.remodelum.com/renovation-cost-estimator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation calculator</a> helps homeowners budget their home projects.</em></p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p>BEMO, a cybersecurity partner for SMBs, embedded an Outgrow cost calculator into their Intercom chat widget. Instead of forcing every prospect to request a quote, the tool delivered instant custom pricing. The result: <a href="https://outgrow.co/blog/interactive-case-study-bemo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4 million in pipeline value, with an average deal size of $12,000</a>.</p>
<p>Tom highlights another key success factor: alignment. “Free tools work best when they’re tightly aligned with your core product. Otherwise, they grab attention but never translate into adoption. That’s why we built our E-E-A-T Score Checker—every use case led naturally back to our platform.”</p>
<p>The common thread is focus. BEMO’s calculator funneled prospects toward buying decisions, while SE Ranking’s checker funneled users into product adoption. Tools succeed when they shorten the path from curiosity to action.</p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Overbuilding. Chasing complexity slows you down. A simple MVP validates faster, and feedback shows where to improve.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pinpoint a calculation or estimate that your audience frequently seeks.</li>
<li>Build a lean version with a no-code platform like Outgrow.</li>
<li>Make it visible across the site, chatbot, email signatures, and social.</li>
<li>Tie the tool’s outputs directly to your product or service, so the next step is obvious.</li>
</ul>
<h3>11. Use SMS and push notifications for promotions</h3>
<p>As user attention fragments, a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/sms-marketing-examples">well-targeted text message or notification</a> bypasses email and search filters to deliver timely offers directly to the user’s device.</p>
<p>Mobile notifications deliver messages instantly to the user’s screen, bypassing search entirely. Their immediacy can drive rapid engagement.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sms-example-stratia-come-back-text-png.webp" alt="sms marketing example from stratia to come back" width="488" height="244" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89712" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sms-example-stratia-come-back-text-png.webp 488w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sms-example-stratia-come-back-text-480x240.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 488px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p>Nadine Merabi, a fashion brand, <a href="https://www.attentive.com/case-studies/nadine-merabi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched SMS marketing via Attentive in May 2024</a>. Their goal was to grow an engaged subscriber list and drive conversions with personalized, timely messages while respecting regulatory compliance.<a href="https://www.attentive.com/case-studies/nadine-merabi?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a></p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Over-messaging or poorly segmented messaging. These channels demand relevance; otherwise, they annoy instead of convert.</p>
<h4>Action Step</h4>
<ul>
<li>Offer a compelling opt-in—like early access or exclusive discounts.</li>
<li>Segment messages by behavior or geography for relevance.</li>
<li>Keep messages short, timely, and actionable.</li>
</ul>
<div id="how-to-diversify-your-acquisition-beyond-search"></div>
<h2>How to diversify your acquisition beyond search</h2>
<p>Relying solely on Google right now is like relying solely on organic Facebook reach in 2015—it works until it doesn’t. Expanding your acquisition mix not only offsets traffic losses but also exposes you to entirely new audiences.</p>
<h3>12. Use paid search to fill in the gaps</h3>
<p>While informational clicks are declining, commercial intent in paid search remains strong. With <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-audience-targeting">precise targeting</a>, you can “buy back” some of the high-value visitors you’ve lost.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-benchmarks-example-ads-on-serp.webp" alt="google ads benchmarks - example ad serp" width="800" height="379" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91526" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-benchmarks-example-ads-on-serp.webp 800w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-benchmarks-example-ads-on-serp-480x227.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p>SmartRecruiters ramped up its Google Ads campaigns with tighter optimizations and targeting. The result: a <a href="https://www.growthmarketingpro.com/case-study-smartrecruiters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">37x increase</a> in leads and an 89% reduction in CPA.</p>
<p>The lesson here is focus. Paid search only works when campaigns zero in on bottom-funnel intent. Tamara explains it bluntly: “Don’t waste budget trying to replace lost informational traffic. Paid search thrives when you target bottom-of-funnel queries that signal a clear intent to buy.”</p>
<p>That’s why SmartRecruiters’ wins weren’t about volume: they were about efficiency. They invested in the keywords closest to revenue, aligning ad copy and landing pages to the exact intent behind the search.</p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Throwing money at broad keywords to chase volume. This dilutes returns and often brings in visitors with no purchase intent.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use Google Ads Keyword Planner to identify bottom-funnel, high-conversion keywords.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-copy">Write ad copy</a> that mirrors the searcher’s specific intent.</li>
<li>Route traffic to landing pages tailored to that intent, not a generic homepage.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/08/google-ads-conversion-tracking-mistakes">Track conversions</a> closely and prune wasted spend aggressively.</li>
</ul>
<h3>13. Experiment with social ads and influencer seeding</h3>
<p>Platforms like TikTok act as discovery engines. Short-form video and influencer content allow you to reach new audiences—and drive traffic—without relying on Google.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-amicis-tiktok.webp" alt="Get found online - Amici's TikTok" width="937" height="594" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92306" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-amicis-tiktok.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-amicis-tiktok-480x304.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Real-world examples</h4>
<p>Natural skincare brand Naked and Thriving ran a campaign using Brandbassador to manage micro-influencers and crowd-generated content. In just a few months, they had <a href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/crazy-100000-investment-that-turned-into-a-multimillion-dollar-empire/news-story/849ae5a4c296df7173a99c0c576d037f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">350 ambassadors with a total reach of 8.68 million, delivering a 215 % ROI</a>.<a href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/crazy-100000-investment-that-turned-into-a-multimillion-dollar-empire/news-story/849ae5a4c296df7173a99c0c576d037f?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a></p>
<p>Beauty brand Naturium, originally built on “clean beauty,” pivoted to a more clinically backed positioning. Co-owner and influencer Susan Yara leaned into micro-influencers across TikTok, Reddit, and X—contributing to explosive growth, international reach, and nearly <a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/beauty/how-naturium-pivoted-from-clean-to-clinical-beauty-to-reach-dollar100m-in-sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$100 million in retail sales by 2023</a>.<a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/beauty/how-naturium-pivoted-from-clean-to-clinical-beauty-to-reach-dollar100m-in-sales?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> </a></p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Overinvesting in a single influencer without testing—you risk low ROI and a misfit audience. Instead, start small.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Deploy micro-influencer batches to test performance.</li>
<li>Boost top-performing content with <a href="https://localiq.com/products/social-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social ads</a>.</li>
<li>Track ROI with UTM links or unique promo codes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>14. Distribute content in non-Google channels</h3>
<p>Audiences are discovering content outside of Google in places like LinkedIn, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reddit-marketing">Reddit</a>, Quora, and niche communities. When people search for expertise instead of keywords, they often start on these platforms. Showing up there expands reach and builds credibility before they ever reach your site.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-reddit.webp" alt="Get found online -Reddit discussion.," width="762" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92304" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-reddit.webp 762w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/get-found-online-wordstream-reddit-480x378.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 762px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p>A CPA firm revitalized its marketing by syndicating blog posts, guides, and videos across multiple channels. The strategy generated 950 form submissions, increased organic traffic from about <a href="https://mike-hardy-thumbwind.medium.com/4-proven-flipboard-traffic-strategies-that-reduce-dependence-on-google-and-seo-drudgery-47a4043f1bb1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">300 to 2,000–3,000</a> visits per month, and delivered nearly $1 million in recurring revenue.</p>
<p>Tom explains how this works in practice: “For B2B SaaS and SEO, LinkedIn has been surprisingly effective. It’s not just distribution, it’s where credibility compounds. By the time prospects book a call, they’ve already seen our content, and half the selling is done.” His perspective shows the difference between blasting content everywhere and placing it where trust naturally builds.</p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Treating distribution as copy-paste. Dropping blog links into communities without adapting to each platform’s norms makes you look out of touch and gets ignored.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Select 2-3 channels where your audience is already active (LinkedIn for B2B, Reddit for niche verticals, Quora for problem-driven searches).</li>
<li>Rewrite content natively so it matches the platform’s style and expectations.</li>
<li>Use light-touch CTAs (profiles, signatures) rather than pushing links into every post.</li>
<li>Track engagement across channels to refine where credibility compounds fastest.</li>
</ul>
<h3>15. Publish on aggregator and syndication platforms</h3>
<p>Even high-quality content may never be discovered if it lives solely on your site. <a href="https://revnew.com/blog/top-content-syndication-vendors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syndication on platforms</a> with massive distribution can significantly amplify reach—especially when AI systems tap those platforms prominently.</p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-media-trends-37509e40-f215-11ef-b600-130450024a29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dow Jones expanded its content reach by syndicating to over 5,000 partners through its Factiva platform</a>. This AI-aligned distribution ensures trusted content is surfaced in Smart Summary outputs, improving visibility and use in AI-driven search and enterprise queries.</p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Syndicating without proper canonical links, attribution, or strategic alignment can diminish SEO value and reduce your content’s credibility.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Identify reputable syndication platforms or marketplaces (like Factiva or niche vertical aggregators).</li>
<li>Ensure your content is properly attributed back to your site (via canonical tags or byline links).</li>
<li>Tailor content formats to fit syndication needs—briefs, summaries, or multimedia-rich snippets.</li>
<li>Use tracking parameters to monitor <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/11/29/referral-traffic">referral traffic</a> from syndicated placements.</li>
<li>Leverage AI sourcing—content available on trusted platforms is more likely to be included in AI summaries and outputs.</li>
</ul>
<div id="how-to-adjust-your-content-strategy-for-the-ai-age"></div>
<h2>How to adjust your content strategy for the AI age</h2>
<p>If AI can summarize your content without a reason to click, you need to give it—and human readers—something it can’t replicate.</p>
<h3>16. Create “AI-resistant” content</h3>
<p>Generic, derivative content is what AI handles best. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-differentiate-content">Proprietary data, original frameworks, and first-hand insights</a> are much harder to scrape and summarize. Tamara puts it simply: “The most defensible content is original research backed by proprietary data. AI is a synthesizer; it can’t create new information. That’s your competitive moat.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-survey-1.webp" alt="" width="936" height="523" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91825" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-survey-1.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/differentiate-content-wordstream-survey-1-480x268.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.contentconnect.site/blog/state-of-ai-in-content-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h4>Real-world example:</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/mar/06/bbc-news-ai-artificial-intelligence-department-personalised-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BBC News launched a Growth, Innovation, and AI department in early 2025</a> with a focus on producing hyper-personalized and uniquely valuable content for under-25 audiences. By prioritizing bespoke insights instead of clickbait or generic pieces, they created material that is distinct and much harder for AI aggregators to replicate.</p>
<p>The principle applies to any business. If you create content that originates from your own data, your customers’ experiences, or your team’s perspectives, AI cannot replicate it. That uniqueness becomes the foundation for authority and long-term visibility.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Conduct surveys, run experiments, or compile <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-google-ads-benchmarks">industry benchmarks</a> that no one else has.</li>
<li>Integrate expert quotes and contrarian opinions to create perspective-driven content.</li>
<li>Publish unique definitions or frameworks that others in your field will cite.</li>
<li>Package findings in ways that can be referenced by both humans and search engines.</li>
</ul>
<h3>17. Move conversion elements to the top</h3>
<p>If AI tools scrape only your intro, that’s prime real estate. Put your most compelling CTAs, data points, and USPs where they can’t be missed.</p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p>Human Interest, a 401(k) provider for SMBs, relocated a contact form above the fold—placing it among the first things visitors saw. This adjustment led to a <a href="https://www.marquiz.io/blog/conversion-optimization-case-studies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">75.84%</a> increase in conversion rate, boosting overall form submissions significantly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rebrandly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebrandly</a> took a similar approach with content. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-yoder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stephanie Yoder</a>, their Director of Content, reviewed which posts drove the most traffic and conversions. She then redesigned those posts to include large CTA boxes in the first third of the article. The result: a 10%+ lift in conversions from blog readers. This shows that early placement of conversion elements isn’t just for landing pages—it works for editorial content too.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Add a concise, benefit-driven CTA in the first 100 words.</li>
<li>Front-load your most compelling proof points.</li>
<li>Use clear, non-generic headlines above the fold.</li>
</ul>
<h3>18. Optimize for rich snippets and structured data</h3>
<p>Structured data helps both Google and AI parse your content more effectively, increasing the chances of visibility in rich snippets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/featured-snippet-example-dog-brushing-png.webp" alt="featured snippet example for how often to brush dogs teeth query" width="1758" height="728" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90176" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/featured-snippet-example-dog-brushing-png.webp 1758w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/featured-snippet-example-dog-brushing-1280x530.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/featured-snippet-example-dog-brushing-980x406.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/featured-snippet-example-dog-brushing-480x199.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1758px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p>Vidio, one of Indonesia’s largest OTT streaming platforms, implemented VideoObject structured data at scale and fixed unstable media URLs so Google could consistently fetch and parse their videos. Within a year, they saw about <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/case-studies/vidio-case-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3x more</a> video impressions and nearly 2x more video clicks from Google Search.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Add schema markup (FAQ, HowTo, Review) to key pages.</li>
<li>Use descriptive headers, bullet points, and numbered lists.</li>
<li>Answer related sub-questions directly within your content.</li>
</ul>
<h3>19. Focus on topics that AI can’t answer fully</h3>
<p>AI often delivers surface-level responses. It struggles with nuance, brand voice, and niche complexity, especially in areas where local insights, cultural context, or brand differentiation matter most. That gap is an opportunity for content that goes deeper and answers what AI cannot.</p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p>DreamGen, a creative AI storytelling platform, had to compete with giants like Character.AI and AI Dungeon in late 2024. With little organic traffic or domain reputation, they carved out visibility by focusing on niche but intent-rich queries such as “Best AI Character Apps” and “How to Jailbreak ChatGPT.” These <a href="https://www.embarque.io/case-studies/dreamgen-case-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeted angles aligned with their brand strengths and produced meaningful search traction even against larger players</a>.</p>
<p>This strategy is echoed by Oskar, who says, “I look for queries where AI answers are all surface and zero depth. If the response is just ‘step 1: collect data, step 2: analyze it,’ that’s my cue to create a detailed, step-by-step guide with screenshots and real advice. AI leaves people hungry; our job is to feed them.” His insight underlines why specificity wins. Where AI stops at the outline, your content can become the full meal.</p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Targeting broad, AI-saturated keywords like “AI writing tools” or “AI storytelling.” These spaces are already flooded with generic content and rarely produce returns.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Audit AI-generated answers in tools like Google SGE or Perplexity to spot where responses are shallow.</li>
<li>Identify gaps where expert insights, local examples, or brand-driven nuance can elevate the content.</li>
<li>Produce detailed, practical content in those niches even if the search volume looks modest.</li>
<li>Track performance for early signs of traction from long-tail and referral traffic.</li>
</ul>
<h3>20. Contribute to high-authority sources</h3>
<p>Even if AI tools extract answers from your site, they prioritize quoting or summarizing content from trusted domains—citation equity matters.</p>
<h4>Real-world example</h4>
<p>Writesonic discusses how strategic PR placements (getting branded insights featured in respected media) can <a href="https://writesonic.com/blog/pr-for-ai_search-visibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener">directly influence visibility in AI-generated search results</a>. These authoritative citations improve the likelihood that AI summaries will include your name, even if not clicking through to your site.</p>
<h4>Mistake to avoid</h4>
<p>Only publishing on your own site and hoping AI will discover it naturally. Instead, leverage placement on trusted external platforms.</p>
<h4>Action steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pitch guest articles or expert commentary to top industry blogs and media outlets.</li>
<li>Respond to journalist requests via HARO, Qwoted, or similar platforms.</li>
<li>Ensure your author bio includes links and references back to your owned properties.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Less traffic? No problem with these tips</h2>
<p>The loss of low-intent traffic is a signal, not a sentence. AI is filtering out the fluff, and that forces us to sharpen our strategies—focusing on conversions, owned channels, high-intent acquisition, and content AI can’t replicate.</p>
<p>Audit your current content this week. Flag what’s losing traffic. Then decide: rework it, redirect it, or retire it. Fill the gaps with assets and campaigns that win in the AI-shaped search landscape.</p>
<p>The marketers who make this shift now won’t just recover lost ground—they’ll build a more resilient, more profitable engine for years to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People aren’t just using ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Perplexity for specific prompts anymore. These tools are gradually replacing traditional search engines for everyday questions, product comparisons, and decision-making, and that shift is changing how brands get discovered.</p>
<p>ChatGPT alone now handles around <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/chatgpt-users" target="_blank" rel="noopener">37.5 million</a> search-like queries per day. While it’s still far behind Google’s 14 billion queries, usage is growing fast. And with that growth comes a new layer of brand exposure, one that businesses can’t see through web analytics or search rankings alone.</p>
<p>If your business gets mentioned in an AI-generated answer, it might not include a link. It might not even be accurate. These models pull from all kinds of sources, blend them together, and present the result as fact.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s important to know how your brand is showing up in these tools.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll explain why that matters, what to look for in a tracking tool, and compare the best options for monitoring your presence in LLM answers.</p>

<h2>Why tracking LLM mentions matters</h2>
<p>Understanding how LLMs talk about your brand is about more than curiosity. It’s about control, context, and competitive edge.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reputation management:</strong> AI models can synthesize incorrect or outdated information about your brand. If left unchecked, these inaccuracies can damage customer trust. As The New York Times reports, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/technology/ai-hallucinations-chatgpt-google.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI “hallucinations” are becoming harder to spot</a> and more harmful when they involve real companies.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic messaging:</strong> The way LLMs describe your brand reveals how your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/positioning-statement">positioning</a> is being interpreted across the web. If they consistently use certain phrases or tones, that’s a valuable signal, helping you refine your messaging across websites, ads, product pages, and social channels.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>It’s helpful to know how LLMs are describing your business to potential searchers.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competitive benchmarking:</strong> Tracking how often and how positively competitors appear in AI responses gives you a new way to evaluate their visibility, influence, and perceived strengths, insights that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-seo-tools">traditional SEO tools</a> won’t uncover.</li>
<li><strong>Emerging channel visibility:</strong> Like SEO a decade ago, LLM visibility is a rising channel. Getting ahead now gives you a first-mover advantage in a space that will only grow in importance.</li>
</ul>
<p>This all ties into a new discipline: <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/generative-engine-optimization">Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)</a>. While traditional SEO is about ranking in search results, GEO is about being the answer. And that starts with knowing when and how you’re showing up.</p>

<div id="how-to-integrate-llm-monitoring-into-your-brand-strategy"></div>
<h2>How to integrate LLM monitoring into your brand strategy</h2>
<p>LLM mention tracking becomes powerful when you use it to drive actual decisions. Here are a few ways it can help you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SEO:</strong> If a keyword is consistently triggering answers that exclude you, that’s a signal to improve coverage, depth, or authority.</li>
<li><strong>PR and comms:</strong> If AI is misquoting or misunderstanding your brand, it’s time to create clearer narratives or issue corrections in public channels.</li>
<li><strong>Support:</strong> Incorrect support responses in AI can reflect outdated docs. Use tracking insights to guide your knowledge base updates.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-address-from-yelp-example.webp" alt="chatgpt address from yelp example" width="900" height="705" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93470" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-address-from-yelp-example.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-address-from-yelp-example-480x376.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><em>In this case, the address shown is correct. But if it wasn’t, you could see it’s pulled from Yelp and make a change there.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Product:</strong> LLMs misunderstanding your features? <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-market-a-product">Product marketing</a> can use that feedback to rework how features are described in documentation and launch materials.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f916.png" alt="🤖" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Want to use AI the right way?</strong> Get tips, tools, prompts, and tricks in this free download &gt;&gt; <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/emergency-ai-guide?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_AIMarketing_Download">Emergency Guide to AI in Marketing</a></p>
<div id="what-to-look-for-in-an-llm-tracking-tool"></div>
<h2>What to look for in an LLM tracking tool</h2>
<p>Most tools in this space are still evolving. When assessing them, focus on features that help you monitor mentions in a way that drives action:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Model coverage:</strong> Can it monitor multiple AI engines (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/05/chatgpt-seo">ChatGPT</a>, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, etc.)?</li>
<li><strong>Prompt + response pairing:</strong> Does the tool show you both the user prompt and the AI’s answer?</li>
<li><strong>Context awareness:</strong> Does it offer sentiment analysis or tone classification to help interpret <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/brand-perception">how your brand is being portrayed</a>?</li>
<li><strong>Syndication monitoring:</strong> Can it detect when an AI-generated answer gets reused in blog posts, summaries, or newsletters?</li>
<li><strong>Integrations:</strong> Does it play well with your existing analytics, PR monitoring, or marketing dashboards?</li>
</ul>
<div id="the-best-tools-to-track-llm-mentions"></div>
<h2>The best LLM tracking tools: A detailed breakdown</h2>
<p>Now, let’s walk through the top tools available today with a level of detail that helps you make an informed decision.</p>
<h3>1. Ahrefs&#8217; Brand Radar</h3>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://ahrefs.com/brand-radar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ahrefs&#8217; Brand Radar</a> is an experimental feature that the company recently introduced to its well-established SEO monitoring suite. It builds on Ahrefs’ core strengths (crawling, indexing, and backlink analysis) and introduces a new layer: monitoring how AI models like ChatGPT and Claude potentially reference or surface your brand in their outputs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ahrefs-brand-radar.webp" alt="ahrefs brand radar landing page" width="758" height="750" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93471" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ahrefs-brand-radar.webp 758w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ahrefs-brand-radar-480x475.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 758px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Thousands of SEO professionals worldwide already trust Ahrefs, and Brand Radar is their early response to the growing influence of generative AI. While not a standalone LLM-specific tool, it offers LLM-aware functionality for businesses already using Ahrefs for SEO and content monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>Key features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LLM snippet detection:</strong> Surfaces instances where AI-generated summaries (especially those indexed or reposted) mention or paraphrase your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-source mention monitoring:</strong> Aggregates mentions across AI-generated content, social media, online forums, news publications, and blogs.</li>
<li><strong>Proprietary web crawler:</strong> Leverages Ahrefs’ industry-leading crawl infrastructure to capture content where AI answers have been shared or quoted.</li>
<li><strong>Brand alerts + dashboards:</strong> Sends notifications when new mentions (including suspected LLM-derived ones) are detected.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seamless SEO integration:</strong> If you’re already tracking backlinks, keywords, and content gaps with Ahrefs, Brand Radar adds another dimension without extra overhead.</li>
<li><strong>Data enrichment:</strong> Unlike other tools that treat brand mentions in isolation, Ahrefs provides SEO context—e.g., whether an AI mention comes from a high-authority source, is driving backlinks, or affects keyword visibility.</li>
<li><strong>Trusted interface:</strong> Many marketing and SEO teams are already familiar with Ahrefs&#8217; UI, making onboarding easier.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lacks real-time LLM integration:</strong> Brand Radar doesn’t monitor live ChatGPT or Claude sessions. Instead, it detects AI mentions that appear in republished content indexed by Ahrefs (e.g., Medium posts, Reddit discussions, newsletters quoting ChatGPT).</li>
<li><strong>Prompt-response blind spots:</strong> You won’t see the original user prompt or the AI’s full response unless that content was published somewhere publicly and indexed.</li>
<li><strong>Not standalone:</strong> You must already be a paying Ahrefs customer, and Brand Radar is currently available in beta to select plans. Unfortunately, Ahrefs charges $150/month per LLM, so you’ll need to budget $600/month to track everything, which is often a bit much for small businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong></p>
<p>SEO teams and content marketers who already rely on Ahrefs for link tracking and keyword monitoring, and who want to understand how AI-generated content might be piggybacking off their brand equity. It’s especially useful for identifying whether AI-driven summaries are distorting, amplifying, or paraphrasing your key messaging across the web.</p>
<h3>2. Peec AI</h3>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://peec.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peec AI</a> is a dedicated LLM visibility platform built to track how your brand is showing up inside responses generated by tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity. It focuses on surfacing actual prompt–response activity rather than monitoring secondary reposts, giving you a direct line into how these models interpret, mention, and contextualize your brand.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/peec-ai-homepage.webp" alt="peec ai dashboard example from homepage" width="900" height="568" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93472" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/peec-ai-homepage.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/peec-ai-homepage-480x303.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>Key features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prompt–response mapping:</strong> Logs and archives both user prompts and the corresponding answers where your brand appears, giving you valuable insight into how LLMs understand your positioning.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-model coverage:</strong> Supports tracking across OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Perplexity—four of the most commonly used LLMs in commercial and consumer environments.</li>
<li><strong>Sentiment and frequency analysis:</strong> Categorizes brand mentions as positive, neutral, or negative, and lets you trend those over time.</li>
<li><strong>Custom alerting:</strong> Real-time alerts when new mentions occur, with filters for brand/product terms, categories, or competitor overlap.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Peec provides <strong>actual LLM response logs</strong>, not just scraped summaries or derivative mentions. That means you&#8217;re getting closer to the truth of how AI sees and talks about your brand.</li>
<li>Its <strong>multi-model support</strong> ensures you&#8217;re not just optimizing for one platform.</li>
<li>It’s excellent for <strong>identifying low-frequency brand queries</strong> or long-tail prompts that wouldn&#8217;t show up in traditional SEO tools.</li>
<li>The platform’s <strong>dashboards are built for clarity</strong>, offering brand and comms teams actionable insights rather than raw data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Historical data is only fully available on enterprise plans,</strong> which may be cost-prohibitive for startups or small teams.</li>
<li><strong>The UI is still maturing</strong>; exporting reports and filtering across prompts/answers can be clunky without customization.</li>
<li><strong>It lacks deep integration with SEO suites or PR monitoring tools</strong>, which might create workflow silos unless you pair it with a broader analytics stack.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong></p>
<p>Brand, communications, and product marketing teams who need to understand how LLMs represent them, especially during a launch, media cycle, or moments of reputational sensitivity. It’s also useful for legal and trust teams that want to track misinformation or policy violations.</p>
<h3>3. Profound</h3>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.tryprofound.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Profound</a> is a brand accuracy and compliance tool built to help businesses monitor how generative AI models, customer support bots, and internal search systems talk about their products, services, and policies. It doesn&#8217;t chase SEO metrics or traffic volume. Instead, it gives brands visibility into factual consistency and messaging alignment.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/profound-ai-mention-tracker-tool.webp" alt="profound tool for tracking llm mentions" width="900" height="572" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93473" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/profound-ai-mention-tracker-tool.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/profound-ai-mention-tracker-tool-480x305.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>Key features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Knowledge base integration:</strong> Syncs with support platforms like Zendesk, Intercom, Notion, and Confluence to analyze how LLMs interpret your owned content.</li>
<li><strong>AI drift detection:</strong> Tracks when generative model outputs start deviating from your official product documentation or brand language.</li>
<li><strong>Weekly accuracy reports:</strong> Provides summaries of LLM answers that reference your brand, with flags for inconsistencies or policy gaps.</li>
<li><strong>Audit trail and versioning:</strong> Creates searchable logs that compliance teams can use to track how misinformation or outdated facts evolve over time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Critical for high-stakes messaging environments</strong> like fintech, healthcare, and cybersecurity, where inaccurate LLM outputs can lead to legal, ethical, or regulatory issues.</li>
<li><strong>Pinpoints documentation blind spots</strong> by showing which parts of your help center or product pages are being misinterpreted or ignored by LLMs.</li>
<li><strong>Valuable for product marketing and support alignment</strong>, ensuring that what you say internally matches what generative tools deliver externally.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not designed for SEO, brand awareness, or marketing analysis. </strong>Teams focused on visibility or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-generation-ideas">lead gen</a> will find limited value here.</li>
<li><strong>Complex setup for smaller orgs.</strong> Requires access to and configuration of your internal documentation repositories, which may demand engineering support.</li>
<li><strong>Limited UI flexibility.</strong> Most dashboards prioritize accuracy and auditability over visualization or storytelling.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong></p>
<p>Product marketers, customer success leaders, legal teams, and compliance officers who need to enforce consistency in how LLMs present their brand or product stack. If you&#8217;re in a regulated industry or run a complex SaaS product, Profound helps ensure your LLM presence stays aligned, factual, and on-message.</p>
<h3>4. Keyword.com’s AI Visibility Tracker</h3>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://keyword.com/ai-search-visibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keyword.com’s AI Visibility Tracker</a> bridges traditional keyword rank tracking with AI monitoring. It extends its existing SEO infrastructure to help businesses see how <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-experiments">generative AI platforms</a> (like ChatGPT and Claude) use or reference their content when answering commercial and informational queries.</p>

<li><strong>Simple onboarding for SEO pros</strong> familiar with keyword tracking tools like Semrush or Ahrefs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No visibility into prompts or full AI output,</strong> so the tool is best for tracking trends rather than understanding nuance.</li>
<li><strong>Not diagnostic,</strong> so you won’t know why you’re being excluded from an answer, only that it happened.</li>
<li><strong>Limited multi-model coverage</strong> at the time of writing; primarily optimized for ChatGPT.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best for: </strong></p>
<p>SEO and content teams looking to understand how their keyword landscape is shifting in an AI-first world. Great for benchmarking generative exposure alongside organic SERP performance.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve been there. A blank doc. A looming deadline. And the thought: “Can ChatGPT just write this for me?”</p>
<p>It probably can. ChatGPT is fast, flexible, and useful for just about every part of the marketing workflow (from brainstorming and outlining to ad copy, SEO tasks, and research).</p>
<p>But here’s where many marketers go wrong: They use ChatGPT as an end-to-end content creation tool.</p>
<p>That’s when the cracks start to show. ChatGPT can’t access real-time data. Its tone often needs work. And if you’re on the free version, it’s stuck in 2023. Relying on it for everything from campaign copy to competitor analysis can lead to off-brand content, missed insights, and hours of avoidable rewrites.</p>
<p>The reality is, some tools are just better for specific jobs.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re summarizing research, scripting videos, writing blog posts, or optimizing paid campaigns, there&#8217;s probably an AI tool designed to do it better than ChatGPT.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’re going to introduce you to nine smart ChatGPT alternatives. You&#8217;ll learn what each one does best, when to use it, and how it can help your team move faster, create sharper content, and stay ahead of the competition.</p>

<h2>Why consider a ChatGPT alternative?</h2>
<p>You may be wondering, “Is there a better AI than ChatGPT?” The short answer is, it depends on your use case. So, before we dive into the alternatives, it’s worth asking the key question: <strong>When does ChatGPT fall short?</strong></p>
<p>Although it’s an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/06/how-to-use-chatgpt-for-small-business-marketing">incredibly powerful marketing tool</a>, ChatGPT isn’t designed to handle every marketing task. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-winter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Winter</a>, Chief Growth Officer and Co-Founder at <a href="https://seowind.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEOwind</a>, explains that many of its limitations come down to how marketers use it.</p>
<p>“The biggest misconception is thinking that ChatGPT knows things it doesn’t,” Tom says. “It doesn’t understand your business, your market, or your goals unless you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/08/chatgpt-prompts">explicitly tell it</a>. It’s not a strategist. It’s a powerful tool waiting to be directed.”</p>
<p>In other words, when the input lacks clarity, the output is vague, off-brand, or just plain ineffective.</p>
<p>“ChatGPT falls short when marketers fail to provide context or clarity about what they actually want,” Tom explains. “Too often, people toss vague prompts at it and expect brilliance. But this isn’t a magic box. It reflects the quality of your input.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-ppc-questions.webp" alt="ChatGPT alternatives - chat of AI answers." width="937" height="601" class="aligncenter wp-image-93421 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-ppc-questions.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-ppc-questions-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>We recently found that ChatGPT incorrectly answered </em><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-accurate-is-ai-for-ppc"><em>22%</em></a><em> of our questions about PPC marketing.</em></p>
<p>Even when marketers use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-prompts">detailed prompts</a>, there are still limits to what ChatGPT can handle effectively. Certain tasks require capabilities that it simply doesn&#8217;t offer. For instance, ChatGPT may not be the right fit if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You rely on real-time or frequently updated information, such as breaking news, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/14/tiktok-trend-discovery">trending topics</a>, or live market data.</li>
<li>You are aiming for performance-driven results like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google">higher search rankings</a>, stronger <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/11/increase-conversion-rates">conversion rates</a>, or better user engagement.</li>
<li>You need seamless collaboration with teammates or integration with tools like Google Docs, Sheets, or project management platforms.</li>
<li>Your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-marketing-trends-2025">content</a> involves rich media formats like images, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/03/video-marketing-ideas">video</a>, or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/04/interactive-content">interactive assets</a> that go beyond plain text.</li>
<li>You regularly work with large volumes of source material and need help summarizing, tagging, or organizing long transcripts or research documents.</li>
</ul>
<p>These use cases often demand more than what ChatGPT can provide. And as Tom puts it, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/05/chatgpt-seo">success with ChatGPT</a> hinges not just on what you ask, but on knowing when not to ask it at all.</p>
<p>This brings us to the issue of trust and accuracy.</p>
<p>“One consistent challenge we’ve seen when generating long-form content is how confidently ChatGPT hallucinates,” Tom says. “It doesn’t just make up numbers. It invents sources and even fabricates links that look legit at first glance.”</p>
<p>If any of these challenges sound familiar, it may be time to explore <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency">AI tools</a> that are purpose-built for the specific demands of modern marketing teams.</p>

<h2>ChatGPT alternatives for everyday use</h2>
<p>These are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-ai-tools">versatile tools</a> designed to help with a wide range of tasks, from long-form writing to brainstorming and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/competitive-analysis">competitive analysis</a>. If you like ChatGPT but want something more targeted, this is where to start.</p>
<h3>Claude (by Anthropic)</h3>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Long-form writing, strategic content, and synthesizing large documents.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-claudeai.webp" alt="ChatGPT alternatives - screenshot from Claude" width="734" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93422 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-claudeai.webp 734w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-claudeai-480x392.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 734px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><a href="http://claude.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claude</a> stands out with its massive context window, which allows it to process and retain focus across long, complex inputs. While ChatGPT might lose the thread halfway through a 90-minute transcript or a multi-part brief, Claude holds its ground.</p>
<p>“Claude is better at listening to direction and executing it thoroughly,” Tom says. “It’s like working with someone who actually reads the whole brief before responding.”</p>
<p>This makes Claude especially valuable for marketers prioritizing structure, accuracy, and tone over improvisation. According to Tom, Claude consistently produces drafts that are closer to “ready to go,” especially for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/12/01/b2b-content-marketing">B2B content</a> where logic, clarity, and voice alignment matter more than flair.</p>
<p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong></p>
<p>Paste in a detailed product spec, a transcript from a 90-minute strategy call, and your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/07/31/brand-voice">brand voice</a> guidelines, and Claude will produce a cohesive, on-brand plan with minimal prompting. It’s ideal when you need consistency, nuance, and clear thinking across long-form assets.</p>
<p><strong>Use it for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Writing detailed <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/07/best-marketing-strategies">marketing strategies</a>.</li>
<li>Synthesizing competitor, audience, or product research.</li>
<li>Creating content that needs precision, structure, and memory.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why pick it over ChatGPT?</strong></p>
<p>While ChatGPT can be more creative, Claude is more disciplined. If your prompts are long, layered, or multi-step, Claude is more likely to follow them through without veering off-track.</p>
<p>Tom explains it as, “ChatGPT tends to come back with something lively, even witty, but it often drifts off-message or plays fast and loose with the facts. Claude sticks to the structure, stays factual, and delivers the tone we need (confident, clear, and human).”</p>
<p>If you’re producing smart, structured content that supports real strategy work, Claude is likely the better fit.</p>
<h3>Gemini (by Google)</h3>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Research, visual content planning, and Google Workspace integration.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-gemini.webp" alt="ChatGPT alternatives - screenshot from Gemini" width="937" height="630" class="aligncenter wp-image-93423 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-gemini.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-gemini-480x323.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><a href="http://gemini.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gemini</a> (formerly Bard) shines in environments where text, visuals, and live web data converge. With native integration across Google Docs, Sheets, Gmail, and even <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/20/youtube-marketing">YouTube</a>, it’s a natural fit for marketers already working inside the Google ecosystem.</p>
<p>“For me, the biggest edge Gemini has is how much it smooths out my daily marketing workflow,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamara-omerovic-058775200/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tamara Omerović</a>, Marketing Consultant at Underdogs Marketing. “Because it’s integrated into the tools I already use, I spend less time switching between apps and more time actually doing the work.”</p>
<p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong></p>
<p>Gemini goes beyond simple text generation. It can draft <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/01/email-marketing-tips">email campaigns</a> in Gmail, help shape content outlines in Docs, and analyze performance data in Sheets—all while keeping context between tasks. It’s especially useful for content teams working across various formats and touchpoints.</p>
<p>“Gemini can also use the context from what I’m working on to give more relevant suggestions,” Tamara explains. “Whether I’m drafting ad copy or breaking down campaign results, it’s right there where I need it.”</p>
<p><strong>Use it for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Researching trends and competitors using live web data.</li>
<li>Drafting content or campaigns directly inside Google Workspace.</li>
<li>Blending text, video insights, and visuals into a unified <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-plan">content plan</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why pick it over ChatGPT?</strong></p>
<p>While ChatGPT excels at creative ideation, Gemini is built for marketers who live inside Google’s productivity suite. Tamara frequently uses it to build <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/11/09/how-to-write-a-creative-brief">content briefs</a> and streamline research.</p>
<p>“I use Gemini to quickly summarize competitor content and identify gaps or opportunities,” she says. “It helps me create briefs faster and lets me focus on strategy instead of spending hours combing through pages.”</p>
<p>For even deeper content research, she often turns to <a href="https://notebooklm.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NotebookLM</a>, another Google product.</p>
<p>“I can upload documents or URLs, ask targeted questions, and even generate a mind map of a competitor’s page,” Tamara says. “It’s incredibly effective for spotting content gaps or identifying new angles for clients.”</p>
<p>If your marketing workflow already lives in Google Workspace (and especially if you’re juggling research, planning, and execution), Gemini is the tool that fits naturally into your day.</p>
<h3>Meta AI</h3>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Social content and engagement at scale.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-Meta.webp" alt="ChatGPT alternatives - screenshot from Meta AI" width="520" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93424 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-Meta.webp 520w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-Meta-480x554.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 520px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><a href="http://meta.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta AI</a> is baked directly into <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/08/facebook-marketing-ideas">Facebook</a>, Instagram, and WhatsApp. If you live in the Meta ecosystem, it’s becoming a great solution for building fast, reactive content.</p>
<p>“We have begun testing Meta AI with clients in certain pockets,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyler-mask-38a47b24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyler Mask</a>, Director of Optimization Strategy at LocaliQ. “Text and graphic enhancements are the two biggest areas of impact so far. However, many clients have specific creative direction, which has kept our adoption from being widespread just yet. As clients become more comfortable giving up some of this control, we anticipate a higher adoption rate.”</p>
<p>Meta AI shines in tasks that benefit from real-time support—whether you’re brainstorming post ideas, writing DMs, or moderating comment threads. It’s built right into the platforms most marketers already use daily, and it&#8217;s tuned specifically for high-volume, short-form output.</p>
<p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong></p>
<p>Need to brainstorm <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/27/blog-post-ideas">post ideas</a>, respond to DMs, or moderate comments? Meta AI can do all of that natively in your workflow.</p>
<p><strong>Use it for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Generating new post ideas quickly (both text and graphics).</li>
<li>Writing and testing comment replies or variations.</li>
<li>Light moderation and engagement assistance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why pick it over ChatGPT?</strong></p>
<p>It’s tuned for short-form social content and lives inside the platforms you already use. This automatically eliminates the need for switching tabs and playing around with extra tools. If you’re posting daily or handling multiple clients, it can save serious time.</p>
<p>That said, it’s still early days.</p>
<p>As Tyler points out, “Meta&#8217;s AI is learning at an incredibly fast rate. Learning still takes time, though. So, strategists adopting AI at this stage have to recognize that using AI unchecked is not the best idea.”</p>
<p>He sees promise in where the tool is headed: “It’s solved several scalability and efficiency questions, but consistent quality remains a large hurdle for the time being. Performance will be the biggest test AI has to pass before becoming a true fixture in marketing.”</p>
<p>If you’re already deep in the Meta suite and want help scaling your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/17/increase-online-presence">social presence</a> without constantly reinventing the wheel, Meta AI is worth exploring (especially as it matures).</p>

<h2>ChatGPT alternatives for marketing</h2>
<p>These tools are purpose-built for marketers. If you’re trying to convert, rank, or drive action, these platforms bring more structure, automation, and marketing-specific features than ChatGPT.</p>
<h3>Copy.ai</h3>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> short-form copy that converts.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-copyai.webp" alt="ChatGPT alternatives - screenshot from Copy ai" width="715" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93425 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-copyai.webp 715w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-copyai-480x403.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 715px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nathan-likes-writing_contentmarketing-b2bcontent-aicontentmarketing-activity-7343329276533854208-KQFU?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAfpBUkBZn1g_3AT-AQ7-zTMTBRIIDRYtto" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Nathan Thompson explains</em></a><em> how to create a blog writer agent in Copy.ai on LinkedIn.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://copy.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Copy.ai</a> is more than just a headline generator. While many AI tools can produce decent short-form copy with the right context, Copy.ai stands out by managing that context more intelligently and at scale. It’s a powerful option for solo marketers, ecommerce teams, and content pros who need copy that stays consistent across assets, campaigns, and languages.</p>
<p>“If you’re just doing one-off tweets or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/01/headline-examples">headlines</a>, ChatGPT is fine,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-likes-writing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathan Thompson</a>, Head of Content Strategy at Copy.ai. “But if you want consistency, adaptability, and the ability to swap models on the fly, Copy.ai in workflow mode wins every time.”</p>
<p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong></p>
<p>Copy.ai supports <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/16/copywriting-formulas">frameworks</a> like AIDA and PAS natively, making it easy to generate conversion-optimized copy with minimal prompting. But the real power lies in its workflows. You can upload everything from your sitemap to Google Analytics data to product specs and build chains that guide the AI’s output with your brand’s full context baked in.</p>
<p>“It feels like having an in-house writer who remembers every detail,” Nathan says, “rather than a Fiverr freelancer you have to brief from scratch each time.”</p>
<p><strong>Use it for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Writing and refreshing product descriptions at scale.</li>
<li>Generating ad headlines, email subject lines, and CTAs.</li>
<li>Repurposing blog content for paid and organic social campaigns.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why pick it over ChatGPT?</strong></p>
<p>Copy.ai is purpose-built for marketing. It doesn’t just respond to prompts—it works from a stored, structured understanding of your business.</p>
<p>Nathan explains how this benefits ecommerce teams in particular. “If you have a hundred SKUs that need refreshed descriptions, you can upload a CSV and hit generate. Out come a hundred polished drafts in seconds—all aligned with your brand voice.”</p>
<p>For any team running <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ab-testing-examples">A/B tests</a>, managing multiple product lines, or looking to centralize their messaging, Copy.ai offers a more scalable, efficient solution than general-purpose tools like ChatGPT.</p>
<h3>Jasper</h3>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Marketing teams that need brand-safe content at scale.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-jasper.webp" alt="ChatGPT alternatives - screenshot from Jasper." width="937" height="485" class="aligncenter wp-image-93426 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-jasper.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-jasper-480x248.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.jasper.ai/studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p><a href="http://jasper.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jasper</a> is a marketing-focused AI platform built for speed, consistency, and collaboration. Unlike ChatGPT, which is a general-purpose tool, Jasper is explicitly designed to help teams produce on-brand blogs, ads, and emails without constant prompt tweaking.</p>
<p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong></p>
<p>Jasper comes with built-in brand voice controls and marketing frameworks (like AIDA or PAS) that help every piece of content stay aligned with your messaging. Its “Insights” dashboard also highlights when tone drifts off-brand, giving teams more control over AI outputs.</p>
<p><strong>Use it for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Scaling blog posts, ads, and email campaigns while keeping voice consistent.</li>
<li>Flagging off-brand or inaccurate phrasing before content goes live.</li>
<li>Enabling multiple team members to generate AI content safely in one environment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why pick it over ChatGPT?</strong></p>
<p>ChatGPT is flexible, but Jasper is structured for marketing teams. You don’t have to re-teach your tone with every prompt, and you get governance features ChatGPT lacks—like team-wide collaboration, brand voice enforcement, and built-in marketing templates. It’s the faster, safer choice when scaling content creation is a priority.</p>

<p>Sometimes AI isn’t a standalone product—it’s embedded into your workflow. These <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-productivity-tools">AI productivity tools</a> help teams get more out of meetings, content planning, and knowledge management.</p>
<h3>Notion AI</h3>

<h3>Microsoft Copilot</h3>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Internal brand use monitoring and productivity in Microsoft environments.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-copilot.webp" alt="ChatGPT alternatives - screenshot from Otter" width="621" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93429 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-copilot.webp 621w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-copilot-480x464.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 621px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/chats/eq79qjiYJaKXRaZewwwds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Copilot</a> is Microsoft’s generative AI assistant built into Word, Excel, Teams, and Outlook, with added reach in Bing and the Edge browser. While it’s not a dedicated LLM brand-monitoring platform, it’s a major touchpoint for how AI references your brand—inside emails, meeting recaps, and enterprise search results.</p>
<p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong></p>
<p>Copilot integrates with Microsoft Graph, meaning it can pull context from documents, calendars, and email threads to generate summaries, proposals, and internal content that could include your brand. For SEO and brand teams, Bing’s AI answers also represent a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/generative-engine-optimization">new zero-click space</a> where your brand may appear.</p>
<p><strong>Use it for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Summarizing internal docs, meetings, or emails where your brand is discussed.</li>
<li>Spotting how Copilot interprets and represents company info internally.</li>
<li>Exploring Bing’s AI answers as part of your brand visibility strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why pick it over ChatGPT?</strong></p>
<p>If your company runs on Microsoft 365, Copilot lives where the work already happens. It’s built for enterprise-grade control with audit logs and admin oversight, giving IT and comms teams some visibility into how AI-generated content uses brand data.</p>
<div id="chatgpt-alternatives-for-research"></div>
<h2>ChatGPT alternatives for research</h2>
<p>When accuracy and attribution matter, you need tools that prioritize real-time data, sources, and context, not just wordy answers.</p>
<h3>Perplexity AI</h3>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Web-connected research with citations.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-perplexity.webp" alt="ChatGPT alternatives - screenshot from Perplexity." width="513" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93430 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-perplexity.webp 513w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-perplexity-480x561.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 513px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><a href="http://perplexity.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perplexity</a> is what you get when you combine a search engine with an LLM. It’s great for finding accurate, cited information fast. Every answer includes links and sources, making it ideal for validating content or conducting competitive research.</p>
<p>“We use Perplexity to gather stats, quotes, and case studies—basically, any hard data that can boost the E-E-A-T of our articles,” Tom says. “It’s become a go-to tool for making content more trustworthy and grounded in real sources.”</p>
<p><strong>Why it’s great: </strong></p>
<p>Perplexity pulls verifiable information from the web and presents it with links and citations upfront. It’s especially useful for marketers working on content that requires up-to-date data, third-party validation, or research-backed insights.</p>
<p>“Compared to Google, it saves time by giving you a summarized answer with citations right out of the gate,” Winter explains. “No digging through 10 open tabs. And unlike ChatGPT, it doesn’t hallucinate or rely on outdated data.”</p>
<p><strong>Use it for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sourcing accurate, recent data points for content.</li>
<li>Summarizing market, industry, or regulatory trends.</li>
<li>Validating claims and backing them up with references.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why pick it over ChatGPT?</strong></p>
<p>ChatGPT is excellent for drafting and ideation, but when it comes to cited, real-time information, Perplexity is far more reliable.</p>
<p>“It’s not just fast. It’s accountable,” Tom says. “That’s what makes it a game changer for research-driven content.”</p>
<p>At SEOwind, Perplexity is also part of their internal AI workflow. Their agents pull fresh data from Perplexity and insert it directly into article drafts.</p>
<p>“Whether we’re creating something new or updating older content, Perplexity gives us credible input we can trace back to the source,” Tom explains. “It’s a major shortcut for boosting content accuracy and trustworthiness.”</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re serious about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/14/google-e-e-a-t">Google’s E-E-A-T guidelines</a>, Perplexity is the research assistant you&#8217;ve been waiting for.</p>

<h2>How to choose the right ChatGPT alternatives</h2>
<p>New AI tools pop up every day, it seems. And everyone has their favorites. But which ChatGPT alternatives should you use?</p>
<p>It all depends on what you need to accomplish. Here’s a list of common use cases and the best AI tool for them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-alt-chart.webp" alt="ChatGPT alternatives - graphic of all alternatives. " width="761" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93431 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-alt-chart.webp 761w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-alternatives-wordstream-alt-chart-480x378.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 761px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>You don’t have to rely on a single ChatGPT alternative</h2>
<p>ChatGPT is powerful. But it’s not your only option and rarely the best tool for every job.</p>
<p>Modern marketers are building cohesive AI stacks: thoughtfully combining specialized tools to eliminate bottlenecks, improve quality, and scale their efforts without scaling their headcount.</p>
<p>For example, a smart AI stack might include Claude for long-form strategy documents, Jasper for high-converting ad copy, Perplexity for up-to-date research with citations, and Notion AI for internal team workflows. When you play each tool to its strength, the result is faster execution, better messaging, and less reliance on generalist outputs that need heavy editing.</p>
<p>The smartest thing you can do is to <strong>match the tool to the task.</strong></p>
<p>Try a few of these out. Most offer free plans or trials. With the right combo, you’ll spend less time wrestling with prompts and more time executing real marketing work.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The latest statistics claim that Google search is <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-search-bigger-chatgpt-search-453142" target="_blank" rel="noopener">373 times</a> bigger today than ChatGPT search, yet most of us feel like it’s the other way around.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because lots of people aren&#8217;t clicking anymore. They&#8217;re <em>asking</em>.</p>
<p>Instead of browsing through search results, they&#8217;re getting instant, conversational answers from tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity. These generative engines are rapidly changing how people discover and consume information, and in many cases, your website isn&#8217;t even part of the equation.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-ctr-study-ai-overviews-rise-as-click-rates-decline/541465/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Search Engine Journal</a>, click-through rates for informational queries are dropping in sectors where AI Overviews appear in Google. At the same time, another report found that ChatGPT is processing <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/blog/insights/ai-news/chatgpt-daily-peak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 1.7 billion</a> visits per month, traffic that might have previously gone through traditional search.</p>
<p>This shift challenges the way we think about SEO and underscores the importance of abandoning outdated playbooks and developing new, more effective strategies that are better suited to this new terrain.</p>
<p>In this guide, I&#8217;ll break down what <strong>Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)</strong> really is, how it differs from classic SEO, and how you can evolve your strategy to stay discoverable no matter where or how people search.</p>

<h2>What is Generative Engine Optimization?</h2>
<p>Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is the practice of optimizing content to appear as authoritative sources or direct responses within generative AI platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">traditional SEO</a>, which focuses on ranking in search engine results pages (SERPs) to earn clicks, GEO aims to position your content as the primary source that AI engines reference when generating answers. <strong>The goal shifts from earning a click to having your information included in the AI&#8217;s response.</strong></p>
<p>This represents a fundamental change in how we approach content optimization:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional SEO</strong>: Optimize for visibility in search results → Earn clicks → Convert users on your site</li>
<li><strong>GEO</strong>: Optimize to be the authoritative source → Get cited in AI responses → Build brand recognition and authority</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/seo-vs-geo-definition.webp" alt="geo vs seo differences and example" width="900" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93156" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/seo-vs-geo-definition.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/seo-vs-geo-definition-480x427.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This distinction is crucial because generative engines operate on different principles than traditional search:</p>
<ul>
<li>They don&#8217;t prioritize sending traffic to external websites.</li>
<li>They synthesize information from multiple sources into a single response.</li>
<li>They evaluate authority and trustworthiness differently from Google.</li>
<li>They prioritize content that fits their training parameters and retrieval mechanisms.</li>
</ul>

<div id="how-generative-ai-is-reshaping-the-search-landscape"></div>
<h2>How generative AI is reshaping the search landscape</h2>
<p>The shift toward generative AI as a primary information source is happening faster than many marketers realize. And the numbers back it up:</p>
<ul>
<li>According to Gartner, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/topics/generative-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">35%</a> of Gen Z now uses AI tools as their first stop for research questions, compared to 19% for millennials and 7% for Gen X.</li>
<li>Perplexity.ai, which launched in late 2022, already processes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/25/perplexity-says-its-now-serving-100m-search-queries-a-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 10 million</a> unique queries daily.</li>
<li>Stack Overflow reported a <a href="https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/the-fall-of-stack-overflow-fde10c0bab4e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">35%</a> reduction in question volume for programming topics since the launch of ChatGPT, as developers increasingly turn to AI for coding solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>This shift is particularly evident in specific sectors. “Technical searches (programming, data analysis), factual queries, and how-to content are migrating rapidly to AI platforms, while commercial searches still largely happen on traditional search engines,” explains <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-yoder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stephanie Yoder</a>, Director of Content at <a href="https://www.rebrandly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebrandly</a>.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve also seen a dramatic shift in discovery patterns, especially for deep-dive educational content,” Stephanie said. “People who used to spend 15–20 minutes reading multiple articles now get a synthesized answer from AI in under five minutes.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-chat-answer-vs-blog-post-answer.png" alt="example of answer from ai search vs organic search" width="936" height="406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93131" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-chat-answer-vs-blog-post-answer.png 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-chat-answer-vs-blog-post-answer-480x208.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I received an immediate response to my query via ChatGPT vs. one of the ranking blog posts for the same search in Google.</em></p>
<p>This evolution creates both challenges and strategic opportunities. While websites providing straightforward factual information may experience traffic declines, those delivering unique insights, original research, and expert perspectives can position themselves as the authoritative sources that AI engines rely upon.</p>

<div id="geo-vs-seo-5-major-differences"></div>
<h2>GEO vs. SEO: What’s the difference?</h2>
<p>Let’s dive into the five major differences between GEO and SEO.</p>
<h3>1. Citations replace links (and they&#8217;re optional)</h3>
<p>In traditional SEO, links are everything. They <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drive traffic</a>, pass authority, and serve as the primary way users navigate to your content.</p>
<p>In the generative AI world, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-citations">citations</a> have replaced links. Links are now few or absent from the generated content.</p>
<p>When ChatGPT provides an answer synthesized from multiple sources, it rarely mentions where the information came from, let alone links to it.</p>
<p>Here’s a real-world example: I asked ChatGPT what plants keep mosquitoes away. It provided me with a list and tips but didn&#8217;t provide any sources.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/chatgpt-answer-no-links.webp" alt="example of chatgpt answer with no links or sources" width="900" height="543" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93134" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/chatgpt-answer-no-links.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/chatgpt-answer-no-links-480x290.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Even Perplexity, which does provide source attribution, typically lists references at the bottom of responses where, according to industry Reddit discussions, many users never scroll.</p>
<p><strong>GEO tip</strong>: Create &#8220;citation bait&#8221; content that generative engines will naturally pull in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop unique statistics through original research.</li>
<li>Craft clear, concise definitions that are easy for AI to extract.</li>
<li>Structure information in a way that makes it easy for AI to parse (tables, lists, step-by-step guides).</li>
<li>Create memorable statements and frameworks that are distinctive to your brand.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Authority signals matter more than ever</h3>
<p>Generative AI engines draw from sources they consider authoritative, making it harder for smaller or newer websites to gain visibility. However, what constitutes &#8220;authority&#8221; for an AI differs from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/09/google-ranking-factors">Google&#8217;s traditional ranking factors</a>.</p>
<p>While Google uses metrics like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/10/link-building-secrets">backlinks</a>, domain age, and engagement signals, generative AI models are trained on vast datasets where certain sources appear more frequently and are treated as more reliable. This creates a new paradigm for establishing authority.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ai-overviews-ranking-content.webp" alt="google ai overviews - top sources" width="500" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92056" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ai-overviews-ranking-content.webp 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ai-overviews-ranking-content-480x768.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For AI platforms, authority comes from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consistent presence across multiple high-quality platforms.</li>
<li>Recognition from established industry voices.</li>
<li>Clear expertise signals (author credentials, professional affiliations).</li>
<li>Structured content that follows well-established formats.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GEO tip</strong>: Build multi-dimensional authority signals that generative AI can recognize:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish on your domain but also on respected industry platforms.</li>
<li>Secure mentions from recognized experts in your field.</li>
<li>Include clear author credentials and expertise markers.</li>
<li>Create content that demonstrates specialized knowledge AI can&#8217;t synthesize.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Structured, fact-rich content becomes premium fuel</h3>
<p>Generative AI models love structure. They&#8217;re designed to identify patterns, extract key information, and recognize relationships between concepts. This makes highly structured, fact-dense content particularly valuable for these systems.</p>
<p>Content that performs best in generative engines includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear headings and subheadings that follow logical hierarchies.</li>
<li>Bulleted and numbered lists that organize information.</li>
<li>Tables that present comparative data.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/24/faq-page">FAQ sections</a> that directly address specific questions.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overview-faq-content-example.webp" alt="ai overview example with faq content structure" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91620" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overview-faq-content-example.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overview-faq-content-example-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Step-by-step guides with numbered instructions.</li>
<li>Clear definitions and explanations of concepts.</li>
</ul>
<p>This preference for structure explains why Wikipedia content appears so frequently in AI responses. It follows consistent formatting patterns that make information easy to extract.</p>
<p><strong>GEO tip</strong>: Structure your content for maximum AI parsing efficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use clear, descriptive headers that signal content relevance.</li>
<li>Organize information in lists, tables, and other structured formats.</li>
<li>Include concise definitions and explanations of key concepts.</li>
<li>Add <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/15/what-is-schema-markup">schema markup</a> to enhance AI understanding of your content.</li>
<li>Create dedicated FAQ sections that directly answer common questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>As Stephanie puts it: &#8220;The content that performs best in both traditional and generative search follows similar principles: it&#8217;s well-structured, authoritative, and clearly addresses user needs. The difference is that AI can extract and synthesize this information without requiring the user to visit your site.&#8221;</p>

<h3>4. Brand visibility must expand beyond traditional search</h3>
<p>In traditional SEO, ranking your own website is the primary goal. In GEO, your content needs to exist wherever generative AI might draw from.</p>
<p>When answering a question about local marketing strategies, generative AI might pull information from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook community groups</li>

<p>This means relying solely on your website for visibility is no longer sufficient. Your brand needs to be present across multiple platforms in a consistent, recognizable way.</p>
<p><strong>GEO tip</strong>: Distribute expertise across the platforms that feed AI systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participate actively in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reddit-marketing">industry forums and communities</a>.</li>
<li>Publish on major content platforms (Medium, LinkedIn, etc.).</li>
<li>Create video content with optimized transcripts.</li>
<li>Engage in podcast interviews to generate transcribed content.</li>
<li>Contribute to open-source projects and public knowledge bases.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Brand mentions across diverse platforms create a network effect for AI visibility,&#8221; said <a href="https://oskarduberg.com/">Oskar Duberg</a>, a Freelance Content Specialist.  &#8220;When AI sees your brand referenced in multiple authoritative contexts, it&#8217;s more likely to include you in responses, even without direct links.&#8221;</p>
<h3>5. Content strategies are now prompt-driven</h3>
<p>People interact with generative AI differently than they do with search engines. Instead of short keyword phrases, they use conversational language, ask follow-up questions, and specify exactly what they want.</p>
<p>This creates a new dimension of optimization: creating content that aligns with how people prompt AI systems.</p>
<p>Consider these differences:</p>
<p><strong>Traditional search query</strong>: &#8220;best accounting software&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>AI prompt</strong>: &#8220;What&#8217;s the best accounting software for a family-owned restaurant with 12 employees that needs to track inventory and has a limited tech budget?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Traditional search query</strong>: &#8220;how to promote small business&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>AI prompt</strong>: &#8220;Can you suggest affordable marketing tactics for a new hair salon in a suburban area, focusing on attracting families and building repeat customers?&#8221;</p>
<p>These longer, more specific prompts require content that addresses nuanced questions and provides contextual information. One-size-fits-all content optimized for short keywords won&#8217;t satisfy these detailed requests.</p>
<p><strong>GEO tip</strong>: Create content that anticipates conversational prompts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research common question patterns in your industry.</li>
<li>Develop content that addresses specific use cases and scenarios.</li>
<li>Include comparisons that help AI differentiate between similar options.</li>
<li>Provide context-specific information (recommendations for different business sizes, industries, etc.).</li>

<h2>How to build a GEO strategy that works</h2>
<p>Now that you understand the differences between GEO and traditional SEO, here are tips to build your strategy.</p>
<h3>1. Design content for AI ingestion</h3>
<p>The first step in effective GEO is creating content that&#8217;s easily understood and extracted by AI systems. This goes beyond simple formatting to consider how AI processes and prioritizes information.</p>
<p><strong>Key principles for AI-optimized content</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Front-load critical information</strong>: Place key facts, definitions, and insights in the first few paragraphs.</li>
<li><strong>Use descriptive, keyword-rich headers</strong>: Make a section’s purpose immediately clear.</li>
<li><strong>Create self-contained sections</strong>: Each content block should stand on its own while fitting into the larger piece.</li>
<li><strong>Include clear signals of expertise</strong>: Demonstrate authority through data, expert quotes, and specific experience.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritize factual accuracy</strong>: AI systems increasingly verify information across sources.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f495.png" alt="💕" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Want more tips and ideas?</strong> We&#8217;ve got 130+ for you!

<h3>2. Create multi-modal content</h3>
<p>Generative AI is rapidly evolving beyond text to understand and generate responses based on images, video, and audio. This creates opportunities to optimize multiple content types for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-referral-traffic">AI visibility</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies for multi-modal GEO</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimize video content with structured transcripts</strong>: Include timestamps, speaker identification, and clear section markers.</li>
<li><strong>Add descriptive alt text to images</strong>: Help AI understand visual content with detailed descriptions.</li>
<li><strong>Create data visualizations with clear labels</strong>: Make charts and graphs interpretable for AI systems.</li>
<li><strong>Develop content that combines multiple formats</strong>: Publish articles with embedded videos, images, and structured data.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/video-embedded-in-blog-post-ahrefs-example.webp" alt="example of blog post with video summary embedded" width="900" height="855" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93138" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/video-embedded-in-blog-post-ahrefs-example.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/video-embedded-in-blog-post-ahrefs-example-480x456.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This approach ensures that when ChatGPT-4 or Google&#8217;s Gemini analyzes a topic you&#8217;ve covered, you&#8217;ll have a higher likelihood of being referenced.</p>
<h3>3. Use digital PR and thought leadership for AI visibility</h3>
<p>Building <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/topical-authority">authority signals</a> across the digital ecosystem is crucial for GEO success. This requires a strategic approach to digital PR and thought leadership that ensures your brand is recognized as an authoritative source by AI systems.</p>
<p><strong>Effective strategies for building AI-recognizable authority</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Secure mentions in respected industry publications</strong>: Focus on quality over quantity.</li>
<li><strong>Develop signature frameworks or methodologies</strong>: Create distinctive approaches that become associated with your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Participate in industry research reports</strong>: Contribute data or expertise to major studies.</li>
<li><strong>Build personal brand authority for key team members</strong>: Establish individual expertise that reinforces organizational authority.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/expert-webinar-example-susie.webp" alt="webinar expert feature example susie email" width="900" height="595" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93140" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/expert-webinar-example-susie.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/expert-webinar-example-susie-480x317.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create a consistent presence on platforms that feed AI training data</strong>: Regularly publish on high-authority sites.</li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>
<p>This multi-platform approach ensures that when generative AI responds to questions about visual web development or no-code tools, Webflow&#8217;s perspectives are frequently included, even without direct attribution.</p>
<h3>4. Future-proof your content strategy for GEO</h3>
<p>As generative AI evolves, maintaining visibility will require an adaptive, forward-looking strategy that balances traditional SEO with emerging GEO practices.</p>
<p><strong>Key principles for a future-proof content approach</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Balance depth with accessibility</strong>: Content that&#8217;s both comprehensive and easy for AI to parse.</li>
<li><strong>Invest in proprietary data</strong>: Original research that can&#8217;t be synthesized from other sources.</li>
<li><strong>Develop a distinctive brand voice</strong>: Unique perspectives that stand out in AI-generated content.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on expertise areas</strong>: Double down on topics where you have genuine authority.</li>
<li><strong>Create content that answers &#8220;why,&#8221; not just &#8220;what&#8221;:</strong> Provide context and reasoning that AI struggles to synthesize.</li>
</ul>
<div id="how-to-measure-geo-success"></div>
<h2>How to measure GEO success</h2>
<p>Measuring GEO effectiveness requires new metrics beyond traditional <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/27/seo-metrics">SEO KPIs</a> like rankings and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/03/organic-traffic">organic traffic</a>. Different tracking approaches are needed since the goal is to appear in AI-generated responses rather than drive direct website visits.</p>
<h3>Key metrics for GEO success</h3>
<p>Here are the metrics to keep an eye on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brand mention frequency</strong>: How often your brand appears in AI responses to relevant queries.</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy of representation</strong>: Whether AI systems correctly represent your products, services, and perspectives.</li>
<li><strong>Authority positioning</strong>: Whether you&#8217;re positioned as a primary or secondary source.</li>
<li><strong>Attribution rate</strong>: How often your brand receives direct attribution in AI responses.</li>
<li><strong>Competitive presence</strong>: How your mention frequency compares to competitors for similar queries.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tools to measure GEO results</h3>
<p>Several tools are emerging to help track these metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://labs.perplexity.ai/"><strong>Perplexity Labs</strong></a>: Allows monitoring of source attribution in Perplexity responses.</li>
<li><a href="https://contentlab.ai/"><strong>ContentLab AI</strong></a>: Tracks brand mentions across multiple AI platforms.</li>
<li><a href="https://brandmentions.com/"><strong>BrandMentions</strong></a>: Expanded to include AI mention monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Custom prompt testing</strong>: Systematically testing key industry prompts across AI platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re still in the early days of GEO measurement,&#8221; Oskar said. &#8220;But forward-thinking companies are already building systems to track their visibility in AI responses, similar to how we once tracked SERP rankings.&#8221;</p>
<p>A practical approach is to create a &#8220;prompt map&#8221; of the key questions in your industry, then regularly test these prompts across major AI platforms to track:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whether your brand is mentioned</li>
<li>How prominently you&#8217;re featured</li>
<li>Whether information is accurate</li>
<li>If competitors are mentioned more frequently</li>
</ol>
<p>This data can help guide your GEO strategy and measure improvement over time.</p>
<h2>GEO and the new search paradigm</h2>
<p>We&#8217;re witnessing the most significant shift in information discovery since Google&#8217;s inception. Just as some businesses failed to adapt to the move from print to digital, those who ignore the rise of generative AI risk becoming invisible in the new search landscape.</p>
<p>But this shift also creates unprecedented opportunities. Brands that understand how to create AI-optimized content, build recognized authority, and maintain presence across the digital ecosystem will find themselves naturally featured in the AI responses that increasingly shape how people find information.</p>
<p>The future of search is not about choosing between traditional SEO and GEO—it&#8217;s about creating an integrated strategy that ensures visibility regardless of how people seek information.</p>
<p>As you develop your approach, remember that while technology changes rapidly, the fundamentals remain the same: providing genuine value, demonstrating clear expertise, and meeting user needs will always be rewarded, regardless of which algorithms or AI systems stand between you and your audience.</p>
<p>For brands willing to embrace this new paradigm, the opportunities are just beginning to unfold.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the zero-click era that we live in now, it’s not about producing more content. It’s about creating content that&#8217;s strategically structured to demonstrate expertise across an entire topic.</p>
<p>That’s where topical authority comes in. When your site connects the dots, answers the full range of questions, and shows clear ownership of a subject, that’s when trust starts to build.</p>
<p>Topical authority isn’t a growth hack. It’s building compounding interest. The more clearly and completely you cover a topic, the more visible and credible you become across queries, snippets, and even AI-generated summaries.</p>
<p>This guide shares 14 proven strategies for building topical authority, from internal linking to semantic structure. Follow it to turn scattered posts into a focused content system that gets noticed and remembered.</p>

<h2>What is topical authority?</h2>
<p>Topical authority is the deep, organized expertise your site conveys on a specific subject. It <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google">increases your ability to rank</a> for related keywords. It’s not about publishing more content. It’s about covering a topic thoroughly and with intention.</p>
<p>The most effective sites aren’t content mills. They’re structured knowledge hubs. Instead of jumping between unrelated posts, they delve deeply into a core topic, exploring every angle and connecting the pieces through strategic<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/04/internal-linking"> internal linking</a>. Over time, this creates a content ecosystem that’s greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-animal-hospital.webp" alt="Topical authority - blog from an animal hospital." width="937" height="502" class="aligncenter wp-image-92429 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-animal-hospital.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-animal-hospital-480x257.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.animalhospitalofclemmons.com/site/veterinary-pet-care-blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>When you <a href="https://www.animalhospitalofclemmons.com/site/veterinary-pet-care-blog/category/dogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cover a topic completely</a>, like animal health, you prove your authority with algorithms and visitors.</p>
<p>As Stephanie Yoder, Director of Content at <a href="https://www.rebrandly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebrandly</a>, explains, “A content hub has to: 1. Be super important to your audience (otherwise, why invest the effort), 2. Be broad enough to warrant multiple posts that cover different facets of the topic, and 3. Have real SEO value. I typically look for overarching topics with lots of different dimensions. For example, ‘Employee Onboarding,’ which can then be broken down into subtopics like onboarding checklists, best practices, common mistakes, etc.”</p>
<p>When you structure your content this way (around a topic that matters, with clear depth and cohesion), you don’t just look authoritative. You become authoritative. That’s the signal Google is looking for and the kind of resource<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience"> your audience</a> will keep returning to.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4e3.png" alt="📣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>We’re just getting started!</strong> Get the free guide, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/increase-traffic-to-your-website?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website</a>, now</p>
<div id="why-does-topical-authority-matter"></div>
<h2>Why does topical authority matter?</h2>
<p>Topical authority isn’t just a best practice. It’s the bedrock of how modern search works.</p>
<p>Since Google launched the <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/08/helpful-content-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helpful Content System</a>, the algorithm favors sites that demonstrate genuine subject-matter expertise. Thin pages or disconnected posts won’t cut it. Search engines are looking for depth, clarity, and cohesion. These are now signals that show you’re not just creating content but answering real<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-intent"> user intent</a>.</p>
<p>That’s where topical authority gives you a strategic advantage. It improves your rankings, increases your relevance across long-tail queries, and builds lasting credibility.</p>
<p>Take Zapier, for example. Instead of publishing isolated tutorials, they built tightly structured guides, app comparisons, and use-case workflows. Each piece reinforces the others around core themes like automation and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-productivity-tools">productivity</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-zapier.webp" alt="Topical authority - Zapier blog." width="937" height="518" class="aligncenter wp-image-92430 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-zapier.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-zapier-480x265.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://zapier.com/resources/guides" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>That interconnected ecosystem now drives thousands of ranking keywords, steady <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2010/04/01/build-amazing-backlinks">backlinks</a>, and a compounding stream of non-branded traffic.</p>
<p>They don’t just rank for their product; they also rank for related products. They also rank for the problems their audience is trying to solve.</p>
<p>Topical authority makes you more visible, more trustworthy, and more useful. In a nutshell, that’s what <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-algorithm-documents-leak">Google is really measuring</a>.</p>
<div id="how-google-evaluates-topical-authority"></div>
<h2>How Google evaluates topical authority</h2>
<p>Google doesn’t publish an exact formula for measuring topical authority, but its behavior makes the framework clear. Here’s what Google is likely assessing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coverage of related subtopics:</strong> Are you answering the full range of questions your audience asks around this topic? Gaps in coverage often signal a lack of expertise.</li>
<li><strong>Internal link structure:</strong> Do your articles connect logically, guiding users and crawlers through a well-structured knowledge graph? Strong clusters show intent and organization.</li>
<li><strong>External validation:</strong> Are you earning links, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-citations">citations</a>, or mentions from other reputable sources? Authority spreads when others in your space acknowledge your work.</li>
<li><strong>Semantic relevance:</strong> Are your topics aligned under a clear thematic umbrella, with consistent terminology and supporting entities? Google&#8217;s semantic systems prioritize coherence over keyword repetition.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a deeper understanding of these signals, refer to<a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/hsw-sqrg.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Google’s documentation on search quality</a> and its alignment with topical breadth, site structure, and credibility.</p>

<div id="14-ways-to-build-topical-authority"></div>
<h2>14 ways to build topical authority</h2>
<p>The good news is that you have considerable control over establishing authority on your website. These 14 strategies will make sure you’ve done it thoroughly.</p>
<h3>Content strategy</h3>
<p>The first four tactics will help you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-plan">develop an authoritative content strategy</a>.</p>
<h4>1. Create comprehensive content hubs</h4>
<p>Use a hub-and-spoke model, also known as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/topic-clusters-for-local-seo">content clusters</a>, to organize your content. In this configuration, a central pillar page links to multiple subtopics, forming a semantic network Google can follow.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-topic-clusters.webp" alt="Topical authority - topic cluster graphic." width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92431 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-topic-clusters.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-topic-clusters-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>“A blog article scratches an itch. A hub cures the whole rash,” says <a href="https://oskarduberg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oskar Duberg</a>, a Content Marketing Consultant. &#8220;If it has subtopics, stages, or variations worth unpacking, it probably needs its own structured home.&#8221;</p>
<h4>2. Cover the entire topic, not just keywords</h4>
<p>Use semantic tools like <a href="https://alsoasked.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AlsoAsked</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/05/chatgpt-seo">ChatGPT</a> to discover subtopics. Your goal is to answer the complete set of user questions, not just high-volume queries.</p>
<p>A great example is <a href="https://www.healthline.com/program/managing-type-2-diabetes-with-food-and-fitness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Healthline&#8217;s diabetes content cluster</a>. Rather than writing one article on &#8220;diabetes symptoms,&#8221; they built a full ecosystem, covering causes, treatment options, diet plans, medication guides, and FAQs. This breadth and depth helped them dominate SERPs for thousands of diabetes-related queries, earning both rankings and trust.</p>

<h4>3. Build supporting content around pillars</h4>
<p>Think of your content ecosystem like a city grid: your pillar page is the downtown hub (e.g., “Diabetes: Symptoms, Causes, Treatment”), and the spoke articles are the surrounding neighborhoods that add depth and nuance.</p>
<p>Healthline follows this model masterfully. Their flagship diabetes pillar page includes links to detailed spokes such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Risk Factors &amp; Complications: “<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/kidney-disease/risk-chronic-kidney-disease-diabetes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Risk Factors for Chronic Kidney Disease with Type 2 Diabetes</a>”</li>
<li>Types &amp; Diagnosis: “<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes/is-type-2-diabetes-an-autoimmune-diease" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Is Type 2 Diabetes an Autoimmune Disease?</a>”</li>
<li>Nutrition Guidance: “<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/video/diabetes-nutrition-101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diabetes Nutrition 101</a>” article focuses solely on meal planning and dietary tips.</li>
<li>Mental Health Angle: “<a href="https://www.healthline.com/diabetesmine/becoming-a-diabetes-mental-health-professional" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why I’m Becoming a Diabetes Mental Health Professional</a>” article explores psychosocial aspects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each spoke enriches the overall narrative and reinforces the central pillar. Together, they improve user navigation and signal depth and cohesion to Google.</p>
<h4>4. Refresh and expand old content</h4>
<p>Show Google that your content is actively maintained. Update older pages with new data, improved structure, and refreshed internal links to signal relevance.</p>
<p>HubSpot is a standout example. They’ve been doing this for years. They routinely refresh high-performing posts by adding new stats, clarifying outdated advice, and optimizing for featured snippets.</p>
<p>Refreshing content isn’t just maintenance. It’s leverage. Instead of starting from scratch, you’re building on assets that already have authority, backlinks, and a search history.</p>
<h3>Structural signals</h3>
<p>Once you’ve developed content depth, structure is what helps Google (and users) recognize it. These next tactics are all about creating structure.</p>
<h4>5. Use internal linking strategically</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/04/internal-linking">Internal links</a> are the backbone of any content cluster. They guide users, shape topic relationships, and help search engines understand what belongs together.</p>
<p>The key is intentional linking. Don’t just drop links for convenience. Connect related pages using descriptive<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/anchor-text#:~:text=Anchor%20text%20is%20the%20clickable,and%20underline%20through%20html%20code."> anchor text</a> that accurately reflects the actual subtopics. This helps Google recognize content relationships at scale.</p>
<p>Oskar explains it this way: “Treat your content like a city grid. If you need a spreadsheet to keep track, good—you&#8217;re doing it right.”</p>
<p>Think of your main topic pages as central hubs. Then, use internal links to connect them to relevant spoke pages that go deeper. Tools like Screaming Frog or Link Whisper can help you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/10/content-audit">audit</a> and optimize your structure.</p>
<h4>6. Build clear URL structures around topics</h4>
<p>URL structure matters for both humans and search engines. Clean, keyword-rich URLs make it easier to understand what a page is about and how it fits into a broader content system.</p>
<p><strong>Poor URL structure:</strong><br />
example.com/blog?id=421<br />
(Doesn’t tell you anything about the topic.)</p>
<p><strong>Better URL structure:</strong><br />
example.com/seo/on-page-seo-guide<br />
(Clearly signals the category and specific topic.)</p>
<p>Where possible, group related URLs under consistent folders or subdirectories (e.g., /seo/, /email-marketing/). This reinforces topic clusters and improves crawl efficiency.</p>
<h4>7. Implement topic tags or categories</h4>
<p>Categories and tags aren’t just for organizing your blog. They help Google understand what your content is about and how everything connects.</p>
<p>But here’s the catch: they only work when used strategically. Random or excessive tagging, often called “tag bloat,” can confuse both users and search engines. A well-planned taxonomy reinforces topical authority by making your site easier to crawl, navigate, and group by meaning.</p>
<p>Categories should align with your main content themes—the high-level topics your audience returns to.</p>
<p>Tags should highlight specific subtopics, use cases, or recurring ideas that show up across multiple posts.</p>
<p>Real-world small business examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A local fitness coach&#8217;s blog</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Categories</em>: Strength Training, Nutrition, Mindset</li>
<li><em>Tags</em>: Home Workouts, Protein Intake, Burnout, Meal Prep</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>An ecommerce site selling eco-friendly home goods</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Categories</em>: Kitchen, Bathroom, Cleaning Products</li>
<li><em>Tags</em>: Plastic-Free, Compostable, Low-Waste Tips, DIY Cleaners</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>A digital marketing freelancer’s site</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Categories</em>: SEO, Social Media, Email Marketing</li>
<li><em>Tags</em>: Google Business Profile, Instagram Reels, Lead Magnets, Deliverability</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each tag or category should support a topic cluster. If a piece of content doesn’t clearly belong anywhere, either rework it to align better or reconsider whether it needs to exist at all.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-physical-therapy.webp" alt="Topical authority -physical therapist blog." width="937" height="583" class="aligncenter wp-image-92433 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-physical-therapy.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-physical-therapy-480x299.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.benchmarkpt.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Think of your taxonomy as a topic map for both readers and search engines. The clearer the structure, the stronger the authority signals it sends.</p>
<h4>8. Add a table of contents to long-form posts</h4>
<p>A table of contents (TOC) improves both usability and crawlability. It helps readers navigate longer guides without getting lost while also signaling subtopics to Google.</p>
<p>When each section in your TOC is linked with in-page anchors like the ones in this article (e.g., #what-is-topical-authority, #why-does-topical-authority-matter), you increase the chance of getting site links in SERPs or capturing featured snippet jump links.</p>
<p>On WordPress? Try the<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/luckywp-table-of-contents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> LuckyWP Table of Contents plugin</a> for an easy implementation.</p>
<h4>9. Use schema markup to enhance context</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/15/what-is-schema-markup">Schema markup</a> adds a layer of structured meaning to your content, helping Google understand what type of content it is and how it should appear in search.</p>
<p>Here are a few useful schema types for content clusters:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FAQ and HowTo:</strong> Ideal for practical subtopics or support-style articles.</li>
<li><strong>Article and Breadcrumb:</strong> Help define page structure and improve navigability.</li>
<li><strong>Organization, Author, and WebPage:</strong> Reinforce site credibility and ownership.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use tools like<a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/markup-helper/u/0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Google’s Structured Data Markup Helper</a> or<a href="https://schema.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Schema.org</a> to build valid markup or implement it using your CMS or SEO plugin.</p>
<h3>Authority and trust signals</h3>
<p>These final tips will help you demonstrate that your website has authority in a particular topic and highlight key trust signals to both readers and search engines.</p>
<h4>10. Get backlinks from topic-relevant sites</h4>
<p>Not all <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/10/link-building-secrets">backlinks</a> carry the same weight. A link from a general high-authority domain might boost your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/12/domain-authority">Domain Rating</a> (an estimate of how likely your web pages are to rank in search), but what matters for topical authority is relevance. Google gives more weight to backlinks from sites that operate in the same niche or cover similar subject matter.</p>
<p>That’s because topical links signal endorsement from within your own knowledge space. If you run a financial coaching blog and get linked from a niche investing site, that tells Google your insights are trusted <em>within the topic ecosystem</em>, not just by the internet at large.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Prioritize niche guest posts, podcast features, or digital PR opportunities where your content contextually fits the audience. A link from a niche authority will always outrank a random inclusion on a generalist site.</p>
<h4>11. Publish content written or reviewed by experts</h4>
<p>Google aims to elevate content written by individuals with proven expertise, particularly in sensitive or complex fields such as health, finance, or law. But this applies more broadly to any competitive topic where trust matters.</p>
<p>That means slapping a byline on a post isn’t enough. You need to show credentials, explain your experience, and, in some cases, cite the expert who reviewed the content.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-retirement.webp" alt="Topical authority -how to save for Retirement blog post." width="608" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92434 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-retirement.webp 608w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-retirement-480x474.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 608px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/how-to-save-for-retirement" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>“Publishing content for content’s sake won’t get you far,” Stephanie said. “To dominate a niche, you need to become a one-stop resource.”</p>
<p>Ways to demonstrate expertise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include a short author bio that explains why this person is qualified to write about the topic.</li>
<li>Add a “Reviewed by” section when content is medically, legally, or technically sensitive.</li>
<li>Link to your authors’ LinkedIn profiles, credentials, or previous industry work.</li>
</ul>
<h4>12. Feature original research or insights</h4>
<ol start="12"></ol>
<p>Few things build authority faster than original data.</p>
<p>Whether it’s a small survey, a large-scale study, or even just your own customer insights, publishing proprietary information positions your site as a source, not just a repeater.</p>
<p>It also earns backlinks. A standout example is Backlinko’s <a href="https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO Ranking Factors Study</a>, which analyzed over 11 million search results. That one piece has earned thousands of citations from sites like Forbes, HubSpot, and Search Engine Journal—and continues to surface in AI-generated content summaries years later.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-domain-rating.webp" alt="Topical authority -Backlinko data post." width="604" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92435 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-domain-rating.webp 604w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/topical-authority-wordstream-domain-rating-480x477.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 604px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>“Original research gets quoted, linked, and resurfaced by AI tools whether you asked for it or not,” Oskar said. “It’s a multiplier, not just a tactic.”</p>
<p>Not sure where to start? Even small data sets, such as the results of a LinkedIn poll or anonymized trends from your customer base, can be effective when presented clearly and tied to a broader narrative.</p>
<h4>13. Engage in thought leadership on the topic</h4>
<p>Google doesn’t just crawl your blog. It also captures off-site trust signals, especially on platforms where authorship and authority are more visible, such as<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/generating-leads-on-linkedin"> LinkedIn</a>, YouTube, or podcasts.</p>
<p>By consistently sharing your thoughts in public, you reinforce both human trust and algorithmic trust in your name, brand, and domain.</p>
<p>Examples of thought leadership channels:</p>
<ul>
<li>LinkedIn articles or long-form posts</li>
<li>Webinars, conference talks, or community events</li>
<li>Guest spots on industry podcasts</li>
<li>Contributed bylines (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/06/21/guest-posting-dos-donts">guest posting</a>) on niche publications</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need to be everywhere. But you do need to show up consistently in at least one or two places where your audience and Google can see that your expertise reaches beyond your own site.</p>
<h4>14. Include expert quotes or collaborators</h4>
<p>Bringing outside voices into your content is one of the easiest ways to boost credibility and often opens the door to natural backlinks or co-promotion.</p>
<p>Featuring an expert quote does three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adds trust and depth to your article</li>
<li>Signals topical authority to Google via co-citation</li>
<li>Makes the contributor more likely to share or link to your piece</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blog.turbotax.intuit.com/life/steps-establish-trusts-family-58800/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Tools like <a href="https://helpab2bwriter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Help a B2B Writer</a> and <a href="https://featured.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Featured</a> make it easy to source expert input. But you can also reach out directly to respected voices in your niche.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Treat expert collaboration like content co-creation, not just a last-minute add-on. Build it into your workflow early so your piece can be shaped (and strengthened) by real insights from the start.</p>
<div id="how-to-track-topical-authority-progress"></div>
<h2>How to track topical authority progress</h2>
<p>Topical authority isn’t a set-it-and-forget-it effort. Like any long-term strategy, it requires regular check-ins to measure progress and identify areas for improvement. Here are four high-signal metrics that tell you whether your efforts are paying off.</p>
<h3>Keyword universe growth</h3>
<p>Don’t just track a few <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2010/07/21/blog-keyword-targeting">target keywords</a>. Track how your universe is expanding. Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/online-seo-tools">SEO tools</a> like Ahrefs, Semrush, or Google Search Console to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;re showing up for more semantically related queries over time.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re capturing more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/long-tail-keywords">long-tail keywords</a> around your core topic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Growth in keyword variety (especially in lower-difficulty terms) shows that Google sees your content as a relevant answer source across the topic spectrum.</p>
<h3>Cluster ranking trends</h3>
<p>Instead of monitoring post-by-post performance, zoom out. Are multiple pages in the same topic cluster moving up in rankings?</p>
<p>When Google starts ranking your ecosystem, not just individual pages, that’s a strong signal of topical authority. It means your internal structure is working, and your content is seen as a comprehensive resource.</p>
<h3>Internal link coverage</h3>
<p>Strong internal linking helps keep your topic clusters cohesive. Use Ahrefs or Screaming Frog to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify orphaned or weakly linked pages.</li>
<li>Visualize internal link pathways between core topics and subtopics.</li>
<li>Check if your most authoritative content is linking out to relevant spokes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is less about quantity and more about semantic logic. Internal links should reinforce how your ideas connect.</p>
<h3>External recognition</h3>
<p>Topical authority isn’t just about what’s on your site. It’s also reflected in how others reference it. Look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mentions or citations in peer blogs, newsletters, or industry publications.</li>
<li>AI engine recognition (e.g., showing up in ChatGPT summaries or SGE panels).</li>
<li>Natural backlinks to your guides, data, or frameworks.</li>
</ul>
<p>When others view your site as the go-to source, Google often follows suit.</p>
<div id="future-proofing-your-topical-authority-strategy"></div>
<h2>Future-proofing your topical authority strategy</h2>
<p>SEO is evolving fast, but the core idea behind topical authority is built to last. Here’s how to stay ahead of the curve as search (and searchers) change:</p>
<h3>Follow helpful content principles</h3>
<p>Google’s Helpful Content System prioritizes content that’s written for people, not just for crawlers. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t publish unless it solves a real problem.</li>
<li>Prioritize clarity, completeness, and trustworthy sourcing.</li>
<li>Cut the filler—depth doesn’t mean word count.</li>
</ul>
<p>Topical authority isn’t about publishing more. It’s about building better answers across a structured topic map.</p>
<h3>Adapt for generative AI</h3>
<p>With <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-overviews-breaking-search">AI Overviews</a> and AI tools like ChatGPT shaping how people discover answers, topic depth matters more than ever.</p>
<p>AI systems summarize what they perceive as the most trustworthy and structured information. Sites that build clean, interconnected content clusters are more likely to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quoted directly in AI answers.</li>
<li>Used as source material for summaries.</li>
<li>Recommended as “further reading” in SGE carousels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Investing in topic modeling and semantic structure now helps you stay visible and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-referral-traffic">drive referral traffic from AI sources</a>, even when search becomes less clickable.</p>
<h3>Conduct quarterly audits</h3>
<p>Topical authority compounds over time, but only if it’s maintained.</p>
<p>Once a quarter, run an audit to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify underperforming or outdated pages.</li>
<li>Add internal links between new and legacy content.</li>
<li>Expand gaps in your clusters (new questions, subtopics, tools, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Build topical authority and own the rankings</h2>
<p>Google has moved from keyword matching to topic modeling. And that’s good news. Why? Because small sites can now compete with giants if they prove they know their stuff.</p>
<p>Start by mapping your core topics. Then, build content clusters around them, audit them quarterly, and keep sharpening the signal.</p>
<p>Topical authority isn’t just about ranking. It’s about earning trust, sustaining traffic, and becoming the site people (and algorithms) rely on.</p>

<h2>The current state of AI Overviews</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-overviews-statistics">AI Overviews</a>, first launched as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/19/google-search-generative-experience">Search Generative Experience</a> in May 2023, have already seen a measurable impact. A recent study by SparkToro found that over <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/2024-zero-click-search-study-for-every-1000-us-google-searches-only-374-clicks-go-to-the-open-web-in-the-eu-its-360/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">58%</a> of Google searches now result in zero clicks, meaning most users find what they need without ever engaging with external websites.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-mission-statement-png.avif" alt="ai overview for mission statement search" width="1128" height="620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90986" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-mission-statement-png.avif 1128w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-mission-statement-300x165.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-mission-statement-1024x563.avif 1024w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-mission-statement-768x422.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-mission-statement-1080x594.avif 1080w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-mission-statement-980x539.avif 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-overview-for-mission-statement-480x264.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1128px) 100vw, 1128px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An example of an AI Overview.</em></p>
<p>As Google continues to expand AI Overviews, this trend is expected to grow, further cutting into organic traffic and making traditional SEO tactics less effective.</p>
<p>Plus, AI Overviews now show for <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/study-google-ai-overviews-appear-in-47-of-search-results/535096/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">47%</a> of searches—most of those informational—but with the potential to spread to other types in the future.</p>
<p>But it’s not all bad news. While AI Overviews are changing the game, they’re also creating new opportunities for brands that know how to adapt. Google’s market share is still <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/new-research-google-search-grew-20-in-2024-receives-373x-more-searches-than-chatgpt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around 90%</a>, and search volume grew by 21% in 2024 (four times ChatGPT’s total search volume).</p>

<h2>5 ways AI Overviews are changing SEO forever (+how you can adapt to keep traffic and rankings)</h2>
<p>Let’s dive into the big ways AI Overviews are impacting SEO and what you can do about it.</p>
<div id="organic-clicks-are-plummeting"></div>
<h3>1. Organic clicks are plummeting</h3>
<p>The data makes it clear: A Semrush study of 10,000 informational keywords found that <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/ai-overviews-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI-generated summaries significantly reduced both organic and paid click-through rates</a>. Meanwhile, Moz’s latest research suggests that AI Overviews could slash organic traffic by <a href="https://moz.com/blog/ai-overviews-are-they-affecting-your-search-results-whiteboard-friday" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18% to 64%</a>, particularly for websites that provide straightforward informational content.</p>
<p>This shift is particularly concerning for businesses that rely on organic traffic to generate leads and revenue. If users no longer have to click through to find the information they need, websites will see fewer visits, which will lead to massive losses in revenue.</p>
<h4>How to adapt and maintain traffic</h4>
<p>Rather than competing with AI-generated summaries, businesses should focus on creating content that AI can’t easily replicate or condense. The key is to provide value beyond a quick answer by offering depth, originality, and real-world application.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create content with depth and complexity: </strong>AI excels at summarization but struggles with in-depth analysis. Publishing comprehensive, expert-backed content that explores topics from multiple angles will make your content harder to replace.
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Example</em></strong><em>: </em><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-chrome-sale">Google May Have to Sell Chrome: What You Need to Know</a>. This article goes beyond surface-level reporting with expert-led analysis and bold opinions AI can&#8217;t replicate. While an AI Overview might summarize the basic facts, it can’t capture the nuance of potential market impacts and forward-looking insights.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Leverage original research and unique data: </strong>AI models pull information from existing sources, which means they cannot generate new data on their own. Websites that publish original research, proprietary data, and industry reports can offer something AI simply cannot replicate. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/10/best-online-survey-tools">Conducting surveys</a>, running experiments, and presenting firsthand insights will make content more valuable and difficult for AI to summarize.
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Example:</em></strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-google-ads-benchmarks">Google Ads Benchmarks for 2025: New Trends &amp; Insights for Key Industries</a>. This piece analyzes over 16,000 U.S.-based search advertising campaigns from April 2024 through March 2025, providing proprietary data on metrics such as click-through rates, cost per click, conversion rates, and cost per lead across various industries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-Google-Ads-Benchmarks-Chart-scaled.webp" alt="google ads benchmarks overall metrics chart 2025" width="2560" height="2043" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91521" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-Google-Ads-Benchmarks-Chart-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-Google-Ads-Benchmarks-Chart-1280x1022.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-Google-Ads-Benchmarks-Chart-980x782.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-Google-Ads-Benchmarks-Chart-480x383.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 2560px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Provide case studies and real-world applications: </strong>One of the best ways to differentiate content is by showcasing real-world applications through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/03/how-to-write-a-case-study">case studies</a>. AI-generated summaries provide general information, but they lack the nuance of real experiences. Businesses that share in-depth success stories, failures, and lessons learned create content that feels more practical, credible, and engaging.
<ul>
<li><strong>​</strong><strong><em>Example</em></strong><em>:</em> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/01/seo-case-study">SEO Case Study: How I Increased SEO Traffic by 600% in 24 Months</a>. This piece details the strategies employed to achieve a substantial increase in SEO traffic, offering readers practical insights into effective SEO practices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Develop step-by-step, highly detailed ‘how-to’ guides: </strong>While AI can generate general guides, it often lacks the ability to walk users through complex processes with precision. Content that breaks down tasks into clear, actionable steps (especially when combined with screenshots, video tutorials, or interactive elements) can make a significant difference in engagement and retention.
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Example</em></strong><em>:</em> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-run-google-ads">How to Run Google Ads: The Step-by-Step Recipe to Success</a> resource. This guide simplifies Google Ads with a structured, easy-to-follow process supported by screenshots, examples, and a video.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Optimize for featured snippets to maintain visibility: </strong>Although AI Overviews dominate the top of search results, featured snippets remain a valuable way to capture attention. Structuring content in a way that makes it easy for Google to feature (such as using clear subheadings, bullet points, and concise answers) can help businesses remain visible even as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/03/organic-traffic">organic traffic</a> declines.
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Example:</em></strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/zero-click-searches">4 Ways to Optimize for Zero-Click Searches</a>​.

<h3>2. Content summaries can misrepresent brands</h3>
<p>AI-generated summaries pull information from multiple sources, often stripping away essential context or excluding critical details. This can result in misrepresentation of a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/27/brand-messaging">brand’s messaging</a>, leading to confusion, diminished trust, and lost conversions. Unlike human-curated content, AI Overviews do not prioritize brand intent, which means that businesses risk losing control over how they are perceived in search results.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s an example of how AI summaries can cause problems:</strong> In February 2025, Google&#8217;s AI chatbot, Gemini AI, falsely claimed in a Super Bowl ad that Gouda cheese accounts for &#8220;<a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/business/google-edited-super-bowl-ad-after-viewers-cited-by-gemini-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50-60%</a> of the world&#8217;s cheese consumption.&#8221; This faulty statistic sparked social media backlash and led Google to quietly edit the ad to remove the incorrect information. The incident underscored how AI-generated content can disseminate false information, potentially misleading audiences and harming brand credibility.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ai-gouda-stat-discrepancy.webp" alt="google ai showing incorrect stat for gouda consumption" width="1200" height="889" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91579" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ai-gouda-stat-discrepancy.webp 1200w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ai-gouda-stat-discrepancy-980x726.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ai-gouda-stat-discrepancy-480x356.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/business/google-edited-super-bowl-ad-after-viewers-cited-by-gemini-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<h4>How to maintain control over your brand message</h4>
<p>While businesses cannot directly control AI-generated summaries, they can take proactive steps to influence how AI interprets their content. The key is to structure content in a way that reinforces brand messaging and ensures that AI pulls the most relevant details.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structure content with AI-friendly summaries: </strong>Since AI prioritizes content that is easy to extract and summarize, brands should create clearly defined sections that highlight key takeaways.
<ul>
<li>“Think of AI Overviews like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-citations">citations</a>: Write your content as if it&#8217;s the perfect key takeaway someone would highlight in an article. AI Overviews prioritize clear, helpful information, so focus on easy-to-understand definitions, examples, and explanations without burying them in long paragraphs or filler. Formatting matters too. Based on my experience, AI Overviews rely on header hierarchy to extract key information,” said Rease Rios, Senior Content Marketing Manager at <a href="https://www.postman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Postman</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overview-example-with-content-source.webp" alt="ai overview example for how to clean a pool with content source example" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91580" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overview-example-with-content-source.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overview-example-with-content-source-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use structured data to reinforce key information: “</strong>Formatting matters too. Based on my experience, AI Overviews rely on header hierarchy to extract key information,” Rease adds.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/15/what-is-schema-markup">Schema markup</a> helps search engines understand a page’s content more accurately. Businesses can reduce the risk of AI misinterpretation by adding structured data that defines brand values, product benefits, and unique selling propositions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ensure brand values and USPs appear early in the content: </strong>AI often pulls information from the beginning of an article or webpage. Placing a company’s mission, differentiators, and core value propositions within the first few sentences increases the chances that AI will include them in its summary.</li>
<li><strong>Publish authoritative content across multiple trusted sources: </strong>Since AI gathers information from a variety of sources, businesses can reinforce their messaging by ensuring consistency across multiple platforms. Guest posts, PR mentions, and collaborations with authoritative industry websites can help shape the data AI pulls when generating summaries.</li>
</ul>

<div id="authority-signals-matter-more-than-ever"></div>
<h3>3. Authority signals matter more than ever</h3>
<p>“Authority matters because internet users get savvier every day,” Rease said.</p>
<p>Google recognizes that, so its AI Overviews tend to prioritize content from authoritative sources, making it significantly harder for smaller or newer websites to gain visibility.</p>
<p>Since AI-generated summaries pull information from sources deemed trustworthy by Google, businesses without an established <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/06/online-reputation-management">online reputation</a> risk being overshadowed by industry giants.</p>
<p>Google’s Search Quality Guidelines emphasize the importance of Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (EEAT) in ranking content. AI Overviews follow these same principles, favoring information from well-recognized publishers, government websites, and established industry leaders.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/google-eeat.webp" alt="definition of google e-eat" width="918" height="580" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90007" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/google-eeat.webp 918w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/google-eeat-480x303.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 918px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Studies by Ahrefs have also shown that <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/impact-of-links/">websites with a strong backlink profile—particularly those with links from reputable domains—are far more likely to appear in AI-curated search results</a>. This means that without a strong foundation of credibility and authority, smaller businesses may struggle to compete.</p>
<h4>How to establish authority and improve AI visibility</h4>
<p>For businesses looking to improve their chances of being featured in AI Overviews, the key is to build credibility through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/better-content-performance">strategic content efforts</a> and high-quality backlinks. Here’s how to do it effectively:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Secure backlinks from trusted industry websites: </strong>AI places a heavy emphasis on authority, and backlinks from reputable sources act as endorsements of a site’s credibility. Focus on earning links from well-respected industry blogs, major publications, and educational institutions by publishing valuable content that others want to reference.</li>
<li><strong>Publish thought leadership content featuring expert insights: </strong>AI Overviews favor content written by recognized experts in their fields. Businesses can increase their perceived authority by producing in-depth articles, whitepapers, and research-backed reports featuring insights from industry professionals. Including author bios that highlight credentials can further strengthen credibility.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborate with established industry leaders: </strong>Partnering with recognized experts through guest posts, interviews, and co-authored content can enhance a brand’s authority. Being cited or featured in reputable sources also increases the likelihood that AI will consider a website trustworthy enough to pull information from.</li>
<li><strong>Regularly update content with fresh data and authoritative references: </strong>AI favors content that is both relevant and well-supported by reliable sources. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-repurposing">Regularly updating blog posts</a>, case studies, and research articles with the latest statistics, reports, and citations from trusted organizations ensures that content remains competitive in AI-driven search results.</li>
</ul>
<div id="long-tail-and-niche-keywords-are-growing-in-importance"></div>
<h3>4. Long-tail and niche keywords are growing in importance</h3>
<p>AI Overviews are optimized for broad, high-volume search queries but often struggle to provide relevant answers for specific, nuanced searches. This presents an opportunity for businesses to target long-tail and niche keywords, capturing high-intent traffic that AI may overlook.</p>
<p>Because AI-generated summaries pull generalized information from authoritative sources, they tend to offer one-size-fits-all responses. However, when users search for highly specific queries, such as industry-specific recommendations or in-depth comparisons, AI often fails to deliver personalized insights.</p>
<p>Postman is a great example: The company is shown twice in AI Overviews and once in the feature snippet for the keyword “soap api.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/soap-api-ai-overview-example.webp" alt="postman blog showing twice in ai overview for soap api search" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91582" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/soap-api-ai-overview-example.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/soap-api-ai-overview-example-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>How to capitalize on AI’s weaknesses</h4>
<p>To compete effectively, businesses should focus on keywords that require depth, expertise, and niche-specific knowledge. Here’s how to identify and optimize for these opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use keyword tools to find AI-resistant queries: </strong>AI struggles with highly detailed, less frequently searched queries. Tools like AlsoAsked, AnswerThePublic, and Google’s ‘People Also Ask’ can reveal questions AI may not answer well, giving businesses the chance to create content that fills those gaps. (You can also try <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">WordStream&#8217;s Free Keyword Tool</a> to help here!)</li>
<li><strong>Create in-depth, industry-specific content: </strong>Generic AI summaries cannot match content that provides specialized insights. Businesses should focus on producing articles that incorporate expert perspectives, detailed comparisons, and real-world applications relevant to a specific audience.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Looking for more ways to drive people to your site?</strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website</a></p>
<div id="visual-and-video-content-is-gaining-ground"></div>
<h3>5. Visual and video content is gaining ground</h3>
<p>As AI Overviews evolve, they increasingly prioritize video and visual content over traditional text-based answers. This shift gives an advantage to businesses investing in multimedia, particularly video tutorials, product demonstrations, and visually engaging content.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wyzowl.com/video-marketing-statistics/"><strong>91%</strong></a><strong> of businesses say video marketing has increased their traffic</strong>, according to Wyzowl’s Video Marketing Report.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.godatafeed.com/blog/google-ai-overview-prefers-video"><strong>Google’s AI favors video-based tutorials</strong></a><strong> and product demos</strong> because they provide a more engaging and practical way to answer user queries.</li>
</ul>
<p>With AI Overviews now embedding video content directly in search results, businesses that leverage multimedia effectively can gain an edge over competitors relying solely on written content.</p>
<h4>How to optimize for AI-driven video search</h4>
<p>To increase visibility in AI-powered search, brands must ensure their video content is both high-quality and optimized for discovery. Here’s how:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create video content designed for search: </strong>Videos should target specific search queries, with keyword-rich titles, detailed descriptions, and timestamps that help Google understand their content. AI favors well-structured videos that clearly answer user intent.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overview-video-example.png" alt="ai overview example with video result and format" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91583" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overview-video-example.png 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overview-video-example-480x308.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Embed videos in blog posts and landing pages: </strong>Businesses should integrate videos into existing web pages rather than rely on video content alone. Relevant tutorials or demonstrations can boost on-page engagement and improve rankings in AI-driven search.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage YouTube SEO to drive traffic: </strong>Since Google prioritizes YouTube content in AI Overviews, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/youtube-seo">optimizing for YouTube search is crucial</a>. This includes writing detailed descriptions, adding relevant tags, and using engaging thumbnails to improve click-through rates.</li>
</ul>
<div id="how-to-future-proof-your-strategy"></div>
<h2>Strategies to future-proof your SEO approach</h2>
<p>As AI Overviews continue to reshape search results, businesses must adapt their <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/2025-local-seo-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO strategies</a> to stay competitive. The key is to create content that AI struggles to replicate, optimize for structured visibility, and build brand authority across multiple platforms.</p>
<div id="develop-ai-resistant-content"></div>
<h3>1. Develop &#8220;AI-resistant&#8221; content</h3>
<p>&#8220;The best way to make your content AI-resistant isn’t to fight the algorithm. It’s to be irreplaceable. That means leaning into your brand voice and using authentic storytelling. When your content has personality and a perspective that AI can’t replicate, it naturally stands out. The content game is still about quality,” said <a href="https://oskarduberg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oskar Duberg</a>, a freelance content specialist.</p>
<p>&#8220;AI-generated content is elevator music. Bland, forgettable, and very easy to tune out. To really stand out, your content needs a pulse. A beat. That means authentic storytelling, a clear perspective, and insights that come from personal experience, not just data,” Oskar said.</p>
<p>AI is excellent at summarizing widely available information, but it struggles with content that requires original thought, deep storytelling, and expert analysis<strong>.</strong> To ensure your content remains valuable and difficult for AI to replace, focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Publishing proprietary research that AI cannot replicate: </strong>Conduct original studies, run surveys, and publish unique data that adds fresh insights to your industry. AI cannot generate or summarize data that does not already exist.</li>
<li><strong>Interviewing industry experts for firsthand insights: </strong>AI pulls from existing sources, but expert interviews introduce fresh perspectives and nuanced opinions that AI cannot fabricate.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Creating in-depth product comparisons that require subjective judgment</strong>: AI can summarize feature lists, but it struggles with subjective opinions, detailed comparisons, and personal recommendations that involve human decision-making.</li>
<li><strong>Writing case studies with real-world applications: </strong>AI cannot replicate real customer experiences, success stories, or business challenges. Detailed case studies with tangible results make your content irreplaceable.</li>
</ul>
<p>By focusing on unique, high-value content that AI cannot easily summarize, businesses can safeguard their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-trends-and-predictions-rest-of-2025">SEO performance</a> despite AI-driven changes.</p>

<h3>2. Optimize for &#8220;snippet-worthy&#8221; formatting</h3>
<p>AI Overviews are drawn to well-structured content that&#8217;s easy to extract and display. If you want to increase your chances of showing up in AI-generated search results, optimizing for featured snippets and AI-friendly formatting is essential.</p>
<p>Stephanie Yoder, Director of Content at <a href="https://www.rebrandly.com/">Rebrandly</a>, puts it best: “To make your content AI-friendly, use clear headers (H2, H3) with relevant keywords. AI scans these headings to get a sense of your content, so optimized headers are key to boosting visibility.</p>
<p>Bullet points and numbered lists are also crucial because AI prefers concise, scannable information, and lists make it easier for the algorithm to pull your key takeaways. Lastly, structuring your content in a Q&amp;A or FAQ format is a game-changer. AI loves pulling from Q&amp;A sections, so answering common industry questions increases your odds of getting featured in snippets.”</p>

<p>By following these best practices, you&#8217;re not just improving your AI visibility; you’re also ensuring your content stands out in organic search.</p>

<h3>3. Strengthen brand authority</h3>
<p>&#8220;With AI prioritizing trusted sources, building authority across multiple platforms is more critical than ever. Google’s AI is more likely to reference brands that have a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/online-presence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong digital presence</a> and recognized expertise,” Stephanie said<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>To establish authority:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Earn mentions in high-authority industry publications: </strong>AI Overviews rely on information from trusted sources. Getting featured in top-tier publications and respected industry blogs improves credibility.</li>
<li><strong>Publish content on third-party platforms like LinkedIn and Medium: </strong>AI pulls from multiple sources, not just your website. Expanding your content distribution to high-authority platforms increases visibility.</li>
<li><strong>Actively engage in digital PR and guest posting: </strong>AI favors well-known thought leaders. Writing guest posts, contributing to industry discussions, and securing media coverage strengthen brand recognition.</li>
</ul>

<p>“I like to think of AI Overviews as being cited as a source. You may not always get the traffic, but you will get the brand recognition and authority from being a trusted source” Rease said.</p>
<h2>Stay ahead of the AI Overviews game</h2>
<p>The rise of AI Overviews marks a fundamental shift in how search engines deliver information. As traditional SEO strategies evolve, businesses must embrace original research, optimize for structured visibility, and build brand authority to maintain their competitive edge.</p>
<p>Those who adapt to AI-driven changes—by creating high-value, AI-resistant content and strengthening their digital presence across authoritative platforms—will not only survive but thrive in the evolving world of search.</p>
