<h2>2024 SEO trends</h2>
<p>This year will be all about how Google and users respond to the mass influx of AI-generated content flooding the internet as we speak. Some marketers will use AI to simply pump out AI-generated drafts, but those who take additional steps to create the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/15/quality-content-defined">highest-quality content</a> possible will rise to the top of the rankings in 2024.</p>
<p>And with the mass influx of AI-generated content, backlinks, brand signals, and other authority indicators will likely see a resurgence this year. Google wants to provide the highest-quality search results for users, and from the most<strong> trusted, reputable, and authoritative sources.</strong></p>
<p>By following these important 2024 SEO trends, you can make sure your content meets both the quality and authority signals Google will be looking for in 2024.</p>
<div id="search-intent-importance"></div>
<h3>1. Search intent will be king</h3>
<p>Search intent will continue to be the North Star for how organic marketers should create their content this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-intent">Search intent</a> refers to the true intention behind the user’s search. Meeting search intent requires a nuanced understanding of how your target audience uses search engines.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/keyword-intent-wordstream.jpg" alt="keyword intent chart" width="859" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73944" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/keyword-intent-wordstream.jpg 859w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/keyword-intent-wordstream-480x335.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 859px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Marketers traditionally have used four primary categories to discuss search intent: Navigational, Transactional, Commercial, and Informational searches. A <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/future-of-seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent study</a> showed that transactional and commercial keywords appear to be on the rise, while informational and navigational queries are declining.</p>
<p>Some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-seo-tools">keyword tools</a> will now display search intent alongside keyword metrics like search volume and cost-per-click so you can understand the intent behind your keyword targets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-keyword-tool-with-intent-information.webp" alt="keyword tool with intent information " width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79285" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-keyword-tool-with-intent-information.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-keyword-tool-with-intent-information-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-intent">Source</a></em></p>
<p>But it’s still important to study the top-ranking results to see what Google thinks users are looking for. Although the four categories of search intent are helpful, it’s also important to think about what type of content users are expecting and what their exact needs are.</p>
<p>Are they seeking a quick answer? A detailed explanation? A product page? An actionable guide? A video tutorial? A list with multiple options to compare? Will they likely have follow-up questions to their initial search query that you can answer before they even ask them?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-marketing-trends-2024">Artificial Intelligence tools</a> can certainly replicate the topics they see in top-ranking results, but thinking closely about users’ exact needs still requires a human touch.</p>
<p>Google recently <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/11/search-quality-rater-guidelines-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simplified its Search Rater Quality Guidelines</a> regarding how it defines content that meets the needs of users. That simplification, however, does not mean that your content should be any less high-quality or helpful.</p>
<p>It means that Google cares very much about ranking the most relevant and useful results, and wants webmasters to understand what quality content looks like. To reach the top of the SERP results for your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-targeting">target keywords</a>, your content needs to show that you understand exactly what it is that users are looking for.</p>

<div id="increase-in-question-keywords-and-answers"></div>
<h3>2. Increase in question keywords and answers</h3>
<p>Answering questions will continue to be a big SEO trend and a valuable strategy in 2024. According to <a href="https://moz.com/mozcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MozCast</a>, People Also Ask results currently appear in over 90% of searches.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-google-serp-features.webp" alt="list of the top google search engine results pages features" width="789" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79286" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-google-serp-features.webp 789w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-google-serp-features-480x364.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 789px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://moz.com/mozcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Although Google is simplifying how they display answers to questions (they got rid of both the <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/08/howto-faq-changes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAQ and How-To rich results</a> in 2023), answering questions is still a great way to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/19/get-on-first-page-google">get on the first page of results</a>.</p>
<p>To find questions, you can look directly to the SERPs to see what questions populate the People Also Ask feature.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-people-also-ask-example.webp" alt="example of a people also ask feature on google serp" width="936" height="402" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79287" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-people-also-ask-example.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-people-also-ask-example-480x206.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Or use a keyword tool that makes it easy to identify related question keywords from a seed keyword.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-keyword-tool-question-keywords.webp" alt="example of keyword tool outputs for question keywords" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79288" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-keyword-tool-question-keywords.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-keyword-tool-question-keywords-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Then, find ways to incorporate those questions and answers into your content through strategies such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adding <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/24/faq-page">FAQ sections</a> to your web pages</strong>. These can be easily incorporated into your web design through expandable dropdown menus.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/27/blog-post-ideas">Create blog posts</a> around questions</strong> that require detailed answers. You can use the H2s of your post to introduce the common questions related to a topic and the body of the section to provide answers.</li>
<li><strong>Have a dedicated page for the most common questions</strong> people ask about your products or services. This can also be a great resource for your customer and sales teams when interacting with current or potential customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another benefit of targeting question keywords is they often have lower <a href="https://www.linkgraph.com/blog/what-is-keyword-difficulty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keyword Difficulty</a> and are thus easier to rank for, making this strategy a particularly good one for newer websites.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6e0.png" alt="🛠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Running Google Ads along with your organic strategy?

<div id="creators-share-firsthand-experiences"></div>
<h3>3. Creators will share more first-hand experience</h3>
<p>Google added “Experience” to its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/14/google-e-e-a-t">E-E-A-T</a> algorithm a little over a year ago. With more content on the web generated by AI, first-hand experience will continue to be a defining factor in top-ranking content in 2024.</p>
<p>There are many ways you can leverage your experience in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/11/28/content-strategy">content strategy</a>. First, is in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/13/content-creation">content creation</a>. Consider adding the following elements to your content to showcase your experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Real-world examples</strong>: Whether from clients, past customers, or your own personal experiences in your industry. Real-world, personal, and original examples are something that AI can’t replicate.</li>
<li><strong>Case studies</strong>: <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/03/how-to-write-a-case-study">Case studies</a> show your work with past clients, customers, and the tangible results of first-hand experience in your industry.</li>
<li><strong>Data and insights: </strong>Hard data and statistics gathered from your own research or reporting is great for building credibility and showcasing your real-world experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to your content, including bylines, author bios, and linking to your creators’ social media profiles will showcase that your content is written by experienced creators.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-experienced-creator-author-bio-example.webp" alt="example of author bio to showcase experience, expertise, and authority with published content" width="936" height="356" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79289" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-experienced-creator-author-bio-example.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-experienced-creator-author-bio-example-480x183.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/28/facebook-advertising-benchmarks">Source</a></em></p>
<p>For example, I’ve worked hard to establish my experience as an SEO professional by writing articles, posting on social media, and updating my own personal website content consistently.</p>
<p>As a result, Google now associates me as an SEO professional and knows that I have first-hand experience in that area.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-creator-profile-google.webp" alt="screenshot of results for manick bhan on google" width="936" height="522" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79290" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-creator-profile-google.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-creator-profile-google-480x268.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This not only benefits the organic ranking potential of the content I publish on my own websites but also makes me more valuable as a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/01/20/guest-blogging">guest blogger</a> or author on other websites.</p>
<p>So if you are writing your own content in 2024, make sure that you&#8217;re leveraging your experience. And if you are <a href="https://www.mightyscribes.com/blog/how-to-hire-a-writer-for-your-blog/">hiring content writers</a>, make sure to consider their experience as a part of your vetting process.</p>

<h3>4. Building topical authority will be important</h3>
<p>Topical authority has been important to Google for years, and it is particularly important for news, health, finance, and political websites.</p>
<p>Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/05/understanding-news-topic-authority" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Topic Authority system</a> prioritizes rankings for those websites that have more expertise in specific topics or coverage areas.</p>
<p>But even if you are outside of those <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/niche-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">niches</a>, you should still be striving to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/12/domain-authority">build topical authority</a> in your industry.</p>
<p>Topical authority is displayed primarily through:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content breadth</strong>: Multiple pieces of high-quality content that explore all of the related subtopics of your primary topic areas.</li>
<li><strong>Content depth</strong>: Detailed, in-depth articles that answer all of the questions related to those specific subtopics. It’s also helpful to include original reporting and insights (i.e. “experience”).</li>
<li><strong>Internal links</strong>: Links between relevant pieces of content that show users and search engines both the breadth and depth of your content offering.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, look at this example of a pet website. They have taken the time to build out hundreds of pieces of informational content about dogs with subtopics such as dog breeds, dog health and wellness, dog nutrition, and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-topical-authority-example.webp" alt="example of site that's built topical authority around dogs " width="936" height="525" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79291" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-topical-authority-example.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-topical-authority-example-480x269.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>What’s the benefit of all that content depth and breadth? This website ranks for over 1.1 million organic keywords.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-benefits-of-building-topical-authority.webp" alt="analytics that show the benefits of building topical authority in the form of organic traffic and rankings" width="936" height="498" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79292" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-benefits-of-building-topical-authority.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-benefits-of-building-topical-authority-480x255.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>High-quality <a href="https://www.linkgraph.com/blog/what-are-backlinks/">backlinks</a> can also showcase your brand’s topical authority. If many websites in your industry are linking to your content, it shows Google that your website is considered an authority by others in your industry.</p>
<p>So promoting your content in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/03/18/content-marketing-versus-public-relations">public relations</a>, digital PR, and social media with the hopes that others might link to it, is also a great strategy for building topical authority in your niche.</p>
<div id="topical-maps-in-content-strategy"></div>
<h3>5. Topical maps in content strategy will be huge</h3>
<p>Topical maps will be a huge SEO trend in 2024. Why? Because they provide a roadmap for how to build topical authority.</p>
<p>A topical map outlines all of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-content-beginners-guide">SEO content</a> you need to create to cover a particular topic in breadth and depth. Here’s an example of a topical map created in spreadsheets for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/28/technical-seo">technical SEO</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-topical-authority-map-excel.webp" alt="example of topical authority map in excel sheet" width="683" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79293" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-topical-authority-map-excel.webp 683w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-topical-authority-map-excel-480x422.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 683px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>When done manually, topical mapping requires hours of keyword research and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/11/pillar-pages">keyword clustering</a>. But with the help of artificial intelligence, topical mapping can now be completed fairly quickly.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-topical-map-generator.webp" alt="example of topical map generator tool" width="936" height="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79294" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-topical-map-generator.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-topical-map-generator-480x256.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You can build topical maps with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-seo-tools">SEO tools</a> like <a href="http://searchatlas.com">Search Atlas</a>.  </em></p>
<p>The main benefit of topical maps is that they allow you to generate a comprehensive <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/18/content-optimization">SEO content strategy</a> quickly. Your content team will know exactly what topics need to be covered to establish authority in your niche and the target keywords they should optimize that content for.</p>
<p>Then, you can use AI content tools to help generate content ideas and outlines around those topics. Or, you can send that topical map off to your content writers. Repeat the process of topical mapping for each of the primary topic areas that are relevant to your website.</p>
<p>Adding those content pieces to your website and showing their relationship through <a href="https://www.linkgraph.com/blog/internal-links-for-seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal links</a>, is a great way to earn hundreds to thousands of new organic keyword rankings in 2024.</p>

<h3>6. AI content will be created at scale (for better or worse)</h3>
<p>Experts are estimating that by 2026, <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/cms/sites/default/files/documents/Europol_Innovation_Lab_Facing_Reality_Law_Enforcement_And_The_Challenge_Of_Deepfakes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90%</a> of online content will be synthetically-generated. Some AI tools now empower marketers to create content in bulk. That can mean generating all of the content of a topical map (AKA hundreds of articles) in just a few hours. In 2024, our collective content velocity will blow through the roof.</p>
<p>And bulk content creation is not against <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/02/google-search-and-ai-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s guidelines</a>, as long as the resulting content is valuable, high-quality, and helpful to users and meets their E–E-A-T guidelines. It is only a violation if, as stated in their guidelines, it is used “to produce content for the primary purpose of manipulating search rankings.”</p>
<p>As AI gets smarter and better at generating high-quality content, the vague line that Google has drawn will certainly get harder to define and penalize. Will some marketers leverage the power of automation to generate average content that is rich in focus terms but low on value to simply gain organic traffic? Certainly.</p>
<p>But it’s still best to look at AI outputs as a starting point, not the finishing line. The most effective <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/08/content-creator">content creators</a> of 2024 will use AI to speed up the writing process while taking the time to meet search intent, showcase their experience, and provide the most valuable, <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/helpful-content-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helpful content</a> for users.</p>
<p>Marketers will need to realize that AI content is the new frontier of SEO. Some of your competitors will likely use AI content tools to create hundreds to thousands of new pieces of content this year. If you don’t start using these tools as well, you will fall behind.</p>
<p>Not sure what tools you should be using or where to start? Check out this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/25/ai-content-generators">list of AI content tools</a> to find options that best fit your needs.</p>

<div id="regularly-update-content"></div>
<h3>7. Content will need to be regularly updated</h3>
<p>With the mass influx of AI-generated content coming our way this year, competition is about to get a lot stiffer for all of our keywords. If you have a piece of content that is currently performing well, protect your top positions by making sure it is updated regularly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/09/google-ranking-factors">Google’s ranking algorithm</a> still has some recency signals that will likely create fluctuations in top-ranking positions as new content is posted, but backlinks, topic authority, and content quality will beat out recency in the long term.</p>
<p>In the past, updating content every 1-3 years was usually sufficient for maintaining rankings, but in 2024, a yearly <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/29/fresh-content-google-ranking-factor">content refresh</a> should become a part of your standard workflow.</p>
<p>To refresh your content for maximum SEO, here are a few suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confirm that all data and statistics are accurate and the most up-to-date as possible.</li>
<li>Link to the newest research, case studies, and news articles.</li>
<li>Rewrite the content. That means entirely new introductions, insights, and examples.</li>
<li>Check all internal and external links. Repair broken links or replace links with 301 redirects.</li>
<li>Keep building backlinks! A content refresh or rewrite is a great occasion for promoting your content in social media, public relations, and to your existing email subscribers.</li>
</ul>
<div id="brand-signals-grow-in-importance"></div>
<h3>8. Brand signals will grow in importance</h3>
<p>With so much synthetic content, your brand’s name and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/06/online-reputation-management">reputation</a> will hold SEO power in 2024, as long as you’ve done the work to establish your brand name online.</p>
<p>Let’s be clear: Google does not prioritize big brands over smaller brands in search engine rankings. But Google uses signals like branded anchor text and branded search volume to understand whether your website is well-trusted and authoritative.</p>
<p>As Google continues to care more about experience and expertise to separate the wheat from the chaff in content, there’s never been a better time to embrace your brand name and leverage it.</p>
<p>Here are a few simple ways you can improve your brand signals for SEO purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Link to your social media pages from your website and vice versa</strong>. This shows Google that your website has a social presence and life outside of your website.</li>
<li><strong>Have robust About pages and Contact pages</strong>. This shows that there are real people behind your website and content&#8211;and that they are experienced!</li>
<li><strong>Invest in public relations outreach</strong>. Links and brand mentions on authoritative websites show your credibility as a brand, business, or organization.</li>
<li><strong>Get listed in directories, review sites, and third-party aggregators</strong>. Focus on quality over quantity and prioritize those sites that have relevance to your industry. For example, a plumbing company should create a listing on <a href="https://www.thumbtack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thumbtack</a>, while a software company should set up a profile page on <a href="https://www.g2.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G2</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">brand-building efforts</a> can also lead to more appearances in Google’s rich results. Want to appear more in lists like this?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-brand-signals.webp" alt="google search results for meditation apps" width="936" height="373" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79295" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-brand-signals.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-brand-signals-480x191.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Google extracts the data about these brand names “from across the web,” not just from the brand’s websites.</p>
<p>So those efforts you make to establish your brand name on reliable sources across the internet is a surefire way to help Google understand who you are, what you offer, and your brand authority in your space.</p>
<div id="user-interactions-engagement-metrics-increase"></div>
<h3>9. Google will place more emphasis on user interactions and engagement metrics</h3>
<p>There’s been a lot of disagreement among SEO professionals on the degree to which Google uses engagement metrics in its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2024-google-algorithm-updates">ranking algorithm</a>. But documents from the recent antitrust case against Google show that user engagement is not only a ranking factor–it’s a pillar of ranking.</p>
<p>The below slide from Google’s presentation titled “The 3 Pillars of Ranking,” lists “User-Interactions” as a core ranking factor. It also clarifies that “clicks, attentions on a result, swipes on carousels, and entering a new query” all qualify as user interactions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-google-ranking-pillars.webp" alt="google's three ranking pillars from presentation" width="936" height="557" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79296" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-google-ranking-pillars.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-google-ranking-pillars-480x286.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-3-pillars-of-ranking-36340.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>So it’s important to think about how your web content allows users to interact.</p>
<p>Interactive modules like jumplinks and carousels have always been good for improving <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/19/core-web-vitals-google-page-experience-update">page experience</a>, but when a user clicks on them, they can also show Google that users are finding your content engaging and valuable.</p>
<p>Be careful not to get spammy though in the effort to increase interactions. These interactive features should benefit the user’s experience, not disrupt it.</p>
<div id="mobile-page-performance-ranking-factor"></div>
<h3>10. Mobile page performance will continue to be a big ranking factor</h3>
<p>Mobile-first indexing is now the way of search, and after years of implementation, Google announced that it was <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/10/mobile-first-is-here" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially completed</a> in October of 2023.</p>
<p>You likely have been hearing about mobile pages for years, so it’s hard to consider this a “trend,” but it’s important to understand that your mobile pages, <strong>and your mobile pages only, </strong>are what count toward rankings.</p>
<p>If you are a website that primarily gets desktop traffic, this still applies to you. You need to pay attention to the performance of your mobile pages.</p>
<p>Here are a few “musts” for your mobile pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Responsive Design</strong>: Your web pages need to be responsive in 2024, meaning they can serve the same content on mobile, tablet, or desktop from the same URL. Separate URLs for mobile and desktop are a thing of the past, and Google discourages anything but responsive websites.</li>
<li><strong>Proper Character Counts</strong>: Remember that meta descriptions on mobile are limited to 120 characters (not the 160 you get on desktop). It’s best to trim up all of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/meta-description">meta descriptions</a> now and aim for 120 regularly.</li>
<li><strong>Check that your pages are mobile-friendly: </strong>QA-ing your mobile pages should be a standard part of your publishing workflow. You can use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/16/how-to-use-google-search-console">Google Search Console</a> to confirm whether your pages are meeting Google’ standards. Go to “<strong>Experience</strong>” &gt; “<strong>Core Web Vitals</strong>” &gt; “<strong>Mobile</strong>” to get a complete report of your mobile pages, like below.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-core-web-vitals.webp" alt="core web vitals results" width="936" height="316" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79297" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-core-web-vitals.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-core-web-vitals-480x162.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="page-experience-updates"></div>
<h3>11. Businesses will need to make page experience updates</h3>
<p>In April of 2023, Google <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/04/page-experience-in-search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded its guidance</a> on page experience and discussed the role of page experience in helpful content.</p>
<p>Essentially, a bad page experience is the opposite of helpful. So your pages need to be fast-loading, responsive, and pass Google’s Core Web Vitals.</p>
<p>In March of 2024, Google will be adding <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9205520?ref_topic=7440006&amp;hl=en&amp;authuser=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Interaction to Next Paint (INP)</a> to its Core Web Vitals metrics. This metric measures a page’s response to a user’s interaction, whether a click or keyboard stroke.</p>
<p>With the importance of user interactions in ranking, this is a natural addition for Google to measure the overall quality of a page. Make sure you are ready for the change by reviewing your INP report available in your Google Search Console account right now.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-page-experience-updates.webp" alt="core web vitals report showing INP issues" width="936" height="384" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79298" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-page-experience-updates.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seo-trends-page-experience-updates-480x197.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="seo-communities-grow"></div>
<h3>12. SEO communities will be crucial</h3>
<p>Although it’s not always discussed explicitly, SEO has long been an industry fueled by shared information and crowd-sourcing.</p>
<p>Community is an essential part of SEO success, whether for SEO professionals, agency owners, or entrepreneurs taking ownership of their SEO.</p>
<p>So of all the SEO trends coming in 2024, I believe SEO community groups will be one of the most important and beneficial for organic marketers. Sharing insights, strategies, or essentially, our experiences, can help us navigate the many changes coming this year.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of ways to connect with other SEO-minded folks. Events, conferences, Facebook groups, <a href="https://seotheory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online SEO courses</a>, forums, podcasts, and LinkedIn are some of the primary ways you can find other people who care about providing high-quality content for users and using the power of organic SEO in 2024 to deliver results for their own websites or their clients.</p>
<h2>Make these SEO trends work for you in 2024</h2>

<h2>What is SEO automation?</h2>
<p>SEO automation refers to the process of using software or tools to perform tasks related to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">search engine optimization</a>. These tools are designed to automate tasks that are otherwise very time-consuming, resource-intensive, and require a lot of manual effort on behalf of marketing team members.</p>
<p>Automating specific SEO tasks has become more common in recent years as SEO marketing software platforms offer more automation features and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-overviews-breaking-search">AI integrations</a> to solve common <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-issues">SEO issues</a>. If you’re not automating the more time-intensive tasks of your SEO work, you will likely fall behind competitors who are already outsourcing those tasks to robots.</p>

<h2>Benefits of automating SEO</h2>
<p>SEO automation tools can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/05/seo-strategy">SEO strategies</a>, by eliminating the need for repetitive tasks and freeing up time for more strategic initiatives.</p>
<p>Also, for those who are still learning the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/30/seo-basics">SEO basics</a>, organic marketing software can often eliminate some of the guesswork of content strategy, helping users discover keywords, develop <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/27/blog-post-ideas">content ideas</a>, or even recommending specific SEO tasks for the users to complete.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/seo-automation-tasks-example.webp" alt="seo automation - recommended tasks" width="936" height="467" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76477" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/seo-automation-tasks-example.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/seo-automation-tasks-example-480x239.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Recommended SEO Tasks from </em><a href="https://searchatlas.com/seo-ai-otto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>OTTO</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>The benefits of SEO automation also extend beyond just smarter, more successful campaigns.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Saves time:</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/13/content-creation">Content creation</a> is hard work and takes time in planning, writing, and delivery. Automating certain parts of that process can mean faster turnaround times for content.</li>
<li><strong>Saves money</strong>: A monthly software subscription usually costs less money than outsourcing time-intensive tasks to a freelancer or marketing agency or hiring additional employees to help your content strategy scale.</li>
<li><strong>Increases volume</strong>: Automation allows you to complete certain tasks faster, from content creation to keyword research to public relations outreach. That means more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-ranking">keyword rankings</a>, more content output, and more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/10/link-building-secrets">backlinks</a> to grow organically faster.</li>
<li><strong>Optimizes workflows</strong>: Replacing manual tasks with automation frees up the brainpower of your marketing team members, allowing them to focus on higher-level strategy decisions and those marketing tasks that still require a human touch.</li>
</ul>
<div id="tools"></div>
<h2>Software or tools to automate SEO</h2>
<p>There are a variety of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/21/cost-effective-marketing-automation-tools-small-businesses">marketing tools</a> that are now available for users to automate various SEO tasks or parts of the content creation process. When choosing an ideal platform, here are some things you may need to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>What SEO tasks are currently the most time-consuming or resource-intensive for my business or marketing team?</li>
<li>Does this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-seo-tools">SEO tool or software</a> eliminate the pain points of those specific tasks?</li>
<li>Are there additional tools and features that are also available in the software platform? Will I use these tools?</li>
<li>How many users on my team will need access to the software?</li>
<li>Is there a free version of this tool I can access or does this require a monthly fee or subscription?</li>
<li>What is a monthly subscription price point that will save my team money?</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on how you answer those questions will determine which software tools are the best choice for your business.</p>
<p>Some SEO platforms are now so advanced and comprehensive, they can feel overwhelming or intimidating to first-time users. The reality is, you may not need all of the tools available in certain software platforms or may only use some of the available features.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s best to start with the specific task that you know you want to automate. Then, let that guide you to the platform or tool that will allow you to do so.</p>
<p>Some free and paid <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/14/seo-tools">SEO automation tools</a> you can look into include:</p>

<h2>5 SEO tasks you can automate right now</h2>
<p>Maybe you’re not certain of which tasks in your SEO strategy can even be automated. Or, there might be certain tasks that you have not yet incorporated into your strategy because of their scope or complexity.</p>
<p>The below tasks are not only ripe for automation, but they are also an extremely important part of improving the effectiveness of your SEO campaigns and the organic performance of websites.</p>
<p>If you start automating some of these tasks, you will start experiencing the amazing benefits listed above.</p>
<h3>1. SEO auditing</h3>
<p>One of the best tasks that you can start automating right now is your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/28/technical-seo">SEO auditing</a> and issue tracking.</p>
<p>The technical SEO health of our websites is critically important to ranking in search engine results and in top positions. However, the majority of digital marketers or small businesses only have a basic understanding of technical SEO and don’t always feel comfortable working on the backend of their websites.</p>
<p>Also, running and interpreting SEO audits takes a higher level of technical SEO knowledge. If you do not have the technical know-how on your team–these tools automate the auditing process, identifying technical issues almost immediately and providing a precise roadmap for how to resolve them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/seo-automation-audit-example.webp" alt="seo automation - seo audit example from contentkings" width="893" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76478" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/seo-automation-audit-example.webp 893w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/seo-automation-audit-example-480x323.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 893px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An SEO audit report generated in ContentKing</em></p>
<p>Tools like SearchAtlas and ContentKing offer 24/7 website monitoring, meaning if something happens on your website that might impact your SEO performance, you will be notified immediately by email before it has any negative impact on your keyword rankings.</p>
<p>With detailed guides on how to fix those issues, you can simply hand over instructions to your web developer or backend manager. And because issue tracking is automated, you never have to worry about “missing” a critical issue that will tank your organic rankings or traffic.</p>
<h3>2. Keyword clustering</h3>
<p>The SEO strategy referred to as <a href="https://linkgraph.com/blog/keyword-clusters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keyword clustering</a> can help you increase the total number of keywords that a particular page ranks for.</p>
<p>But historically, the process of keyword clustering has required a lot of manual spreadsheet work by SEO and content strategists. Clustering involves ciphering through hundreds to thousands of keywords, looking for those that can be paired together due to topical relevance, search volume, or competitive landscape metrics like Keyword Difficulty.</p>
<p>Now, some SEO software platforms can automate the process of keyword clustering for their users. For example, an <a href="https://searchatlas.com/content-planner/">SEO content planner</a> will cluster keywords by ranking potential, relevance, and search volume to help content marketers identify realistic opportunities for ranking in their industries.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/seo-automation-keyword-cluster.webp" alt="seo automation - keyword cluster example" width="936" height="513" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76479" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/seo-automation-keyword-cluster.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/seo-automation-keyword-cluster-480x263.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A Keyword Cluster for “responsible tourism” in the SearchAtlas content planner tool</em></p>
<p>Content Marketing teams can then tackle these clusters one by one, creating relevant content that has the potential to rank for the valuable groups of keywords these tools identify.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a person in-house who can do comprehensive <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide">keyword research</a> for your brand, or you simply can’t afford to hire that person at this time, these tools do hours of keyword research work in a fraction of the time.</p>
<h3>3. Topic generation</h3>
<p>The process of moving from a keyword to a content idea is one of the best tasks to automate using AI content generator tools.</p>
<p>Coming up with an original blog post idea or article title requires creativity and brainpower. If you’re producing content at a high volume, then this particular SEO task is a regular part of your content planning process.</p>
<p>Blog topic generator tools will provide multiple templates or ideas for your SEO content. You can then edit the titles and ideas to better fit your brand voice, your specific products, services, and target audiences.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/seo-automation-topic-generator.webp" alt="seo automation - copy.ai topic generator" width="936" height="571" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76480" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/seo-automation-topic-generator.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/seo-automation-topic-generator-480x293.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Blog post ideas generated in copy.ai for the keyword “google ads bidding strategies”</em></p>
<p>Google wants to rank content that is created by humans for humans, so do not simply use ChatGPT outputs as your content. It’s important to look at these tools as providing a first draft or outline that your team can then work from. They are helpful for avoiding writer’s block or for those marketing teams that don’t have in-house content writers or creatives.</p>
<p>If you’re new to content strategy and don’t have any content on your website, topic ideation can be a great task for automation in the early days of your content strategy. It can take some <a href="https://www.mightyscribes.com/how-many-blog-posts-before-traffic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time before new websites start earning organic traffic</a>, but publishing blog posts on a consistent basis is a way to speed up results and start seeing traffic sooner.</p>
<h3>4. Content briefs</h3>
<p>Traditionally, content strategists hand over a content brief to writers that outlines all of the details a piece of content needs to have for the best ranking potential.</p>
<p>Putting together content briefs can be time-consuming. These briefs are often generated after extensive research and provide content writers with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Target keywords</li>
<li>Suggested word counts</li>
<li>Readability level</li>
<li>Recommended internal links</li>
<li>Focus terms or suggested terms</li>
<li>Common questions</li>
<li>Suggested Headings</li>
<li>Additional elements that are important for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/06/on-page-seo">on-page SEO</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/seo-automation-content-brief-example.webp" alt="seo automation - content brief example output" width="936" height="559" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76481" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/seo-automation-content-brief-example.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/seo-automation-content-brief-example-480x287.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Content Brief Generator tool from Dashword </em></p>
<p>The process of content brief generation can be automated with one click. These tools prompt users to provide an article title and summary. Then, the software generates a high-quality content brief that can be easily edited and better tailored to the content’s goals and target audience.</p>
<p>In terms of volume, this automation can mean generating more content briefs in less time, helping you get more content assignments to writers. With hundreds of briefs, you’ll always have the next content outline you need to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/31/content-amplification">keep expanding your organic presence</a>.</p>
<h3>5. SEO reporting</h3>
<p>Creating SEO and content performance reports can be extremely time-consuming. The larger your organic presence, the more complex and comprehensive these reports can become.</p>
<p>But there is really no avoiding SEO reporting, as it is the key to proving the value of SEO efforts and optimizations to key stakeholders at your organization. This is particularly true for SEO freelancers or marketing agencies who provide SEO services to clients.</p>
<p>Depending on the goals of your campaign, there are certain metrics that you may want to highlight over others in your reporting.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/seo-automation-reporting.webp" alt="seo automation - seo report" width="936" height="510" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76482" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/seo-automation-reporting.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/seo-automation-reporting-480x262.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Finding a software platform that generates SEO reports can help you eliminate the time-intensive nature work of this work. Many marketing platforms now include the Google <a href="https://developers.google.com/webmaster-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Search Console API</a>, meaning you can be confident that your website data is an accurate and complete picture of your website’s organic performance.</p>
<div id="avoid"></div>
<h2>SEO tasks to avoid automating</h2>
<p>There is likely an automation tool for almost any task that you are performing for your SEO strategy. That doesn’t mean, though, that you should set your SEO strategy to autopilot and remove the human touch entirely.</p>
<p>The below SEO tasks are those that you should still delegate to humans because they are essential to achieving top-ranking results in Google.</p>
<h3>High-quality content writing</h3>
<p>Google recently made it clear that the use of <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/02/google-search-and-ai-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI-generated content is not against their policies</a>. Their focus is on the quality of the content, not on the way that it was produced.</p>
<p>So using content generation tools during your content writing process is certainly a great strategy. But although these tools are impressive, the content quality is still limited. Purely publishing auto-generated content without bringing in the human touch to the process is unlikely to produce the type of high-quality content that it takes to rank in top positions.</p>
<p>High-quality content needs to embody <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/14/google-e-e-a-t">Google&#8217;s E-EAT</a> philosophy, meaning it includes experience, expertise, authority, and trust.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-eeat.jpg" alt="google eeat graphic" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74959" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-eeat.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-eeat-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Remember, ChatGPT was trained on data from 2021 and above, meaning it isn’t really capable of bringing something “new” to the conversation. Google wants to rank content from websites that are <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/thought-leadership-content-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/459736/">thought leaders</a> in their industries–that means bringing original ideas and strategies to the conversation.</p>
<p>This is even more reason to look at these text automation tools as a starting point for content writing, not a substitute.</p>
<h3>High-level SEO strategy</h3>
<p>Succeeding in organic search also requires understanding what type of content is already ranking on the first page of Google. Factors like relevance, <a href="https://linkgraph.com/blog/what-is-search-intent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search intent</a>, word count, featured snippets, People Also Ask, and more can all impact whether your content has more or less ranking potential.</p>
<p>Some marketing tools make it easier to find all of the information you need to make strategic decisions, but a human eye is still needed to make decisions that are the best for your business and your unique goals. You don’t want to be investing time and resources into content creation for keywords that are out of reach or creating the wrong type of content that doesn’t provide users with what they are actually looking for.</p>
<p>Understanding key SEO metrics like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/12/domain-authority" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Domain Authority</a>, Domain Rating, Keyword Difficulty, and search intent is still an absolute must for those executing your SEO efforts. Having a fundamental understanding of these important SEO factors will help you understand how to leverage these tools to their fullest potential.</p>
<h2>Do SEO automation the right way</h2>
<p>SEO automation is truly the way of the present and future.</p>
<p>If you want to succeed in organic search, it&#8217;s important that you start familiarizing yourself with the many ways automation can be integrated into your current marketing strategy.</p>
<p>Getting comfortable with these tools may have a little bit of a learning curve, but it will be well worth the effort for the benefits it brings to your organic performance and your bottom line.</p>

<h2>The top SEO trends to align with in 2023</h2>
<p>This year is all about displaying expertise and value in our content and continuing to provide high-performing web pages for users. These strategies have always been important throughout the history of SEO, but Google is getting better at evaluating signals and determining what content is actually meeting these standards.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a closer look at what I mean and how you can meet those standards.</p>
<h3>1. First-hand experience on a topic (the new “E” in E-EAT)</h3>
<p>As of December 2022, Google’s popular EAT acronym, (Expertise, Authority, Trust) has gotten an additional E: Experience, making it <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/14/google-e-e-a-t">E-EAT</a>. Google will now consider <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/12/google-raters-guidelines-e-e-a-t">the experience of the author</a> or creator when evaluating the quality of content.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-google-eeat.png" alt="2023 seo trends - google eeat" width="720" height="237" class="size-full wp-image-69421 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-google-eeat.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-google-eeat-480x158.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>So what does “experience,” actually mean? Google wants to see that a content creator has first-hand, real-world experience with the topic discussed.</p>
<p>For example, as the founder of an <a href="https://linkgraph.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO agency,</a> I have real-world experience and can speak authoritatively on SEO trends that will arise in 2023. However, If I were to create a piece of content on a health website about common causes of heart disease, that would undermine the quality of the content, because I am not a medical professional and have no experience in healthcare.</p>
<p>That means more websites need to take a closer look at not just who their content creators are, but what topics they&#8217;re focusing on.</p>
<p>Which leads me to the next two trends.</p>
<h3>2. Audience-targeted, not traffic-targeted content</h3>
<p>One reason for this increased emphasis on experience is because SEO content creation is proliferating. But if a website that sells financial software is producing blog posts with food recipes, Google crawlers are going to get suspicious. Because does that content actually benefit the target audience of financial software customers? Or, does it help that the website rank for certain high-volume keywords?</p>
<p>You already know the answer. The reality is, businesses whose <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/11/28/content-strategy">content strategy</a> is to simply go after search traffic with little or no consideration of what users actually want are unlikely to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google">see ranking success in 2023</a>. Sticking within your general topic and industry areas is essential for creating rank-worthy content.</p>
<p>Not sure what topics to explore in your content? A <a href="https://linkgraph.io/content-planner-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content planning tool</a> can help you discover relevant industry topics that your target audience is searching for. Enter a keyword, and the tool will show you the many semantically related keywords that users are typing into the search bar.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-keyword-research-related-keywords.png" alt="2023 seo trends - keyword research examples" width="720" height="388" class="size-full wp-image-69427 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-keyword-research-related-keywords.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-keyword-research-related-keywords-480x259.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>3. Increased emphasis on author authority</h3>
<p>Another reason for Google’s emphasis on experience is the rise of auto-generated content ranking in the SERPs. Google wants to make sure that the content that ranks in 2023 is produced by <em>real people</em> with<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience"> real audiences</a> in mind.</p>
<p>So what can you do to elevate both the experience and authority of your creators this year? First and foremost, make sure that the people creating your content are, indeed, experts. Then, elevate their experience in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Include author bios</strong> to better and more fully communicate your content creator’s knowledge and areas of expertise</li>
<li><strong>Create author pages</strong> where you link out to all of the articles on your website that are written by the author</li>
<li><strong>Link your creators&#8217; social media accounts </strong>so Google can more easily understand through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/20/social-signals-for-seo">social signals</a> that they are real people and real experts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example of a great author bio that helps elevates the experience and authority of the creator as a PPC expert</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-author-authority.png" alt="2023 seo trends - author authority bio" width="720" height="349" class="size-full wp-image-69422 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-author-authority.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-author-authority-480x233.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>4. Satisfying, helpful content</h3>
<p>Google’s August 2022 <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/08/helpful-content-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helpful content update</a> is another important algorithm update that will impact how we create content in 2023.</p>
<p>For its entire history, Google has always prioritized serving high-quality content to users. But its new emphasis on “helpful” states that users should feel “satisfied” by the content they click on in the SERPs.</p>
<p>User satisfaction, though, is not easy to measure or quantify. So what does Google mean by helpful? Content that is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Created for humans, not search engines.</li>
<li>Appropriate for the target audience.</li>
<li>Relevant to the primary topic or subject area of the website.</li>
<li>Created by authoritative, experienced creators.</li>
<li>Displays a depth of knowledge about the topic.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Noticing a theme yet in this year’s SEO trends?)</p>
<p>Creating helpful content is easier said than done. So how can you make your content more helpful?</p>
<p><strong>First, focus on quality, not quantity. </strong>Although there are likely a lot of target keywords on your content calendar in 2023, pumping out a high volume of content that is thin on helpfulness and low on expertise is unlikely to produce <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/09/google-ranking-factors">top-ranking</a> results in 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Second, expand your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/09/easy-keyword-research-guide">keyword research</a> to include information beyond just search volume. </strong>Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What types of content are ranking for specific searches?</li>
<li>How long is the content?</li>
<li>What questions does it answer?</li>
<li>What other subtopics or related questions does it explore?</li>
<li>What links are included on the page?</li>
<li>Who is the creator?</li>
<li>What is their experience?</li>
</ul>
<p>Keyword research and content research can provide all sorts of insights into these quality indicators, so make sure you don’t get distracted by potential organic traffic alone.</p>

<h3>5. A.I content &amp; content writing software</h3>
<p>Despite all of the 2022 updates focused on combatting auto-generated content, the use of AI content will likely only increase in 2023.</p>
<p>The number of marketing applications that now integrate <a href="https://builtin.com/marketing/ai-tools-search-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO and AI</a> is only increasing. And it’s no wonder because these integrations can be incredibly time-saving! Most content marketers have utilized some version of these types of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/25/ai-content-generators">AI content generators</a> over the past year.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ai-content-generators-simplified.png" alt="ai content generator tool - simplified aida copywriting" width="720" height="335" class="size-full wp-image-57808 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ai-content-generators-simplified.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ai-content-generators-simplified-480x223.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But with all of Google’s recent updates, can <a href="https://linkgraph.io/blog/content-writing-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content-writing software</a> be utilized safely?</p>
<p>Absolutely! Pumping out auto-generated drafts is a huge no-no, but marketers can certainly leverage these tools to help speed up their content workflows and still create original, quality content in the process.</p>
<p>Here are some of the more helpful applications of these tools that do not sacrifice the originality or people-centeredness of content:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content briefs</strong>: Content tools that generate content briefs can help your writers understand the important keywords, topics, and subtopics that should be included in their original content.</li>
<li><strong>Content outlines</strong>: Outlines are a great way to give your writers a roadmap for how to create helpful content without relying on AI to do the work for them.</li>
<li><strong>Content ideas</strong>: Tools like <a href="https://linkgraph.io/blog-topics-generator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog topic generators</a> can speed up the brainstorming process. Moving from a keyword to a helpful content idea can be half the battle, and an idea generator can help prevent writer’s block. For example, here is an auto-generated blog idea that has been revised to include the website’s brand voice and be more tailored to the website’s younger target audience:<strong>Auto-generated:</strong><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-auto-generated-content.png" alt="2023 seo trends - auto generated content" width="720" height="219" class="size-full wp-image-69425 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-auto-generated-content.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-auto-generated-content-480x146.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /><br />
People-first:</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-people-first-content.png" alt="2023 seo trends - people-first content" width="720" height="277" class="size-full wp-image-69426 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-people-first-content.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-people-first-content-480x185.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is just one of many examples of how to use content writing software to better meet Google’s quality standards, not avoid or bypass them.</p>
<h3>6. SEO automation</h3>
<p>Like content AI, more and more SEO tasks will be automated in 2023 as digital marketers continue to leverage the power of enterprise SEO software platforms and tools.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/09/18/best-keyword-research-tools">Keyword research tools</a></strong> can automate tasks that once required a lot of manual spreadsheet work.</li>
<li><strong> Site auditing and monitoring platforms</strong> like <a href="https://searchatlas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SearchAtlas</a> and <a href="https://www.contentkingapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Content King</a> can automatically detect changes and technical issues on websites.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/31/website-graders"><strong>Website graders</strong></a> can help the less SEO-savvy to identify needed optimizations and prioritize accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/best-free-website-graders-localiq-grader-report.png" alt="best free website graders - localiq website grader report sample" width="608" height="625" class=" wp-image-59589 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/best-free-website-graders-localiq-grader-report.png 608w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/best-free-website-graders-localiq-grader-report-480x493.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 608px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><a href="https://localiq.com/website-grader/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Try out our Free Website Grader!</a></em></strong></p>
<p>The increase in these <a href="https://linkgraph.io/blog/diy-seo-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DIY SEO tools</a> will also allow businesses and agencies alike to take care of tactics more efficiently and focus more on strategy.</p>
<h3>7. Changes to CTRs by SERP positions</h3>
<p>Get ready to change what you think you know about CTR and ranking positions.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/05/google-introduces-continuous-scrolling-on-desktop-for-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endless scrolling</a> now available on both mobile and desktop, Google has made it far easier for users to scroll through multiple pages of SERP results to find the content they seek.</p>
<p>Over the years, the relationship between ranking position and CTR has remained fairly consistent, with the majority of clicks going to the first three results.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-ctr-position.png" alt="2023 seo trends - organic ctr vs position" width="600" height="574" class="size-full wp-image-69429 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-ctr-position.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-ctr-position-480x459.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://backlinko.com/google-ctr-stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>But in 2023, click-through rates are likely to be impacted as searchers more easily navigate across multiple pages of search results.</p>
<p>In terms of those dreaded zero-click searches, we’ve been hearing about for years, a <a href="https://searchengineland.com/zero-click-study-semrush-389067" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent SEMrush study</a> showed that only about 25.8% of searches resulted in zero clicks. As Google continues to add more featured snippets and search features like People Also Ask, CTRs may not suffer from no clicks as much as originally thought.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-zero-click.png" alt="2023 seo trends - search engine land article on zero click searches" width="720" height="271" class="size-full wp-image-69430 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-zero-click.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-zero-click-480x181.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Although getting to the first page is still ideal, being on page two or three will have more benefits than it once did thanks to endless scrolling. So make sure that you are optimizing those page titles and meta descriptions and using features like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/15/what-is-schema-markup">schema markup</a> to make your content more engaging and clickable in the SERPs.</p>
<h3>8. Product page SEO</h3>
<p>As Google continues to reward long-form, informative content, pages that tend toward thin content, like product pages, can benefit in 2023 from providing more helpful details on the page.</p>
<p>Drop-down menus, FAQs, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">customer reviews</a> are all ways to add additional content to a product page. Although adding keywords to the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/06/26/product-descriptions">product description</a> is helpful, think of other questions that users may want to be answered about the product before they purchase.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you offer free shipping?</li>
<li>What is the return policy?</li>
<li>Are there warranties, upgrades, or add-ons available with the product?</li>
<li>Are there <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/05/customer-testimonials">customer testimonials</a> or reviews that you can display with the product?</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-product-page.png" alt="2023 seo trends - product page example" width="720" height="462" class="size-full wp-image-69428 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-product-page.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-product-page-480x308.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>These are just a few ways to add additional content to a page that is actually helpful and informative for users who are considering a potential purchase.</p>

<h3>9. SEO competitor analysis</h3>
<p>Looking to competitors has always been a smart way to shape SEO strategy, and competitor analysis will become even easier and more effective in 2023 thanks to the help of SEO tools.</p>
<p>As Google places more emphasis on industry expertise and “topic areas” of websites, looking at the thought leaders in your industry will be a surefire way to understand what types of content in your industry will rank.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="https://linkgraph.io/blog/seo-competitor-analysis-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO competitor software</a> to compare competitors&#8217; content, backlinks, Domain Authority, and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-competitor-analysis.png" alt="2023 seo trends - seo competitor analysis" width="720" height="348" class="size-full wp-image-69424 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-competitor-analysis.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-competitor-analysis-480x232.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Look at the ways that your competitors are establishing experience, expertise, authority, and trustworthiness through both<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/06/on-page-seo"> on-page</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/13/off-page-seo">off-page</a> signals and leverage those insights in your own SEO campaigns and content strategy. Learn more in our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/01/competitor-keyword-analysis">guide to keyword competitor analysis</a>.</p>
<h3>10. Less crawl frequency</h3>
<p>Google has recently set big <a href="https://sustainability.google/commitments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climate goals</a>, including operating on carbon-free energy by 2023. To achieve that goal, Google has been considering reducing the frequency with which it crawls web pages.</p>
<p>Reducing crawling helps conserve computing resources, and is one of the easiest changes Google can make in line with its sustainability initiatives.</p>
<p>But reduced crawl rates are more likely to impact refresh crawls rather than crawls that discover new content. That means that it may take longer for Google to take notice of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/03/get-more-traffic-from-evergreen-content">new changes we make on our websites</a>.</p>
<p>That’s why optimizing your content from the get-go, with all of the on-page elements it will require to rank, is the best strategic choice in 2023.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-2023-on-page-seo.png" alt="seo trends 2023 - on page seo checklist" width="720" height="472" class="size-full wp-image-69436 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-2023-on-page-seo.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-2023-on-page-seo-480x315.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>11. Image SEO revitalized</h3>
<p>Images are often neglected on websites, but they have always played a role in better rankings for image searches.</p>
<p>They also can provide opportunities to include additional keywords and semantically-related terms into our content via alt text.</p>
<p>Google likes to see alt text and schema markup that help their crawlers better understand the content of images. Google also likes to see webmasters who make their content more accessible to all users. Alt text also helps make the internet a better place for those who are visually impaired or individuals limited by internet bandwidth or connectivity challenges.</p>
<p>Follow this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/08/image-seo">image SEO checklist</a> to make sure you are following all of the must-dos with images in 2023.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-2023-image-seo.png" alt="seo trends 2023 - image seo" width="720" height="482" class="size-full wp-image-69437 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-2023-image-seo.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seo-trends-2023-image-seo-480x321.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>12. Fast-loading, high-performing websites</h3>
<p>Ever since the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/19/core-web-vitals-google-page-experience-update">page experience update of 2021</a>, Google has placed more emphasis on high-performing, fast-loading websites in its ranking algorithm.</p>
<p>Although the page experience update may feel like old news, Google did not finish rolling out the update until March 2022, and it will continue to refine the signals it uses to determine whether a page is actually high-performing for users.</p>
<p>In 2023, Page Speed Insights and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/02/improve-core-web-vitals">Core Web Vitals</a> will still be essential tools for monitoring and evaluating the speed and performance of websites.</p>
<p>Alongside content quality, prioritizing page speed improvements is bound to pay off for businesses with increased keyword rankings for all of the web pages of their domain.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-core-web-vitals-results.png" alt="seo trends 2022 - pagespeed insights results" width="1536" height="926" class="size-full wp-image-56117 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-core-web-vitals-results.png 1536w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-core-web-vitals-results-1280x772.png 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-core-web-vitals-results-980x591.png 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-core-web-vitals-results-480x289.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1536px, 100vw" /></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Are social signals a Google ranking factor? Definitely maybe.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/20/social-signals-for-seo">10 Ways to Improve Your Social Signals for SEO</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SEO is multidisciplinary, meaning working on other areas of our digital marketing strategy can have ancillary benefits to our web pages’ performance in the SERPs. This includes your social media strategy and the effort to improve the social signals of our web pages.</p>
<p>The connection between social signals and SEO is an indirect relationship, meaning improved social signals will not result in higher ranking positions. However, the efforts to improve social media visibility are certainly correlated to our SEO efforts, which is why the relationship is important for digital marketers to leverage.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-seo-linkedin-engagement.png" alt="social signals and seo - linkedin engagement" width="326" height="366" class="wp-image-65580 aligncenter" /></p>
<p>This guide will cover the fundamentals of that relationship. Read on to learn about how social signals impact SEO and ranking, and how you can improve them.</p>

<li><a href="#improve">10 ways to improve your social signals for SEO</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a id="what"></a></p>
<h2>What are social signals?</h2>
<p>Social signals are essentially any interactions with a social media profile or its content. From a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">social media marketing</a> standpoint, these interactions are simply social media <em>engagement</em>, but from an SEO standpoint, they are <em>signals</em> that help search engines like Google to understand the identity, popularity, and reliability of a user, profile, or post.</p>
<p>When you think of all the various social media platforms out there, there are many types of metrics that can be categorized as social signals. Here are some of the most common by platform:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook</strong>: Follows, likes, dislikes, comments, shares, views</li>
<li><strong>Instagram: </strong>Follows, likes, shares, favorites, saves.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong>: Follows, Tweets, Retweets, Quote Tweets, replies</li>
<li><strong>Pinterest</strong>: Follows, pins, views</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn</strong>: Connections, likes, comments, shares</li>
<li><strong>Reddit</strong>: Upvotes, comments</li>
</ul>
<p><a id="ranking"></a></p>
<h2>Are social signals a ranking factor?</h2>
<p>Google relies on over 200 <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/09/google-ranking-factors">ranking factors</a> when determining how to rank web pages, but many SEOs are not in full agreement on the role social signals have in ranking—due in large part to Google&#8217;s mixed messages in the matter.</p>
<h3>2010: Google says yes&#8230;sorta</h3>
<p>In this short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofhwPC-5Ub4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Search Central video from 2010</a>, a viewer asks if Google uses Twitter and Facebook links (e.g., twitter.com/wordstream) as a ranking signal, referring to a [recent at the time]<a href="https://searchengineland.com/what-social-signals-do-google-bing-really-count-55389"> article by Danny Sullivan. </a></p>
<p>Google software engineer Matt Cutts responds saying: “We do use Facebook and Twitter links in ranking as we always have…but in addition, we’re also trying to figure out a little bit about the reputation of an author or creator on Twitter or Facebook.&#8221; He then goes on to explain that (at the time) they are more important for real-time searches, and that the quality of those engagements matters more than the quantity.</p>

<h3>2014: Google says not really</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udqtSM-6QbQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another Google Search Central video from 2014</a>, a viewer asks &#8220;Are Facebook and Twitter signals part of the ranking algorithm? How much do they matter?&#8221; Matt emphasizes that because these pages can change so often as users update or post to their profiles, Google engineers are less focused on being able to extract any signals (e.g., likes, comments, shares) from them.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/udqtSM-6QbQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>2022: Google says it&#8217;s a quality indicator</h3>
<p>Fast forward to 2022 and Google has recently made it clear that it is working hard to understand the <a href="https://linkgraph.io/author-authority-seo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">authority of an author or creator</a> via social media. The reputation of a web page creator is becoming an increasingly important quality indicator for organic SEO, and Google looks to social media profiles to better understand authorship.</p>
<p>So although convoluted, we do know that Google is certainly paying attention to the social media pages of our websites and the profiles of our content creators—and so, too, should anyone who wants to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google">rank higher in organic search</a>.<br />
<a id="seo"></a></p>
<h2>How do social signals impact SEO?</h2>
<p>The reality is, SEOs are still using studies and experimentation to discover the exact impact of social signals on SEO performance.</p>
<p>Although there is some disagreement in the industry, we can make some strong inferences about the indirect impact that social signals have on ranking based on how <a href="https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed ranking factors</a> overlap with the social media presence of a website.</p>
<h3>Social media profiles can rank</h3>
<p>Google indexes social media profiles, meaning they will rank in search engine results.</p>
<p>And because Google wants to connect websites with their respective social media pages, we can be confident that Google is looking for signals that connect our websites to specific profile URLs.</p>
<p>Although less important to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/11/14/how-to-rank-for-a-keyword">ranking for your target keywords</a>, your branded search results are important to your SEO <a href="https://linkgraph.io/reputation-management-strategy-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reputation management strategy</a>. If you Google your business name, it is likely your Facebook, Linkedin, or Twitter page will rank on page one.</p>
<p>For Twitter specifically, Google displays the three most recent tweets in the SERP (do note though that Google is not actually displaying likes or retweets there).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-seo-tweets-serp.png" alt="social signals and google ranking factors - tweets in the serp" width="700" height="606" class="size-full wp-image-65566 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-seo-tweets-serp.png 700w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-seo-tweets-serp-480x416.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>A <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-increase-social-media-presence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong social media presence</a> reflected in the SERPs can help build your audience’s trust in your brand, meaning more clicks in the future if they come across your web pages in organic search.</p>
<h3>More social shares can result in more backlinks</h3>
<p>Throughout the history of search engines, <a href="http://linkgraph.io/permanent-backlinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backlinks</a> have always been the most important ranking factor.</p>
<p>But if a person Tweets with a link back to a web page, it doesn’t actually send any link equity to your website like a backlink on a web page does.</p>
<p>However, your content being shared and circulated on social media will mean more traffic being sent to your web pages, more eyes on your content, and more possibilities that a user finds the content valuable and then chooses to link to it.</p>
<p>The first step to being linked to is being seen. Social media is a great way to be seen by a larger audience, and this is why it can also be a part of your <a href="https://linkgraph.io/link-building-strategies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link-building strategy</a>.</p>
<h3>Quality content does well on both social and search</h3>
<p>Let’s say a web page has been shared thousands of times on social media. Across those thousands of shares may be hundreds of thousands of likes, comments, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/30/social-media-engagement">engagements</a>.</p>
<p>If a web page is getting that much <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/social-proof/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social proof</a>, it most likely contains pretty valuable content for the user.</p>
<p>Often, web pages that rank well in search results also have strong social media signals. But correlation does not equal causation, meaning there’s no reason to conclude that those social signals are being used by Google to evaluate quality and determine rankings.</p>
<p>However, just like quality content is rewarded in social media, it is also rewarded by Google. After all, its algorithm is built on EAT (expertise, authority, and trust).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/google-ranking-factors-e-a-t-meaning.png" alt="google ranking factors - meaning of E-A-T" width="476" height="440" class="alignnone wp-image-63672" /></p>
<p>Creating quality content will help you improve your visibility and performance in both digital channels, as long as you share your content on social media and <a href="https://linkgraph.io/complete-guide-to-seo-on-page-content-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimize for organic SEO</a>.<br />
<a id="improve"></a></p>
<h2>10 tips to improve your social signals for SEO</h2>
<p>Because of the above connections, taking the time to improve your social signals can have positive impacts on your SEO and other areas of your digital marketing strategy.</p>
<p>So here are some tips for improving your social signals in order to generate those ancillary benefits and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/17/website-visibility"> improve the overall online visibility of your web pages</a>.</p>
<h3>1. Link your website &amp; social media profile pages</h3>
<p>As stated, Google is looking to connect websites to social media accounts.</p>
<p>You can make it easier by ensuring your website links to your social media profile pages, and vice versa.</p>
<p>This is a basic step, but an important one. Previously, SEOs used social media schema to directly communicate to Google their social media pages, but Google no longer uses this schema type.</p>
<p>So make it easy for Google to automatically identify the connection by reciprocal linking.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-link-to-website.png" alt="social signals and google ranking factors - linking profile to website" width="720" height="595" class="size-full wp-image-65576 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-link-to-website.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-link-to-website-480x397.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>However, you don’t want links to social profiles on your homepage to pull clicks away from your CTA buttons or lead generation forms. For that reason, I suggest the footer of your website to place social media links.</p>
<p>These links can also improve your user experience. Whether a user discovers your website or your social media page first, you want to make it as easy as possible for them to find other important URLs related to your brand.</p>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/261d.png" alt="☝" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Fun fact:</p>

<h3>2. Optimize your social profile pages</h3>
<p>Just like with a web page or blog post, your social media profile pages can benefit from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/06/on-page-seo">on-page optimization</a>.</p>
<p>Including target keywords in your About Us, Services, Products, or the other editable areas that different social media profiles allow can help with Google’s understanding of your website’s relationship to those keywords.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-linkedin-profile.png" alt="social signals and google ranking factors - linkedin profile" width="720" height="463" class="size-full wp-image-65575 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-linkedin-profile.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-linkedin-profile-480x309.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It’s important to fill out every section of your profile, as Google will be crawling and rendering the content of these pages to understand what your business is all about. Each area provides you more opportunities to add important keywords related to your business.</p>
<h3>3. Claim your Knowledge Panel</h3>
<p>Google Knowledge Panels are a SERP feature that consolidates all of the key information about a brand for users, including social media profiles.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-seo-knowledge-panel.png" alt="social signals and seo ranking factors - google knowledge panel" width="400" height="635" class="size-full wp-image-65574 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-seo-knowledge-panel.png 400w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-seo-knowledge-panel-189x300.png 189w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>They most often rank for branded searches, or when someone searches your business name.</p>
<p>Google automatically generates <a href="https://support.google.com/knowledgepanel/answer/9163198?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Knowledge Panels</a>, meaning there is no way to submit for one if your brand does not yet have one appearing.</p>
<p>But if your business does have a Knowledge Panel appearing, make sure you claim it. This allows you to have more direct communication with Google about the information that is populated there.</p>
<h3>4. Promote your content regularly across social platforms</h3>
<p>If you are regularly publishing content on your website like blogs, articles, or ebooks, you should also be regularly promoting those content assets on your social media accounts.</p>
<p>The more posts and content you share on social media platforms, the more opportunities you have to earn those likes, comments, shares, and engagements.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/sharing-content-social-signals.png" alt="social signals - sharing content on linkedin" width="500" height="494" class="size-full wp-image-65587 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/sharing-content-social-signals.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/sharing-content-social-signals-480x474.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You can use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/17/best-free-social-media-management-tools">social media management tools</a> like Sprout Social to plan out and automate your postings to your Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram accounts. If you haven’t yet brought on a social media manager, you may want to consider doing so or outsourcing to an agency.</p>
<p>Here are some tips for finding ways to share your website content on a daily basis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include links to the newest content on your website soon after it has been published.</li>
<li>Post and link to any updated content when it provides new or better information to users.</li>
<li>Share and link to relevant content on your website when the topic area comes up in the news, conversations, or trending topics happening in your industry.</li>
<li>When a user comments with a question about a particular topic, service, or product, respond with a link to other relevant content on your website that answers their question.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few examples of ways to create social media posts that include links back to your website.</p>
<p>Although you can certainly create posts without any links to your content, those will not actually help your SEO. To create any indirect benefits for SEO, your posts need to include links back to your web pages.</p>
<h3>5. Add social plugins to make your content easily shareable</h3>
<p>Sometimes, website visitors are more likely to share content if it is easy to do so.</p>
<p>Adding social plugins to your content management system makes it simple for website visitors to share your high-quality content on their social media accounts.</p>
<p>For example, Wordstream encourages users to click with social icons that stick as the user scrolls through blog posts.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/strengthen-social-signals-seo-social-share.png" alt="social signals and seo ranking factors - social share buttons on blog posts" width="720" height="399" class="size-full wp-image-65572 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/strengthen-social-signals-seo-social-share.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/strengthen-social-signals-seo-social-share-480x266.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>When a user clicks to share the content on their social media, the post is ready without them having to do any additional work to make an engaging, clickable, and likable social media post.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-social-share-tweet.png" alt="social signals and seo ranking factors - automatic share on twitter example" width="500" height="570" class="size-full wp-image-65571 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-social-share-tweet.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-social-share-tweet-480x547.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>6. Make your content more clickable with Twitter cards and Open Graph tags</h3>
<p>If you want your web pages to be engaging to social media users when shared, leverage Open Graph tags and Twitter cards.</p>
<p>These are simply pieces of metadata that influence how your web content looks when shared on social media platforms. Here is an example of a “Summary with Large Image” Twitter card.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-seo-retweet.png" alt="social signals and seo ranking factors- retweet example" width="600" height="586" class="size-full wp-image-65570 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-seo-retweet.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-seo-retweet-480x469.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In HTML, it looks like this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-seo-backend.png" alt="social signals and google ranking factors - back end code of social content" width="600" height="183" class="size-full wp-image-65569 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-seo-backend.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-seo-backend-480x146.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Having missing Open Graph tags and Twitter cards can make your content less clickable when shared on social media. For example, this web page is missing a &#8220;twitter: image&#8221; property and thus populates on Twitter like this: just text with no appealing image.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-seo-tweet-without-image-property.png" alt="social signals and google ranking factors - tweet without image property" width="600" height="300" class="size-full wp-image-65568 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-seo-tweet-without-image-property.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-seo-tweet-without-image-property-480x240.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In comparison to a web page that has a defined &#8220;twitter: image property&#8221;:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-seo-tweet-with-image-property.png" alt="social signals and google ranking factors - tweet with image property" width="600" height="359" class="size-full wp-image-65567 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-seo-tweet-with-image-property.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-seo-tweet-with-image-property-480x287.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Which piece of content are you more likely to click on?</p>
<p>If you need help implementing these important tags to your web pages, read these <a href="http://linkgraph.io/open-graph-tags" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Graph tag</a> and <a href="http://linkgraph.io/twitter-cards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter cards</a> guides.</p>
<h3>7. Actively respond to comments and shares</h3>
<p>A part of increasing your social signals is being “active,” on social media. That means responding to comments and shares and showing users that your profile is managed by a real-life person.</p>
<p>Actively responding to comments and shares can also mean more opportunities to share additional relevant links to other pages on your website with users.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-google-ranking-factor-engage-back.png" alt="social signals and google ranking factor - engaging back with comments" width="431" height="706" class="wp-image-65577 aligncenter" /></p>
<p>If you are busy managing other parts of your business, consider hiring a social media marketing manager or outsourcing your social media tasks to an agency.</p>
<h3>8. Share other people’s content and foster partnerships</h3>
<p>Just like you’re seeking to get more Facebook followers and increase <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/27/how-to-increase-instagram-engagement">Instagram engagement</a>, so are other people in your industry.</p>
<p>Sharing valuable content from other websites can be a great way to build partnerships and show you are an active member of your industry community.</p>
<p>Retweet other content that you find valuable, or thank people for sharing yours. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/02/how-to-repost-on-instagram">Repost content on Instagram</a> that you appreciate. This might mean more shares or likes from those same accounts in the future.</p>
<h3>9. Don’t pay for fake followers or engagement</h3>
<p>Although social media engagement is beneficial, fake follows and engagements from bots or computer software are not.</p>
<p>The reality is, social media platforms are getting better at <a href="https://www.knaptonwright.co.uk/twitter-begins-mass-bot-removal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identifying and removing bots</a> from their platforms.</p>
<p>So although those likes or engagements may help you in the short term, they are most likely temporary. It’s not worth the risk or the price. Follow our tips to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-check-social-media-engagement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check and improve social media engagement</a> organically.</p>
<h3>10. Elevate the social media reputation of your creators</h3>
<p>As stated earlier, Google is paying closer attention to the creators of web page content. Also, search engine crawlers are using social media platforms to better understand author authority.</p>
<p>So you can do the work of elevating your creators by adding author bios to your blog posts and articles. Linking to their social media profiles, and tagging them when sharing their content, are both ways to elevate their reputation as expert creators.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-google-ranking-author-bio.png" alt="social signals and seo - author bio" width="720" height="278" class="size-full wp-image-65579 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-google-ranking-author-bio.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/social-signals-google-ranking-author-bio-480x185.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>When Google sees that your web page content is created with expert authorship, Quality Raters are more likely to see your overall website as authoritative and trustworthy.</p>
<h2>Improve your social signals &amp; Google ranking together</h2>
<p>The relationship between social signals and SEO is an important one, and any business can combine its social media and SEO strategies to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/17/increase-online-presence">elevate your online presence</a> and visibility.</p>
<p>Investing in both strategies is a strategic and cost-effective way to grow. So make sure that you have the right team members doing the daily tasks required to increase social signals. With time and consistency, you’ll most likely see measurable results!</p>
<p>To recap, here are 10 ways to improve your social signals which can help influence your rankings:</p>
<ol>
<li>Link your websites and social media profiles</li>
<li>Optimize your social profile pages</li>
<li>Claim your Knowledge Panel</li>
<li>Promote your content regularly on social</li>
<li>Add social sharing widgets to make your content easily shareable</li>
<li>Make your content more clickable with Twitter cards and Open Graph tags</li>
<li>Actively respond to comments and shares</li>
<li>Share other people’s content and foster partnerships</li>
<li>Don’t pay for fake followers or engagement</li>
<li>Elevate the social media reputation of your creators</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Too many site owners forgo internal linking on their websites in order to prioritize other areas of on-page optimization.</p>
<p>But did you know those tiny internal links have the power to improve the keyword ranking positions of your web pages? Internal link building alone can have a major impact on all areas of your SEO performance.</p>
<p>Why? Because internal links are essential for search engine crawlers to properly index, understand, and thus promote, your content. This article will cover all the essentials of internal linking for SEO, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#what">What internal linking is</a></li>
<li><a href="#types">Types of internal links</a></li>
<li><a href="#benefits">Benefits of internal link building</a></li>

</ul>
<p><a id="what"></a></p>
<h2>What is internal linking?</h2>
<p>Internal linking is the process of hyperlinking to other pages on your website.</p>
<p>Unlike external links (or outlinks), which are hyperlinks that point to pages on other websites, internal links keep users on your website. They should not be mistaken for “inlinks,” (or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2010/04/01/build-amazing-backlinks">backlinks</a>), which are links from other domains that point “in” toward your website.</p>
<p>Internal links also make up your website’s architecture. If you think of your website like a pyramid, with your homepage at the top, your internal linking profile forms the structure of that pyramid.</p>
<p>Ideally, any page on your website should be reachable in three clicks or less.</p>

<p>Internal linking is one of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/30/seo-basics">SEO basics</a> as they help communicate to web crawlers what pages are the most important, next important, and least important on your website.</p>
<p>Internal links are created using buttons, clickable images, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/anchor-text">anchor text</a>, or the clickable part of the hyperlink that links to the other page. Here’s an example of what anchor text looks like on both the front end and back end of a website.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-anchor-text.png" alt="seo internal linking - anchor text example" width="720" height="379" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60785" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-anchor-text.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-anchor-text-480x253.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>When the anchor text for a page contains that page&#8217;s targeted keyword, it helps improve the SEO value of that page.<br />

<h2>Types of internal links</h2>
<p>There are several types of internal links that you likely have on your website right now. Understanding their differences is important, because they play a key role in your website visitors&#8217; journey.</p>
<h3>1. Menu/navigation links</h3>
<p>The most important internal links on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/31/basic-website">your website</a> are those in your primary navigation menu.</p>
<p>These are a permanent fixture within your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/27/website-header-examples">website header</a> that communicate to users your website hierarchy. Most often they are organized around product categories, primary services, or key topic areas.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-navigation.png" alt="seo internal linking - navigation links" width="720" height="329" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60790" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-navigation.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-navigation-480x219.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>These internal links communicate to users where the “next most important” pages are after arriving on your website. They are called navigation links because they very much operate like a map, guiding users to where they should go next.</p>
<h3>2. Footer</h3>
<p>Like navigation links, footer links remain consistent as the user moves through the various pages of your website.</p>
<p>They should point to other important pages on your website that the user might want to reference. If the user hasn’t found what they are looking for by the time they scroll to the bottom of the page, you want your internal links in the footer to help them find another place to click.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-footer.png" alt="seo internal linking - footer lnks" width="1422" height="680" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60788" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-footer.png 1422w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-footer-1280x612.png 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-footer-980x469.png 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-footer-480x230.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1422px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You will often find contact us, help, frequently asked questions, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/27/guide-to-about-us-pages">about pages</a>, and similar resource-type pages linked in the footer of websites.</p>
<h3>3. Sidebar</h3>
<p>Sidebar links are usually contextual links that also serve the purpose of navigation.</p>
<p>Some websites use internal links in their sidebar to direct users to popular or relevant content. Sidebar links are very common for websites that feature a lot of content, like news or recipe sites, because the user may not necessarily be looking for something specific, but is simply browsing from one page to another.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-sidebar-links.png" alt="seo internal linking - sidebar links" width="720" height="323" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60792" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-sidebar-links.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-sidebar-links-480x215.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>4. In-text</h3>
<p>In-text links are those that appear within the body of a website’s content. They are often utilized in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/05/blog-post-templates">blog posts</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-in-text-links.png" alt="seo internal linking - in-text links" width="720" height="315" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60789" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-in-text-links.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-in-text-links-480x210.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Instead of signaling importance or navigation, in-text internal links point to relevant information that the user can access at their preference.<br />
<a id="why"></a></p>
<h2>Why internal link building?</h2>
<p>Taking the time to add internal links across your web pages has a variety of benefits. Let&#8217;s look at how they help improve your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/05/seo-strategy">SEO strategy</a>.</p>
<h3>Improves user experience</h3>
<p>First and foremost, relevant internal links make your website a better place for users. This is particularly true for those users arriving at your website for the first time with no previous knowledge of the content that lives there.</p>
<p>Making it easier for users to navigate through your web pages and find what they are looking for quickly keeps the user experience a positive one and strengthens the user journey.</p>
<h3>Keeps users on your website longer</h3>
<p>Internal links make it less likely that the user will move on to another website, or return to a search engine, to get the information that they seek.</p>
<p>That means longer page sessions and more page views. That increased time on page also provides more opportunities for the user to convert, as long as your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/05/best-call-to-action-phrases">CTAs</a> and conversion actions are properly optimized.</p>
<p>And if users arrive at your website from Google search (organic traffic) and stay on your page for longer, that also communicates to Google that users are finding the information they seek and that the content must be valuable.</p>
<h3>Help readers learn more in blog posts</h3>
<p>By linking to other relevant blog posts on your website, you can help your users get even more information about your products, services, or topic areas.</p>
<p>Lots of internal links to in-depth, high-quality blog posts also has the great effect of elevating your brand’s industry expertise in the eyes of users.<br />
<a id="benefits"></a></p>
<h2>SEO benefits of internal linking</h2>
<p>In addition to directing users across your website, those internal links are also sending search engine spiders along to crawl and index all of those various pages.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-crawl.png" alt="seo internal linking - crawler illustration" width="720" height="544" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60787" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-crawl.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-crawl-480x363.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As web crawlers move through your website, they are able to gain more information about your content that influences whether or not they will promote those pages in the SERPs.</p>
<p>Strategically adding internal links, then, can have major benefits to your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/27/seo-metrics">SEO performance</a>.</p>
<h3>Easier for Google to crawl and discover new pages</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, any page on your website should ideally be reached in three clicks or less from the homepage. If there is no internal link or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/21/deep-linking">deep link</a> to a page on your website, Google’s crawlers won’t see it.</p>
<p>Making sure that the web pages you want to rank are easily discoverable by search engine crawlers, and therefore crawled and indexed, is an essential first step to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/17/website-visibility"> making your website more visible</a> on the SERP.</p>
<h3>Signal relevance and context</h3>
<p>Google also relies on the anchor text of internal links to understand context and relevance to different search terms.</p>
<p>If the anchor text does not align with the content on the linked page, Google is less likely to trust the page or promote it in the SERPs for related keyword phrases.</p>
<p>However, using the right anchor text can help Google understand what the linked page is about more fully.</p>
<p>This is why using the keyword in the anchor text is important when<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/10/link-building-secrets"> link building</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/keyword-placement-checklist-on-page-seo-720.png" alt="anchor text for internal linking in on-page seo" width="720" height="472" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60794" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/keyword-placement-checklist-on-page-seo-720.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/keyword-placement-checklist-on-page-seo-720-480x315.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Distribute PageRank</h3>
<p>Internal links also help distribute PageRank across our websites.</p>
<p><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6285999B1/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PageRank </a>is a proprietary Google metric that speaks to the popularity of a web page, as measured by the total links pointing to it.</p>
<p>Every time that a page links to another, it passes along a portion of its PageRank, or link equity.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-page-rank.png" alt="seo internal linking - how pagerank works" width="720" height="505" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60791" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-page-rank.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-page-rank-480x337.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Google uses PageRank in its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/09/google-ranking-factors">ranking algorithm</a>, and the more PageRank a page has, the more likely it is to rank well in the SERPs.</p>
<h3>Help Google understand your authority on a topic</h3>
<p>If Google crawlers see that you have a lot of internal links pointing to relevant content on your website, they will see your website as an authority in key topic areas.</p>
<p>For example, a key content asset about <a href="https://linkgraph.io/link-building-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link building</a> might also be linked to from pages about anchor text, guest posts, backlink profile analysis, or other relevant subtopics that relate to link building as a whole.<br />

<h2>Internal linking best practices &amp; tips</h2>
<p>Internal linking is an integral part of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/06/on-page-seo">on-page optimization</a>. However, internal liking the wrong way can drag down your performance in the SERPs.</p>
<p>So how do you do internal linking with the goal of elevating your ranking potential?</p>
<h3>1. Use descriptive, keyword-rich anchor text</h3>
<p>The value of internal linking can only go so far without optimizing the anchor text that makes up those internal links.</p>
<p>Ideally, your anchor text should adequately describe the content on the page. If you want your linked-to page to rank for specific keywords, make sure you use exact, partial-match, or <a href="https://linkgraph.io/how-to-contextual-link-building/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contextual anchor text</a> to signal stronger relevance to Google.</p>

<h3>2. Strategic use of dofollow/nofollow</h3>
<p>In order to pass along PageRank, your internal links will need to be <em>dofollow</em>. Dofollow is a robots search directive that tells Google crawlers they can follow the links on the page rather than ignore them.</p>
<p>There may be times when you want to use the <a href="https://linkgraph.io/noindex-nofollow-and-disallow-search-crawler-directives/"><em>nofollow </em></a><a href="https://linkgraph.io/noindex-nofollow-and-disallow-search-crawler-directives/">tag</a> for pages that don’t need to rank, like “Thank you,” or confirmation pages. More on this later, but if you are internally linking to a page in order to elevate its rankings, that link has no value without the <em>dofollow</em> robots tag.</p>
<h3>3. Link to old posts in your new blog posts</h3>
<p>In general, no new blog post should go live on your website without including internal links to other relevant content.</p>
<p>If you’re not exactly sure where to link to on your website, you can leverage software tools like SearchAtlas and see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0BxqvsOMgE&amp;t=55s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal links suggestions</a> it recommends to you.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-suggestions.png" alt="seo internal linking - suggestions" width="720" height="393" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60793" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-suggestions.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-suggestions-480x262.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Remember though, don’t force internal links if there is no natural relationship between the two pages. That can actually harm your SEO.</p>
<p>If you don’t have the relevant content on your website yet, then add it to your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/01/17/seo-content-beginners-guide">SEO content</a> calendar. Internal linking for SEO gets easier with the more high-quality pieces of content that live permanently on your website.</p>
<h3>4. Link to new posts in old posts</h3>
<p>You should also add internal links in older posts that point toward any new blogs you publish. This is a step that many people forget, but again: Google can’t find a page if there are no links pointing to it and this is a great way to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/03/get-more-traffic-from-evergreen-content">get more traffic from your evergreen content</a>.</p>
<p>So after publishing a new blog, make it a regular part of your checklist to find older, relevant posts and update them with internal links to the new content. The further down your new page is in your site architecture, the longer it will take for crawlers to find it, but as long as those internal links are there, crawlers will have an avenue to index.</p>
<p>Depending on the importance and ranking potential of the new page, you may want to link to the page from old posts with lots of backlinks so they can pass along more link equity.</p>
<h3>5. Monitor and repair broken links</h3>
<p>Over time, internal links may break on your site as you add new content, update old content, or change url paths.</p>
<p>Some content management systems will automatically add redirects as you change these key elements, but not always. It’s important that you take the time to regularly schedule link maintenance into your strategy and identify and repair any broken internal links quickly.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-broken-links.png" alt="seo internal linking - broken links" width="720" height="339" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60786" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-broken-links.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/seo-internal-linking-broken-links-480x226.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Otherwise, you may send users and search engine crawlers to dead pages. That not only disrupts the user experience, it makes your website look like it’s not being regularly cared for, making Google less likely to rank pages from your website at all.</p>
<h3>6. Open in same page</h3>
<p>It’s considered best practice to have your internally-linked pages open in the same tab after clicking. Users can simply press the back button in order to find the page they were at before.</p>
<p>This is the opposite of external links, which should open in a new tab. If not, your links then send your user away from your website rather than keeping them on it.<br />
<a id="strategies"></a></p>
<h2>3 advanced internal linking strategies</h2>
<p>If you already have internal links scattered throughout your website and want to leverage them even more, here are some more advanced strategies for internal linking.</p>
<h3>1. Pillar pages &amp; topic clusters</h3>
<p>Pillar pages are high-level pieces of content that provide broad information about a core topic. Throughout pillar pages are internal links to comprehensive articles on the subtopics related to that core topic.</p>
<p>Although not necessarily advanced in concept, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/11/pillar-pages">building out pillar pages</a> and on your site is extremely time- and resource-intensive. However, having multiple topic clusters strengthens your internal linking profile and establishes your topical authority in the eyes of Google crawlers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pillar-pages-seo-site-structure.png" alt="what are pillar pages - optimal site structure" width="720" height="357" class="size-full wp-image-65339 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pillar-pages-seo-site-structure.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pillar-pages-seo-site-structure-480x238.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /><a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/pillar-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em></em></a></p>
<h3>2. PageRank sculpting</h3>
<p>PageRank sculpting is the process of leveraging your website’s PageRank more strategically through internal links and <em>nofollow </em>tags.</p>
<p>What often happens is that site owners send link equity to pages that just don’t need to rank! PageRank is already hard enough to get, so wasting it on pages that don’t bring value or convert users is less than ideal.</p>
<p>Although users can no longer see what their PageRank is, Google still looks at PageRank as an undertanding of authority and value of web pages. The majority of your site’s PageRank will be centered on your homepage, meaning those navigation and footer links are extremely important.</p>
<p>For more details on how to leverage this strategy, check out this <a href="https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2020/10/26/pagerank-sculpting-how-to-get-more-from-your-links/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PageRank sculpting guide</a>.</p>
<h3>3. Crawl budget optimization</h3>
<p>Google only allows your website a specific amount of <a href="https://linkgraph.io/crawl-budget-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crawl budget</a>. Enterprise sites with thousands of landing pages can easily max out that budget. That means enterprise sites can have thousands of landing pages that aren’t even in Google’s index.</p>
<p>Although a more advanced strategy, SEOs often use a combination of internal links, sitemaps, and robots tags to make sure that Google’s web crawlers index their most high-value, highest-converting pages.</p>
<p>Although smaller websites don’t need to worry about crawl budget optimization, larger websites should <a href="https://www.oncrawl.com/technical-seo/googles-crawl-budget-optimization/#:~:text=Crawl%20budget%20optimization%20is%20the,websites%20without%20reaching%20its%20limit." target="_blank" rel="noopener">be aware of their crawl budget and strategize accordingly</a>.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t ignore internal linking</h2>
<p>In summary, if you want to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">get more traffic to your website</a> and improve the user experience,  the internal links on your website should not be an afterthought!</p>
<p>With a little bit of time and planning, your internal links can help you see more pages in Google’s index and better ranking positions.</p>
<p>And all of those efforts will also benefit the most important stakeholders—your users—helping them discover more of your content and converting more often. And if you&#8217;re ready for more ideas, learn from these <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/seo-examples/">SEO examples</a>.</p>

<h3>1. Core Web Vitals optimization</h3>
<p>Last year’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/19/core-web-vitals-google-page-experience-update">page experience update</a> was arguably the biggest change for search in the last several years. Page experience, now quantifiable by <a href="https://linkgraph.io/what-are-core-web-vitals/">Core Web Vitals</a> is now officially a Google ranking factor. Core Web Vitals include the following performance metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</strong>: the amount of time it takes the largest content asset on the page to load.</li>
<li><strong>First Input Delay (FID)</strong>: how long it takes for your site to respond to a user&#8217;s first interaction with the page.</li>
<li><strong>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</strong>: how many unexpected layout shifts occur during the lifespan of the page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of all the areas to direct your SEO investments in 2022, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/02/improve-core-web-vitals">improving Core Web Vitals</a> signals across your pages is bound to have the most tangible impact on your search engine performance. This will most likely require the assistance of skilled web developers, but these free tools will be essential to identify where your web pages need improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://search.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Google Search Console</strong></a>: The Experience feature of your Google Search Console account will let you see which pages are meeting or not meeting Core Web Vitals standards. It also lists the types of issues impacting your pages.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Example of Core Web Vitals Report in Google Search Console</em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>PageSpeed Insights</strong></a>: In addition to Core Web Vitals data, PageSpeed Insights reports can give you an additional look into how your web pages are performing for users.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-core-web-vitals-results.png" alt="seo trends 2022 - pagespeed insights results" width="727" height="438" class="aligncenter wp-image-56117" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-core-web-vitals-results-1280x772.png 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-core-web-vitals-results-980x591.png 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-core-web-vitals-results-480x289.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Example PageSpeed Insights report</em></p>
<p>In the SEO industry, we will likely see agencies and SEO providers expand their service offerings to include page experience and Core Web Vitals optimization this year. If you don’t have the team in-house to make these more technical optimizations, consider outsourcing to an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/15/small-business-seo-services">SEO service provider.</a><br />
<a id="paa"></a></p>
<h3>2. People also ask</h3>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2021/08/data-shows-people-also-ask-and-local.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study of 2.5 million search queries</a> showed that Google’s “People also ask” feature now shows up for about 48.6% of searches.</p>
<p>With its prominent placement at the top of the SERP (and often above position one), everyone is going to want to get their content ranking in this coveted SERP feature.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-people-also-ask.png" alt="seo trends 2022 - people also ask section" width="600" height="186" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56115" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-people-also-ask.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-people-also-ask-480x149.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" />Example of the P<em>eople also ask SERP feature</em></p>
<p>To get there, you need to provide answers to common questions in your content. Look to the SERPs or use a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/09/18/best-keyword-research-tools">keyword research tool</a> to identify long-tail question keywords among your audience</p>
<p>Then, provide comprehensive answers, including the questions in your H2s, H3s, and H4s, or adding a FAQ section.</p>
<p>This strategy will be a great way to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/17/website-visibility">gain more visibility</a> at the top of SERPs in 2022, even if the web page where you provided the answer ranks lower on<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/19/get-on-first-page-google"> page one</a> (or even on page two!).<br />
<a id="keywordclustering"></a></p>
<h3>3. Keyword clustering</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/the-big-easy-guide-to-keyword-research-for-businesses">Keyword research</a> is the foundation of SEO. But as Google’s natural language processing (NLP) technology has gotten more advanced, effective keyword targeting has become a more granular and complex process.</p>
<p>Gone are the days of optimizing your landing pages and blog posts for single keyword targets. Google ranks our landing pages for multiple keywords anyway, meaning 2022 is the year to aim higher.</p>
<p><a href="https://linkgraph.io/keyword-clusters-guide-for-seo-strategists/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keyword clustering</a> is a more advanced keyword strategy to level up your total keyword rankings. It involves identifying multiple keywords with similar search intent and creating web pages that target those “clusters.”</p>
<p>In the example below, we could create an interview software keyword cluster with keywords like:</p>
<ul>
<li>interview scheduling software</li>
<li>interview scheduling tool</li>
<li>online interview software</li>
<li>virtual interviewing software</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-keyword-clustering.png" alt="seo trends 2022 - keyword clustering" width="720" height="457" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56109" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-keyword-clustering.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-keyword-clustering-480x305.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /><br />
<em>Example of keyword clustering using spreadsheets.</em></p>
<p>Keyword clustering is a more effective way to increase the total keywords your web pages rank for and establish your website as an authority in key topic areas. Although more time-intensive, the results can mean Google showing the same web page for hundreds of additional keywords.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Use our<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Blog_InContentTextLink_FKT"><strong> Free Keyword Tool</strong> </a>to start forming your clusters.<br />
<a id="ai"></a></p>
<h3>4. AI-generated content</h3>
<p>The machine learning model <a href="https://linkgraph.io/gpt-3-the-5-things-seos-digital-marketers-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPT-3</a> (third-generation <span>Generative Pre-trained Transformer) </span>was made publicly available last year through OpenAI. As a result, AI-assisted SEO content tools like CopyAi, Headlime, Jarvis, and others are on the rise,  empowering content teams to generate more SEO-optimized content at a quicker rate.</p>
<p>These tools can generate topics, titles, meta tags, paragraphs, and even entire articles with just a few inputs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-ai-content-example.png" alt="seo trends 2022 - ai content example" width="720" height="641" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56297" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-ai-content-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-ai-content-example-480x427.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Example of blog content generation with SearchAtlas</em></p>
<p>Although I strongly discourage you from replacing your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/03/seo-copywriting">human SEO copywriting</a> with robots entirely, AI-generated content can be a great starting point. In 2022, we will likely see more content teams incorporating AI copywriting tools into their workflows.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most effective ways to utilize AI content tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title/topic generation</strong>: Not sure what to write? Speed up the ideation and brainstorming process with AI-generated titles and topics.</li>
<li><strong>Meta tag generation</strong>: If you need hundreds of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/meta-tags">meta tags</a>, AI copywriting tools can help you produce original and unique page titles and meta descriptions at scale.</li>
<li><strong>Outlines/first drafts</strong>: Once again, these should serve as a starting point, not a replacement. AI tools still give themselves away as robots with obvious errors and unnatural phrasing, so build off of AI-generated drafts to save time and produce content faster.</li>
</ul>
<p><a id="contentoptimization"></a></p>
<h3>5. Content optimization software</h3>
<p>Content optimization tools can help you create high-quality, semantically-rich content that<a href="https://localiq.com/rank-your-business-higher-on-google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ranks higher in Google</a>.</p>
<p>Using similar NLP algorithms as Google, these tools identify keywords, subtopics, synonyms, and even common questions search engine crawlers are looking for on the page when promoting content.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll likely see more sites leveraging the power of content tools this year. I myself have seen content optimization have an almost immediate impact on the total keywords and average positions a web page ranks for.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-content-optimization-software-results.png" alt="seo trends 2022 - content optimization results" width="720" height="223" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56114" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-content-optimization-software-results.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-content-optimization-software-results-480x149.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Immediate jump in impressions and average position after using content optimization software.</em></p>
<p><a></a></p>
<h3>6. More structured data &amp; rich snippets</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/15/what-is-schema-markup">Schema markup</a> is a vocabulary of microdata that helps Google better understand and extract content from your pages, enabling them to show up as rich snippets, which are more attractive and clickable for users.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-structured-data-rich-snippets.png" alt="seo trends 2022 - structured data and rich snippet example" width="660" height="143" class="aligncenter wp-image-56118" /></p>
<p>Google loves rich snippets because it helps its crawlers better show users the exact content they’re searching for, meaning a better experience for users. And with Google supporting new schema markups each year (including <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/18/best-marketing-strategies#clipmarkup">video schema</a> and <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-supports-new-schema-markup-for-education-sites/400273/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">education sites</a>, it&#8217;s not going to be slowing down with these anytime soon.</p>
<p>Businesses that leverage schema markup are already far ahead of their competitors, as many digital marketers still don’t utilize it. Take a look at <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/search-gallery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s full list of rich results</a> to see which are relevant to the content on your website, and then make it a goal to add the appropriate schema markup in 2022.<br />
<a id="longform"></a></p>
<h3>7. Long-form content</h3>
<p>Google likes to rank high-quality content. Although content length is not a ranking factor, there is a strong correlation between <a href="https://linkgraph.io/content-length-and-seo-does-it-really-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">longer content</a> and better rankings.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-long-form-content.jpg" alt="seo trends 2022 - content length vs rank" width="720" height="454" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56113" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-long-form-content.jpg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-long-form-content-480x303.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Why? Because long content is more likely to display the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/12/google-e-a-t">E-A-T</a> signals that Google associates with quality, such as in-depth content, original research and analysis, and expert authorship and sourcing.</p>
<p>As Google continues to improve its NLP algorithms, it will keep getting better at recognizing quality. So take the time to provide comprehensive information on the keywords you&#8217;re targeting and you&#8217;ll likely see higher keyword rankings and higher average positions.<br />
<a id="seo"></a></p>
<h3>8. Good ol&#8217; boring SEO</h3>
<p>Although Google updates its algorithm and search engine technology improves, the core principles of SEO have always remained the same. To see SEO success in 2022, the basics still apply:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content quality:</strong> Create accurate, up-to-date, original, and in-depth articles on keywords relevant to your audience.</li>
<li><strong>On-page SEO: </strong>Make sure your meta titles, meta descriptions, header tags, images, body text are optimized so Google can better understand the content on your pages.</li>
<li><strong>Backlinks:</strong> Focus on getting <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2010/04/01/build-amazing-backlinks">high-quality backlinks</a> from other sites through content marketing, guest blogging, and public relations.</li>
<li><strong>Technicals:</strong> Create fast-loading, responsive web pages with high-quality UI/UX and make sure they are indexed properly.</li>
<li><b>Industry-specific ranking factors: </b>Align with these, whether for local business, credit lending, legal services, healthcare, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>&gt;&gt; Is your site optimized to rank on Google? <a href="https://localiq.com/localiq-grader?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Get a free SEO audit with the LOCALiQ website grader.</strong></a><br />
&lt;aid=&#8221;democratization&#8221;&gt;</p>
<h3>9. The democratization of search</h3>
<p>Because Google is so much better at recognizing content quality and page experience signals on web pages, the role of authority will not play as significant a role in the coming years as it used to.</p>
<p>Although backlinks and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/12/domain-authority"> Domain Authority</a> will still be essential to ranking well in 2022, search is becoming a more democratic place.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-search-more-democratic.png" alt="seo trends 2022 - democratization of search" width="720" height="488" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56111" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-search-more-democratic.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-search-more-democratic-480x325.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Incumbents will not be able to rely on their authority signals alone to maintain top keyword positions, and newer websites will have more chances to rank if they provide a high-quality, high-performing web experience for users.<br />
<a id="searchexperience"></a></p>
<h3>10. Another search engine?</h3>
<p>With open-source technologies like GPT-3 becoming widely available, that means more opportunity for key players to create their own search engines.</p>
<p>I don’t see Google losing market share anytime soon, but we are already seeing companies like Apple investing in creating its own search experiences for users.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-safari-search-experience.jpg" alt="seo trends 2022 - apple's search experience improvements" width="500" height="847" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56116" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-safari-search-experience.jpg 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-trends-2022-safari-search-experience-480x813.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Google’s dominance has arguably been well-earned because it produces the highest quality search results. However, with new and existing search engines being able to access the best in NLP technologies, we will likely see Google’s competitors refine their own products in order to better compete.</p>
<p>That’s great news for the SEO industry overall, as more businesses and brands will want to be discovered through the new ways users may be searching for content.</p>
<h2>The best SEO strategies for 2022</h2>
<p>Overall, site owners and digital marketers should stick to the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/30/seo-basics">SEO fundamentals</a> this year. But do pay attention to tools and technologies that can help your team save time and produce more impactful results.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>Whether you’re a seasoned digital marketer or brand new to the world of SEO, you’ve likely heard about Domain Authority (DA). The DA metric has a long history in the SEO industry, and many SEO strategists use it to understand and quantify the ranking potential of websites.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/domain-authority-moz.png" alt="Moz domain authority score example" width="720" height="132" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53639" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/domain-authority-moz.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/domain-authority-moz-480x88.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>But what exactly is Domain Authority and how important is it to your own SEO strategy? Domain Authority is not just for the SEO nerds, and anyone who wants to rank higher in search results can benefit from having a more nuanced understanding of this site authority metric.</span></p>
<p><span>In this article, I hope to demystify Domain Authority by answering the following questions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><span>What is Domain Authority and how is it calculated?</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>What do I really need to know about Domain Authority?</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>How can I increase Domain Authority? </span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>How can I use DA in my SEO strategy?</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span>What is Domain Authority?</span></h2>
<p><span>Domain Authority is a metric created by Moz, an SEO software, that quantifies how likely a website is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/19/get-on-first-page-google">rank in search engine results</a>. Domain Authority is on a 0-100 scale with higher scores predicting stronger ranking potential. </span></p>

<h2><span>How is Moz Domain Authority calculated?</span></h2>
<p><span>There are several factors that Moz uses to calculate DA, but the most significant is the inbound links pointing to your domain, also known as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2010/04/01/build-amazing-backlinks">backlinks</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>Moz gathers this information from its constantly updated Link Explorer index. Sites with more backlinks and unique referring domains are more likely to have higher DA scores.</span></p>
<p><span>You can read all about the math behind Domain Authority in <a href="https://moz-static.s3.amazonaws.com/products/landing-pages/announcements/Authority_Scoring_Guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moz’s Authority Scoring Guide</a>. But to keep it as simple as possible, it’s all about your backlink profile.</span></p>
<h2><span>What is a Good Domain Authority score?</span></h2>
<p><span>Because Domain Authority is on a 100-point scale, it can be tempting to categorize certain scores as “good,” or “bad.” But earning a perfect DA score is a nearly impossible feat that only the biggest, most popular of websites have ever earned.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>That’s why Moz emphasizes that <strong>this metric is <em>comparative</em></strong>. Websites with low DA scores can still and often do <a href="https://localiq.com/rank-your-business-higher-on-google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rank high in search engine results</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s say your website has a DA of 25. That may be lower in comparison to the millions of other websites out there, but if that score is higher than your competitors, then you can most likely outrank them for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/popular-keywords?cid=Web_blog_InContentTextLink_PopKw">important keywords in your industry</a>.</span></p>
<p><strong>In other words, a good Domain Authority score that is higher than the domains you hope to outrank.</strong></p>
<h2>How to check Domain Authority</h2>
<p><span>Curious about the Domain Authority score for your own website? </span>You have lots of options. Here are just three:</p>

</ul>
<h2><span>Domain Authority: what you <em>really</em> need to know</span></h2>
<p><span>So what do site owners or digital marketers actually need to know about Domain Authority? </span></p>
<p><span>If your main goal is to simply <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/07/12/get-more-customers">earn new customers from search</a>, it isn’t mandatory to understand the ins and outs of this calculation.</span><span> </span><span>However, Domain Authority has loads of direct applications to crafting a successful <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/05/seo-strategy">SEO strategy</a>. Here are the most important things to understand about this site authority metric.</span></p>
<h3><span>1. Domain Authority is not a ranking factor</span></h3>
<p><span>Although DA can help quantify ranking potential, it has no part in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/30/google-algorithm-updates-2021">Google’s ranking algorithm</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>This is why newer or smaller websites with lower Domain Authority scores’ can still outrank competitors if they create <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/15/quality-content-defined">high-quality</a>, informative, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/29/fresh-content-google-ranking-factor">fresh</a>, and relevant content for users.</span></p>
<p><span>However, some of the factors that Moz uses to calculate Domain Authority are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/09/google-ranking-factors">Google ranking factors</a>, like the number of linking root domains and number of linking pages. As a result, there is often a positive relationship between DA scores and other SEO performance indicators like keyword rankings, average position, and organic traffic.</span></p>
<h3><span>2. Domain Authority is not the only site authority metric</span></h3>
<p><span>Moz’s Domain Authority is not the only site authority <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/27/seo-metrics">metric available to SEOs</a>. Other big SEO brands and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/09/18/best-keyword-research-tools"> keyword research tools</a> with large link indexes have developed their own authority metrics. Some you may recognize include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><span>Majestic’s <strong>Citation Flow</strong></span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Semrush’s <strong>Authority Score</strong></span></li>
<li><span>Ahrefs’ <strong>Domain Rating (DR)</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/domain-authority-domain-rating-ahrefs.png" alt="domain rating in ahrefs" width="650" height="207" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53633" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/domain-authority-domain-rating-ahrefs.png 650w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/domain-authority-domain-rating-ahrefs-480x153.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>DR (domain rating) is Ahrefs&#8217; Domain Authority metric.</em></p>
<p><span>And because each of these brands uses its own unique calculation and link indexes, your website’s scores could vary widely for each metric.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>For example, the below <a href="https://linkgraph.io/domain-rating-vs-domain-authority/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Domain Rating vs Domain Authority</a> scatter plot compares Ahrefs DR and Moz DA scores approximately 9,700 domains. The upward trend shows that the site authority metrics have a positive relationship with each other.</span></p>
<p><span> <img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-increase-domain-authority-vs-domain-rating.jpg" alt="how to increase domain authority - domain authority vs domain rating" width="720" height="455" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53623" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-increase-domain-authority-vs-domain-rating.jpg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-increase-domain-authority-vs-domain-rating-480x303.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></span></p>
<p><span>However, the data also shows that there are times when DA and DR scores can widely differ for the same domain. The group of domains where DA scores are significantly lower than DR scores may be because Ahrefs’ considers both the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/link-building">quality of links</a> and the authoritativeness of referring domains in its <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/domain-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DR calculations</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>So although DA is arguably the most widely used authority metric in the SEO industry, it is by no means the absolute truth of ranking potential. it’s important to note that there are other ways to understand the health and ranking potential of your website beyond DA. </span></p>

<h3><span>3. Google&#8217;s PageRank is the original authority metric</span></h3>
<p><span>Long before Domain Authority was on the SEO scene, Google’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> was the original authority metric.</span></p>
<p><span>Google used to publicly display the PageRank of web pages in its toolbar, but because black-hat SEOs exploited that information to help their rankings, Google now keeps PageRank scores under lock and key. </span></p>
<p><span>Essentially, every time a page links to another, it passes along a portion of its PageRank (or link equity). That means that pages with lots of backlinks will pass along more PageRank than others. It looks something like this:</span><span> </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-pagerank-works.gif" alt="how google pagerank works" width="595" height="417" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53630" /></p>
<p><span>Unlike Domain Authority, PageRank is actually a ranking factor that Google relies on when promoting web pages. So although Google no longer gives us direct insight into PageRank, site owners need to realize that every hyperlink is still passing along PageRank (or<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2010/07/15/how-to-find-and-drain-link-juice"> link juice</a>) throughout the internet. </span></p>
<h3><span>4. Improving Domain Authority &amp; off-page SEO go hand-in-hand</span></h3>
<p><span>Because the Domain Authority calculation primarily relies on backlinks, off-page SEO strategies like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/10/link-building-secrets">link building</a> and digital PR are really the only way to elevate site authority metrics like DA. </span></p>
<p><span>Although improving <a href="https://localiq.co.uk/blog/what-is-on-page-seo-and-why-is-it-important-for-business/">on-page SEO</a> will always be a worthwhile endeavor for improving your relevance and quality in the eyes of Google, on-page optimizations won’t directly influence your DA like backlinks will.</span></p>
<p><span>However, with higher-quality content on your website, earning backlinks through<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/13/off-page-seo"> off-site strategies</a> will likely become far easier. In general with SEO, a multidisciplinary approach is likely to be more effective than relying on a single strategy on its own. </span></p>
<h2><span>How to increase Domain Authority (safely)</span></h2>
<p><span>Because DA is calculated primarily through backlinks, off-site strategies like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/link-building">link building</a> are the best way to try to improve your score. </span><span>But this is not as easy as it sounds, as we have no control over whether or not another website chooses to link to ours. </span></p>
<p><span>Also,<strong> some link-building strategies are considered “black-hat,”</strong> meaning your website can be <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/30/google-penalty">penalized by Google</a> if it appears to be paying for backlinks or engaging in spammy link practices.</span></p>
<p><span>But there are plenty of ways to safely increase the overall authority of your domain, and as a result, your DA scores. Below are some of my favorite <a href="https://linkgraph.io/link-building-for-seo-guide-for-beginners-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link building strategies</a> because they are both effective and Google-compliant.</span></p>
<h3><span>1. Get listed in directories</span></h3>
<p><span>For small and local businesses, getting your domain listed across online directories is both a high-impact and cost-effective (under $100) way to increase your DA. Here are <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/best-free-business-listing-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the best 10 directories to start with.</a></span></p>

<h3><span>2. Write great content</span></h3>
<p>First and foremost, focus on making your content so good that other sites will discover and link to it naturally (think <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/12/google-e-a-t">E-A-T</a>). Write a great keyword-targeted post that ranks, and a blogger or business looking to write about that topic will discover your post in their research and <em>hopefully </em>link back to your site in their post. I say hopefully because if the information you&#8217;ve provided is common knowledge and there&#8217;s no way to prove that the writer got this information from your page, the less likely you are to get a citation.</p>
<p>But if you share original research or a thought leadership piece on the topic—something that is hard to replicate— the more likely you are to get that backlink. You can take this approach for high-volume keywords or super-niche topics. Just be sure to promote on social media to get more eyes on it.</p>
<h3><span>3. Contribute guest posts</span></h3>
<p><span>Contributing blog content, original research, or thought leadership to other relevant, high DA websites in your industry is also a great way to earn more backlinks to your website, and thus elevate your DA. </span></p>
<p><span>Publishers are always looking for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/07/29/great-content">great content</a>, and if you provide that content for them, you not only elevate your brand expertise but will often earn a backlink to your website in the byline—or even in the body of the post.</span></p>
<p><span>To elevate your Domain Authority faster, seek out guest blogging opportunities in industry-specific publications that have <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/topical-authority">topical relevance</a> to your own. </span><span>For example, the below chart shows the topical relevance of my own brand’s website in comparison to one of our top competitors.</span></p>
<p><span> <img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-increase-domain-authority-category-vs-total-depth.png" alt="how to increase domain authority - industry vs depth" width="720" height="309" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53621" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-increase-domain-authority-category-vs-total-depth.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-increase-domain-authority-category-vs-total-depth-480x206.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><span>Topical Relevance of Backlink Profiles as seen in </span></em><span><a href="https://www.searchatlas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>SearchAtlas </em></a></span></p>
<p><span>The majority of our competitor’s backlinks come from websites related to Business and Technology. Because we want to elevate our Domain Authority to be higher than theirs, we focus on earning guest blogging opportunities from websites with the same topical relevance.</span></p>
<h3><span>4. Invest in public relations</span></h3>
<p><span>Having a public relations team can benefit any-sized business, but for enterprise-level brands, earning links in well-known publications is key to competing against other websites with really high Domain Authority scores.</span></p>
<p><span>In terms of your overall brand awareness, press coverage that doesn’t include a link can still have some positive SEO return because Google looks to off-site signals like brand mentions to understand your website’s authority. But for raising DA specifically, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/07/24/follow-nofollow-links">dofollow</a> links from top-tier publications will be what ultimately has an impact.</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re a small or mid-sized business that doesn’t have the resources for a PR team, consider signing up for <a href="https://www.helpareporter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Help A Reporter Out (HARO)</a>. This service connects reporters to industry experts and can be a great way to earn high-quality linking opportunities.</span></p>
<h3><span>5. Try broken link building</span></h3>
<p><span>Although a more advanced strategy that will require the use of backlink tools, <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/link-building-guide/broken-link-building/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broken link building</a> can help you find link opportunities to elevate your DA scores. The process is as follows:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Use a backlink analyzer tool to find <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2010/06/02/how-to-find-and-fix-broken-links">broken links</a> on other websites.</span></li>
<li><span>Create content that can serve as a replacement for the missing resource (or identify that existing content on your website).</span></li>
<li><span>Reach out to the editor and offer your content as a replacement.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><span>Other ways to use Domain Authority in your SEO strategy</span></h2>
<p><span>Beyond an authority flex, you can also use Domain Authority scores to develop a highly-targeted SEO campaign. The comparative nature of DA can help you set realistic goals and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/20/seo-audit">benchmark your own SEO performance</a>.</span></p>
<h3><span>1. Choose keywords according to DA</span></h3>
<p><span>When it comes to choosing the right keyword targets, DA can be a useful metric for knowing whether or not your website can realistically compete with those pages already ranking on page one.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>I recommend optimizing your web pages for keywords with a Keyword Difficulty score less than or equal to your Domain Authority.</strong> For example, if you want to rank for the keyword “coffee subscription boxes,” it will likely take at least a DA of 60 <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/19/get-on-first-page-google">to rank on the first page. </a></span><span> </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/domain-authority-example-moz-serp-analysis.png" alt="domain authority - moz serp analysis example" width="600" height="441" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55534" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/domain-authority-example-moz-serp-analysis.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/domain-authority-example-moz-serp-analysis-480x353.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>This is not an absolute barometer, but it can be very helpful for identifying lower-competition keywords that will bring your website organic traffic in the short term while you build up your Domain Authority over time.</span></p>
<h3><span>2. Identify your SEO priorities</span></h3>
<p><span>Because DA is a comparative metric, one of the best ways to use the score is in thinking about your competition. </span></p>
<p><span>For example, if your DA is already higher than your competitors, high-quality content alone will likely get you to page one. That means it would be better for your team to invest your resources in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo#_On-Page_Optimization">on-page optimizations</a>, which are more affordable and can often be done in-house.</span></p>
<p><span>The reality is, off-site SEO is usually more time, resource, and cost-intensive. If there is still a significant gap between your Domain Authority and your competitors, then being aggressive with your off-site strategy will be a must-do if you want to compete and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/17/website-visibility">make your website more visible on Google</a>.</span></p>
<h3>3. Pay attention to Google&#8217;s guidelines</h3>
<p>While Domain Authority isn&#8217;t an official ranking factor (again, it&#8217;s a Moz metric), it is a representation of two things that are: E-A-T and backlinks. In Backlinko&#8217;s <a href="https://backlinko.com/seo-this-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guide to SEO in 2022</a>, Brian Dean points out that Google&#8217;s Quality Rater Guidelines says the creator of the main content plays a role in your ranking. This means making sure your blog authors are experts in the topic being covered and have bylines that say so, and that Google can learn as much about your website&#8217;s expertise and authority as possible through your about page, contact page, privacy policy, and terms of service.</p>
<h2><span>Increase Domain Authority, improve your ranking</span></h2>
<p><span>In some ways, Domain Authority can feel like a bit of a status symbol in the world of SEO. Really high DA scores are impressive and not easy to get, but remember, your SEO success is not limited or defined by your Domain Authority. </span></p>
<p><span>Still, improving DA is worthwhile because it relies on factors that are essential to ranking well in Google, and ranking well in Google means <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">more traffic to your site</a>. </span><span>To show Google that your domain is authoritative and well-trusted by other websites on the internet, follow the steps covered in this post to increase your Domain Authority:</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p>For any digital marketer who wants to elevate their SEO performance, taking the time to add schema.org markup to their web pages can help those pages appear in rich results, which are more clickable and desirable to users.</p>
<p>But many hesitate to work on the backend of their websites. They know that schema is important, but forgo adding the markup to their pages (or default to plugins) without really understanding what schema is and how it can help generate more organic traffic.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/what-is-schema.org_.png" width="720" height="480" alt="what is schema.org markup" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>For those digital marketers who are not familiar with the multiple schema types available and how they can boost search engine visibility, this article will cover the following schema essentials:</p>
<ul>
<li>What schema.org markup is and why it’s important to search engines.</li>
<li>How schema.org can help with SEO performance.</li>
<li>The different schema types and how to choose the best types for your web pages.</li>
<li>How to add schema markup to a web page without consulting a web developer.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is Schema markup?</h2>
<p>Schema.org markup is a shared vocabulary of microdata that helps major search engines better understand the content on web pages.</p>
<p>The schema vocabulary includes specific ways of structuring data around people, places, and things. When Google crawlers find a specific schema type on their web page, it helps them understand what that content means, and which kinds of rich results to serve.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/what-is-structred-data-rich-results-example.png" width="720" height="444" alt="what is schema markup: example of recipe rich results" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>The <a href="https://schema.org/docs/gs.html">Schema.org</a> website estimates that only about 10 million web pages utilize schema. In the vast landscape of the internet, that’s a pretty small percentage.</p>
<p>So those digital marketers who take the time to add schema to their pages have even more opportunities to outrank and outperform their competitors in search.</p>
<h2>How does Schema work?</h2>
<p>As with other markup formats, schema microdata is applied to the content of a page to define exactly what it is and how it should be treated. Schema elements and attributes can be added directly to the HTML code of a web page to provide the search engines’ crawlers with additional information.</p>
<p>In the example below from schema.org, which focuses on content about James Cameron’s 2009 movie, “Avatar,” you can see that adding the &#8220;itemtype&#8221; attribute to the relevant &#8220;div&#8221; block makes it easier for search engines to identify that this content relates to a movie, as defined by the schema.org <a href="http://schema.org/docs/full.html">type hierarchy</a>. Similarly, the addition of the &#8220;itemscope&#8221; attribute specifies that everything contained in that particular &#8220;div&#8221; block references a specific item&#8211;in this case, James Cameron’s $237 million remake of “Fern Gully.”</p>

</div>
<p>Let’s look at another example from schema.org:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="3f182cd3-8448-46bd-ba7d-8be1bdfe416b" data-langcode="und">

</article>
</div>
<p>Times and dates can be very difficult for search engines to interpret correctly. This is due to differences in how dates are formatted, whether the event in question took place in the past or is scheduled to occur in the future.</p>
<p>In this example, the inclusion of the &#8220;event&#8221; itemtype attribute makes it clear that this is an event taking place on a specific date (as you can see by the addition of the &#8220;startDate&#8221; and &#8220;datetime&#8221; attributes), making it easier for search engines to return relevant results to the user. This eliminates any ambiguity for users searching for information about the 1984 film of the same name.</p>
<h2>What are the SEO benefits of Schema markup?</h2>
<p>The primary value proposition of <a href="https://linkgraph.io/a-complete-guide-to-schema-markup/">Schema markup</a> is that it enables your web pages to appear in rich results, or more prominent SERP placements.</p>
<p>For example, see the first page of the SERPs for the keyword phrase, “target.”</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/what-is-schema-markup-rich-results-google-SERP.png" width="720" height="450" alt="what is schema markup—example of rich results in SERP " typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>Rather than just the standard SERP result with the blue, clickable page title and the accompanying meta description, this SERP has a variety of rich results that also appear at the top of the page.</p>
<p>All of these rich results are powered by schema.org markup.</p>
<p>But there are other benefits of adding schema.org to web pages beyond just improved SERP real estate.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher CTR</strong>: <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-serp-study-which-rich-results-get-the-most-clicks/382445/#close" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Average CTR for rich results is 58%</a> compared to 41% for non-rich results. For some rich result types, CTR can jump as high as 87%</li>
<li><strong>Improved Targeting: </strong>If you are trying to get users to book events, buy products, or make bookings, rich results can help you reach audiences who are looking to do so</li>
<li><strong>Brand Awareness: </strong>Appearing at the top of the and in more prominent real estate can help your brand gain more recognition</li>
<li><strong>Get a CTA from Google: </strong>Some rich results come with CTAs like “Call,” or “Get Now,” which can help drive clicks and conversions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Types of Schema markups and when to use them</h2>
<p>About one-third of Google’s search results include rich results. Rich results not only look more enticing in the SERPs, they more quickly provide users with the exact information they’re looking for.</p>
<p>For example, a searcher that types “indoor garden,” into the search bar is likely looking for a product that will allow them to garden indoors.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/what-is-schema-markup-product-rich-results-example-google.png" width="720" height="421" alt="what is schema markup: example of product rich results" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Example product rich results for “indoor garden” keyword</em></p>
<p>However, a searcher that types “how to garden” is looking for step-by-step information. Naturally, Google populates that second set of search results with the “How-to” rich results.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/what-is-schema-markup-how-to-rich-results-example.png" width="600" height="484" alt="what is schema markup: example of how-to rich results" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>Because Google loves making search as simple and easy for the user as possible, it’s likely Google will continue to add different types of rich results to match the various types of searches people conduct on the internet.</p>
<p>Google now has over <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/search-gallery">30 different types of rich results</a>. Here are some of the most common that you’ve likely seen populate in your Google searches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Article</li>
<li>Breadcrumb</li>
<li>Event</li>
<li>FAQ</li>
<li>How-to</li>
<li>JobPosting</li>
<li>Logo</li>
<li>Product</li>
<li>Q&amp;A</li>
<li>Review Snippet</li>
<li>Video</li>
</ul>
<p>With products, jobs, and events schemas, and, as of earlier this year, <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-supports-new-schema-markup-for-education-sites/400273/">education sites</a>, Google doesn’t appear to be slowing down with rich results anytime soon.</p>
<p>That means if your web pages are not appearing in rich results yet, you’re missing out on tons of opportunities to stand out against your competition.</p>
<p>But no business needs to add every schema type to their website. Your specific industry and the type of content on your website will influence what schema markups will be most beneficial for your brand.</p>
<h2>Schema markup examples: 6 powerful schema types for small businesses</h2>
<p>Across the board, there are some essential schema types that pretty much every small to midsize business should add to improve their SEO performance, brand visibility, and conversion rates.</p>
<p>If you have content on your web page that fits with one of the below schema types, your brand could likely benefit from adding the corresponding schema markup to the page.</p>
<h3>1. Organization schema markup</h3>
<p><strong>Improve brand identity and awareness</strong></p>
<p>The organization schema combines essential information about your business or organization into a knowledge panel that appears in the right side of the search results.</p>
<p>This knowledge panel will show up for search queries that include your brand name.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/what-is-schema-markup-organization-rich-result-example.png" width="500" height="1056" alt="what is schema markup: example of organization schema rich result" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>Here are some specific benefits from adding the organization schema type to your web pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brand recognition:</strong> Because the organization schema consolidates key information about your brand like your name, logo, founder, location, and services, it can help improve brand awareness overall.</li>
<li><strong>Social media following</strong>: By combining links to your social media profiles within the knowledge panel, you can generate more links to your social media pages as well as more followers and engagements</li>
<li><strong>Reputation management</strong>: For enterprise brands with a lot of brand recognition and therefore lots of other people on the internet publishing content with their brand name, schema can help with <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-reputation-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reputation management</a>—by helping to direct users to the information you want them to focus on and understand about your business.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Local business Schema markup</h3>
<p><strong>Get more appointments and bookings</strong></p>
<p>Google knows when a user is searching for a local offering and will rank local businesses at the top of the results accordingly.</p>
<p>Because the majority of local searches happen on mobile devices, it’s important to help improve your appearances in Google Map Pack.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/what-is-schema-markup-local-business-rich-result-example.jpg" width="500" height="761" alt="what is schema markup: example of local business schema rich result" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Local search results on mobile for “physical therapists&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/local-business">local business</a> schema makes it easy for Google to find and display key information about your business like hours of operation, address, phone numbers, as well as display your reviews.</p>
<p>Within the local business schema markup, you can add an action schema with your result, like “Book an appointment,” or “Make a reservation.”</p>
<p>Some of the information displayed in rich results for local businesses is pulled from your <a href="https://linkgraph.io/how-to-set-up-google-my-business-listing/">Google My Business</a> listing, so make sure your business has properly set up and claimed your listing.</p>
<p>Then, I recommended adding the schema markup to your home page, about page, and contact page.</p>
<h3>3. Breadcrumbs Schema markup</h3>
<p><strong>Help users (and search engines) understand your website architecture</strong></p>
<p>The breadcrumbs schema helps search engines know how the web pages on your site interrelate. If you have a lot of content on your site, the breadcrumbs schema is a must-have.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/what-is-schema-markup-breadcrumbs-rich-result-example.png" width="600" height="137" alt="what is schema markup: example of breadcrumbs rich result" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>Although the appearance of a SERP result doesn’t drastically change due to breadcrumbs, it helps users and search engines understand how your content is organized.</p>
<p>It can help reduce the number of times that users bounce back to the search results, but instead encourage them to navigate through more pages of your website.</p>
<h3>4. Sitelink Schema markup</h3>
<p><strong>Give searchers more options and take up more real estate</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to making an impact in the SERPs, sitelinks can help you provide more options to searchers and take up more space.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/what-is-schema-markup-sitelink-rich-result-example.png" width="720" height="525" alt="what is schema markup: example of sitelink rich result" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>Some of the key benefits of the sitelinks schema include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give users more options that are relevant to their query</li>
<li>Direct users to your highest-converting pages</li>
<li>Make your SERP result more desirable and clickable than others</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Product Schema markup</h3>
<p>Let shoppers see key information about your products</p>
<p>Ecommerce companies will significantly benefit by adding the product schema to their product pages.</p>
<p>Product schema shows search engine users key information about your product in a carousel at the top of the SERPs.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/what-is-schema-markup-product-schema-example.png" width="720" height="343" alt="what is schema markup: example of product schema rich results" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>Information like price, reviews, or special promotions will also appear alongside the image of your product in your rich result.</p>
<p>The product schema puts your product at the front and center of the user’s experience so they don’t have to navigate through category pages or your ecommerce site’s search bar.</p>
<p>For your competitors who are not using the products schema, you will also easily outrank them by appearing in the carousel at the top of the page.</p>
<h3>6. Review Schema markup</h3>
<p><strong>Let searchers know you have happy customers</strong></p>
<p>The review schema is arguably one that every business should be using, regardless of their industry.</p>
<p>That’s because reviews are such a key part of most users’ purchasing decisions. <a href="https://linkgraph.io/reputation-management-strategy-tips/">Almost 90% of buyers look to reviews</a> before purchasing a product. So if you have good reviews, there’s no reason not to display them.</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/review-snippet">Review snippets</a> will display those yellow stars alongside how many reviews your product, local business, or software product has received.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/what-is-schema-markup-review-schema-code-backend.png" width="720" height="340" alt="what is schema markup: example of review rich results" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>Seeing directly in the SERP results that your business, product, or service has lots of 4 and 5 star reviews makes your result more desirable in the eyes of users who trust ratings and reviews when choosing products or services.</p>
<h2>How to add Schema to your web pages</h2>
<p>Because adding schema markup means venturing into the backend of their websites, many digital marketers hesitate to add schema.</p>
<p>Although it may be best for beginners to be guided by the help of a skilled web developer, anyone can add schema markup to their web pages using schema tools.</p>
<h3>Choose a Schema markup format</h3>
<p>There are three different schema markup formats. These formats determine which properties are required, optional, or recommended in the schema markup.</p>
<p>No schema format is better than another, but you must know and understand them to ensure your schema is properly validated and can appear in rich results.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JSON-LD</strong>: This format is considered the easiest to implement for beginners, as the annotation type can simply be copied and pasted into the heading of the web page.</li>
<li><strong>RDFa</strong>: Short for Resource Descriptive Framework in Attributes, you can add this code to any HTML, XHTML, and XML-based document</li>
<li><strong>Microdata</strong>: Microdata has separate attributes than RDFa, but the implementation is similar.</li>
</ul>
<p>If all this code talk makes you nervous, don’t worry. You can implement a schema to your web page using tools that generate the code for you.</p>
<h3>Use a Schema markup generator</h3>
<p>To add schema to your web pages, use a schema generator tool. These tools simplify adding schema markup by doing the hard part (the coding) for you.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/what-is-schema-markup-schema-generator.png" width="720" height="328" alt="searchatlas schema generator tool" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Schema Generator in </em><a href="https://linkgraph.io/searchatlas-seo-software/"><em>SearchAtlas</em></a><em> software suite</em></p>
<p>Simply select which schema type you want, add the required attributes prompted by the tool, and you will see the tool generate your code.</p>
<p>The above tool uses JSON-LD markup, so all you have to do is copy and paste the markup into the heading of your web page.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/what-is-schema-markup-schema-generator-script.png" width="600" height="403" alt="example of script from schema generator" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<h3>Test your Schema markup</h3>
<p>You can then check that your schema has been properly implemented with the help of Google’s <a href="https://search.google.com/test/rich-results">rich results test</a>.</p>
<p>After you’ve deployed your web page with the new schema, copy and paste the url into the tool.</p>
<p>Google will notify you whether or not the page is eligible for rich results, which results it’s eligible for, and whether or not there are any warnings on the page.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/what-is-schema-markup-elegibility-checker.png" width="600" height="615" alt="google search console page schema eligibility checker" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>If the page is not eligible, you&#8217;ll see this:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/what-is-schema-markup-not-eligible.png" width="500" height="193" alt="google search console saying page not eligible for rich results" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<h2>Improve your SEO, CTR, and reputation with Schema markup</h2>
<p>If you’re not comfortable choosing your own schema and implementing the code yourself, don’t hesitate to work with a seasoned SEO strategist or web developer to get schema markup implemented on your web pages.</p>
<p>But if the cost of hiring those services is holding you back, you can implement this powerful SEO optimization on your own.</p>
<p>Adding schema to your website will be worth the value it brings in the long term: More visibility, more clicks, and more converting traffic.</p>
