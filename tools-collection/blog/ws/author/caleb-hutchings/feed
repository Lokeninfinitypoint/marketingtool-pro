										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many things that seem too good to be true actually are. Candy corn flavored Oreo’s, Pop Rocks martinis, and <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/45306416/ns/health-diet_and_nutrition/t/pizza-vegetable-congress-says-yes/#.U7HFYZRdVEk">classifying pizza as a serving of vegetables</a> are a few such things that could make the long list. One more to add to that list would be Automatic Bidding in Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords).</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>I recently shared some tips for <a href="/blog/ws/2014/10/30/switch-automatic-bidding-to-manual">switching from automatic bidding to manual bidding</a>. In this post, I’ll explain why you might want to do that. Some smaller advertisers with severely limited time might find comfort and see moderate results in the “set-it-and-forget-it” characteristics of Automatic Bidding. However, if you’re looking to <a href="/blog/ws/2014/04/24/ppc-performance">optimize beyond the basics</a>, there are five specific things to consider before choosing between Automatic vs. Manual Bidding:</p>
<h2>#1: Impression Share</h2>
<p>Just because you’re bidding on a particular keyword doesn’t mean you’re showing up every time it’s searched. In fact, it’s possible that your ads for keywords in your accounts could be shown less than 10% of the time!</p>
<p>The most common reason for lost Impression Share is low Ad Rank. While Quality Score plays a significant role in ad rank, the quickest way to improve your rank is often increasing your bid. <strong>With automatic bidding, you can’t selectively choose to increase the bids on terms that are core to your product or service.</strong> Thus you can’t influence or increase Impression Share on those terms, you will continue to lose impressions for your ads, and potential conversions will pass you by.</p>
<h2>#2: Page Position</h2>
<p>Search can grow your business from the ground up exponentially faster than many traditional channels, yet first people have to see your ad. If it’s buried in a low position on the SERP, searchers might be skimming over it in favor of other links on the page. Think about the last time you searched for a product. Did you even bother to glance beyond the top 3-4 positions?</p>
<p>To ensure you are truly receiving impressions for critical keywords in your account, you would want to bid higher <strong>on those specific keywords</strong> so that your ad places in the top of page or at least position 4-5, to reach those searchers who might be the most actionable to convert. With Automatic Bidding, you again can’t selectively choose to adjust the individual bids on those critical keywords, which leave your ads at the bottom of the page.</p>
<h2>#3: Tiered / Stacked Bidding</h2>
<p>Tiered or <a href="/blog/ws/2013/08/27/adwords-bid-stacking">Stacked Bidding</a>, a more advanced bidding strategy, pertains to the specific match types you’re using in PPC. More specific match types can drive higher CTR’s, increase Quality Score, and even prove cheaper than clicks on more general match types. Those same specific match types and terms can often drive conversions at a higher rate and lower cost than more general variations.</p>
<p>Since those keywords are more valuable and a higher priority, they are bid higher than Broad Matched variations. As you get more specific with your Match Type, you bid 10-15% higher for each: Broad &lt; Modified Broad &lt; Phrase &lt; Exact. <strong>Your Exact Match keyword should have the highest bid since it is the most specific, while the other match types are tiered lower than the next more specific type. </strong></p>
<p>While an advertiser would prefer to receive all clicks on the most specific match type to reap the benefit of higher CTR’s and lower cost, Google tends to be more concerned with your Max CPC (when bidding manually). If you had a higher Max CPC on a Broad Matched keyword, that term is likely to pull in Exact Matches as well, even if you have a specific Exact Match keyword in the account (Impression Share also plays a role in why this occurs). To prevent this from occurring, you would typically use this Bid Stacking strategy. However, with automatic bidding, since you can’t edit your bids, you can’t tier your match types, which leaves it up to Google to decide where to attribute your clicks.</p>
<h2>#4: Exorbitant Bids</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="527f822d-a4a9-4572-9aba-5d8592b60c51" data-langcode="und">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/automatic-bidding-take-my-money-1.jpg" alt="adwords automatic bidding" width="944" height="590" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>To be honest, this isn’t as much of an unavoidable concern as it is a great insight into how Google will manage your account when you hand over this control. Expensive bids can certainly be avoided with a realistic maximum CPC setting, however one keyword without one can serve as a great example as to why you should avoid giving away control over your bidding.</p>
<p>The keyword below is long-tail, a fairly selective Modified Broad match type, and uses Automatic Bidding. It’s from a competitive industry, but average CPC’s range from $10-$50. It received one click. <strong>That click cost $362.63</strong>. (Click the image to enlarge.)</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="cb55f00a-6576-49ca-b8ef-d5c76dce0def" data-langcode="und">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/why-you-should-never-use-automatic-bidding-in-adwords2028229-1.png" alt="Automated Bidding AdWords" width="1127" height="77" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Again, this can be avoided by setting a lower maximum CPC bid limit, yet it seems to highlight the extremes that can occur with Automatic Bidding. Even in industries like Insurance or Law, clicks rarely go that high. While the Maximum CPC was set high to achieve a high Impression Share, most of the clicks remained around a $10 -$30 Average CPC as expected. More control over your individual bids would guarantee that such a circumstance wouldn’t occur. Google lacks your intuition and discretion for wasting spend, so don’t solely rely on their judgment to determine the value of your keywords.</p>
<h2>#5: Manual Management of CPA</h2>
<p>If you’re taking the initiative to read this post or <a href="/learn">educate yourself in PPC</a>, it’s most likely you prefer to be in control of your account. For most in search, the goal of this control and education is to lower your CPA, or the cost incurred to get each conversion. Automatic Bidding can stand in stark opposition to that goal.</p>
<p>Consider keywords in your account that might convert at a higher rate than others. <strong>Ideally you would want to receive more impressions and invest more on the keywords that convert.</strong> That “attention” would be reflected in a higher bid price for converting keywords and a lower bid for lower converting (but still relevant) keywords. With Automatic Bidding, Google makes the decisions on how the budget and bids are prescribed for all keywords. This prevents you from making more specific preferences for your converting terms as well as lackluster keywords that just might be driving cost rather than value.</p>
<h2>Is It Really NEVER, Ever OK to Use Automatic Bidding?</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s not <em>always</em> an absolute. (That&#8217;d just be too easy for us!) It&#8217;s true that most advertisers prefer to use Manual Bidding as their <a href="/blog/ws/2016/05/11/easy-adwords-bidding-strategies">Google Ads bidding strategy</a>. When creating a new campaign or reworking a severely underperforming one, I would recommend the same. But with changes to the Google Ads platform and algorithms, automated bidding has improved significantly over the past few years, and many marketers find this automated option the best fit for their accounts. To figure out what works well for your account – and your account goals – test both bidding strategies to see how each performs.</p>

<p>Kids are punks. For their first few months, they make their introduction to the world screaming like Britney Spears off auto-tune, and gobble Gerber like they’re sponsored by Nestle. Soon come supermarket tantrums, and increasing elaborate birthday themes met with mild response. Thank god we love them. As they grow, their sneaky pranks evolve, and it’s ever more common for those to include technology.</p>

<p>When it comes to the world of PPC, I bet you thought you were safe, didn’t you? If you’re like most advertisers, you didn’t even see it coming. If you’re running Display campaigns in your Google Ads (formerly known as AdWords) account without the proper settings, these little buggers (and other users as well) could be costing you a chunk of money! Let me show you how…</p>
<h2>Why Google Ads in Mobile Apps Are Dangerous</h2>
<p>The Display Network spreads across millions of websites, apps, and videos, <a href="/articles/facebook-vs-google-display-network">reaching 93% of users online</a>. It’s a powerful tool when used correctly, yet there are a few more intricate optimizations that tend to sneak by unnoticed. The silent killer in this scenario would be related to mobile apps.</p>
<p>While mobile searches are growing exponentially, there are certain applications that really don’t make sense for most advertisers. (Cue the kids.) Google places ads not only on relevant websites (by Category, Interest, etc.) but also within <a href="/blog/ws/2013/03/01/mobile-app-advertising">mobile apps</a> and games. That’s where things get tricky.</p>
<p>Imagine playing a game on your phone or opening an app and having an ad pop up during your experience. Normally one of three things happen: you’re interested in what’s being advertised and click the ad, you ignore the ad or close it, or, most commonly, you accidently click the ad. I opened up a photo-editing app a few weeks ago, and inadvertently clicked an ad <strong><em>3 times</em></strong> trying to close it to use the app.</p>
<p>A look through many accounts shows I’m not alone. Let’s take a look at what the kids are up to. The below is a screen shot of just a few placements from ONE account for the few short months a Display Campaign was active:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="589459f0-d071-4c92-8626-1088070d8296" data-langcode="und">

</article>
</div>
<p>With a top level look at the campaign, we could have thought we were earning relevant clicks and driving appropriate traffic to the site. After a quick review of these placements, it’s clear that it’s more likely that a <strong>toddler is playing on a smartphone somewhere, wasting away your budget. </strong></p>
<h2>How To Check Your Own Account’s Display Network Placements</h2>
<p>First things first. To see if you have irrelevant Mobile App placements coming into your own campaign, start by selecting the specific campaign. Next, click the Display Network tab for the campaign, and the Placement sub-tab right below. This will display the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/30/mastering-display-placements">placements where your ads have shown</a>. To only view the Mobile apps, just enter “mobile” in the query box.</p>

</article>
</div>
<h2>How to Exclude Individual Mobile Apps in Google Ads</h2>
<p>If you find only a few irrelevant placements, kid-related or not, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/02/google-ads-mobile-app-exclusions">you can exclude them</a> from the ad group by clicking on the green “enabled” icon and selecting the “excluded” option. To remove them at the campaign level, you can select the check boxes next to each and use the Edit option above. <strong>The most common culprits I’ve seen are the Flashlight App, Flashcards for Babies, Photo Frame Editors, Doodling Apps, and Random Games. </strong></p>

</article>
</div>
<h2>How to Exclude All Mobile Apps in Google Ads</h2>
<p>It might be wise for most businesses to exclude all Mobile Apps, as they can drive costly clicks that aren’t going to convert, since so much of the traffic is inadvertent. To complete this, you will need to add a Placement Exclusion for “adsenseformobileapps.com.” After selecting the proper campaign, click on the Display Network Tab, and navigate to the bottom of the page where it states “Campaign Exclusions.” In the drop-down menu of the many types of exclusions, select “Placements” and add adsenseformobileapps.com. This will effectively prevent your ads from appearing in any mobile apps.</p>

</article>
</div>
<h2>Site Category Exclusions</h2>
<p>You’re almost done! To ensure that you’re <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/09/google-ads-audience-exclusions">excluding all irrelevant clicks</a>, visit the Site Category Options before you finish. There might be a few you wish to exclude. Three of the most common options to exclude would be the “Death &amp; Tragedy” category, “In-Game” placements, and GMob Mobile Apps. This will ensure that your ads aren’t appearing alongside sensitive material or within games where they will be accidently clicked. With these exclusions set, your Display campaigns will be safe from this inadvertent traffic and unnecessary cost.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When was the last time someone told you they were a good driver? Perhaps it was during an attempt to borrow your car for a weekend excursion, or boast their prowess in parallel parking. Do you recall how they backed up their claim? I’d be willing to guarantee they didn’t immediately pull out their wallet to show you their driver’s license. Why? Because that shiny piece of plastic holds little bearing on their actual capability to drive a car. You’re familiar with this conclusion if you have ever witnessed the exodus of a high school parking lot at 3:00 pm, driven on the 95 into New York City, or tried to merge anywhere in the state of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The same applies on the streets of Search. If you work in PPC or are looking for a consultant/agency, you might have noticed that an AdWords Certification is not a differentiator of any kind from other marketers in the industry. Passing the <a href="/blog/ws/2015/07/07/adwords-certification-test">Google AdWords certification test</a> is a minimum indicator of competency designed simply to show that the recipient should likely know how to navigate the AdWords interface.</p>
<h3><a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLPPC101.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_PPC101_Download">Trying to get AdWords Certified? We&#8217;ve got all you need to know in our free guide, PPC 101: A Beginner&#8217;s Guide to PPC</a></h3>
<p>Here are four reasons why the Google AdWords exam isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. When reviewing a candidate to manage your account or considering AdWords certification for yourself, keep these characteristics of the test in mind.</p>
<h2>You’ll Know Only Enough To Be Dangerous</h2>
<p>In the world of motorcycles, there’s an acronym for inspecting your bike before each ride: T-CLOCS. It stands for Tires, Controls, Lights, Oil, Chassis, and Stands. It serves as a checklist and guide for knowing the condition of the bike, and ensuring all the parts are correctly in place. However, there is one glaringly obvious lesson missing from this information. It doesn’t teach you how to ride.</p>
<p>The Google AdWords exam lacks the same value. <strong>By intent, it is not a course designed to create a highly skilled user, though it is often touted as such.</strong> In contrast, it is simply a basic overview of the system and its general application. It introduces you to the different parts of an account and provides a definition for each, yet doesn’t cover the finer points of when to turn the throttle or when (and when not) to pump the brakes. It’s purely defining the basics.</p>
<p>Take the example of a question below on Ad Rotation&#8230; <em>[Note: We were asked to remove paraphrases of questions and obscure screenshots from the AdWords exam.]</em></p>

<h2>The AdWords Exam Is Purposefully General</h2>
<p>The next time someone promotes their Google Certification as the end-all of qualifications to manage an AdWords account, remember that out of 180 or so questions, this one was included:</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, that’s most definitely correct, yet this is something every freshman knows going into Marketing 101. While good knowledge to have, you can see it’s not specifically directed towards the strategy of PPC advertising or honing your skill set in that medium. The <a href="/blog/ws/2013/12/06/google-adwords-advanced-exam-tips">Advanced Search portion</a>, should you choose it over the <a href="/blog/ws/2014/02/10/adwords-advanced-display-exam">Display Test</a>, provides a bit more direction in strategy. However, it primarily focuses on when to increase budget and how to improve relevance. It flirts with valuable information to optimize your account, <strong>but does a better job of providing definitions</strong>.</p>
<h2>The AdWords Exam Is Self-Serving</h2>
<p>I really like when people are confident talking about themselves. It shows they believe in the value they offer, and there’s usually a long list of proven examples that have cultivated that confidence.</p>
<p>That being said, I could do without being tested on it. Anyone making it to the point of taking the Google AdWords exam should already know the benefit it can provide to their business. Being reminded why using AdWords is such a great decision 30 questions into the test just seems a bit too self-flattering.</p>

<h2>The Google AdWords Exam Doesn’t Cover Potential Hazards</h2>
<p>On my first motorcycle ride I made the critical mistake of running out of gas. This was partially due to the fact that my tank didn’t have a fuel gauge, an instrument that provides a very important metric. While the issue was fixable, it took valuable time and some unnecessary expense.</p>
<p>Learning curves exist in PPC as well, and, unfortunately for some, they can be costly. Working across hundreds of clients, I’ve personally seen the same common mistakes repeated across many accounts. Most come in the form of the application, or lack of, <a href="/keyword-match-types">keyword match types</a> and unfavorable campaign settings or targeting. While each client knows the definition of most of these terms, they don’t understand the correct application of each. Therein lies the problem.</p>
<p>Take Automatic Bidding for example. The question below makes Automatic Bidding sound like the obvious ideal choice for those looking to run their account with little management. Yet, it doesn’t highlight how you’ll lose the opportunity to adjust your bids for position, <a href="/blog/ws/2013/10/28/adwords-impression-share">impression share</a>, or for your target CPA. These distinctions are lost in such a pretty question, and might lead in an unfavorable direction depending on your goals.</p>

<h2>You Can Cheat</h2>
<p>Have you ever been required to complete a “take home” test in high school? Depending on the course, I bet you breathed the same sigh of relief I used to. The reason the pressure would melt away is because with the use of your book or online resources you were guaranteed to ace the test. Now, even though that might have been the case, how confident do you feel about that content today? For most, I wouldn’t be surprised if that information left their memory shortly after copying down the answer.</p>
<p>In the same vein, the <a href="/blog/ws/2017/10/10/how-to-pass-the-adwords-exam">Google AdWords exam</a> is quite literally a “take home” test. Even as recent as last year, you weren’t able to open any additional tabs in your browser during the test. That’s not the case anymore, as you can search the Google Support pages for the correct answer to your heart’s content (as long as that’s within 120 minutes). <strong>Good news is you can easily achieve a passing grade;</strong> <strong>bad news is so can any self-proclaimed expert.</strong></p>
<p>Keep in mind, if you choose to take the Display Test over the Advanced Search portion, you only need a 70% to “pass” and be officially certified. When was the last time you happily handed over your marketing operation to someone who was certifiably average? I suppose it was around the last time you loaned your car to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayhem_(advertising_character)">Dean Winters</a>.</p>

<p>Now tell me:<strong> Am I wrong? </strong>Do you use AdWords certification as the core qualification of who you solicit PPC advice from? Or do you have a nightmare example of less than satisfactory results with a certified manager? Would love to hear the stories in the comments!</p>
