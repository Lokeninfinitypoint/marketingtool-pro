										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="tag__text">Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?</div>
<div class="column">
<p>If your brain immediately and internally screamed out the name of this yellow and porous fella—congratulations! You just made a strong case for using music in your own advertisements. Now we&#8217;ve always been all about music in <em>TV</em> advertising&#8230;</p>
<div><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/music-for-ads-britney-pepsi-ad.png" width="400" height="388" alt="music for ads: britney spears pepsi commercial" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>&#8230;but it is arguably one of the most underutilized strategies for <em>online</em> advertising. But you can’t just choose any music. There’s an art and science to it (and laws to follow!). So in this post, we’re going to cover everything you need to know to improve your ads with music, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>How music improves advertising performance (science!).</li>
<li>Tips for using music in your online ads (emotions!).</li>
<li>The plain-English rundown of music licensing terms (laws!).</li>
<li>The pros and cons of a music licensing service (decisions!).</li>
</ul>
<p>So let’s talk about music in marketing. Are ya ready kids?</p>
<h2>The proven benefits of using music for advertising</h2>
<p>Back in 1991 when Britney Spears was all the rage and Pepsi jumped on her success like Spongebob on a plate of Krabby Patties, we learned a bit about the consumer’s brain relating to music. The Association for Consumer Research conducted a <a href="https://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/7166" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study on the impact of music in ads</a> on TV and found that music in an advertisement improved overall ad effectiveness in many ways, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher purchase intent.</li>
<li>Improved attitude towards the brand and the ad itself.</li>
<li>Enhanced consumer persuasion and ad recall.</li>
<li>Increased preference for the advertised product.</li>
<li>Improved mental image memory of the product.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why does music in advertising have such a strong impact?</h2>
<p>Music’s impact on <a href="/blog/ws/2021/04/23/influence-buyers-marketing-psychology">buying decisions </a>has been studied for years, and the answer lies in the brain. Neuroscientists have analyzed the brain mechanisms related to memory, finding that words set to music are the easiest to remember. This is because <a href="https://www.soundstripe.com/blogs/the-psychology-of-music" target="_blank" rel="noopener">music memory is stored in a few different parts of the brain</a>.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/music-in-ads-brain-on-music.png" width="500" height="333" alt="music in advertising: brain's reaction to music" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>So music can increase ad recall, mood enhancement, and the likelihood of purchasing. And given the fact that on average, it takes eight touchpoints with your brand for a prospect to become a lead with online advertising this is huge.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/music-in-ads-spongebob-meme.png" width="500" height="397" alt="spongebob meme about music" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<h2>But what about using music in ads online?</h2>
<p>The results above are telling, but the study was done on TV ads. So, does music matter in the new age of <a href="/blog/ws/2017/07/05/online-advertising-costs">online advertising</a>? Absolutely. Consider these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/08/video-marketing-statistics">video marketing stats</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marketers who use video <strong>grow revenue 49% faster</strong> than non-video users.</li>
<li>Among consumers, <strong>70% purchased</strong> from a brand after seeing a branded video on social media..</li>
<li>Instagram video ads receive <strong>3x more engagement</strong> than image ads.</li>
<li>Adding a video to your website can <strong>double the conversion rate</strong>.</li>
<li>Social video generates <strong>1200% more shares</strong> than text and image content combined.</li>
</ul>
<p>And think about TikTok. Whether users are dancing to tracks or performing some random task, music is the common link with how users create engaging content.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, <a href="/blog/ws/2016/08/03/video-marketing-ideas">video marketing</a> is a force to be reckoned with, and using music in your promo videos or<a href="/blog/ws/2020/03/05/video-ad-ideas"> video ads </a>makes them that much more powerful. This creates a great opportunity for everyday marketers to get ahead of their competition by thinking a little outside the box with their <a href="/blog/ws/2021/08/02/ppc-strategies">ad strategies</a>.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/power-of-music-in-ads.png" width="720" height="394" alt="nielsen study on the power of music in ads" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2015/i-second-that-emotion-the-emotive-power-of-music-in-advertising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>You just have to know how, where, and when to use it. And that’s what this guide is for. So let’s start with picking the right music for your ads.</p>
<h2>How to pick the right music for ads</h2>
<p>It’s not enough to randomly choose <a href="https://www.soundstripe.com/youtube-background-music" target="_blank" rel="noopener">royalty-free background music</a> for your ads. We’ve established that using the right song has the potential to make a positive impact on how consumers view your brand.</p>
<p>However, using the wrong music can cause an unwelcome distraction from your message. So here are some things to consider when choosing music for your ads:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brand:</strong> What is your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">brand’s personality</a>? How does this music reflect your brand’s voice?</li>
<li><strong>Demographic:</strong> There is likely a correlation between your market and the type of music they listen to. Look at factors such as age, gender, and similar interests.</li>
<li><strong>Content: </strong>Is there a voiceover or is music the main focus? Do you want people to notice the music straight away?</li>
<li><strong>Message:</strong> What mood are you inspiring? What do you want the consumer to do? What <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotions</a> do you want them to feel?</li>
</ul>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/music-in-ads-emotion-brand-appeal.png" width="650" height="253" alt="correlation between emotions, persuasion, and brand appeal" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<h2>Tips for successfully using music in ads</h2>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Once you’ve found the right music, you’ll want to make sure your ads are reaching a music-friendly audience. Here are some tips on how to do that. </span></p>
<h3>1. Focus on placements where users are more likely to have sound on:</h3>
<p>While many Facebook users browse through their feed with the sound off, there are other social media platforms (and scenarios within Facebook) where sound is preferred, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/07/instagram-story-ads">Instagram Story ads</a><br />
<a href="https://www.yumyumvideos.com/instagram-statistics-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>70%</em></a><em> of Instagram users watch Stories on a daily basis, and </em><a href="https://animoto.com/blog/news/social-video-trends-consumers-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>one in four</em></a><em> consumers have made a purchase after seeing a story on Instagram.</em></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/10/31/pre-roll-ads">YouTube pre-roll ads</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/22/instagram-reels-ideas-for-businesses">Instagram Reels</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/22/tiktok-ads">TikTok ads</a></li>
<li>Spotify</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Target audio-focused audiences</h3>
<p>Think outside the box and find ways to reach sound-friendly audiences. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>Market to a lookalike audience of users who have watched a high percentage of a previous <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/14/facebook-video-ad">video ad</a> that was audio-focused.</li>
<li>Consider partnering with an independent musician or influencer who has an audio-focused market and ask them to share your content.</li>
<li>Ask your audience to vote on audio for your next ad or video.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Remind users to turn the sound on</h3>
<p>Not everyone has their sound off because they’re out in public or don’t have headphones. Sometimes they just need to be prompted. Did you know that if a user taps the “sound on” sticker placed in an Instagram Story, it will automatically turn their audio on?</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/music-in-ads-instagram-sound-on-sticker.png" width="400" height="570" alt="music in ads: instagram story sound on sticker" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<h3>4. Test out different sounds</h3>
<p>Be sure to split-test to make sure you’re getting the best results. Test out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Songs</li>
<li>Sound effects</li>
<li>Male vs female voiceovers. This is highly dependent on your market, but generally, <a href="https://www.business2community.com/video-marketing/male-female-voice-matters-explainer-videos-01712050" target="_blank" rel="noopener">female voices are preferred </a>by most users!</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Use captions regardless</h3>
<p>If the sound in your ad is a voiceover, you’ll still want to use captions, of course. This is a given, since videos in Facebook and Instagram feeds are on mute by default. This is also a best practice for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/12/web-accessibility-tips">accessibility</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/30/email-accessibility">inclusivity</a>.</p>
<h2>How to use music in ads legally: what is music licensing?</h2>
<p>If 12-year-old Timmy uploads a YouTube video of his cat with Taylor Swift music playing in the background, the video may get flagged and monetized by T.Swift’s label.</p>
<p>And if a big company plays a Taylor Swift song in an ad to sell their product, well, she may sue you and write a song about it. (As someone who lives in Nashville, trust me, you don’t want a Taylor Swift song written about you).</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/music-in-ads-taylor-swift-lawsuits.png" width="600" height="472" alt="music in ads: taylor swift lawsuit headlines" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p>Bottom line: You REALLY need the legal all-clear to use music in your ads. This is where music licensing comes in.</p>
<p>Music licensing is the means by which a publisher, advertiser, or even another musician gets legal permission to use someone else’s music. Sounds simple, right? But there’s much more to it.</p>
<h2>Terms and misconceptions to know about when using music in ads</h2>
<p>So, what the heck is the law with music licensing and how does it work for marketers? Here are five terms to know:</p>
<h3>1. Fair use</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fair%20use" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fair use</a> is “a legal doctrine that portions of copyrighted materials may be used without permission of the copyright owner provided the use is fair and reasonable, does not substantially impair the value of the materials, and does not curtail the profits reasonably expected by the owner.”</li>
<li><strong>Misconception:</strong> I want to use this song, it’s only fair. I’ll just use it.</li>
<li><strong>Reality:</strong> You can only play the song if you’re giving a commentary on the track. (This is a really gray area and you still might get sued, so talk to a lawyer first.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Creative commons</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creative Commons</a> is a nonprofit organization that makes digital media available for others to build upon legally and share.</li>
<li><strong>Misconception: </strong>The song exists, so as long as I credit the artist in my content, I can use it.</li>
<li><strong>Reality: </strong>An artist still has to grant permission for Creative Commons to be valid. Even still, there’s always fine print around how you can use the music, and sometimes fine print under the fine print. (Hint: Advertising is usually not allowed!)</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Public domain</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning: </strong><a href="https://www.copyrightlaws.com/what-is-the-public-domain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public domain</a> music is not protected by intellectual property laws such as copyright, trademark, or patents.</li>
<li><strong>Misconception:</strong> This song is old and falls under public domain, so I’ll use this track.</li>
<li><strong>Reality: </strong>While the original song may be under public domain, the track you’re using was recorded by an orchestra that owns the master license. You’re still gonna get sued — just not by the (possibly deceased) original artist.</li>
</ul>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/music-in-ads-creative-commons-royalty-free.png" width="684" height="386" alt="music in ads: creative commons vs royalty free vs public domain" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<h3>4. Royalty-free</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning: </strong>Royalty-free music means the music is subject to copyright but does not require you to pay royalties (ongoing payments) or license fees.</li>
<li><strong>Misconception:</strong> This song is free for me to use.</li>
<li><strong>Reality:</strong> You don’t need to pay royalties on a per-use basis, but there may still be some fees involved to license and use the music.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Related: </strong><a href="/blog/ws/2018/06/14/royalty-free-background-music">11 Places to Find Royalty-Free Background Music</a></p>
<h3>5. Copyright-free</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning: </strong>This means the music is not protected by copyright.</li>
<li><strong>Misconception: </strong>This song has no copyright owner so I can just use it.</li>
<li><strong>Reality: </strong>A second party has acquired the right to use the work OR the copyright expired, but it still isn’t “free” for any use. (In fact, there’s really no such thing as free music because licensing is a confusing web of rules and regulations.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is a music licensing service?</h2>
<p>As you can see, finding music for commercial use can be a headache. If you frequently use music in your marketing and advertising content, you may want to check out a <a href="https://www.soundstripe.com/royalty-free-music" target="_blank" rel="noopener">music licensing company</a>.</p>
<p>These are companies such as Soundstripe, Artlist, and Epidemic Sound with libraries of songs that you can legally use in your ads. Their terms and conditions are created specifically for this.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/music-in-ads-soundstripe.png" width="720" height="385" alt="music licensing service - soundstripe platform screenshot" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
<p><strong>Music licensing service pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You don’t have to have a law degree to license music.</li>
<li>No one gets sued.</li>
<li>It’s easy to find great music to enhance your ads.</li>
<li>Pricing is relatively cheap (as low as $20/month).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Music licensing service cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can’t license Taylor Swift songs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Music licensing service cautions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some — but definitely not all — companies have fine print around how you can use their music, so you still might need a lawyer to go through the details with you.</li>
<li>Many companies require a subscription to license the music, and some are more expensive than others.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What to look for in a music licensing service</h2>
<p>Even if pricing is relatively cheap, you’re still paying money. So it’s important to make sure whatever platform you invest in will get you the most  bang for your buck. Here are some things to look for when vetting music licensing platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Additional content: </strong>Some services also provide stock video and sound effects.</li>
<li><strong>Original music: </strong>Some services—like Soundstripe—actually hire musicians to write music for ads.</li>
<li><strong>Quality of music:</strong> Some services actually have Grammy-winning artists and producers they work with.</li>
<li><strong>Tested music:</strong> Soundstripe, for example, actually tests music for conversion rates in its own ads.</li>
<li><strong>“Soundalike” songs: </strong>While you can’t license popular music you hear on the radio, there are “similar song” search tools that allow you to find tracks similar to the one you had in mind.</li>
<li><strong>Standardization:</strong> Every track is produced to the same specs, so you can easily transition from one to another.</li>
<li><strong>Selective features: </strong>You can download stems for every song, so you can choose to mute the vocalist, drums, guitar, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Start using music in your video ads</h2>
<p>At the end of the day, having music in your ad can yield some pretty significant results in your marketing efforts. You can expect to see more positivity around your brand, higher ad recall, and even more sales!</p>
<p>Go check out some royalty-free music playlists, and be sure to review some video marketing best practices before publishing your next video ad. Share your marketing results with Soundstripe for a shoutout and a chance to win a free year of music!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to our annual <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/04/12/state-of-the-agency-report">State of the Agency report</a>, hiring is a top-three challenge, and 15% of digital marketing agencies feel that hiring and training new employees is the biggest challenge they will face this year.</p>

<p>Between finding people with the right background and a strong culture fit, hiring new employees can be a daunting task. However, as you scale your business, you are going to need to hire in order to keep up with the demands of your growing client base. Here are some strategies to consider as you expand your team.</p>
<h2>When to Hire New People</h2>
<p>When scaling a digital agency, it’s important to identify signs that it might be time to bring in an additional team member. Recruiting and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/17/goal-talk-episode-6">hiring new team members</a> is not only a daunting process, it’s an expensive one. So how do you know it’s time to hire?</p>
<h3>You Have Steady Revenue</h3>
<p>About one in four startups fail due to not having the right team, and 29% fail from running out of cash, according to <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CB Insights</a>. While it’s important to ensure you have enough employees to meet the demands of your business, you need to ensure your revenue is steady enough to take on an additional payroll.</p>
<p>Many startups hire due to an increase in stress level without an actual plan. Before taking on an additional employee, you should have a steady stream of income from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/04/client-retention-tips">client retention</a>. If you’re having a difficult time keeping up with the workload, but can’t justify hiring an additional employee from a financial standpoint, consider outsourcing some work to freelancers or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/agencies">other agencies</a> until things start to level out.</p>
<h3>You Found a New Opportunity in Your Market</h3>
<p>Whether you found <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/27/how-to-build-a-ppc-offering">a new opportunity in your service offerings</a> or through expanding your market, it might be time to consider bringing on additional help. New employees can be beneficial not only by taking workload off you and other employees, but by having secondary specialty areas that can contribute to your agency’s overall growth.</p>
<h3>You Can’t Keep Up</h3>
<p>If your client base is expanding rapidly and your employees are getting fatigued, it is extremely important to bring someone in immediately. You should never be in a position where you have to turn prospects away because of workload. Nor do you want your product’s quality to suffer. Here are some signs your company is having a hard time keeping up with their current workload:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employees frequently mention feeling tired, burned out, overworked</li>
<li>Small mistakes are increasing in frequency</li>
<li>Employees are frequently ill and calling out sick</li>
<li>Low morale</li>
<li>Clients are churning more frequently (with or without specific complaints)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all signs that you’re overtaxing your existing staff and need to expand to meet the demands on your business.</p>
<h2>Hiring the Right People</h2>
<p>Once you recognize the need for expanding your team, you need to ensure you’re bringing the right people into your company. It can be difficult to consider expansion when you already have a great team around you, as hiring new people may lead to change in both the culture side of your agency, as well as the service quality. If you want to gracefully scale your agency, you need to have a good process for hiring and maintaining talent.</p>

</div>
<h3>Develop a System for Entry-Level Positions</h3>
<p>It’s great when the perfect applicant walks right in your door, ready to work. They have a portfolio of success with previous clients, and already know how to play the game. However, if you are hiring new employees solely off experience level, you are likely missing out on a big pool of talent. Digital marketing is such a new industry, that very few people in your box of resumes are going to come fully equipped with tons of experience. Your best bet is to develop a new system that accepts and trains entry-level employees.</p>
<p><a href="https://hireology.com/blog/small-business-rethink-entry-level-hiring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">41% of employers</a> say entry-level positions are the hardest to fill. The reasoning behind this is that many agencies try to cut corners with training programs by adding additional requirements to entry-level jobs. This process not only limits qualified applicants from submitting a resume, but also will be taking away from what you should find in an entry-level employee.</p>
<p>Entry-level positions are important in digital marketing, as the main strengths candidates will possess are likely around learning quickly and retaining information. Our industry is constantly changing. Between Google regularly refreshing their algorithms and features, as well as new clients coming and going, you need employees who are able to learn quickly and adapt to change. Entry-level positions are going to be a great place to start when it comes to retaining qualified employees in the future.</p>
<h3>Look for Topic Experts</h3>
<p>At this point as an agency, you should have an idea where your strengths and weaknesses are. Maybe you’re better with small businesses, maybe you’re better with B2B or eCommerce clients. Hiring new people is a great way to expand your company’s strengths. Say an applicant doesn’t have a lot of experience for the role they’re applying for, but does have a lot of experience in a service you don’t offer. This employee may be able to provide new ideas for implementing out-of-the-box strategies to your existing client base.</p>
<h3>Consider Hiring a Recruiter</h3>
<p>Finding the right people can be extremely challenging, especially as you need to t<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/17/how-to-train-new-hires">rain new employees</a> and continue to manage your current client base. If you are spending more than 35% of your time interviewing and searching for applicants, you may want to consider some outside help.</p>
<p>When it comes to recruiters, you have a couple of different options. Ideally, you’d hire someone in-house with experience <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/recruitment-marketing-strategies/">recruiting</a> who fits the culture you’d like to see in your company. This person may not have a deep understanding of marketing, but should be able to learn enough about what you do to provide qualified applicants.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can also consider working with a recruiting agency. This might be a good option if you need a large amount of employees in a short time, or are not sure you’d like to dedicate resources to an in-house position. When <a href="https://theundercoverrecruiter.com/find-right-agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiring a recruiting agency</a>, you should be sure that they specialize in your industry and that they have an understanding of your desired culture.</p>
<h2>Common Hiring Pain Points</h2>
<p>When scaling your team, you are likely going to run into some common hiring-specific issues along the way. I spoke with a member of WordStream’s own recruiting team, Nicole DeSisto, to get a feel for some of the pain points we experience within our own agency’s hiring, as well as how WordStream works to overcome hiring challenges.</p>

<h3>Employee Turnover</h3>
<p>At 17%, <a href="https://www.iqpartners.com/blog/marketing-jobs-have-the-highest-turnover-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing is the leading industry in employee turnover rate</a>, due to a variety of reasons. The first is that digital marketing is constantly changing. New opportunities are frequent, day-to-day practices are constantly evolving, and freelance and consulting opportunities may prove to be more flexible for many people within the workforce.</p>
<p>On top of this, the <a href="https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/careers-salary-snapshot-age/224132" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average age of people in the marketing industry is 32</a>, meaning many employees in digital marketing are considered to be millennials (also known as the “job hopping” generation). Six in 10 millennials are currently open to new job opportunities, and 21% say they’ve changed jobs within the past year. This is an expensive reality, as <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231587/millennials-job-hopping-generation.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">millennial turnover costs the U.S. economy $30.5 billion annually</a>.</p>
<p>With such a high industry turnover rate, even top marketing agencies are feeling the heat from their competitors searching for applicants within their talent pool.</p>
<p>Here’s what Nicole had to say about WordStream’s employee retention efforts:</p>
<p>“This industry is uber competitive in the job market. Just like we want top talent, so does every other digital marketing and advertising company. Our employees are constantly getting approached by our competitors, which can cause challenges from an employee retention standpoint. This is where the importance of culture, employee love and appreciation, and benefits come into play. You must always stay abreast of what other companies are doing to keep their employees happy, to retain your amazing people.”</p>
<p>As a WordStream employee, I can attest to how hard WordStream works to ensure every employee has a plethora of opportunities for career growth and feels valued. Here are some of the awesome perks we offer to our employees to set them up for success:</p>
<ul>
<li>A strong focus on company culture and team bonding</li>
<li>Competitive salary and benefits packages</li>
<li>Flexibility with hours/time off (WordStream offers unlimited PTO)</li>
<li>Transparency around growth paths</li>
<li>Relaxed dress code</li>
</ul>
<p>WordStream also works to show that management, employees, and the organization as a whole care about the same things. For example, WordStream has recently enrolled in an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/18/wordstream-signs-talent-compact">equal pay for equal work initiative</a> that supports diversity in the workplace, and WordStream works with multiple charities in our hometown and has a program that matches employee charitable contributions.</p>

<h3>Standing Out From Other Agencies &amp; Engaging Candidates</h3>
<p>With more and more agencies popping up every day, you need to stand out to potential hires the same way you need to stand out to potential clients. On top of key deliverables such as salary and benefits, candidates need to feel like moving to your agency over another is a good career choice.</p>
<p>Job postings should have a clear layout of expectations as well as day to day life, while maintaining a fun, lighthearted tone. Check out <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/jobs">WordStream’s career page</a> for a specific example. This is where you can highlight your perks, company culture, and core values. Focus on areas your current employees appreciate about your business, and highlight the opportunity you bring to the table.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>We asked Nicole for some advice on keeping candidates engaged throughout the hiring process, and how WordStream handles new hires:</p>
<p>“Recruiting and hiring can be tricky in this market because of the insanely fast pace. If you aren’t moving as quickly as possible in your hiring process, you’re going to lose your amazing dream candidate to another company who hired faster than you. GET MOVING. Avoid things like multiple rounds of interviews, spacing out your interview rounds too long, or hesitating on hiring someone just to see who else is out there. If you spot great talent, HIRE them.”</p>
<h3>Interviewing Difficulties</h3>
<p>If you seem to be losing candidates during the interview process, there are a couple of different areas where your systems may be broken. The first is your job posting. Are your expectations laid out clearly enough? Are you vetting resumes closely enough? Are you confident each employee you bring to the next step is truly a good fit for the role? Once you surpass this area, it’s time to take a look at what’s happening once you’ve begun contact with the applicant.</p>
<p>Choosing interview questions that give you the information you need while continuing to paint a consistent picture of your company’s culture and core values can be difficult. Check out some common interview questions <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/05/08/marketing-interview-questions">WordStream recommends asking candidates</a>. When interviewing, it is important to make the applicant feel comfortable. Asking open-ended questions will give you a big-picture sense of what they’re looking for, and can promote a conversation that allows you to understand who they are as a person. WordStream also includes current employees in the interview process. This helps maintain the company culture, as well as providing the hiring manager with a peer-to-peer review of the applicant, which can be helpful in making a final decision.</p>
<p>We asked Nicole if she had any additional tips or tricks for the hiring process:</p>
<p>“Promote your company’s culture. Get your company’s name out there so that people know who you are and how awesome it is to work there! Create a brand for your agency and never stop building on that brand. Treat your employees well and they will never leave! Move quickly on recruiting and hiring – stay proactive and never get behind, this market is hot.”</p>
<h2>Managing Clients with a Growing Team</h2>
<p>Growing your agency will have a direct impact on your clients. As you increase the number of clients you serve, as well as the number of employees you manage, things are going to need to change internally.</p>
<h3>Develop Processes &amp; Systems</h3>
<p>As you hire more people, you’re going to need a method of internal communication that consists of more than flying paper airplanes across the table. Scaling your agency also means investing in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/12/12/agency-tools">tools to help your business run</a>.</p>

<p>These processes should continuously be tested against each other to find what works best for your agency.

Always look for areas where a process may be failing rather than an employee or client.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Legend has it there’s a castle deep in the heart of the second page of Google. Guarding a castle is a monster named Bowser. Every so often, Bowser will creep from his home and attack innocent listings on the first page (as well as the occasional princess) to bring them back to his castle <em>never to be seen again</em>… until now!</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>Are you ready to play Super Marketing Bros?</p>
<p>In today’s game, we’ll learn how you can use SEO and PPC together to maximize your marketing efforts – and rescue those listings from Bowser. Let’s go!</p>
<h2>Here we go!</h2>
<p>Today, we’ll be working on rescuing Bowser’s latest victims. Super Mario Plumbing is a plumbing company located in the extremely competitive market of Mushroom Kingdom. It’s a family-owned business, currently being run by Mario and Luigi after their father had an unfortunate run in with a carnivorous plant. With their listing, he’s also captured the kingdom’s beloved princess, Peach.</p>
<h2>PRESS START: Understanding SEO &amp; PPC</h2>
<p>Before we get to rescuing, we need to understand SEO and PPC. So what are they? SEO and PPC both fall in the category of “inbound marketing” strategies. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/05/inbound-marketing-examples">Inbound marketing</a> is a type of marketing that allows prospects to find you, rather than you finding them. PPC and SEO work to ensure you show up when someone searches for your name, product, or service.</p>
<h3>What Is SEO?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/articles/seo-faq">SEO, or search engine optimization</a>, is the practice of structuring your site, as well as other areas of the web, to teach search engines what you do and who you are. In return, search engines will show your site to prospects via “organic listings” (listings that are not ads). Though you don’t have to pay for a click, SEO does involve major investments when it comes to time.</p>
<h3>What Is PPC?</h3>
<p>PPC stands for pay-per-click marketing (also known as SEM, or search engine marketing). PPC is the practice of purchasing a slot on the first page of a search engine, usually via <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/articles/what-is-google-adwords">live auction</a> on selected keywords. Unlike SEO, PPC delivers fast results. The second your ads are live, prospects are seeing your business when they search for you.</p>
<h3>So Which Marketing Strategy Should I Use?</h3>
<p>Trick question!</p>
<p>For the past few years, Super Mario Bros plumbing has been making a common mistake. Mario and Luigi have been working against each other, debating on using PPC or SEO. The first step in rescuing their listing is to realize that both PPC and SEO have strengths and weaknesses that directly complement each other. Let’s dive into combined strategies, and why you should use these channels in concert.</p>
<h4><em>Most Marketing Agencies Will Recommend This “Combined” Game Plan:</em></h4>
<ol>
<li>Start off with strong and competitive <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/30/facebook-ads-account-structure">PPC campaigns</a>.</li>
<li>Begin to rank via SEO for the successful PPC keywords.</li>
<li>Back away from PPC, and run off SEO-generated leads.</li>
</ol>
<p>When we sit and think about it, this “combined strategy” really isn’t combined at all! When you keep SEO and PPC separated like this, you are likely losing out on potential opportunities at an overall lower cost. Let’s look at a better combined strategy that leans on the strengths of both marketing strategies.</p>
<h2>Level 1: Optimizing Basics to Help Both SEO and PPC</h2>
<p>The first step to our combined strategy is to make changes to our existing marketing efforts that will positively impact both SEO and PPC.</p>
<h3>Google My Business Optimization</h3>
<p>So many marketers make the mistake of neglecting their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/12/local-seo">Google My Business profile</a>! This is a panel that should appear within the first page of Google when you type in your company name and city.</p>
<p>If we think of the entire internet as a virtual world, your Google My Business profile is your virtual storefront. This is what users see before going inside and purchasing something. How is your curb appeal? Does it welcome prospects?</p>
<p>Optimizing this panel is essential for both SEO and PPC. On the SEO side, optimizations build trust within the search engine, and verify your company as legitimate. On the PPC side, the information on you Google My Business profile can pull into marketing efforts via location extensions.</p>

<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/seo-and-ppc-google-my-business_0.jpg" alt="Google My Business listing" width="762" height="539" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>As far as which optimizations to make, I generally recommend doing as many as possible based on what makes sense for your business. For example, a plumber may benefit from a “Book Now” button; however, a candy store may not find this feature as relevant to their business. The most important thing is to have your name, address, and phone number <em>exactly</em> as it appears on your website.</p>
<h3>Mobile Speed Optimization</h3>
<p>The next combined optimization we’re going to look at is your performance on mobile. Mobile friendliness is both a <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/01/using-page-speed-in-mobile-search.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranking factor</a> for SEO, as well as a quality score enhancer for PPC. These enhancements are extremely important for businesses who are looking to show up for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/04/10/voice-search-statistics-2018">voice search</a>.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="dabaad63-fdb2-4341-8b62-b91a61ba602a" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/seo-and-ppc-mobile-speed-optimization.jpg" alt="mobile page speed optimization" width="419" height="342" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<h2>Level 2:  Using SEO and PPC as a Team</h2>
<p>While most people view SEO and PPC as two separate entities, there are ways they go hand in hand. Looking at the strengths and weaknesses of both SEO and PPC, we can develop a combined strategy to improve our online marketing across the board.</p>
<h3>Using PPC for SEO Keyword Research</h3>
<p>Only <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/how-long-does-it-take-to-rank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5.7%</a> of all new pages will rank organically within the first year of their existence. Due to the long optimization process that corresponds with this timeline, it is essential to use as much information as possible prior to investing resources on ranking a page. We don’t want Mario and Luigi spending hours on a piece of content to rank for the keyword “Why Mario Loves Peach” if it won’t yield a good conversion metric!</p>
<p>A great way to identify which keywords to focus on is to look at PPC data.</p>
<p><strong>To do this, simply look at PPC trends</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider ad copy that converted well and apply it to your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/02/landing-page-copywriting">landing page copy</a>.</li>
<li>Test different page structures via split tests on PPC (form fill layouts, CTAs, etc.) and apply your findings to your landing page.</li>
<li>Monitor search volume and interaction rates on specific keywords before optimizing a page for them on SEO.</li>
<li>Monitor the competitiveness on the PPC side of things to get a better feel for what you might be up against. (PPC competitiveness is not always an exact correlation but can be an indicator of a highly competitive SEO market.)</li>
</ul>
<p>As you continue to make PPC optimizations to test what will work within SEO, you may also find ways to drive down PPC costs!</p>
<h3>Increase Time on Site</h3>
<p>It’s no secret that the majority of Mushroom Kingdom has a low attention span. While we all want our users to find value in our content, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/01/25/dwell-time-seo">time on site</a> is also a ranking factor for SEO. If you’re having a particularly hard time ranking a piece of content with a low time on site, PPC may be a good way of improving your metrics.</p>
<p><strong>To do this, use existing data:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Analytics and view the average amount of time spent on each page.</li>
<li>Revisit (and, if necessary, revamp) old pages and look for keywords in the content.</li>
<li>If you have enough users accessing your site, generate a list of users who viewed a page with a good time on site and with similar content.</li>
<li>Run ads on PPC to the struggling page. Use retargeting based on the successful page as your audience.</li>
<li>Consider adding the struggling page as a sitelink on your branded campaign.</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea behind this strategy is to get content in front of the right audience. If we find a list of people who have historically found your content relevant and interesting, they are more likely to spend more time across different pages.</p>
<h3>Implement Branding Strategies</h3>
<p>If you’re anything like Luigi, you may be wondering, “Why should I run paid ads targeting my own name when I should already have organic listings taking care of those searches for free?” This is a great question. It’s understandable that when someone searches you, they’re already showing a strong <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/26/intent-marketing">intent to convert</a>. So how can you effectively utilize PPC for your branding without spending all of your hard-earned coins?</p>
<p>Break out your branding goals.</p>
<p><strong>Lean on SEO for long-term branding</strong> (aspects that are not likely to change over time) and negate related search queries from PPC. Consider SEO for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your company name</li>
<li>Your mission statement</li>
<li>Founder information</li>
<li>Location</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lean on PPC for short-term branding</strong> (aspects that are likely to change over time) that shows off your company’s personality. If nothing else, run a PPC campaign to bump an additional competitor off the first page for your own name. Consider PPC for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press releases</li>
<li>Promotions</li>
<li>Awards</li>
<li>Charity work &amp; community involvement</li>
<li>Seasonal Offers</li>
</ul>
<h2>Negative Press</h2>
<p>Now, we hope you haven’t been accused of kidnapping a princess. But if you have some negative press come up (these things happen – we don’t judge), PPC can help with that! You can use paid search as your first line of defense.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s how:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Find a list of keywords your prospects may be searching to locate information on the incident, and then take note. (Is there a common question people are asking you can answer? Is there a solution you can provide?)</li>
<li>From there, write a piece of content answering those questions and providing your solutions, and run a campaign on the keywords.</li>
<li>Include sitelinks in your other ads that continue to allow transparency across your campaigns.</li>
<li>Your ads will appear before other sources, so your prospects can get the whole story from you rather than someone else.</li>
</ul>

</article>
</div>
<h2>Level 3: Keeping the Princess Safe</h2>
<p>As with everything inbound marketing-related, <strong>continued optimizations are essential to success</strong>. Rescuing listings takes a lot of time and effort, especially when dealing with the SEO side of things. It’s generally a good idea to review strategy at least once a quarter and regularly review your keywords, content, and scheduling to ensure you’re using all resources available across both SEO and PPC to better your marketing.</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations! You rescued the princess – and your listing! </strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/14/google-display-network-targeting-facts">Google Ads Display placements</a> should be as important to an advertiser as the ad creative itself.</p>
<p>Imagine this: You’re sitting at your desk, it’s a Tuesday. It’s raining slightly and you’re looking out the window thinking about all those leads you’re bringing in with your new <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/15/google-display-ad-builder">display ads</a>. The phone rings, you’re delighted. You’re ready to take on whatever questions this new prospect has.</p>
<p>But it’s not a lead. It’s your mother. She saw your new ad! She knew something was wrong and had to call you. “I was looking up Anatidaephobia on a website and your DUCK was staring right back at me! Do you know what Anatidaephobia is? It’s a fear of being watched by ducks!”</p>

<p>How did this happen? What can we do about it? How do we turn it off before someone else sees it? Why was your mother looking up Anatidaephobia!? <em>Relax</em>, we know the answers to some of these questions.</p>
<h2>What Are Google Ad Display Placements?</h2>
<p>We’re so glad you asked! Placements are the specific websites your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/06/12/biggest-benefit-google-display-ads">Google display ads</a> show up on. Though these placements will help prevent your duck from showing up on Anatidaephobia sites, there is much more power behind them than potentially scaring the pants off your mother.</p>
<p>There are two types of placements available on the display network. Here’s how they work:</p>
<h3>Automatic Placements</h3>
<p>When using automatic placements, Google will determine placements for your ads based on sites it judges to be relevant to your business.</p>
<h3>Managed Placements</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/03/display-network-click-fraud">Managed placements</a> give you a little more control: You determine placements for your ads based on prospect trends and relevancy to your business. Managed placements are available on the following campaign types:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Display Network Only” campaigns</li>
<li>“Search Network with Display Select” campaigns</li>
<li>“Video” campaigns</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Basics of Google Ad Display Placements</h2>
<p>Google’s display network spans over two million websites and captures 90% of the web, so the room for error is great, and could be costly.</p>
<p>Like optimizing keywords for search campaigns, optimizing your placements can provide an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/16/engagement-ads">increase in conversion volume</a> and a decrease in your cost per lead. Ultimately, though, placements should only be a single layer in your targeting for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/09/ad-design">your display campaigns</a>. For example, you’re going to want to keep in mind the placements you’re targeting, as well as the keyword-level targeting you’re working with.</p>
<p>As you can see in the image below (another classic from the bad ad placement archives), this company made a mistake likely by targeting the keyword “coffee” as well as a placement of a news site. This would normally be a good defined target, only the news site had just published an article about the dangers of drinking coffee.</p>

<p>When optimizing your Google Ad Display Placements, keep these other layers in mind:</p>
<h3>Display Keywords</h3>
<ul>
<li>Like search keywords, these are terms relevant to your product or services. With display advertising however, they are used for contextual targeting.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Topics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Topics are used to target sites with content that matches a certain topic you define. For example, if you choose “Home and Garden” as a topic, you can expect your ads to show on a list of home and garden sites.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Audiences</h3>
<ul>
<li>Audiences will show your ads to a specific list of people rather than on specific sites. These are defined by <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/17/remarketing-audiences">remarketing lists</a>, in-market, affinity audiences, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Demographics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Think of your target <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/09/12/demographic-targeting-for-search-campaigns">demographic</a>. Are 18-year-olds more likely to go on news sites or blogs? Are women or men more likely to view a given page on your site?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Device</h3>
<ul>
<li>Are your prospects more likely to view a site on mobile than they would desktop? Is the site mobile optimized? How does each device convert?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Determining Where to Place Your Ad Via Managed Placements</h2>
<p>Google is great at putting the right content in front of the right people. It&#8217;s literally what the search engine is designed to do.</p>
<p>That being said, no one knows your clients better than you do. Automatic placements could be costing you a pretty penny within your display campaigns if Google is targeting a site that doesn&#8217;t convert well with your clients. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/18/google-display-network-tips">determining managed placements</a> is more difficult than ever with the new Google Ads UI moving away from the display planner.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to find the best placements for your business:</p>
<h3>Look at your existing placements (if you have them).</h3>
<p>See what&#8217;s performing well in your current list. From there, think about your target audience.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do they spend their day?</li>
<li>What sites are they likely to browse while at work, on lunch, etc.?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Do some research on how different websites convert overall.</h3>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/12/05/breitbart-ad-boycott">WordStream conducted a study on Breitbart</a> and found that results from that placement were poor across the board.</p>
<h3>Check your placement’s content.</h3>
<p>When adding a placement, it&#8217;s generally a good idea to type in some top-performing keywords in the search bar of the site and see what types of articles come up.</p>
<h3>Consider the amount of traffic going to the site.</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re targeting a niche site, you&#8217;re going to get fewer impressions than one that gets a lot of visitors.</p>
<h2>Is There An App For My Business?</h2>
<p>There’s an app for everything! Unfortunately, there’s not a lot of data working in favor of advertising on them. Nearly half (47%) of all in-app clicks were found to be accidental. That’s probably because people are working with a smaller screen, and in some cases <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/06/exclude-mobile-apps-adwords">kids may be to blame</a> for this one.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when an ad pops up in an app, the “x” is often too small to comfortably close it without accidentally clicking on it. Sometimes the failure to close the ad happens multiple times. If you have children, you know as much as I do that an ad results in boogers sliding over the screen, followed by a “Mooooooom! It’s broken again!” It’s really messy, and quite frankly, hard to watch.</p>

<p>Google recently made some changes to its mobile app exclusions – <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/02/google-ads-mobile-app-exclusions">learn more about the changes in this post by Allen Finn</a>.</p>
<h2>Optimizing Your Managed Placements</h2>
<p>Now that you have a good list of managed placements, we need to move into optimizations. This is where we&#8217;ll take a look at what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not. This task should be performed often, to ensure you&#8217;re keeping up with market changes. Like keywords, placements can (and should) be excluded if they are not effective.</p>
<p>Here are some items to pay attention to:</p>
<h3>Are things converting particularly well on a specific site?</h3>
<p>If so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider a positive bid adjustment</li>
<li>Look for other sites that produce similar content and add new targets</li>
</ul>
<h3>Are things converting poorly on a specific site?</h3>
<p>If so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do a search for some of your top keywords on the site. If you see an article that is specifically calling out your brand or service negatively, exclude the specific page</li>
<li>Look at the traffic to the site; is there enough to support your campaign goals?</li>
<li>Consider a negative bid adjustment</li>
<li>Consider excluding the placement and reallocating budget</li>
</ul>
<p>Congratulations! You’ve effectively removed all instances of unwanted ducks across the web! Go reward yourself with a nice cup of coffee, and maybe consider calling your mother.</p>
