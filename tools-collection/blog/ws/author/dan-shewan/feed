<h2>What is a SWOT analysis?</h2>
<p>A SWOT analysis is a technique used to determine and define your Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats – SWOT.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wOlWjkaZp94?rel=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>SWOT analyses can be applied to an entire company or organization, or individual projects within a single department. Most commonly, SWOT analyses are used at the organizational level to determine how closely a business is aligned with its growth trajectories and success benchmarks, but they can also be used to ascertain how well a particular project – such as <a href="/blog/ws/2017/07/05/online-advertising-costs">an online advertising campaign</a> – is performing according to initial projections.</p>
<p>Whatever you choose to call them, SWOT analyses are often presented as a grid-like matrix with four distinct quadrants – one representing each individual element. This presentation offers several benefits, such as identifying which elements are internal versus external, and displaying a wide range of data in an easy-to-read, predominantly visual format, like these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/swot-analysis-templates">SWOT templates</a>.<br />

<h2>Breaking down the SWOT analysis definition</h2>
<p>We know that SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats – but what does each of these elements mean? Let’s take a look at each element individually.</p>
<h3>Strengths</h3>
<p>The first element of a SWOT analysis is Strengths.</p>
<ul>
<li>Things your company does well</li>
<li>Qualities that separate you from your competitors</li>
<li>Internal resources such as skilled, knowledgeable staff</li>
<li>Tangible assets such as intellectual property, capital, proprietary technologies, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/swot-analysis-strengths.png" alt="SWOT analysis strengths examples" width="800" height="575" /></p>
<p>As you’ve probably guessed, this element addresses things that your company or project does especially well. This could be something intangible, such as <a href="/blog/ws/2017/11/15/website-copy">your company’s brand attributes</a>, or something more easily defined such as the <a href="/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">unique selling proposition</a> of a particular product line. It could also be your people, your literal human resources: strong leadership, or a great engineering team.</p>
<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
<p>Once you’ve figured out your strengths, it’s time to turn that critical self-awareness on your weaknesses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Things your company lacks</li>
<li>Things your competitors do better than you</li>
<li>Resource limitations</li>
<li>Unclear unique selling proposition</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/swot-analysis-weaknesses.png" alt="SWOT analysis weaknesses examples" width="800" height="575" /></p>
<p>What’s holding your business or project back? This element can include organizational challenges like a shortage of skilled people and <a href="/blog/ws/2016/04/06/small-marketing-budget">financial or budgetary limitations</a>.</p>
<p>This element of a SWOT analysis may also include weaknesses in relation to other companies in your industry, such as the lack of a clearly defined USP in a crowded market.</p>
<h3>Opportunities</h3>
<p>Next up is Opportunities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Underserved markets for specific products</li>
<li>Few competitors in your area</li>
<li>Emerging needs for your products or services</li>
<li>Press/media coverage of your company</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/swot-analysis-opportunities.png" alt="SWOT analysis opportunities examples" width="800" height="575" /></p>
<p>Can’t keep up with <a href="/blog/ws/2017/03/01/lead-generation-ideas">the volume of leads being generated</a> by your marketing team? That’s an opportunity. Is your company developing an innovative new idea that will open up new markets or demographics? That’s another opportunity.</p>
<p>In short, this element of a SWOT analysis covers everything you could do to <a href="/blog/ws/2016/02/03/increase-sales-online">improve sales</a>, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/growth-academy">grow as a company</a>, or advance your organization’s mission.</p>
<h3>Threats</h3>
<p>The final element of a SWOT analysis is Threats – everything that poses a risk to either your company itself or its likelihood of success or growth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Emerging competitors</li>
<li>Changing regulatory environment</li>
<li>Negative press/media coverage</li>
<li>Changing customer attitudes toward your company</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/swot-analysis-threats.png" alt="SWOT analysis threats examples" width="800" height="575" /></p>
<p>This could include things like emerging competitors, changes in regulatory law, financial risks, and virtually everything else that could potentially jeopardize the future of your company or project.</p>

<h2>SWOT analysis internal and external factors</h2>
<p>The four elements above are common to all SWOT analyses. However, many companies further compartmentalize these elements into two distinct subgroups: Internal and External.</p>
<h3>Internal factors</h3>
<p>Typically, Strengths and Weaknesses are considered internal factors, in that they are the result of organizational decisions under the control of your company or team. A <a href="/blog/ws/2014/05/12/customer-churn">high churn rate</a>, for example, would be categorized as a weakness, but improving a high churn rate is still within your control, making it an internal factor.</p>
<h3>External factors</h3>
<p>Similarly, emerging competitors would be categorized as a threat in a SWOT analysis, but since there’s very little you can do about this, this makes it an external factor. This is why you may have seen SWOT analyses referred to as Internal-External Analyses or IE matrices.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/swot-analysis-internal-external.jpg" alt="SWOT analysis internal external examples" width="602" height="255" /></div>

<p>Subcategorizing your four primary elements into Internal and External factors isn’t necessarily critical to the success of your SWOT analysis, but it can be helpful in determining your next move or evaluating the degree of control you have over a given problem or opportunity.</p>
<p>Now that we know what each of the elements of a SWOT analysis means, let’s take a look at how to go about creating and conducting a SWOT analysis.<br />
<a id="how_to_do_swot_analysis"></a></p>
<h2>How to do a SWOT analysis</h2>
<p>You can get the full experience in our video below, and this entire post is dedicated to answering that question, but for simplicity&#8217;s sake, here&#8217;s how to do a SWOT analysis:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gather your team together—ideally bring candy.</li>
<li>Set up your quadrants—on a whiteboard or projector (perhaps using our template).</li>
<li>Start with strengths—ask the below list of questions.</li>
<li>Follow suit with weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.</li>
<li>Organize the information collected into a neat and tidy document.</li>
<li>Send out to the team with notes.</li>
<li>Organize a second meeting to come up with action items and owners.</li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ets_5qSAo4?rel=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>

<p><a id="swot_analysis_questions"></a></p>
<h2>SWOT analysis questions</h2>
<p>Like <a href="/blog/ws/2017/02/21/features-vs-benefits">feature-benefit matrices</a>, there are several ways to conduct a SWOT analysis. However, regardless of how you choose to structure your analysis, we need to start by asking a series of questions. Here is a breakdown of the questions you should seek to answer when performing your SWOT analysis.</p>
<h3>Strengths questions</h3>
<p>Let’s take our first element, Strengths, for example. To determine what your strengths are as an organization, you could begin by asking some of the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What do your customers love about your company or product(s)?</li>
<li>What does your company do better than other companies in your industry?</li>
<li>What are your most positive brand attributes?</li>
<li>What’s your unique selling proposition?</li>
<li>What resources do you have at your disposal that your competitors do not?</li>
</ol>
<p>By answering these questions, you’ll be in great shape to start identifying and listing your organization’s strengths.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/swot-analysis-wordstream-brand-attributes.jpg" alt="SWOT analysis WordStream brand attributes examples" width="502" height="441" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Positive brand attributes associated with WordStream, as identified by our customers</em></p>
<h3>Weakness questions</h3>
<p>We can use the same principle to determine your company’s weaknesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do your customers dislike about your company or product(s)?</li>
<li>What problems or complaints are often mentioned in your negative reviews?</li>
<li>Why do your customers cancel or churn?</li>
<li>What could your company do better?</li>
<li>What are your most negative brand attributes?</li>
<li>What are the biggest obstacles/challenges in your current sales funnel?</li>
<li>What resources do your competitors have that you do not?</li>
</ul>
<p>You may find that determining the strengths and weaknesses of your organization or project is considerably easier or takes less time than figuring out the opportunities and threats facing your company. This is because, as we said earlier, these are internal factors. External factors, on the other hand, may require more effort and rely upon more data, as these are often beyond your immediate sphere of influence.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/swot-analysis-internal-external-factors-diagram.jpg" alt="SWOT analysis internal external factor relationship diagram" width="500" height="530" /></div>
<h3>Opportunities questions</h3>
<p>Identifying opportunities and threats may require you to conduct in-depth <a href="/blog/ws/2017/11/09/competitor-keywords">competitive intelligence research</a> about what your competitors are up to, or the examination of wider economic or business trends that could have an impact on your company. That’s not to say that opportunities and threats cannot be internal, however; you may discover opportunities and threats based solely on the strengths and weaknesses of your company. Some possible questions you could ask to identify potential opportunities might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can we improve our sales/customer onboarding/customer support processes?</li>
<li>What kind of messaging resonates with our customers?</li>
<li>How can we further engage our most vocal brand advocates?</li>
<li>Are we allocating departmental resources effectively?</li>
<li>Is there budget, tools, or other resources that we’re not leveraging to full capacity?</li>
<li>Which advertising channels exceeded our expectations – and why?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Threat questions</h3>
<p>When it comes to threats, you could certainly begin by asking a series of questions like those above. However, it’s often quite easy to come up with a list of potential threats facing your business or project without posing questions beforehand. This could include “branded” threats such as emerging or established competitors, broader threats such as changing regulatory environments and market volatility, or even internal threats such as high staff turnover that could threaten or derail current growth.<br />
<a id="pest_analysis"></a></p>
<h2>What is PEST analysis?</h2>
<p>While we’re on the topic of internal versus external factors, I wanted to mention a tangential but entirely separate type of analysis closely relevant to SWOT analyses, known as a PEST analysis.</p>
<p>Earlier, I mentioned that external factors such as changing regulatory policies and market volatility could be considered threats in a standard SWOT analysis. However, despite their importance, challenges like this are often highly nuanced and driven by dozens or hundreds of individual factors. This can place them beyond the scope or intent of a typical SWOT analysis. This is why many companies also conduct PEST analyses.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/swot-analysis-pest-analysis-example.jpg" alt="SWOT analysis PEST analysis examples" width="700" height="457" /></div>
<p>This type of analysis is not what an exterminator does upon arriving at a roach-infested tenement. Rather, a PEST analysis functions very similarly to a SWOT analysis, only they’re concerned with four external factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Political</li>
<li>Economic</li>
<li>Sociocultural</li>
<li>Technological</li>
</ol>
<h3>Pros of PEST analysis</h3>
<p>One of the main reasons it’s worth looking at PEST analyses is because many of the factors that could end up in a PEST matrix could also be relevant to the Opportunities and Threats in our SWOT analysis. The kind of political and economic turmoil we’ve seen in the United States during the past year, for example, could very well pose legitimate and serious threats to many businesses (as well as some opportunities), but these kinds of obstacles tend to be much more complicated than the opportunities and threats you’d see in most SWOT analyses, given their broader scale and often-complex underlying factors.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/swot-analysis-stages-of-economic-bubbles.jpg" alt="SWOT analysis stages of economic bubbles " width="700" height="447" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>Image via </em><a href="https://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch7en/conc7en/stages_in_a_bubble.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Dr. Jean-Paul Rodrigue/Hofstra University</em></a></p>
<h3>Cons of PEST analysis</h3>
<p>Obstacles identified in a typical PEST analysis also tend to be on much longer timeframes – it’s a lot easier and quicker to try and overcome internal challenges like high staff turnover than it is to wait and see if the economy picks up (or if the bubble will burst again). That’s why many larger companies conduct both SWOT and PEST analyses simultaneously – the SWOT analysis provides them with more immediate, potentially actionable roadmaps, whereas PEST analyses can be highly valuable when it comes to formulating longer-term plans and business strategies.<br />
<a id="swot_analysis_small_business"></a></p>
<h2>Benefits of SWOT analysis for small businesses</h2>
<p>If you’re a marketer or small-business owner, you might be wondering if SWOT analyses are practical or even feasible for smaller companies and organizations. Although there is definitely a resource overhead involved in the creation of a SWOT analysis, there are many benefits in doing so, even for the smallest of companies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get a bird&#8217;s eye view:</strong> For one, conducting a comprehensive SWOT analysis provides a unique opportunity to gain greater insight into how your business operates. It’s all too easy to get lost in the weeds of the day-to-day workings of your company, and conducting a SWOT analysis allows you to take a broader, bird’s eye view of your business and the position it occupies in your industry.</li>
<li><strong>Improve specific campaigns and projects.</strong> Another benefit of SWOT analyses is that this technique can be applied to a wide range of scenarios, not just as an overview of your business. You could use SWOT analyses to evaluate the potential strengths and weaknesses of a forthcoming advertising campaign, a planned content project, or even whether your company should be represented at a trade show or industry event.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of a project SWOT analysis:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/project-swot-analysis-example.jpeg" alt="project SWOT analysis example" width="720" height="540" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56801" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/project-swot-analysis-example.jpeg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/project-swot-analysis-example-480x360.jpeg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://toggl.com/blog/the-benefits-of-swot-analysis-in-project-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Develop tangible roadmaps.</strong> Obviously, it almost goes without saying that conducting a SWOT analysis allows you to identify what your company does well, where it could improve, and the opportunities and threats facing your business. However, conducting a SWOT analysis provides you with the opportunity to not only identify these factors, but also develop and implement tangible roadmaps and timelines for potential solutions. This can be beneficial in the creation of budgetary plans, identifying hiring needs and other mid- to long-term strategic planning.</li>
</ul>
<p><a id="swot_analysis_example"></a></p>
<h2>A full SWOT analysis example</h2>
<p>So, now we know what each element of a SWOT analysis is concerned with and the kinds of exploratory questions we can ask to get the ball rolling, it’s time to actually get to work and create your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/swot-analysis-examples">SWOT analysis example</a>.</p>
<p>To illustrate how it works, we’ll create our own SWOT analysis example: a family-owned restaurant, with a single location, operating in an urban area.</p>
<p>Here’s the SWOT analysis example based on our fictional restaurant:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/swot-analysis-example-matrix.png" alt="SWOT analysis example matrix" width="650" height="569" /></div>
<p>As you can see, this matrix format allows you to quickly and easily identify the various elements you’ve included in your analysis.</p>
<h3>Strengths examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>Excellent, well-trafficked location</li>
<li>Good reputation in local community</li>
<li>Seasonal menu, locally sourced.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Weakness examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>Higher costs than comparable chain restaurants</li>
<li>Single location means limited reach</li>
<li>Modest advertising budget</li>
<li>Not currently using food delivery apps/technology</li>
</ul>
<h3>Opportunity examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>Growing interest in/support for locally sourced ingredients</li>
<li>Seasonal menu keeps things fresh and interesting</li>
<li>Potential growth via food delivery apps/technology</li>
</ul>
<h3>Threat examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>Intensifying competition from established chain restaurants</li>
<li>Uncertain economic environment</li>
<li>Rising cost of ingredients</li>
</ul>
<p><a id="swot_analysis_action"></a></p>
<h2>SWOT analysis example: Acting on your results</h2>
<p>So, you’ve finally got your hands on a completed SWOT matrix. You’ve identified internal strengths and weaknesses, as well as external opportunities and threats. You’ve begun to see your company in a whole new light.</p>
<p>Now what?</p>
<p>Ideally, there are two stages of action you should take upon completing a SWOT analysis. First, you should attempt to <strong>match your strengths with your opportunities</strong>. Next, you should try to <strong>convert weaknesses into strengths</strong>. Let’s take a look how this works.</p>
<h3>1. Harness your strengths</h3>
<p>One of the best things about the strengths you identified in your SWOT analysis is that you’re already doing them.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/swot-analysis-diagram-strengths.png" alt="SWOT analysis example strengths" width="650" height="569" /></div>
<p>In our example above, the restaurant’s location, reputation, and seasonal menu are all strengths. This tells the fictitious company that it should continue to experiment with its popular seasonal menu. It also tells the company it should continue to develop and nurture the strong relationships with its regular customers that have strengthened the restaurant’s reputation in the community.</p>
<p>Essentially, acting upon your business’ strengths consists of “do more of what you’re already good at.”</p>
<h3>2. Shore up your weaknesses</h3>
<p>Acting on the weaknesses you identified in your SWOT analysis is a little trickier, not least because you have to be honest enough with yourself about your weaknesses in the first place.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/swot-analysis-diagram-weaknesses.png" alt="SWOT analysis diagram weaknesses" width="650" height="569" /></div>
<p>Going back to our example, some of these weaknesses are very challenging to act upon. Going up against the considerable purchasing power of rival chain restaurants can be very difficult for smaller, family owned businesses. The restaurant is also struggling with its limited reach, the restrictions of a modest advertising budget, and is also failing to leverage the potential to increase sales by allowing customers to order food online through delivery apps like Foodler or GrubHub.</p>
<p>However, that’s not to say all hope is lost. It might be harder for our example business to compete with a chain, but there are plenty of other ways small companies can be more competitive – such as by developing strong, meaningful relationships with customers, which was not only one of the company’s strengths, but also something chain restaurants simply cannot offer.</p>
<h3>3. Seize opportunities</h3>
<p>The Opportunities section of your SWOT analysis is by far the most actionable, and that’s by design. By identifying opportunities by evaluating your organization’s strengths, you should have a ready-made list of targets to aim for.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/swot-analysis-diagram-opportunities.png" alt="SWOT analysis diagram opportunities" width="650" height="569" /></div>
<p>In the example above, increasing consumer appetites for ethically produced, locally grown ingredients is a major opportunity. However, our restaurateurs cannot rest on their laurels – there’s still work to be done. In this example, this may involve investing in technical expertise to take advantage of the opportunities presented by food delivery apps, or sourcing locally grown produce more aggressively in an attempt to reduce costs.</p>
<p>It’s also important to avoid hubris or complacency in your opportunities. Even if you have an iron-clad advantage over every other business in your industry, failing to devote sufficient time, money, or personnel resources in maintaining that advantage may result in you missing out on these opportunities over time.</p>
<p>Every business’ opportunities will differ, but it’s vital that you create a clearly defined roadmap for capitalizing upon the opportunities you’ve identified, whether they be internal or external.</p>
<h3>4. Mitigate threats</h3>
<p>Anticipating and mitigating the threats identified in your SWOT analysis may be the most difficult challenge you’ll face in this scenario, primarily because threats are typically external factors; there’s only so much you can do to mitigate the potential damage of factors beyond your control.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/swot-analysis-diagram-threats.png" alt="SWOT analysis diagram threats" width="650" height="569" /></div>
<p>Every threat, and the appropriate reaction to that threat, is different. Regardless of the specific threats you’ve identified in your SWOT analysis, responding to and monitoring those threats should be among your very top priorities, irrespective of the degree of control you have over those threats.</p>
<p>In the example above, all three threats are particularly challenging. To compete with the prices of its chain competitors, our restaurateurs may be forced to either compromise on their values to secure cheaper ingredients, or willingly cut into their profit margins to remain competitive. Similarly, economic uncertainty is virtually impossible to fully mitigate, making it a persistent threat to the stability of our example restaurant business.</p>
<p>In some SWOT analyses, there may be some overlap between your opportunities and threats. For example, in the <a href="/blog/ws/2021/03/16/marketing-competitive-analysis">analysis</a> above, the popularity of locally sourced ingredients was identified as an opportunity, and heightened competition was identified as a threat. In this example, highlighting the restaurant’s relationships with local farmers – further reinforcing the restaurant’s commitment to the local community and regional economy – may be an effective way for our restaurateurs to overcome the threat posed by the increasingly desperate chain restaurants vying for their customers.</p>
<p>When compiling the results of your SWOT analysis, be sure to look for areas of crossover like this and see if it’s possible to seize an opportunity and reduce a threat at the same time.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever found yourself telling someone about some good news you got, only for the other person to completely ignore what you said and start talking about themselves?</p>
<p>That’s a little what ambush marketing is like.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ambush-marketing-sign-joc.gif" alt="Ambush marketing" width="640" height="552" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image via <a href="https://www.joc.or.jp/english/aboutjoc/marketing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Japanese Olympic Committee</a></em></p>
<p>Today we’ll be taking a look at ambush marketing – specifically, what it is, what it looks like, and why brands spend countless millions of dollars on glorified pissing contests.</p>
<p>We’ll be examining the advantages and disadvantages of ambush marketing, including some real-world examples of how ambush marketing has been utilized to great effect by some of the world’s best-known brands.</p>
<p>First up, a primer on the basics.</p>
<h2>What Is Ambush Marketing?</h2>
<p>Ambush marketing – also known as coat-tail marketing or predatory ambushing – is the practice of hijacking or coopting another advertiser’s campaign to raise awareness of another company or brand, often in the context of event sponsorships.</p>
<p>One of the earliest known examples of ambush marketing is <a href="https://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/02/07/VISA-American-Express-battle-with-Olympic-ads/8877697438800/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the bitter feud that erupted between MasterCard and Visa</a> during the 1992 Winter Olympics, which was held in the town of Albertville in southeastern France.</p>
<p>Having paid $20 million (approximately $35.5 million in 2018 dollars) for the privilege, Visa was the official credit card sponsor of the ’92 Winter Games. For months prior to games, Visa ran TV commercials advising American Express cardholders to leave their AmEx at home as “the Olympics don’t take American Express.”</p>
<div>
<div class="video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video"><iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pdn6WdnjXjA?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
</div>
<p>Technically, this was true – tickets to the games could only be purchased with Visa credit cards. However, Visa’s aggressive ad campaign soon raised the ire of American Express, which claimed Visa’s ads were purposefully misleading by suggesting that American Express cards were not accepted <em>anywhere</em> at the ’92 Winter Games.</p>
<p>AmEx soon launched its own series of TV spots, which featured the slogan, “When you go to Spain, you’ll need a passport – but you don’t need a Visa,” a sly reference to the forthcoming Summer Games in Barcelona and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/ambush-at-barcelona-rivals-are-piggybacking-official-sponsors-of-the-olympic-games-write-nick-1534185.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a subtle dig at the company’s rival</a>. American Express was accused by Visa of engaging in “parasite marketing,” which later gave rise to the slightly more palatable name of ambush marketing.</p>
<h2>4 Real-World Ambush Marketing Examples</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve looked at what ambush marketing is, it’s time to see some examples of this technique in action, from the inspired to the irreverent.</p>
<h3>#1: BMW vs. Audi</h3>
<p>Santa Monica, California, may be famous for its lengthy pier and near-perfect weather, but this affluent coastal city was also the battlefield upon which two of the world’s largest car manufacturers waged a war for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/26/out-of-home-advertising">billboard</a> dominance.</p>
<p>The spat began soon after BMW hosted a rally in Wisconsin, an event that was publicized through an accompanying campaign. The slogan of the campaign was “A BMW rally with two nearby service centers. What’s next, paramedics at a chess tournament?”</p>
<p>Crappy, nonsensical slogans aside, Audi saw an opportunity to capitalize upon BMW’s campaign. In response to BMW’s ads, Audi purchased a billboard in Santa Monica advertising its new A4 sedan and mocking BMW’s slogan:</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ambush-marketing-audi-chess-billboard.jpg" alt="Ambush marketing Audi vs. BMW billboard war Santa Monica" width="800" height="489" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image via </em><a href="https://jalopnik.com/5213704/bmw-vs-audi-jalopnik-readers-turn-billboard-cold-war-hot" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Jalopnik</em></a></p>
<p>Not long after the billboard above appeared in Santa Monica, Audi doubled down and erected another giant roadside provocation to BMW, while cleverly sticking to BMW’s regrettable chess theme:</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ambush-marketing-audi-your-move-billboard.jpg" alt="Ambush marketing Audi vs. BMW billboard Your Move, BMW" width="529" height="323" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image via </em><a href="http://www.thebrandingjournal.com/2015/01/benefit-billboard-brand-rivalry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Branding Journal</em></a></p>
<p>BMW didn’t take this attack lying down. In response, BMW purchased an enormous billboard across the street from Audi’s billboard:</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ambush-marketing-bmw-checkmate-billboard.jpg" alt="Ambush marketing Audi vs. BMW billboard war Checkmate " width="800" height="475" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image via Jalopnik</em></p>
<p>By now, you’d think that two of the world’s largest vehicle manufacturers would have tired of their childish tit-for-tat.</p>
<p>They hadn’t.</p>
<p>After BMW erected its “Checkmate” billboard response, Audi upped its game again by launching yet another billboard ad with yet another witty chess-related quip. Ultimately, BMW won the day with its final, withering response:</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ambush-marketing-bmw-game-over-zeppelin.jpg" alt="Ambush marketing Audi vs. BMW billboard war blimp game over" width="1280" height="720" /></div>
<p>Oh, and to really twist the knife, BMW actually tethered the blimp to Audi’s R8 billboard.</p>
<p><em>Savage</em>.</p>
<h3>#2: Paddy Power</h3>
<p>Unlike our friends in the States, many of whom seem to have an irrational, almost phobic aversion to a friendly wager, my countrymen in Britain love a good bet. Walk down any high street in the U.K. and you’ll most likely see at least one or two bookmakers, among the best-known of which is Irish gambling chain Paddy Power.</p>
<p>Like so many of the most notorious ambush marketing campaigns, Paddy Power’s first foray into the exciting world of predatory ambushing took place during the Olympic Games – the London 2012 Games, to be precise.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ambush-marketing-paddy-power-london-2012-billboard.jpg" alt="Ambush marketing Paddy Power London 2012 billboard campaign" width="642" height="507" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image via </em><a href="http://adage.com/article/creativity-news/paddy-power-resists-olympic-ambush-ads-u-k/236305/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>AdAge</em></a></p>
<p>As the British capital geared up for the Games, Paddy Power launched a wide-scale billboard campaign across the city, claiming it was the “Official sponsor of the largest athletics event in London this year.” Below the bookmaker’s bold claim was a disclaimer that revealed Paddy Power was referring to the town of London, France –the event the ad referred to was not the Olympic Games, but rather a traditional egg-and-spoon race that Paddy Power really did sponsor.</p>
<p>The IOC took a predictably dim view of Paddy Power’s tongue-in-cheek campaign, and demanded the Irish bookie take down the ads immediately. Paddy Power challenged the IOC’s order in court, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jul/25/london-2012-paddy-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ultimately won its fight against the IOC</a> in a landmark ruling.</p>
<h3>#3: Samsung vs. Apple</h3>
<p>In October of 2011, Apple was preparing to launch the then-latest iteration of its flagship mobile device, the iPhone 4S.</p>
<p>The device launch was expected to be one of the most hotly anticipated tech events of the year – so Samsung decided to crash Apple’s party by erecting a pop-up store just a few feet away from Apple’s prestigious storefront in Sydney, Australia.</p>
<p>While eager Apple acolytes (<em>Appolytes?</em>) waited patiently to get their hands on the new iPhone, Samsung proceeded to sell its Galaxy SII device for just $2 AUS – mere pocket change compared to Apple’s $850 iPhone.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ambush-marketing-samsung-vs-apple.jpg" alt="Ambush marketing Samsung vs. Apple Sydney pop-up store iPhone 4S launch" width="779" height="439" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>LOL. Image via </em><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/technology/samsung-ambushes-apples-iphone-4s-launch-in-sydney-20111012-1lk0d.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Sydney Morning Herald</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Plenty of people managed to resist Samsung’s tempting offer, but many more still chose to walk away with a brand-new Samsung device rather than wait in line for the iPhone 4S.</p>
<p>Although Samsung took an enormous financial hit with its iPhone launch event stunt (which we’ll break down shortly), the incident proved just how easy it can be to ride the coat-tails of one of the world’s biggest brands.</p>

<h3>#4: Rona and the iPods</h3>
<p>When you’re one of the wealthiest companies in the history of mankind, you can’t help but attract attention. Case in point, another classic ambush marketing example of a company leveraging Apple’s advertising to its own ends.</p>
<p>Back in 2010, Apple’s colorful iPod Nano was among the most popular MP3 players on the market (just typing this makes me feel ancient). To advertise its iPod Nano line, Apple erected a billboard ad next to the Jacques Cartier Bridge in Montreal displaying the vividly colorful MP3 players in a satisfying rainbow-ribbon arrangement.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ambush-marketing-rona-paint-apple-ipod.jpg" alt="Ambush marketing Rona paint Apple iPod billboard" width="800" height="439" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image via </em><a href="https://www.coloribus.com/adsarchive/ambient/leftover-paint-collection-program-rona-chromatic-13277405/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Coloribus</em></a></p>
<p>Sensing an opportunity, Canadian paint and hardware firm Rona seized its chance. Rona soon erected its own billboard ad directly beneath Apple’s iPod ad to advertise the company’s new paint recycling program. The ad, which bore the slogan “Nous récupérons les restes de peinture,” or “We collect leftover paint,” was brilliantly simple, and the ad remains one of the best and most creative examples of ambush marketing in recent memory.</p>
<h2>Why Use Ambush Marketing?</h2>
<p>Now that we know what ambush marketing is, let’s take a look at some of the advantages of this type of advertising campaign.</p>
<h3>Ambush Marketing Campaigns Can Be Very Clever</h3>
<p>Something I personally love about ambush marketing campaigns is how cheeky they can be and the <a href="/blog/ws/2016/06/06/local-marketing-ideas">creative flexibility</a> these campaigns offer.</p>
<p>Since most ambush marketing campaigns directly respond to or otherwise leverage an existing campaign by a close competitor, ambush campaigns can – and often, have to – be extremely creative. This includes everything from visual trickery to witty wordplay. As a result, ambush marketing campaigns are often a lot more memorable than a typical ad precisely because they’re unusually entertaining or clever.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ambush-marketing-newcastle-brown-ale-vs-stella-artois.jpg" alt="Ambush marketing Newcastle Brown Ale chalice campaign" width="320" height="480" /></div>
<p>Subtle references and sly jokes are often integral to the success of ambush marketing campaigns. As we saw in the Audi vs. BMW example above, ambush campaigns often respond directly to one another, which can turn visual humor into a vital competitive edge.</p>
<p>Even if one ad is “better” than another, the funnier or cleverer ad <a href="/blog/ws/2013/10/08/funny-ads">will often be much more memorable</a>, as Newcastle Brown Ale proved in the example ambush campaign above.</p>
<h3>Ambush Marketing Campaigns Can Go Off-Script</h3>
<p>When it comes to display advertising – online or IRL – cohesion is crucial. From enormous, towering billboards in Times Square to a mobile sidebar ad, brands have to ensure that their campaigns <a href="/blog/ws/2013/10/15/multi-channel-marketing">look, feel, and sound the same across all platforms</a>.</p>
<p>Ambush campaigns, however, can get a little more creative.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ambush-marketing-fiat-volkswagen-google-maps.jpg" alt="Ambush marketing Fiat photobombs Volkswagen Swedish headquarters Google Maps" width="603" height="398" /></div>
<p>One of the key advantages of ambush marketing is that it allows brands to go off-script from their regular advertising campaigns, whether in <a href="/blog/ws/2014/07/31/brand-voice">style, tone, or content</a>. Brands can and frequently do employ techniques that may be beyond the scope of a company’s established brand or advertising guidelines, affording the ambusher a great deal more creative freedom and flexibility.</p>
<p>Italian car manufacturer Fiat leveraged this principle to great effect in an impromptu ambush campaign back in 2013 when Fiat somehow managed to park a red Fiat 500 hatchback car on the front steps of Volkswagen’s Swedish headquarters – just in time for a Google Maps car to pass, which preserved Fiat’s little stunt for years in Google Maps results. (The offending little red Fiat is no longer immortalized in Maps results, as Google refreshed the old image with a newer image that was taken in June of 2017).</p>
<h3>Ambush Marketing Can Change Consumer Perceptions</h3>
<p>Another benefit of ambush marketing is that, done well, it can actually help brands cultivate and exhibit new <a href="/blog/ws/2017/11/15/website-copy">brand attributes and values</a> that consumers may not necessarily already associate with that advertiser.</p>
<p>Take South African airline Kulula, for example. To coincide with the 2010 World Cup, Kulula launched an ad campaign branding itself as the “Unofficial National Carrier of the You-Know-What,” a not-so-subtle reference to the forthcoming soccer tournament. The World Cup’s governing body, FIFA, demanded that Kulula cease the campaign immediately, claiming that the airline sought “to gain a promotional benefit for the Kulula brand by creating an unauthorized association with the 2010 FIFA World Cup.”</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ambush-marketing-sepp-blatter-boston-terrier.jpg" alt="Ambush marketing Sepp Blatter Boston Terrier" width="575" height="384" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Sepp Blatter, the real MVP</em></p>
<p>Though unhappy with FIFA’s decision, Kulula reluctantly complied with FIFA’s order. However, the airline wasn’t done quite yet. Shortly after the ads were pulled, Kulula said it would fly anyone named Sepp Blatter – the name of FIFA’s then-president – for free. Eventually, the airline located <a href="https://twitter.com/seppthedog">a Boston Terrier</a> that shared a name with FIFA’s former president, and made the improbably named pup an unofficial mascot.</p>
<p>This campaign serves as a great example of how ambush marketing can help brands cultivate new brand values. Air travel is an insanely competitive industry, but Kulula’s ambush campaign not only gained the airline some invaluable publicity, but also advanced the idea that Kulula isn’t just another dry, boring airline.</p>
<h2>What Are the Disadvantages of Ambush Marketing?</h2>
<p>So, we’ve looked at how and when ambush marketing can work well, but this approach is not without its downsides.</p>
<h3>Ambush Marketing Can Be Very Expensive</h3>
<p>The main drawback of ambush marketing is that it has the potential to be very expensive.</p>
<p>Take the very public spat between Audi and BWM in Santa Monica above, for example. For the sake of argument, let’s assume that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/08/business/the-media-business-rarefied-billboard-air-of-the-sunset-strip.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a billboard in Santa Monica costs $10,000 per month</a> (not including actual design or printing costs). The fight between Audi and BMW lasted for several months and resulted in four separate billboard ads running simultaneously in the same geographic location, which almost definitely drove costs up even further. Then BMW went and put a zeppelin above all four billboards, which can cost anywhere between $500,000 and $5 million. So far, we’re talking almost $100,000 on the billboards alone, plus the cost of BMW’s blimp, plus all design and production costs.</p>
<p>Not exactly small change.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ambush-marketing-hindenburg-disaster.jpg" alt="Ambush marketing Hindenburg disaster" width="657" height="524" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>The Hindenburg, also known as “your advertising budget”</em></p>
<p>Ambush marketing might seem like a great way to piggy-back on another brand’s efforts – and it can be – but it also demands a certain level of spend that puts this approach beyond the reach of smaller companies or newer, less established brands. That’s why ambush campaigns tend to be launched by well-funded brands at major international events like the Olympics or the Super Bowl – it’s so expensive, the return has to be worthwhile.</p>
<h3>Calculating the ROI of Ambush Marketing Is Very Difficult</h3>
<p>Another problem with ambush marketing campaigns is that <a href="/blog/ws/2016/10/21/calculate-roi-offline-transactions">calculating the ROI</a> of such a campaign can be very difficult, if not actually impossible.</p>
<p>Take our Samsung hijacking example from earlier. In terms of the upfront overhead costs, Samsung’s little stunt in Sydney wasn’t that expensive. There was the cost of refurbishing the pop-up store itself and the wages of the Samsung employees who manned the store during the event.</p>
<p>The <em>real</em> cost of this ambush marketing campaign was the massive hit that Samsung took on each individual Galaxy SII device sold during the event.</p>
<p>Time for some napkin math!</p>
<p>First, we need to establish the base cost of a Galaxy SII device. For the sake of example, let’s say that a Samsung Galaxy SII cost $499, which is what the device retailed for at launch in many regions.</p>
<p>Next, we need to determine how many Galaxy SII devices Samsung sold during its ambush marketing event. For our purposes, we’ll say that the Samsung pop-up store sold 750 Galaxy SII devices that day.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ambush-marketing-samsung-pop-up-store-sydney.jpeg" alt="Ambush marketing Samsung vs. Apple Sydney pop-up store iPhone 4S launch" width="420" height="280" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Fans wait outside Samsung’s pop-up store in Sydney in 2011. Image via</em><br />
<a href="https://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/10/12/samsung-plays-dirty-ambushes-apples-iphone-4s-launch-in-sydney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Next Web</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Finally, we need to figure out how much it cost Samsung to put on its event in Sydney. Let’s say Samsung hired two people to staff the pop-up store, paid each of them $15 per hour (ha!), and asked them to work for eight hours each. This means our staffing costs would be $240. Now let’s say that it cost Samsung $10,000 to actually refurbish the store. Using these figures, we can say that Samsung’s ambush marketing event cost $10,240.</p>
<p>If this were a typical ad campaign, we might use the following formula to come up with some numbers:</p>
<p><strong>Value of a Galaxy SII</strong> <em>multiplied by</em> <strong>Number of devices sold</strong> <em>minus</em> <strong>Event overhead costs</strong></p>
<p>Since we know that a Galaxy SII costs $499, that Samsung sold 750 devices during the event, and spent $10,240 to actually put on the event itself, the formula above would look like this:</p>
<p>499 x 750 – 10,240 = 364,010</p>
<p>So, using the monkey math above, we could say that Samsung’s ambush marketing campaign generated $364,010 in revenue – not bad for a pop-up store!</p>
<p>But wait a minute – wasn’t Samsung was selling its Galaxy SII devices for just $2? Now our math looks a lot less attractive:</p>
<p>2 x 750 – 10,240 = -8,740</p>
<p>Going by the actual numbers, <strong>Samsung actually lost almost $9,000 in revenue</strong> because it was selling its Galaxy SII devices for just two bucks..</p>
<p><em>This</em> is how much it really cost Samsung to put on its event in Sydney.</p>
<p>For our purposes, we’re not actually interested in that figure. For a global brand like Samsung, $364,000 is couch change. What we want to know is whether the ambush marketing campaign was worth $364,000 – and this is where it gets complicated.</p>
<p>You can’t assign numerical values to intangible factors such as <a href="/blog/ws/2017/03/06/brand-advertising-for-conversions">brand awareness</a> or positive consumer sentiment, which makes it very difficult to effectively gauge the ROI of an ambush marketing campaign. It’s easier to gauge the overall reception of an ambush campaign by monitoring mainstream and social media for <a href="/blog/ws/2013/04/25/social-media-roi">mentions, links, and other engagement metrics</a>, but when you get down to brass tacks, proving the financial ROI of an ambush marketing campaign can be <em>very</em> difficult.</p>
<h3>Time and Space Are Factors in Ambush Marketing</h3>
<p>Another problem with ambush marketing campaigns is that in addition to the potential costs involved, these campaigns often require a relatively quick response or coordinated planning (or both) if they’re to work effectively or successfully leverage the target campaign to achieve its goal. To complicate matters further, the availability and price of advertising inventory can make or break an ambush marketing campaign before it even gets off the ground.</p>
<p>Take Newcastle Brown Ale’s “chalice” campaign above, for example. Although these ads were quite memorable, their effectiveness relied solely upon the neighboring Stella Artois ads they mocked; by themselves, Newcastle Brown Ale’s ads would only be memorable because they wouldn’t make any sense (and for potentially confusing American passersby with their use of the word “bollocks”).</p>
<p>This means that time and space are crucial factors in many ambush marketing campaigns. Unless you can be sure that the target of your ambush campaign will be there for a while – such as a sports stadium with a corporate sponsor or something similarly semi-permanent – you need to move quickly.</p>
<h2>It’s a Trap!</h2>
<p>Ambush marketing isn’t a viable marketing strategy for most businesses. The costs involved can be prohibitively expensive to all but the wealthiest of brands, but the underlying strategies beneath ambush marketing as a concept can be easily applied to your campaigns, from PPC campaigns on the search network to primarily visual campaigns on Facebook.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this post has given you some creative inspiration for new approaches you can take to your existing ads. Next time you sit down to write or optimize your next campaign, consider what you could learn from the examples above. You might not get to rub a competitor’s face in it with a gigantic billboard in Times Square, but you <em>might</em> be able to poke a sly dig at your competitors in your next Facebook campaign.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ask any content marketer what their greatest fear is, and they’ll probably say something stupid and obvious like heights or spiders or clowns (or some kind of unholy, nightmarish spider-clown slowly descending the Burj Khalifa).</p>
<p>What we <em>should</em> be scared of is running out of stuff to write about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/find-things-to-write-about-header.jpg" alt="Find things to write about, writers block concept, struggling to think of ideas" width="800" height="400" /></div>
<p>Jokes aside, coming up with ideas for new content topics can be an absolute <em>bastard</em>. Many content marketers rightfully dread the content ideation process, especially those of us who write for well-established blogs with frequent publication schedules in competitive verticals. Running out of ideas is Not An Option, so what do we do?</p>
<p>In this post, I’m going to show you.</p>
<p>We’ll be examining five ways to find things to write about, whether you’re <a href="/blog/ws/2016/12/01/b2b-content-marketing">writing for a major B2B blog</a> or <a href="/blog/ws/2016/07/14/medium-publishing">your personal Medium page</a>. We’ll look at the pros and cons of each approach including common pitfalls to avoid, before diving into some general tips to help you develop new content ideas quickly and (relatively) painlessly.</p>
<h2>1. Find Things to Write About Using Competitive Intelligence Tools</h2>
<p>Since we’re always telling you to rely on hard data rather than assumptions, we’re going to look at coming up with content ideas using <a href="/blog/ws/2017/11/09/competitor-keywords">competitive intelligence tools</a> first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/find-things-to-write-about-keyword-research-tools.png" alt="Find things to write about competitive intelligence keyword research tools concept illustration" width="510" height="339" /></div>
<p>Competitive intelligence tools can be invaluable during the content iteration process because they can help us quantify why some content ideas are better than others – specifically, which topics are being shared and discussed most.</p>
<p>I don’t want to get bogged down in a platform-specific tutorial, but for the sake of example, we’re going to use BuzzSumo, but I’ll keep the concepts as platform-agnostic as I can.</p>
<p>First, we need to specify what keyword or vertical we’re interested in. We do this by entering our query into the relevant field. In this case, I’m going to take a look at content about… content. (How meta.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/find-things-to-write-about-buzzsumo-content-results.jpg" alt="Find things to write about BuzzSumo total social shares results screen" width="800" height="445" /></div>
<p>As you can see, the results above show us a range of useful information, but we’re most interested in <a href="/blog/ws/2014/06/19/social-sharing">the number of social shares</a>. Why? Because the more shares an article has, the more confident we can be that another article on the same topic will also be shared widely.</p>
<p>Social shares are a pretty reliable indication that the article in question is pushing the right buttons. It’s important to note that social shares don’t necessarily mean the article will be positive, or even well-written; all we need to know is that many readers, regardless of the article’s angle or perspective, felt compelled to share it with their networks.</p>
<p>An article being shared widely across social platforms can be an indication of several different things:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s a breaking news story that got the scoop first and is being shared/cited widely</li>
<li>The article is particularly useful, insightful, or actionable</li>
<li>The writer has a unique perspective or insight into the topic</li>
<li>The opinions in the article defy conventional wisdom about the topic</li>
<li>It’s an article so bad or an opinion so controversial that people are sharing it out of anger or incredulity</li>
</ul>
<p>With the exception of the last one, any of the preceding points are worthy of emulating in our own content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/find-things-to-write-about-news-content-statistics.jpg" alt="Find things to write about Reuters news content statistics" width="800" height="293" /></div>
<p><em>And this is just one news outlet. Image via </em><a href="https://agency.reuters.com/en/about-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Reuters</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Obviously, news content is uniquely fresh and “new” precisely because it focuses on emerging or developing events, but this doesn’t help you if your publication doesn’t publish news content. As a rule, we should always be striving to produce <a href="/blog/ws/2017/03/15/quality-content-defined">actionable, insightful content</a>, so the second point is kind of a no-brainer. It also goes without saying that we shouldn’t be trying to publish content that people only share because they can’t believe how bad it is, so what does that leave us with? Publishing content with unique insights into a topic, and that offers an unusual, fresh perspective on a well-worn subject.</p>
<p>We’ve discussed <a href="/blog/ws/2014/05/19/contrarian-content-marketing">the value of contrarian content</a> before, but it’s worth reiterating that adopting an alternate viewpoint can be an excellent way to distinguish your content from the rest of the crowd. It’s also an easy way to come up with <a href="/blog/ws/2021/05/04/unique-blog-ideas">unique blog ideas</a>; simply find the prevailing points of view about a current topic in your industry, then come up with an angle that takes the opposite stance to everyone else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/find-things-to-write-about-nyt-most-emailed-by-emotion.png" alt="Find things to write about New York Times most emailed by emotion" width="600" height="341" /></div>
<p>Remember – it’s not enough to know your topic inside and out, or be able to write well. You have to be able to identify broader trends <em>and</em> think creatively about how to provide value to your audience by exploring alternate angles.</p>
<h3>A Note About Comments</h3>
<p>Some content analytics platforms allow you to filter results based on the number of comments an article has. An article with dozens of comments could suggest that the article inspired vigorous debate, but it could also mean that the site that published the article just has a terrible spam filter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/find-things-to-write-about-comments-sections.png" alt="Find things to write about toxic comments sections concept illustration" width="641" height="321" /></div>
<p><em>Image via </em><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/"><em>Pew Research Center</em></a></p>
<p>Another potential pitfall of relying on the number of comments an article has as an indication of its potential worth as a content idea is that while many content analytics platforms do a fine job of correctly tallying the number of comments an article has, this tends to be more difficult to calculate accurately. There are dozens of comment systems in use across many of the most popular sites on the web, from Disqus and Kinja to Postmatic and Jetpack, and not every analytics platform can accurately capture true comment data from every commenting systems.</p>
<p>Basically, try to think of comment volume as an interesting secondary metric to consider rather than a reliable indication of an article’s potential as a source for a new post.</p>
<h2>2. Find Things to Write About Using Keyword Research Tools</h2>
<p>While we’re on the topic of tools, our next tip focuses on using <a href="/blog/ws/2013/09/18/best-keyword-research-tools">keyword research tools</a> as a way to develop new content ideas.</p>
<p>Regardless of which keyword tool you choose to use, what we’re looking for are relevant keywords that we may not have thought of otherwise. This can be especially helpful if, like us here at WordStream, you work to a frequent publication schedule for a popular, established blog.</p>
<p>There are dozens of free keyword tools out there, but we like to think ours is pretty good, so I’ll be using <a href="/keywords">WordStream’s Free Keyword Tool</a> to illustrate this process.</p>
<p>First, we need to choose a nice, broad initial keyword to start our search, which is sometimes referred to as a seed keyword. For this example, I went with the keyword “cryptocurrency” with no industry vertical specified and results limited to the United States:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/find-things-to-write-about-wordstream-free-keyword-tool.jpg" alt="Find things to write about WordStream Free Keyword Tool example screenshot" width="800" height="274" /></div>
<p>This search yielded some interesting results. Here are some of the more interesting keyword suggestions for my initial seed query “cryptocurrency” and their accompanying monthly search volumes on Google:</p>
<ol>
<li>Litecoin vs bitcoin – 12,100</li>
<li>Cryptocurrency market capitalization – 8,100</li>
<li>Best cryptocurrency to invest in – 5,400</li>
<li>Is bitcoin farming profitable – 5,400</li>
<li>List of cryptocurrencies by market cap – 1,900</li>
<li>How to make a cryptocurrency – 1,900</li>
<li>Cryptocurrency mining explained – 720</li>
<li>Best digital currency exchanges – 390</li>
<li>Digital currency vs cryptocurrency – 40</li>
<li>List of cryptocurrencies by value – 20</li>
</ol>
<p>Although the average monthly search volume for some of these keywords is vanishingly small &#8211; just 20 searches per month for the keyword &#8220;list of cryptocurrencies by value&#8221; for example &#8211; we&#8217;re primarily looking for content ideas. Many of these keywords would be perfect for introductory guides, in-depth explainers, or even shorter listicles, and could easily be used as seed keywords themselves for further keyword research.</p>
<h2>3. Find Things to Write About in the News</h2>
<p>Despite the fact that most news these days is as toxic as a neglected Superfund site, the news can be an excellent source of content ideas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/find-things-to-write-about-news-headlines.jpg" alt="Find things to write about CNN news headlines Manafort indicted" width="800" height="465" /></div>
<p><em>Hey, it’s not ALL bad news!</em></p>
<p>Recently, we’ve been producing a lot more news-based content. This wasn’t necessarily by design, but rather necessity; recent announcements like Google’s recently unveiled <a href="/blog/ws/2018/02/15/chrome-ad-blocker">ad blocker for Chrome</a> and <a href="/blog/ws/2018/02/14/amp-stories">the launch of AMP Stories</a> are simply too important to overlook, and we’d be doing our readers a disservice by <em>not</em> writing about them. That said, we’re don’t tend to prioritize news stories as a rule – our readers don’t necessarily look to us for breaking stories – but by publishing more news content, we’ve been able to provide more of the kind of in-depth analysis that our readers <em>do</em> expect from us.</p>
<p>However, you didn’t come here to listen to me recommend newsjacking, so how else can you use the news as a wellspring of content ideas? By asking questions nobody else is asking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/find-things-to-write-about-net-neutrality-packages.png" alt="Find things to write about net neutrality bundled packages concept" width="800" height="494" /></div>
<p>In 2014, we published <a href="/blog/ws/2014/04/18/what-is-net-neutrality">this blog post on net neutrality</a> (RIP). I pitched Elisa this post because at the time, nobody seemed to be asking how the repeal of net neutrality regulations would affect small businesses and digital marketers. Since the post was originally published, we’ve updated it several times to reflect the ongoing dismantling of the internet as we know it, which has resulted in a steady stream of traffic to this and other posts.</p>
<p>We took a similar approach to <a href="/blog/ws/2017/10/04/chatbots">this post about some of the most innovative chatbots</a> on the web. Obviously this isn’t a timely or news-based post, but it does include citations and links to content that were originally news articles. We then used this to provide further analysis about what developments in conversational agents will mean for digital marketers.</p>
<p>Still not satisfied? Let’s look at another example of this process from start to finish.</p>
<p>Below is a screenshot of headlines from the Content Marketing section of my Feedly homepage:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/find-things-to-write-about-feedly-content-marketing.jpg" alt="Find things to write about Feedly Content Marketing news page" width="669" height="574" /></div>
<p>As you can see, the top three stories in my feed are from well-known sources – the Content Marketing Institute, Copyblogger, and Blog Tyrant.</p>
<p>Now let’s say I’m actively looking for a blog post to write, and this is the news content I’ve got to work with. Off the top of my head, here’s what comes to my mind for potential blog topic ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do clickbait headlines like the one in that CMI post even work anymore? Are major publishers like CMI as fatigued by intense editorial calendars as smaller publishers?</li>
<li>I have no idea what to expect from that Copyblogger story, nor what it’s even about. Maybe a post about how summaries of stories can make your audience feel? Or a guide on how to nail a summary of your article? Or a post exploring the risks of badly-written summaries?</li>
<li>All three of the top stories’ descriptions have been truncated by Feedly. What about a post on the current recommended specifications of meta descriptions? Or a list of reasons why meta descriptions aren’t as important as they used to be?</li>
</ul>
<p>The ideas above might not be that great, and they’re <em>definitely</em> not ready to be pitched to an editor, but <strong>that list literally took less than five minutes to put together</strong> and it gives me a solid starting point to work with. If I were struggling to come up with an idea for my next post, the rough ideas above could all work as launch points for brainstorming a viable idea that can be developed into a more complete outline or pitch.</p>
<p>Remember – we’re not looking to simply newsjack our way to more traffic (but hey, if you manage, more power to you), <strong>we’re looking for opportunities to provide more depth and context to emerging stories</strong> and developments in our industry.</p>
<p>Once you start reading the news with content in mind, you’ll be amazed by the ideas that will come to you.</p>
<h2>4. Find Things to Write About Using Blog Topic Generators</h2>
<p>Before you close this tab out of disgust that I’m about to seriously recommend blog topic generators as valid content ideation tools, hear me out.</p>
<p>The thing about blog topic generators is that they aren’t meant to be perfect – they’re only supposed to get the rusty gears in your noggin turning, like a can of WD-40. Think of blog topic generators like <a href="/blog/ws/2017/09/08/how-to-write-an-introduction">writing prompts</a> in a creative writing class. Some prompts are very good, and others are so bad they’re practically crimes against literature.</p>
<p>The same goes for blog topic generators.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at what using a blog topic generator looks like. Below is a screenshot of <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/blog-topic-generator">HubSpot&#8217;s Blog Topic Generator</a>, one of the better topic generators out there. For this example, I entered three terms into the generator: Writing, Advertising, and Marketing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/find-things-to-write-about-hubspot-blog-topic-generator.png" alt="Find things to write about HubSpot blog topic generator screenshot" width="1087" height="401" /></div>
<p>After clicking “Give Me Blog Ideas!” we’re presented with the following results:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/find-things-to-write-about-hubspot-blog-topic-generator-results.png" alt="Find things to write about HubSpot blog topic generator example results" width="817" height="359" /></div>
<p>At first glance, these results are surprisingly good. To be honest, I think I could make any of these example post ideas work as real blog posts, but let’s say we want to use these ideas as the basis for some ideas of our own.</p>
<p>As we did with the news article examples, below is a list of content ideas I came up with in just a few minutes based on the ideas provided by HubSpot’s Blog Topic Generator. Again, these ideas aren’t going to break the internet with their boldness of vision, but they’re definitely good enough to bring to your next editorial meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Cognitive Benefits of Teaching Children Cursive: A Fast Company-style article exploring the developmental benefits of teaching children cursive handwriting skills, explaining the physiological and cognitive processes that happen when kids learn to write in cursive</li>
<li>5 Reasons Why the Best Blog Post You’ve Ever Written Still Sucks: A how-to article examining what separates merely <em>good</em> content from really <em>great</em> content, featuring practical tips on how to be even more discerning about gauging the quality of your writing</li>
<li>7 Ways to Make Yourself Professionally Indispensable: An in-depth, listicle-style post featuring seven actionable ways to make yourself indispensable to your manager, including learning resources where readers can go to acquire these skills and third-party data about professional skills currently in high demand</li>
<li>Why Everything You Know About Headlines Is Wrong: A blog post offering counterpoints to many of the established best practices about writing headlines, including examples of various types of headlines i.e. news headlines, ad headlines, landing page headlines etc.</li>
<li>3 Quick Hacks to Make Your Content More Shareable: Short-form blog post featuring three highly actionable steps content marketers can take to make their content more appealing from a social shares perspective, including examples</li>
</ul>
<p>As I said, none of the ideas above are particularly earth-shattering in their originality, but the list above only took me five minutes or so to put together. With more time, or more specific initial criteria, we could easily come up with better ideas, or more ideas, or even use the rough notes above as the basis for further research and development.</p>
<h2>5. Find Things to Write About…In Your Old Content</h2>
<p>Our final tip for finding new things to write about is to look back through your old content.</p>
<p>Reviewing older content can be a lot of fun (or an exercise in cringe-inducing hilarity) and it’s a great way to see your progress as a writer over time – but that’s not all. Going back through older content is also an excellent way to come up with new things to write about.</p>
<p>For example, I did a quick search for some older blog posts I’d written with a view to coming up with some new content ideas. Here are the first handful of posts that caught my eye:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2016/03/17/shopping-cart-abandonment">13 Ways to Combat Shopping Cart Abandonment</a></li>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2017/10/24/subliminal-advertising">6 Examples of Subliminal Advertising, from Spooky to NSFW</a></li>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2017/10/13/how-to-write-a-cover-letter">How to Write a Cover Letter for a Job Application</a></li>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2014/07/07/native-advertising-examples">Native Advertising Examples: 5 of the Best (&amp; Worst)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike our net neutrality example from earlier, none of these posts are candidates for updates – there are no timely or news-based elements to them. However, that doesn’t mean we can’t wring even more ideas out of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shopping-cart-abandonment-header.png" alt="Shopping cart abandonment" width="535" height="267" /></div>
<p>Let’s take the first example, a blog post about shopping cart abandonment that we published in March of 2016. Before I even sat down to re-read that post, a thought popped into my head. We’re always hearing about how mobile traffic is exceeding desktop traffic across many ecommerce platforms, and that offline conversion tracking technology is advancing rapidly to meet the expectations of today’s advertisers.</p>
<p>So what are the biggest potential obstacles to ecommerce conversions that are <em>exclusive to mobile traffic</em>?</p>
<p>Already, this idea feels like it has legs. Let’s break it down:</p>
<ul>
<li>The topic expands and builds upon the foundation established in the original post</li>
<li>The entire angle of the post – major barriers to mobile ecommerce conversions – is based on broader trends in ecommerce</li>
<li>The post has a speculative, forward-thinking element that allows for the inclusion of timelier elements such as new data and opinion/analysis of emerging technological developments</li>
<li>Both ecommerce and mobile growth are well-established topics that resonate strongly with our core audience</li>
</ul>
<p>See how easy this is? I haven’t even put pen to proverbial paper yet, and already I’ve got a solid idea that aligns with our editorial <em>and</em> business objectives – not bad for idly looking through older posts.</p>
<p>We’re not done yet, though. Here’s some more rough ideas I came up with based on the other posts in my initial list of older content:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does Offline Conversion Tracking Go Too Far?: A post exploring emerging technologies in offline conversion tracking that asks whether these tracking techniques violate the privacy of end users</li>
<li>What to Expect From a Job Interview for a Remote Gig: An instructional post with real-life tips and tricks for what to expect from an interview for a 100% virtual/remote job, complete with advice on answering tough and unexpected questions</li>
<li>The State of Native 2018: An in-depth, long-form blog post that examines the current landscape of native advertising and advertorial content, featuring new examples, statistical data, and third-party reports/studies</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, these ideas are hardly amazing, but they’re a start – and we had to do almost nothing to come up with them save look through some older posts. Plus, these are just rough content ideas <em>based on my own posts</em>; if I went through some of our older posts written by other writers, I’d have even <em>more</em> ideas. (Plus it’s always nice to see two- or three-year-old posts holding up today.)</p>
<h2>Seek and Ye Shall Find</h2>
<p>Coming up with new ideas for things to write about can be hard; smash-your-head-into-your-desk-repeatedly-until-gradually-losing-consciousness hard. It gets even harder when you write for a particularly demanding client or an established blog in a highly competitive industry. However, as we’ve seen throughout this post, it’s definitely possible to come up with new content ideas, even if you’re staring down a fierce deadline or feel completely bereft of ideas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marketers always seem to be talking about pain points.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pain-points.jpg" alt="Customer pain points, 1-10 medical pain scale image, smiley face pain scale" width="800" height="317" /></div>
<p>Unlike a bum hip aggravated by the weather, however, the kind of pain points marketers typically encounter can be a little more complicated.</p>
<p>Today we’ll be diving into the world of customer pain points – specifically, what pain points are and how you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/06/20/product-market-fit">position your company as a potential solution</a>. We’ll be taking a look at several real-world examples to see how marketers overcome some of the most common customer pain points, as well as general tips on how to make yourself indispensable to your prospects at the right time, in the right place.</p>
<p>Before we get to the examples, though, let’s start with the basics.</p>
<h4><a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSContentDLWebBlogInContentTextLinkTrickstoClicks.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_TrickstoClicks_Download"><em>Also check out our free ad copywriting guide, 10 Tricks to Get the Click!</em></a></h4>
<h2>What Are Customer Pain Points?</h2>
<p><strong>A pain point is a specific problem that prospective customers of your business are experiencing.</strong> In other words, you can think of pain points as problems, plain and simple.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/customer-pain-points-concept-illustration.jpg" alt="Customer pain points concept illustration" width="850" height="513" /></div>
<p>Like any problem, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-pain-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer pain points</a> are as diverse and varied as your prospective customers themselves. However, not all prospects will be aware of the pain point they’re experiencing, which can make marketing to these individuals difficult as you effectively have to help your prospects realize they have a problem <em>and</em> convince them that your product or service will help solve it.</p>
<p>Although you can think of pain points as simple problems, they’re often grouped into several broader categories. Here are the four main types of pain points:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>Financial Pain Points</strong>: Your prospects are <a href="/blog/ws/2017/09/05/how-to-compete-with-big-budgets-adwords">spending too much money</a> on their current provider/solution/products and want to reduce their spend</li>
<li><strong>Productivity Pain Points</strong>: Your prospects are <a href="/blog/ws/2016/08/10/time-management-tips">wasting too much time</a> using their current provider/solution/products or want to use their time more efficiently</li>
<li><strong>Process</strong> <strong>Pain Points</strong>: Your prospects want to improve internal processes, such as assigning leads to sales reps or <a href="/blog/ws/2017/04/04/nurture-marketing">nurturing lower-priority leads</a></li>
<li><strong>Support</strong> <strong>Pain Points</strong>: Your prospects aren’t receiving the support they need at critical stages of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/19/customer-journey-map-templates">customer journey</a> or sales process</li>
</ul>
<p>Viewing customer pain points in these categories allows you to start thinking about how to position your company or product as a solution to your prospects’ problems, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/14/goal-talk-episode-10">what is needed to keep them happy</a>. For example, if your prospects’ pain points are primarily financial, you could highlight the features of your product within the context of a lower monthly subscription plan, or emphasize <a href="/blog/ws/2016/10/04/adwords-roi">the increased ROI your satisfied customers experience</a> after becoming a client.</p>
<p>However, while this method of categorization is a good start, it’s not as simple as identifying price as a pain point before pointing out that your product or service is cheaper than the competition. Many prospective <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/27/design-thinking">customers’ problems</a> are layered and complex, and may combine issues from several of our categories above. That’s why you need to view your customers’ pain points holistically, and present your company as a solution to not just one particularly problematic pain point, but as a trusted partner that can help solve a variety of problems.</p>
<h2>How Do I Identify My Customers’ Pain Points?</h2>
<p>Now that we know what pain points are, we need to figure out how to actually identify them.</p>
<p>Although many of your prospects are likely experiencing the same or similar pain points, the root cause of these pain points can be as diverse as your clientele. That’s why qualitative research is a fundamental part of identifying customer pain points.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/customer-pain-points-qualitative-research.jpg" alt="Customer pain points qualitative research concept illustration" width="800" height="600" /></div>
<p>The reason you need to conduct <em>qualitative</em> research (which focuses on detailed, individualized responses to open-ended questions) as opposed to <em>quantitative</em> research (which favors standardized questions and representative, statistically significant sample sizes) is because your customers’ pain points are highly subjective. Even if two customers have exactly the same problem, the underlying causes of that problem could differ greatly from one customer to another.</p>
<p>There are two primary sources of the information you need to identify your customers’ pain points – your customers themselves, and your sales and support teams. Let’s take a look at how to get the information you need from your customers first.</p>
<h3>Conducting Qualitative Customer Research</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to learn your customers’ biggest problems is by <em>really</em> listening to them.</p>
<p>Recently, we held <a href="/blog/ws/2017/11/15/wordstream-customer-insight-round-table">our first Customer Insight Round Table event</a>, in which we invited 11 WordStream customers to spend some time at our offices in Boston to share their experiences &#8211; good and bad &#8211; with us openly and honestly.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/customer-pain-points-wordstream-customer-roundtable.jpg" alt="Customer pain points WordStream customer roundtable" width="750" height="563" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>A WordStream client evaluates a series of problems and proposed solutions during our first Customer Insight Round Table event</em></p>
<p>As part of this process, we asked attendees to participate in an Ideation &amp; Design workshop, a collaborative, hands-on session in which our customers identified some of their biggest challenges as online advertisers. This helped attendees remain focused on the problems they shared as advertisers, rather than as individual entrepreneurs and business owners, and also allowed us to focus on solving problems that were within our control.</p>
<p>We learned things about our customers’ problems that even the most detailed questionnaire could never unearth, and it gave us the opportunity to discuss those issues within the context of wider problems that our customers are experiencing. This gave us a remarkably detailed view of our customers’ pain points as well as a broader view of how the current economic climate and other factors are affecting real businesses.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/customer-pain-points-wordstream-customer-roundtable-2.jpg" alt="Customer pain points WordStream customer roundtable" width="750" height="563" /></div>
<p>This kind of event is invaluable to you as a business. Not only does it allow you to converse at length with the people who are actually using your products, but it also creates an environment in which problem-solving is a collaborative process.</p>
<h3>Conducting Qualitative Sales Research</h3>
<p>The other research resource at your disposal is your sales team. Your sales reps work on the frontlines of the battle for the hearts and minds of your prospective customers every single day, which makes them an invaluable source of feedback on your prospects’ pain points.</p>
<p>However, as valuable as your sales team’s feedback can be, it’s important to distinguish your sales reps’ pain points from your prospects’ pain points; your sales reps’ problems may be very real, but you’re not building a product or providing a service to make your sales reps’ lives easier (at least, not in the context of this article).</p>
<p>It’s crucial to separate operational challenges from genuine customer pain points. For example, let’s say your reps are experiencing a slow quarter, and sales goals have been missed for two consecutive months. Here’s where things can get complicated. Facing the prospect of missing another sales target, your reps might be tempted to bemoan a lack of qualified leads or the quality of the leads assigned to them. While this may be a legitimate complaint, it’s got nothing at all to do with your customers’ pain, so you have to filter out the noise to get to the actual problem.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/customer-pain-points-what-would-you-do-differently-word-cloud.png" alt="Customer pain points WordStream survey what would you do differently word cloud" width="800" height="550" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>This word cloud of things advertisers would change about their campaigns offers us a lot of insight into our customers’ pain points</em></p>
<p>Now let’s say that your reps tell you that they’ve had several potential deals fall through because the prospect told them that PPC is “too complicated.” <em>This</em> is a genuine customer pain point. This speaks to several potential pain points, including a lack of experience or training, a poor understanding of PPC best practices, badly allocated ad budget, a fundamental misunderstanding about your product and what it does, and dozens of other potential problems.</p>
<p>Regardless of what’s causing the pain, you now have a pain point you can counter in your marketing. Remember our list of pain points from earlier in this post? Let’s take a look at the pain points we identified, and see how we could address them in our marketing:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>Financial: </strong>Emphasize lower price point (if applicable), highlight the average savings of your client base, use language that reiterates better ROI</li>
<li><strong>Productivity:</strong> Highlight reductions in wasted time experienced by current customers, emphasize ease-of-use features (such as at-a-glance overviews or a centralized dashboard)</li>
<li><strong>Processes:</strong> Mention current/planned integrations with existing products/services (i.e. Slack’s integration with Dropbox and Salesforce), highlight how your product/service can make typically difficult/time-intensive tasks easier</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support:</strong> Help the prospect feel like a partner by highlighting your after-market support, use connecting language (“us,” “we” etc.) in your copy</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to remember that you can’t “prove” you can ease your prospects’ pain, and what works for one customer may not work for another. That’s what makes <a href="/blog/ws/2017/01/10/social-proof-guide">social validation</a> so crucial when using customer pain points in your marketing; word-of-mouth recommendations and user reviews become much more persuasive when a prospect already believes your product or service could make their life better.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/customer-pain-points-customer-testimonial.jpg" alt="Customer pain points social validation customer testimonial" width="713" height="269" /></div>
<p>That’s why you should be using <a href="/blog/ws/2015/05/05/customer-testimonials">customer testimonials</a> and other social validation tools in your marketing – a great review or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/06/referral-marketing">glowing testimonial</a> can sell your product far more effectively than even the most silver-tongued salesperson.</p>

<h2>Mini Case Study: WordStream for Agencies</h2>
<p>When it comes to PPC, agencies face many unique challenges. From balancing account management with sourcing new clients to improving performance and demonstrating ROI, life is far from easy for agency PPC professionals.</p>
<p>In May last year, we set out to learn what makes the average internet marketing agency tick – with particular emphasis on the challenges agencies face – by <a href="/blog/ws/2017/05/15/state-of-the-internet-marketing-agency">conducting a survey of more than 200 internet marketing agencies</a> specializing in paid search from all over the world.</p>
<p>The results were fascinating, if a little predictable in some cases.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/customer-pain-points-biggest-challenges-ppc-agencies-1.jpg" alt="Customer pain points WordStream agency survey biggest challenges" width="760" height="452" /></div>
<p>During our analysis of the survey data, we found that time management was the single greatest challenge facing agencies today. This was perhaps the least surprising of the survey’s results – it’s no secret that agencies are under tremendous pressure if they want to compete in today’s online advertising ecosystem. Even the most skilled PPC professional still has to spend time actually working in their clients’ accounts, making time management even more crucial for agency PPC managers.</p>
<p>We already knew that time management was a major pain point for agencies before we built <a href="/agency-help">WordStream Advisor for Agencies</a>, but when we launched the tool, we wanted to really speak to our agency clients’ pain points. Take a look at this page intended specifically for prospective agency clients:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/customer-pain-points-wordstream-for-agencies-page.jpg" alt="Customer pain points WordStream for Agencies page" width="800" height="454" /></div>
<p>Although we also highlight WordStream Advisor for Agencies’ range of tools and the ease of use offered by the platform, time savings take center-stage throughout this page precisely because time management is agencies’ top priority.</p>
<p>Almost all of the copy on this page reiterates how much time agency PPC professionals can save by using our software, and this <a href="/blog/ws/2017/02/21/features-vs-benefits">benefit-driven approach</a> shapes the <a href="/blog/ws/2014/07/31/brand-voice">style, tone, and language</a> of the entire page. In fact, we take our agency prospects’ pain points even further as we progress down the page:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/customer-pain-points-wordstream-for-agencies-benefits.jpg" alt="Customer pain points WordStream for Agencies benefits" width="800" height="324" /></div>
<p>We know that time management is our agency prospects’ biggest pain point, but this alone isn’t all our agency prospects are worried about. Remember how we said that balancing time between account management and finding new clients was another pain point experienced by many agencies? The screenshot above shows how we’ve directly addressed this particular pain point within the context of time management and efficiency – both Productivity and Process pain points that follow logically from the initial identification of time management as agencies’ major pain point.</p>
<p>Remember – it’s not just about identifying your prospects’ pain points, it’s also about emphasizing <strong>what solving this pain will help your prospects do</strong>. The clearer you can make this in your copy and campaigns, the more likely your prospects are to respond positively.</p>
<h2>Leveraging Customer Pain Points in Online Ads</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve explored the concept of pain points in a little more detail, let’s keep going with our examples of how to leverage this pain in your online ad campaigns.</p>
<h3>Addressing Customer Pain Points in Paid Search Ads</h3>
<p>You’ve conducted qualitative research into what pain points your prospects are experiencing, and now you’re ready to use this knowledge in your search campaigns. What does this look like?</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/customer-pain-points-adp-ppc-ad.png" alt="Customer pain points ADP payroll PPC ad example" width="717" height="147" /></div>
<p>The image above is an ad that was served to me for the search query “payroll services” on Google. Unsurprisingly, the top ad was for ADP, one of the largest payroll providers in North America. If you’re not familiar with the fascinating world of payroll services, this ad might not look all that tantalizing, but to anyone who actually works with payroll on a regular basis, this ad could be very tempting.</p>
<p>One of the biggest financial challenges growing companies face is payroll. According to Paychex, payroll can cost <a href="https://www.surepayroll.com/resources/blog/small-business-payroll-cost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anywhere between $20 and $100 per month</a> in addition to a fee of up to $5 per employee per payroll run. This can make hiring new people a significant expense for some companies (especially when you factor in benefits and other costs), particularly newer, smaller businesses. From the get-go, this ad promises us two months of free payroll services, but that’s not what we’re interested in – we want to take a closer look at the ad copy.</p>
<p>The first line of copy – “Let ADP Take The Weight Off Your Business With Fast, Easy &amp; Reliable Payroll” – hits all the right notes. For one, the use of the phrase “Let ADP Take The Weight Off Your Business” addresses the burden of payroll subtly and uses language that evokes relief, implying the relief prospects will feel when they let ADP handle their payroll.</p>
<p>The inclusion of “Fast, Easy, &amp; Reliable” is also very clever, as <a href="/blog/ws/2015/04/08/persuasive-landing-pages">these common adjectives all address pain points</a> themselves, namely that payroll is a difficult, time-consuming pain in the ass that other companies can’t be entrusted with – not bad for three words of copy. Finally, you’ll notice the inclusion of several extensions offering that crucial social validation we mentioned earlier, as well as offers for a free quote, a demo of ADP’s payroll software, and the two-months-free offer highlighted in the headline.</p>
<h3>Addressing Customer Pain Points in Social Ads</h3>
<p>Social ads may be even more effective at addressing customer pain points than search ads. Why? Because many people browse social media sites like Twitter and Facebook in an aspirational way; we post updates that reflect the people <em>we want to be</em>, not necessarily the people <em>we are right now</em>.</p>
<p>As such, a well-designed social ad that directly addresses a prospect’s pain points could be powerfully persuasive.</p>
<p>We can see this principle in action in this Facebook ad for technical employment screening service Triplebyte:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/customer-pain-points-triplebyte-facebook-ad.jpg" alt="Customer pain points Triplebyte Facebook ad example" width="591" height="292" /></div>
<p>This ad is particularly clever and an unusual combination of emotional triggers that addresses a very specific pain point – landing a new technical job.</p>
<p>If you know much about <a href="/blog/ws/2015/01/02/learn-to-code-free">software development</a> or are friends with any of the engineers in your office, you may already know that a developer’s choice of text editor – the software programs in which developers actually write their code – is a Very Big Deal, and this ad leverages this to great effect.</p>
<p>Firstly, the ad makes a bold, potentially controversial claim that developers who use Vim and Emacs, two of the oldest and most popular text editors out there, are twice as likely to pass a technical interview with Triplebyte than users of Eclipse, another text editor. Although this claim is based on real data, it’s also <a href="/blog/ws/2015/11/09/emotional-ads">a clever emotional trigger</a>. Developers who use Vim or Emacs might feel a smug sense of self-satisfaction when reading this ad, but it could also raise the hackles of developers who favor other text editors. This makes the ad very tempting to would-be Triplebyte clients, regardless of their text editor of choice.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/customer-pain-points-triplebyte-technical-interviews-text-editors.jpg" alt="Customer pain points Triplebyte technical interviews text editors infographic" width="600" height="488" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>Image/data via </em><a href="https://triplebyte.com/blog/technical-interview-performance-by-editor-os-language"><em>Triplebyte</em></a></p>
<p>Secondly, the ad addresses a very specific pain point among techies looking for a new gig – the fear of successfully passing a technical interview. Companies like Google are famous (or infamous, depending on your perspective) for <a href="https://www.inc.com/business-insider/google-hardest-interview-questions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the deviousness of their technical interviews</a>, and Triplebyte’s ad infers that by using Vim or Emacs, prospective candidates can put themselves ahead of the (ferocious) competition for top technical roles.</p>
<p>This might not be the most conventional use of leveraging pain points in a social ad, but it’s an excellent example of how well-crafted social ads can combine emotional triggers <em>and</em> address very specific pain points.</p>
<h3>Addressing Customer Pain Points in Landing Pages</h3>
<p>As our final example of how to leverage customer pain points in your marketing, we come to one of the most effective – and leakiest – parts of the conversion funnel, the humble <a href="/blog/ws/2016/06/10/high-converting-landing-pages">landing page</a>.</p>
<p>Landing pages are crucial to the success of many marketing campaigns, particularly PPC campaigns. Aligning your landing pages with the copy of your ads is <a href="/blog/ws/2017/08/14/forgotten-adwords-best-practices">a well-established PPC best practice</a>, but your landing pages can also serve as another opportunity to reinforce why your product or service can ease your prospects’ pain.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at how this works.</p>
<p>Below is a landing page for social analytics platform SimplyMeasured:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/customer-pain-points-landing-page-example.jpg" alt="Customer pain points SimplyMeasured landing page example" width="782" height="608" /></div>
<p>This landing page is one of the best examples of addressing customer pain points I’ve come across. The headline is very effective (“How to Make Social Marketing Decisions Faster”) but the strapline below it is even better. Not only is it benefit-driven, it also addresses two specific pain points in a single line of copy: using time more effectively – which could be either a Productivity or Processes pain point – and establishing ones’ self as the go-to <a href="/blog/ws/2018/01/17/best-free-social-media-management-tools">social analytics</a> person in your office.</p>
<p>These benefits are further emphasized further down the landing page in the copy. In the bulleted list of what readers will learn from the download, one of the benefits listed is “Make quick stunning presentations for your stakeholders.” This reiterates the promise of the strapline, which is as much about perception as it is about productivity.</p>
<p>This landing page definitely isn’t perfect (there are many more <a href="/blog/ws/2015/07/27/landing-page-forms">web form fields</a> included on this landing page than those shown above), but generally speaking, it’s a great example of how to leverage customer pain points in your copy and use emotional triggers to make your landing pages much more appealing.</p>
<h2>No Pain, No Gain</h2>
<p>By now, hopefully you have a better idea of what your customers are really trying to do when they’re looking for companies or products like yours. Although many customer pain points are similar, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution to solving your customers’ pain. Fortunately, nobody knows your customers like you do, so dive into your research and start helping your customers accomplish what they really want to do.</p>
<p>What other tips do you have for helping customers overcome pain points?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some of the most effective marketing campaigns have an altruistic or philanthropic theme. However, not every campaign has the permanence of a business or specific product line; sometimes, the best campaigns focus on an idea, rather than a place or product.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cause-based-marketing1.jpg" alt="Cause-based marketing example" width="800" height="363" /></div>
<p>Today we’ll be taking a look at cause-based marketing (you&#8217;ll also see it called cause marketing). We’ll examine what caused-based marketing is before checking out several real-world examples of cause-based marketing in action, including the strengths of each campaign.</p>
<p>We’ll also be talking about what makes caused-based marketing so effective, as well as the challenges and obstacles that are unique to this kind of marketing so you can prepare for them in your own campaigns.</p>
<p>Ready to change the world? Me too.</p>
<h2>What Is Cause-Related Marketing?</h2>
<p>As its name implies, <strong>cause-related marketing is the process of marketing a specific idea, cause, or goal, rather than a specific business, product, or service.</strong></p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cause-based-marketing-human-rights-campaign-marriage-equality.png" alt="Cause-based marketing Human Rights Campaign marriage equality campaign example" width="650" height="375" /></div>
<p>Cause-based marketing campaigns can be incredibly broad, or very narrow, depending on the campaign. For example, a cause-related marketing campaign could be launched to promote a cause as broad as LGBTQ rights or marriage equality, encompassing a wide range of organizations and viewpoints such as the campaign by the Human Rights Campaign above, or a cause as narrow as ending animal testing in the cosmetics industry, which may target specific companies or even individual product lines.</p>
<p>Regardless of how broad or narrow a cause-related marketing campaign may be, these initiatives are often partnerships between a <a href="/blog/ws/2017/12/06/social-media-for-nonprofits">nonprofit organization</a> – typically the driving force behind the <a href="/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">messaging</a> of the campaign itself – and either an ad agency or corporate partner, which typically handles the execution of the campaign.</p>
<p>Although cause-based marketing campaigns can focus predominantly on PPC or <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/02/reasons-to-advertise-on-social-media">social advertising</a>, these campaigns can and often do incorporate elements of <a href="/blog/ws/2014/09/22/guerrilla-marketing-examples">guerrilla marketing</a> in their execution. Trying to grab people’s attention is no easy feat these days, and as such many organizations adopt more <a href="/blog/ws/2014/06/12/marketing-ideas">creative</a> ways of getting their message out, as we’ll see later on. Many cause-based marketing campaigns are organic offshoots of <a href="/blog/ws/2016/12/08/grassroots-marketing">grassroots marketing efforts</a>, which also tend to focus on causes.</p>
<h2>Cause-Related Marketing vs. Ethical Marketing: What’s the Difference?</h2>
<p>One of the biggest differences between cause-based marketing and <a href="/blog/ws/2017/09/20/ethical-marketing">ethical marketing</a> is that cause-based campaigns typically focus on a specific <a href="/blog/ws/2020/06/15/marketing-objectives">objective</a>, whereas ethical marketing focuses on broader marketing principles that apply to many different aspects of an organization’s marketing efforts.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cause-based-marketing-warby-parker-buy-one-give-one.jpg" alt="Cause-based marketing Warby Parker buy-one give-one program" width="800" height="329" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image via </em><a href="https://www.warbyparker.com/buy-a-pair-give-a-pair" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Warby Parker</em></a></p>
<p>For example, promoting a fundraising event for a cancer research organization would be cause-based marketing. Buy-one, give-one programs, such as those used by brands like Warby Parker and TOMS Shoes for example, are an example of <a href="/blog/ws/2017/09/20/ethical-marketing">ethical marketing</a> because this approach to corporate giving is a fundamental part of those companies’ identities and brand values.</p>
<p>Although there are distinct differences between cause-based and ethical marketing, the two approaches share a great deal of overlap, particularly in their execution. Visual assets such as images, the <a href="/blog/ws/2014/07/31/brand-voice">style and tone of the language</a> used, and the overall positioning of a cause-based marketing campaign may be very similar to those of an ethical marketing campaign by virtue of the similarities between the two campaign types in terms of themes and objectives.</p>
<p>So now we know what caused-based marketing is. But what does cause-based marketing look like?</p>
<h2>6 Powerful Examples of Cause-Related Marketing</h2>
<p>There’s certainly no shortage of social problems in urgent need of solutions, and as such cause-based marketing campaigns are as diverse as their profit-driven counterparts. Here are a few examples of particularly well-executed cause-based marketing campaigns that can serve as a little creative inspiration for your own cause-based campaigns.</p>
<h3>1. Veganuary</h3>
<p>2017 was an absolutely incredible year for plant-based diets. According to data from the Vegan Society, <a href="https://munchies.vice.com/en_uk/article/9a8gve/this-is-why-millennials-are-all-turning-vegan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the number of vegans in the United Kingdom has increased by 350%</a> over the past 10 years. Nellson, a manufacturer of protein bars and powders, claims that demand for the production of plant-based foodstuffs <a href="https://www.fooddive.com/news/food-maker-nellson-says-plant-based-product-development-surging/503489/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has increased by almost 140%</a>. Data from food delivery service Just Eat suggests that veganism is set to be the biggest food trend of this year, and in 2017 alone, the company observed <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/food/vegan-predicted-popular-food-trend-next-year-267099" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 987%(!) increase in demand for vegan options</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cause-based-marketing-veganuary-participation.png" alt="Cause-based marketing Veganuary participation graphic" width="650" height="540" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image/data via Veganuary</em></p>
<p>With figures like these, it’s little wonder that this year’s <a href="https://veganuary.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Veganuary campaign</a> was one of the biggest ever. Veganuary is an annual, month-long event that aims to promote the benefits of adopting a plant-based diet. Veganuary, now a registered charity, first began in the U.K. back in 2014 with just 3,300 people participating. Last year, more than 60,000 people took part.</p>
<p>Veganuary is a prime example of cause-based marketing done right. The organization’s first real foray into true advertising was launched in October of 2016, when <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2016/11/06/veganuary-campaign-urges-people-to-go-vegan-for-a-month-6238419/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the charity crowdfunded $30,000 to place advertisements</a> across the London Underground network. Following the success of that campaign, Veganuary made the leap across the Pond when the organization placed similar ads on the Boston subway system, as well as across Manchester in the U.K. and Sydney in Australia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cause-based-marketing-veganuary-subway-ads.jpg" alt="Cause-based marketing Veganuary ads London Underground campaign launch King's Cross station" width="800" height="533" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Professional vegan pole-fitness instructors Terri Walsh and Michael Donohoe promoting<br />
Veganuary outside King’s Cross St. Pancras Underground station in central London. Image via Veganuary.</em></p>
<p>One of the reasons why the Veganuary campaign has been so successful – aside from lots of people looking to reduce their consumption of animal products, of course – is that social engagement is built into the heart of the campaign itself. As well as useful resources that new vegans will find useful in their new lifestyle, Veganuary asks participants to sign a pledge stating their commitment to veganism, which participants can then <a href="/blog/ws/2017/01/05/social-media-marketing-statistics">share across their social networks</a>. This provides new vegans with a sense of community by getting involved with the initiative and provides a way for participants to spread the word organically (no pun intended).</p>
<h3>2. Movember</h3>
<p>Every <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/15/november-marketing-ideas">November</a>, millions of men around the world come together to champion the most noble of causes – raising awareness of serious health issues facing men by refusing to shave our upper lips. This curious phenomenon has become an immensely popular annual tradition better known as <a href="https://us.movember.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Movember</a>.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cause-based-marketing-movember-nz.jpg" alt="Cause-based marketing Movember New Zealand statistics" width="1024" height="512" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image via </em><a href="https://twitter.com/movembernz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Movember New Zealand</em></a></p>
<p>The story of Movember begins as so many grand tales do – over drinks between two mates in an Australian pub. In 2003, friends <a href="https://us.movember.com/about/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Travis Garone and Luke Slattery</a> noticed over beers in their native Melbourne that the traditional mustache had become an increasingly rare sight. Convinced of the genius of their idea, and inspired by a friend’s mother who was raising money for breast cancer charities, Garone and Slattery managed to coerce around 30 of their friends to grow mustaches throughout the month of November.</p>
<p>The rest, as they say, is history.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cause-based-marketing-movember-stats.jpg" alt="Cause-based marketing Movember statistics mental health" width="736" height="528" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image via Movember</em></p>
<p>As of 2017, more than 5 million men took part in Movember to raise awareness for a range of health issues facing men, from prostate cancer to suicide. The movement resulted in the formation of the Movember Foundation, a charitable organization that works with various men’s health advocacy groups around the world, and aims to reduce premature deaths among men by 25% by 2030. The organization has had an incredible impact since its inception in 2004, having funded more than 1,200 men’s health initiatives worldwide.</p>
<p>Similarly to Veganuary, the social element of Movember is a strong driver of <a href="/blog/ws/2018/05/23/seo-for-startups">organic growth</a> (again, no pun intended). Many men update their Movember progress pics daily on social media, which not only keeps participants motivated to see their attempt through to the end, but also keeps the campaign front-and-center in people’s social feeds. This also provides participants with additional opportunities to fundraise for men’s health charities throughout the month, not just at the beginning of their attempt.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cause-based-marketing-movember-mogress-pics.jpg" alt="Cause-based marketing Movember progress pictures social media" width="540" height="563" /></div>
<p>The mustaches themselves aren’t important; in fact, it seems that guys who can barely grow any facial hair are just as involved and enthusiastic about the campaign as the guys who can grow a spectacular set of whiskers.</p>
<p>Like many of the best charitable awareness campaigns, Movember combines lighthearted fun with a serious message to spread the word.</p>
<h3>3. Women’s March</h3>
<p>On <a href="/blog/ws/2020/12/07/january-marketing-ideas">January</a> 21, 2017, half a million people descended upon Washington, D.C., to protest the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cause-based-marketing-womens-march-dc-2017.jpg" alt="Cause-based marketing Womens March Washington DC 2017 CNN" width="1100" height="619" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image via </em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/21/us/gallery/womens-march-on-washington/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>CNN</em></a></p>
<p>What became <a href="https://qz.com/891978/womens-march-one-out-of-every-100-americans-took-to-the-street-according-to-estimates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the largest protest marches in modern history</a> began as a Facebook post by Teresa Shook of Hawaii, who invited her social network to join her in a march on the nation’s capital. Several other similar Facebook pages emerged, and soon after merged to become the official Women’s March. Planned Parenthood helped organize the march by making experienced event-organizing staff available to the march organizers, and more than 100 organizations lent their support and expertise to the event.</p>
<p>The organizers of the Women’s March were smart enough to realize very early on that strong, unified branding would be crucial to the success of the event. This helped the Women’s March make the difficult transition from loosely affiliated groups of people organizing in the same place to a cohesive, strategic event that united hundreds of special interest groups and dozens of individual causes, from domestic abuse prevention to women’s reproductive rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cause-based-marketing-womens-march-branding.jpg" alt="Cause-based marketing Womens March branding logos" width="800" height="550" /></div>
<p>In addition to its strong branding, the Women’s March campaign made excellent use of <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/20/daily-hashtags">hashtags</a> to keep the conversation going. The #WhyIMarch hashtag wasn’t just used on the day of the protests, which saw the hashtag surpass more than 200,000 mentions just three days after the event, and has been used in subsequent events – a valuable lesson on the importance of choosing good, evergreen hashtags.</p>
<h3>4. Everytown for Gun Safety</h3>
<p>According to the FBI, <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44126.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a mass shooting</a> is defined as an incident in which at least four people, excluding the gunman, are injured or killed by firearms in the same incident at the same location.</p>
<p>By this definition, there was a mass shooting almost every single day in America in 2017.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cause-based-marketing-nyt-gun-violence-data.jpg" alt="Cause-based marketing New York Times mass shootings by month 2017 infographic data visualization" width="646" height="575" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>A visualization of mass shootings by month in 2017, via </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/02/opinion/editorials/mass-shootings-congress.html?module=ArrowsNav&amp;contentCollection=Opinion&amp;action=keypress&amp;region=FixedLeft&amp;pgtype=Multimedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The New York Times</em></a></p>
<p>Regardless of where you stand on the Second Amendment, there’s no getting around the fact that America has a unique gun violence problem. When you start to look at the data on firearm-related deaths in the U.S., the terrifying scale of the problem becomes clearer – even if the solution does not.</p>
<p>There are dozens of gun reform advocacy organizations in the U.S., but Everytown for Gun Safety is among the largest and most active. The organization was founded in 2014 following the merger of Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cause-based-marketing-everytown-for-gun-safety.png" alt="Cause-based marketing Everytown for Gun Violence logo" width="302" height="167" /></div>
<p>The group advocates for a wide range of gun reform initiatives, including comprehensive reform of the current background check system, legislative changes that forbid convicted domestic abusers from acquiring firearms, and the ending of federal statutes that allow legal weapon trafficking in some states. Everytown is also one of the few gun control advocacy organizations that actively campaigns about the dangers that firearms pose to women through domestic violence.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cause-based-marketing-everytown-for-gun-safety-domestic-violence-stat.png" alt="Cause-based marketing Everytown for Gun Violence domestic violence statistics" width="1001" height="801" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image via Everytown for Gun Safety</em></p>
<p>If we use general awareness – or <a href="/blog/ws/2017/03/06/brand-advertising-for-conversions">brand recognition</a>, to think of it another way – Everytown has become one of the most successful cause-based marketing campaigns in recent memory. Even if Everytown has struggled to influence policymakers in Washington, the campaign itself has become synonymous with the wider gun reform movement in the U.S., and the brand itself has become a highly visible lobbying organization across the country. While the organization has lobbied for specific legislative items over the years, it’s Everytown’s success as a growing movement against gun violence in general that speaks to the power of cause-based campaigns.</p>
<p>Similarly to the Women’s March, Everytown’s unified branding is both immediately recognizable and quite visually clever, making it a strong brand under which the organization can rally supporters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cause-based-marketing-everytown-for-gun-safety-julianne-moore.jpg" alt="Cause-based marketing Everytown for Gun Violence rally Julianne Moore" width="636" height="421" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Actress and gun reform advocate Julianne Moore at an Everytown for Gun Safety rally.<br />
Image via Everytown for Gun Safety.</em></p>
<p>Everytown has enjoyed remarkable success, despite a lack of attendant policy changes. The organization has become one of the most visible gun reform advocacy groups in the country, and has racked up high-profile support from a range of well-known and influential people including actresses Emma Stone, Laura Dern, and Julianne Moore, as well as politicians such as former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, one of the group’s biggest financiers.</p>
<h3>5. Feeding America</h3>
<p>Despite being among the world’s wealthiest nations, America has one of the highest rates of child poverty in the world. Approximately <a href="http://www.nccp.org/topics/childpoverty.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one in five American children lives in poverty</a>, and few dimensions of poverty are as devastating or potentially deadly as hunger.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cause-based-marketing-feeding-america-infographic-stats.gif" alt="C" width="600" height="174" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Some sobering statistics from Feeding America’s </em><a href="http://www.feedingamerica.org/research/hunger-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Hunger in America 2014 report</em></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.feedingamerica.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feeding America</a> is one of the most active nonprofit organizations in the U.S., and works tirelessly to end food insecurity across America’s most vulnerable and impoverished communities. Every year, more than 46 million people rely on Feeding America programs and food banks to make ends meet, and more than 200 food banks and 60,000 food pantries make up the Feeding America network, which serves one in seven Americans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cause-based-marketing-feeding-america-impact.png" alt="Cause-based marketing Feeding America impact" width="960" height="325" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image via Feeding America</em></p>
<p>The organization frequently embarks upon large-scale cause-related marketing campaigns to highlight the urgent problem of child hunger in the U.S., including print ads in national publications, billboard ads, and online and social media campaigns. Feeding America also operates vital <a href="/blog/ws/2015/10/15/holiday-marketing-tips">seasonal campaigns</a> that put food on families’ tables at particularly challenging times of year such as Thanksgiving and Christmas.</p>
<p>In addition to the enormous impact that Feeding America has on the lives of vulnerable families, Feeding America’s cause-based campaigns illustrate how poverty can be tackled without resorting to the use of exploitative imagery for its own sake. In all of its visual assets, Feeding America prioritizes dignity and respect, highlighting the complex socioeconomic causes of poverty and hunger and their disproportionate impact on the poor and people of color, rather than demonizing it as the result of fecklessness or laziness. Feeding America has also leveraged modern trends to highlight how prevalent hunger is across the United States, spreading its message in an increasingly relatable way:</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cause-based-marketing-feeding-america-social.jpg" alt="Cause-based marketing Feeding America social media campaign example" width="640" height="640" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image via Feeding America</em></p>
<p>Feeding America is a prime example of how cause-based marketing can not only help people, but establish <a href="/blog/ws/2017/12/06/social-media-for-nonprofits?dt=1">nonprofits and charitable organizations</a> as true leaders in the fight against society’s most urgent social problems.</p>
<h3>6. WWF</h3>
<p>The World Wildlife Foundation is one of the most dedicated conservation organizations in the world. Although WWF is best known for its advocacy work in protecting endangered species from extinction, the organization is also very active in the field of habitat conservation.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cause-based-marketing-wwf-deforestation-campaign.jpg" alt="Cause-based marketing WWF Amazon deforestation campaign" width="880" height="574" /></div>
<p>WWF has launched hundreds of cause-related campaigns over the years, but a recent <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/28/green-marketing">green marketing campaign</a> highlighting the urgent dangers of rainforest deforestation was particularly memorable. The campaign’s creative featured an image of a rainforest resembling human lungs that has been partially clear-cut by loggers. Produced by French agency TBWA/Paris, the image was a powerful reminder of the need to protect the world’s rainforests, not only for the animals that call the forests home, but for our planet as well.</p>
<p>While this particular campaign is an excellent example of the power of strong visual assets, it also highlights one of the potential pitfalls of cause-based campaigns, namely the lack of <a href="/blog/ws/2014/10/20/call-to-action-examples">a specific call to action</a>. Without a hashtag, landing page, or even a QR code, the campaign itself isn’t the easiest to track in terms of performance or objectives – these ads appeared primarily in ambient locations such as subway cars – making it difficult to justify in terms of impact or ROI.</p>
<h2>Rebels with a Cause</h2>
<p>As we’ve seen from the examples above, cause-based marketing campaigns can be an excellent way of raising awareness of crucial causes across a range of interest areas. Although they may be more difficult to track in terms of performance or impact, there has never been a greater need for cause-based marketing.</p>
<p>Which cause-based marketing campaigns have stuck in your mind over the years? Has a cause-based campaign ever persuaded you to make a change or reevaluate your position on a prickly topic?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few things are as satisfying as watching a major brand getting mercilessly owned on social media. Even if it’s a brand we don’t particularly care about – or perhaps precisely <em>because</em> we don’t care about them – seeing a faceless corporation get bodied by legions of angry consumers on Twitter or Facebook is pure <em>schadenfreude</em> at its best, especially if they had it coming (which, let’s be honest, they almost always do).</p>

<p><em>Hey, even a broken clock&#8230;<br />
</em></p>
<p>Social media crisis management has never been more crucial, yet it’s truly incredible watching brands that should have the common sense and expertise to know better make the same mistakes over and over again. From tasteless tweets to foolish Facebook fury, we’ve seen some of the world’s biggest brands brought to their proverbial knees by the power of social media, and I for one never tire of watching it unfold in real time. Of course, some poor bastard has to pick up the pieces, whether they’re responsible for the mess or not.</p>
<p>Today we’ll be looking at five social media crisis management examples and how they played out, as well as six tips for developing your own social media crisis response plan. We’ll be taking a short tour of some of the most egregious missteps made by major brands in recent years to serve as cautionary tales (and maybe the butt of a few well-deserved jokes), before examining not only what they did wrong during the aftermath, but what they <em>should</em> have done instead.</p>
<p>Ready to point at major brands and do your best <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOifa1WrOnQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nelson Muntz laugh</a> with me? Then let’s get to it!</p>
<h2>5 Social Media Crisis Examples</h2>
<h3>#1: McDonald’s Hashtag Hijinks</h3>
<p>Although many social media sites’ search functionality has become a great deal more sophisticated than it was just a few years ago, <a href="/blog/ws/2015/07/02/twitter-hashtags">hashtags</a> remain an important part of maximizing the visibility of social campaigns. Simply come up with a clever hashtag, let the users do the work, and reap the benefits – what could go wrong?</p>

<p>As McDonald’s learned in 2012, just about everything.</p>
<p>To coincide with a campaign to promote its line of happy meals, McDonald’s created a hashtag &#8211; #McDStories – and encouraged its followers to share their own stories. And, to the doubtless horror of the fast-food giant’s social media team, that’s exactly what people did.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>One of the hundreds of tweets that took advantage of the #McDStories hashtag to<br />
shed light on McDonald’s business operations</em></p>
<p>Almost immediately, people began sharing their very worst experiences of either working at or patronizing McDonald’s, from horrifying labor law violations observed by former employees to shocking firsthand accounts of how the chain routinely abuses animals at its suppliers’ agricultural production facilities.</p>
<p>All told, the incident was among McDonald’s worst social media failures, and remains a prime example of how hashtag-based campaigns can backfire horribly.</p>
<h3>Social Media Crisis #2: Tasteless Tie-Ins</h3>
<p>There’s an old adage that says the only certainties in life are death and taxes. I propose that we add a third to the list – tone-deaf branded tweets on the anniversary of 9/11.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>KNOCK IT OFF RIGHT NOW</em></p>
<p>It doesn’t matter how many brands have been taken to task for trying to capitalize on the anniversary of the World Trade Center attacks – every year, it happens again.</p>
<p>There are literally dozens of examples of this in action, each as offensive as the last.</p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>So do we – just not in the way CVS wants</em></p>
<p>In 2014, outspoken designer and co-founder of San Francisco-based Mule Design <a href="http://www.adweek.com/creativity/guys-replies-911-brand-tweets-sum-everything-thats-wrong-911-brand-tweets-160060/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mike Monteiro took some of the most egregious offenders to task</a> for their “branding” on Twitter, which prompted some difficult conversations about coopting national tragedies to sell products.</p>
<p>Sadly, this kind of opportunistic branding is far from exclusive to 9/11 memorials. In 2014, a hashtag focused on the stories of domestic abuse survivors, #WhyIStayed, began trending on Twitter, and it didn’t take long for brands to plant their feet firmly in their proverbial mouths, as DiGiorno Pizza did with this particularly tasteless attempt to cash in on the hashtag:</p>

<h3>Social Media Crisis #3: Customer Service Crapshoots</h3>
<p>Social media has given us more than just an outlet for our every waking thought and observation; it’s also a prime opportunity to let brands know exactly what we think of them. According to HubSpot, <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/twitter-response-time-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">72% of consumers who contact a company on Twitter expect a response within an hour</a>, which means delaying responses to customer complaints can be the kiss of death for a company’s online reputation.</p>
<p>Case in point, British Airways.</p>
<p>In September 2013, Twitter user Hasan Syed, who tweets under the handle @HVSVN, tweeted about British Airways’ poor customer service. This was not just an organic tweet &#8211; @HVSVN was so mad, he paid to promote it to every user following British Airways (a clever example of using <a href="/blog/ws/2016/12/14/why-use-twitter-ads">audience segmentation</a> creatively), amplifying the tweet’s reach to more than 76,000 people:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="02ff7cee-e94a-4484-8e81-e528d5ef7fc5" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/social-media-crisis-management-ba-tweet.png" alt="Social media crisis management sponsored tweet don't fly British Airways twitter HVSVN" width="593" height="311" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Granted, @HVSVN’s tweet was a little generic, and didn’t address a specific grievance or experience he’d had with the airline. However, British Airways did itself no favors by failing to respond to the tweet for more than eight hours. The reason for the delay? The airline’s social media team weren’t in the office because they only work 9-5 p.m.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0ca7dd2d-5f80-4e2a-bf17-62b4dcfd378b" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>#LMAO #rekt</em></p>
<p>Had BA responded in a more timely fashion, some of the damage could have been mitigated – but they didn’t, and it wasn’t. A valuable lesson for companies of all sizes, especially immensely profitable international airlines that can easily afford a 24/7 social media presence.</p>
<h3>Social Media Crisis #4: Multiple Account Maladies</h3>
<p>Ever tweeted something from a personal account when you meant to tweet from the corporate account you manage? Then you’ll know how catastrophic – and easily – this kind of social media mix-up can be.</p>
<p>This particularly social snafu happens regularly. A brand’s social account posts an update or tweet that reflects poorly on the brand, which is then followed by either profuse apologies or indignant, transparently fake excuses about accounts being “hacked.”</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e7f25179-1bc0-4b7a-9c8e-540851500cd6" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Hello, police? I’d like to report a murder.</em></p>
<p>One especially memorable example of this came courtesy of British cellular provider Vodafone UK in February 2010, when the official Twitter handle of the company tweeted a truly vile, wildly offensive homophobic tweet. (I won’t include an image of the offending tweet here, but you can read <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/feb/05/vodafone-twitter-obscene-tweet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this story in The Guardian</a> to see what the tweet said.)</p>
<p>As is typical in such situations, Vodafone deleted the tweet immediately, but soon realized that everything lives forever on the internet after hundreds of users screengrabbed the tweet and reposted it. The company apologized to its followers in general and on an individual basis in the hours that followed, and later issued a statement that claimed an employee at the company’s customer service center in Stoke was responsible. That employee was subsequently fired, but the damage done to Vodafone UK’s brand lasted long after the rogue employee was given their pink slip (or P45, for our British readers who have no idea what a pink slip is).</p>
<h3>Social Media Crisis #5: Politically Toxic Takes</h3>
<p>Sometimes, brands get it so wrong on social media that it’s amazing they ever recover. This was a painful lesson that footwear brand New Balance learned the hard way last year when the brand inadvertently became unofficially endorsed by white supremacists.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="2caa0a7e-af61-43e1-ade5-0d07f06354df" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, New Balance’s VP of Public Affairs, Matt LeBretton, voiced his support for the incoming Trump administration when asked a question on his views on the doomed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. New Balance had been vociferously opposed to the TPP for many years, and had been in the running for an exclusive contract to provide the U.S. Department of Justice with athletic footwear, a contract for which the company was willing to tolerate the “<a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/04/11/new-balance-says-obama-administration-reneged-deal-involving-military-business/zUdUWa23ZWv53D5a9AjNII/story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poison pill that is TPP.</a>”</p>
<p>However, when LeBretton said that, “frankly, w/ Pres-Elect Trump we feel things are going to move in the right direction,” fans and opponents of New Balance alike wasted no time in voicing their disapproval. Shortly after the interview was published, neo-Nazi site The Daily Stormer endorsed New Balance as the “official brand of the Trump revolution,” which prompted hundreds of former customers to post images of their New Balance sneakers in the trash on social media:</p>

<h2>Social Media Crisis Management 101: 6 Tips for Survival</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve seen a handful of the many ways you can inadvertently kill a brand on social media, let’s take a look at some of the measures you can take to reduce the risk of encountering a similarly catastrophic scenario, and tips you can use if a crisis is unavoidable.</p>
<h3>#1: Think Before You Hashtag</h3>
<p>As we discussed earlier, hashtags can be a great way to maximize visibility of your social content. However, as McDonald’s learned the hard way, hashtags can be as destructive as they can be useful.</p>
<p>Before creating a hashtag-themed campaign on any social platform, think about the myriad ways this could backfire. Could the meaning of the hashtag be purposefully misconstrued to damage your company’s reputation? Now is not the time to put your faith in the goodness of strangers or the better nature of your fellow humans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e70b409a-1eeb-4649-94f3-6e1f63830170" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/social-media-crisis-management-comcast-dan.jpg" alt="Social media crisis management corporate account responses to negative tweets Comcast rep tweets" width="642" height="449" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><em>Spare a thought for poor Comcast Dan</em></p>
<p>Similarly, public perceptions of your company (or the company you work for) play a large role in the potential pitfalls of a hashtag-centric campaign. This is particularly important if you manage the social presence of <a href="/blog/ws/2014/04/18/what-is-net-neutrality">large corporate entities with poor reputations</a>, such as Comcast. It doesn’t matter how much money you spend, or how positive the messaging is, or how creative your campaign’s hashtags are – if people hate your company, they’ll take any chance they can to malign you on social media, including hijacking your hashtags.</p>
<p>If you’re in any doubt whatsoever, maybe reconsider the hashtag strategy.</p>
<h3>#2: Avoid Capitalizing on Crises</h3>
<p>If you’re tempted to think that <em>your</em> tweet about 9/11 or a similar tragedy will be funny – it won’t be.</p>
<p>There are simply no excuses for trying to capitalize upon a tragedy, ever. It doesn’t matter if your tweets or posts are funny, somber, or reverential – there’s just no need for them. The content of your updates aside, even <em>appearing</em> to be coopting a tragedy for your own gain can be enough to prompt a social media backlash that could do tremendous damage to perceptions of your brand.</p>
<p>Something else to be mindful of is scheduling tweets. Many companies schedule their social media posts up to several weeks in advance, and it’s obviously impossible to predict where and when tragedy will strike. That said, if you’ve got social media content queued up and a major terrorist attack or natural disaster occurs, consider postponing your scheduled tweets until the media coverage dies down; posting even scheduled content during or shortly after a national tragedy can be just as tone-deaf and potentially damaging as trying to coopt or capitalize upon a disaster in the first place.</p>
<h3>#3: Have Prepared Response Plans in Place</h3>
<p>One of the most damaging elements of an emerging social media crisis isn’t just the initial incident and the immediate fallout, but a lack of a defined, prepared disaster response plan.</p>
<p>Regardless of what crisis has befallen your company on social, you should know exactly what to do and who is responsible for assessing, responding to, and monitoring the development of the situation. Everybody identified in the crisis response plan should know their role and how the plan should be executed. It’s impossible to prepare for every single eventuality, but it’s amazing how many companies don’t have any form of disaster response plan ready.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="53ed9d4b-9b2b-4a61-b69f-597fe1e9c188" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/social-media-crisis-management-crisis-plan-concept.jpg" alt="Social media crisis management concept illustration" width="1200" height="627" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>In addition to <a href="https://mention.com/blog/social-media-crisis-management-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preparing a detailed response plan</a>, you need to consider the tone of your prepared responses, not just how and when to get them out. If your company really did screw up, faux apologies like, “We’re sorry you feel that way” are likely to make matters worse, not better. Genuine, sincere apologies aren’t just the right thing to do when you drop the ball – they’re what your pissed-off followers will expect (or demand), so don’t make things worse by refusing to accept responsibility or offering a weak, not-quite apology.</p>
<h3>#4: Create a Social Media Playbook for Your Company</h3>
<p>As social media has become <a href="/blog/ws/2017/11/28/facebook-ads-for-saas">more sophisticated as a marketing tool</a>, more and more companies have decided to formally codify their internal preferences and rules for employees into comprehensive social media playbooks. If you don’t have one, now’s the time to create one.</p>
<p>The specifics of what should be included in your social media playbook is a little beyond the scope of this post. However, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/mediaeloqua/documents/Eloqua_Social_Media_Playbook_Public.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the social media handbook of Oracle’s Eloqua platform</a> is an excellent starting point for companies that are thinking about putting their own playbook together.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="26fe8e09-d779-4b62-b551-8e6c58af22c8" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/social-media-crisis-management-eloqua-social-media-playbook-example.jpg" alt="Social media crisis management Eloqua social media playbook example" width="810" height="489" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><em>A page from </em><a href="http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/mediaeloqua/documents/Eloqua_Social_Media_Playbook_Public.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Eloqua’s social media playbook</em></a><em>, which is an excellent<br />
starting point for businesses considering creating their own</em></p>
<p>Your social media playbook should not only cover the aforementioned disaster response plans, but also govern how social media usage should be handled by your reps and employees. This includes elements such as the <a href="/blog/ws/2014/07/31/brand-voice">style, tone, and voice</a> of social media content published by official handles or accounts. (It may be worth incorporating elements of <a href="/blog/ws/2017/11/15/website-copy">your in-house style guide</a> into your social media playbook, especially when it comes to content governance.)</p>
<p>The guide should also contain explicit guidelines for factors such as responding to user inquiries on behalf of your company, and general codes of conduct in a broader sense (such as apologies, as we talked about a moment ago). It should also cover rules concerning whether offending tweets or posts should be deleted (protip: they shouldn’t until a full explanation and supporting tweet/post has been published), how matters of escalation should be handled, and appropriate reporting procedures to ensure key stakeholders are kept up to speed on developing or emerging crises.</p>
<p>Social media guidelines for companies are very handy, but they’re not without their risks. For one, it’s unethical (and most likely illegal) to force employees to adhere to stringent social media usage policies that violate or restrict your employees’ civil liberties or freedom of speech. It’s also a very bad look to try and police the content of your employees’ social media posts, and doing so is a great way to earn yourself some negative press. Protecting your business’ reputation is important, but not at the expense of your employees’ protected rights to freedom of expression.</p>
<h3>#5: Use Two-Factor Authentication for Login Credentials</h3>
<p>Whether the result of genuine “hacks” or simple carelessness across multiple accounts, this kind of snafu can be hugely damaging. That’s why you should consider using two-factor authentication for all social media services if available.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0292f189-a778-4b02-85ad-3ac85330462a" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/social-media-crisis-management-two-factor-authentication.png" alt="Social media crisis management two-factor authentication example illustration" width="741" height="333" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>An illustration of how two-factor authentication works, via </em><a href="https://www.google.com/landing/2step/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Google</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>In case you’re unfamiliar with two-factor authentication (also known as two-step verification), this security system requires that two distinct challenges be cleared before granting a user access to a social media account. This usually involves an initial credentials check for the correct username and password, followed by a secondary check that asks the user to enter a unique login code or access key to verify the identity of the user. This is often a secondary code that can be texted or emailed to registered account holders, which is then entered into the social media service in question.</p>
<p>Two-factor authentication is far from a silver bullet that will prevent your social media manager accidentally tweeting a personal tweet from your corporate account – but it <em>does</em> reduce the risk of it happening. It also significantly reduces the risk that your corporate social accounts will be hacked, and is among the easiest and most effective security solutions at your disposal.</p>
<h3>#6: Choose Your Battles Carefully</h3>
<p>As New Balance’s Matt LeBretton learned after voicing his support for Trump’s proposed agenda late last year, choosing sides in political battles can backfire spectacularly. However, these days, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to separate the political from the everyday, and even the most carefully curated social media brand or persona may find it impossible to remain on the fence indefinitely.</p>
<p>Whatever your personal or corporate politics may be, choosing your battles carefully is essential to surviving on social media. The <a href="https://twitter.com/slpng_giants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sleeping Giants movement</a>, which pressures well-known brands to cease advertising on websites promoting white supremacy and other odious political ideas, has demonstrated that people are willing to support brands and companies that take a stand against hatred and bigotry.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="03a016e1-b2d1-463f-b084-e7864a2543cd" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>A Facebook post published by outdoor apparel retailer Patagonia speaking<br />
out against Trump’s executive order shrinking the Bears Ears National Monument in<br />
southeastern Utah</em></p>
<p>Recently, the official Patagonia social media channels embarked on a well-publicized stand against the government’s plans to shrink protected national monuments and public lands across several western states, a move for which the company and its executive team received immense support. I’d wager Patagonia’s decision to weigh in on a hotly contested, crucially important political and environmental issue didn’t hurt sales or social engagement, either, but it doesn’t change the fact that a major nationwide outdoor apparel retailer chose to publicly and openly criticize the government on social media – a potentially disastrous decision that ultimately proved enormously popular with the general public and highlights the importance of <a href="/blog/ws/2017/02/08/brand-affinity-marketing">cohesive brand values</a> on social media.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember, however, that you can’t please everyone, all the time, and that choosing a side can and likely will result in upsetting at least some people. Regardless of how you choose to handle these situations, the procedures in place should be clearly and fully explained in your company’s social media guidebook.</p>
<h2>Grace Under Pressure</h2>
<p>Few things in today’s business environment are as stressful or potentially damaging as a full-scale social media crisis. Fortunately, the tips and techniques above can help you get in front of these situations before doing untold damage to your company or reputation, but it’s important to take as many precautionary measures as you can to minimize confusion as social media emergencies develop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many businesses advertise on a city- and area-wide basis, but for some advertisers, this isn’t nearly local enough.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hyperlocal-marketing-header1.jpg" alt="Hyperlocal marketing " width="800" height="373" /></div>
<p>Like crime-fighting detectives in police procedurals triangulating a perp’s cell signal with technology of questionable credibility, some advertisers home in on areas of just a few blocks – or even a few streets – to find new customers.</p>
<p>These “hyperlocal” advertisers aren’t unwittingly sabotaging themselves, or focusing too narrowly; they’re targeting prospective customers right where they are – at home, at work, at local stores in their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll be taking an in-depth look at hyperlocal marketing. We’ll examine what hyperlocal marketing is, why it can be so effective, and most importantly, how you can do it across your paid search and paid social campaigns.</p>
<h2>What Is Hyperlocal Marketing?</h2>
<p>Hyperlocal marketing is the process of targeting prospective customers in a highly specific, geographically restricted area, sometimes just a few blocks or streets, often with the intention of targeting people conducting “near me” searches on their mobile device.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever found yourself looking for a very specific type of business when you’re out and about, you’ve probably already conducted a hyperlocal search.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you’re looking for a copy of a new book. You visit the nearest bookstore, only to discover that they’re completely sold out. What do you do next? You take out your mobile device and conduct a near-me search for bookstores near your location. You already spent 20 minutes circling the block looking for a parking space, so you’re not exactly keen on getting back in the car and driving to another store – you want a bookstore you can walk to, right?</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hyperlocal-marketing-near-me-bookstore-search.jpg" alt="Hyperlocal marketing near-me bookstore search example" width="800" height="351" /></div>
<p>This is the essence of hyperlocal marketing in a nutshell.</p>
<h2>Why Launch a Hyperlocal Marketing Campaign?</h2>
<p>In terms of objectives, hyperlocal marketing’s primary purpose is to <a href="/blog/ws/2016/06/14/adwords-store-visit-conversions">drive foot traffic to physical locations</a> and capitalize on near-me searches, which have <a href="/blog/ws/2014/06/30/commercial-intent-keywords">strong commercial intent</a>.</p>
<p>Near-me searches have become immensely popular in recent years. Data from Google indicates that near-me searches grew in volume by 130% year-over-year between 2014 and 2015 alone, and since then, Google users are using near-me searches to find everything from post offices to New Year’s Eve fireworks celebrations.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hyperlocal-marketing-near-me-search-examples-nationwide.jpg" alt="Hyperlocal marketing near-me search examples nationwide google" width="757" height="390" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image via </em><em><a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/marketing-trends-year-in-search-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Think With Google</a></em></p>
<p>Although near-me searches remain popular, advances in search technology are shaping how users search for businesses near them.</p>
<p>Many users now expect local search results to take precedence over wider results, even when they do not explicitly state they’re looking for local results. <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/data-gallery/detail/qualifier-location-local-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data from Google</a> suggests that local searches without “near me” or other location qualifiers (such as zip codes or city names) have grown 150% faster than searches including “near me,” revealing that <strong>many users now expect Google to automatically take their location into account when serving results</strong>.</p>
<p>Take the figure below, for example. This graph shows search volume for restaurant-related search queries between 2015 and 2017. As you can see, search volume actually increased for <a href="/blog/ws/2017/03/03/food-advertising">restaurant-related searches</a>, but the same searches that included zip code location qualifiers actually declined during this period:</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hyperlocal-marketing-restaurant-searches-over-time.jpg" alt="Hyperlocal marketing restaurant searches with and without zipcodes google" width="700" height="437" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image/data via </em><em><a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/local-search-mobile-search-micro-moments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a></em></p>
<p>This may not sound that remarkable at first glance, but it represents a seismic shift in consumer attitudes towards real-time geolocation tracking and how location data can be used to provide more relevant, accurate results for a wide range of search queries. Not only has interest in <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/search-marketing/6-questions-about-local-search-marketing-answered">local search</a> increased significantly, but more users now expect their location to affect their results automatically.</p>
<p>Just as search technology is changing the ways in which we search for and interact with local businesses online, so too is consumer behavior shaping search technology. We identified “research online, purchase offline” – also known as ROPO – as one of <a href="/blog/ws/2018/01/10/ecommerce-trends">the biggest ecommerce trends to watch this year</a>, and this will likely drive further interest in and demand for locally focused search results over time.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hyperlocal-marketing-ropo-research-online-purchase-offline.png" alt="Hyperlocal marketing ROPO research online purchase offline" width="800" height="499" /></div>
<p>The popularity of hyperlocal marketing has risen in tandem with the increase in near-me searches observed during the past several years. However, greater adoption of mobile devices is not the only factor that has driven interest in location-based search results over the past few years.</p>
<p>Google itself has been shaping local search in a very intentional way for some time, prioritizing fewer, higher-quality Google Maps results for near-me searches and offering “near me” suggestions in the “Searches related to…” recommendations at the bottom of the SERP. On some results pages – <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/01/22/google-maps-explore-recommendations-come-to-desktop-search-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including desktop searches as of last year</a> – Google has even begun providing additional results in a “Discover more places” section of the SERP, a feature that was formerly limited to Maps results on mobile.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hyperlocal-marketing-google-discover-more-places.jpg" alt="Hyperlocal marketing Google SERP Discover more places" width="694" height="361" /></div>
<p>The combination of widespread mobile device adoption and Google’s heightened emphasis on local search have made hyperlocal marketing a very effective way of attracting new customers to your physical store.</p>
<h2>What Ranking Signals Matter Most for Hyperlocal Search Results?</h2>
<p>As with anything to do with SEO, there are very few things we truly know for certain when it comes to ranking signals for hyperlocal searches. We do, however, know that several specific factors are very important.</p>
<h3>A Comprehensive Google My Business Listing</h3>
<p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/13/local-search-marketing">maximizing visibility in local search results</a>, one of the most important steps you can take is to ensure you have as comprehensive a Google My Business listing as possible.</p>
<p>Google My Business listings – formerly known as Google Places – are where Google sources most of the information it serves to users in local searches and Google Maps results. This includes many of the details that appear in <a href="https://localiq.com/products/listings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listings</a> of individual businesses in Maps results, such as opening hours and address, as well as the cool little Knowledge Graph-style data points such as when a business is busiest.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hyperlocal-marketing-google-busiest-store-hours-knowledge-graph.jpg" alt="Hyperlocal marketing Google Knowledge Graph store busiest times graph result" width="443" height="286" /></div>
<p>If your site offers third-party services such as reservations through OpenTable or menu listings through SinglePlatform, this information will also be displayed here, as you can see in the listing for South End Buttery, a delightfully charming café located not far from WordStream’s offices:</p>

<h3>Customer Reviews</h3>
<p>Many small-business owners know how effective <a href="/blog/ws/2014/06/26/word-of-mouth-marketing">word-of-mouth marketing</a> can be. When it comes to hyperlocal marketing, reviews and customer testimonials can be among the most effective tools at your disposal.</p>
<p>Think about the last time you searched for a local business. Did you follow up your initial search by <a href="/blog/ws/2013/07/22/yelp-reviews">checking out the reviews</a>? I’d wager you did, especially if you were looking for a new restaurant or take-out place, for example. Well, if you check out the reviews of local businesses before making the decision to shop there, you can be sure that your customers are doing exactly the same thing.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hyperlocal-marketing-funny-customer-review.png" alt="Hyperlocal marketing funny customer amazon review example" width="771" height="260" /></div>
<p>Customer reviews are believed to be one of the most important ranking signals in <a href="/blog/ws/2016/11/02/local-business-marketing-tips">local SEO</a>, which makes them crucially important if you’re going the hyperlocal route.</p>
<p>According to Moz’s <a href="https://moz.com/local-search-ranking-factors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2017 Local Search Ranking Factors report</a>, review signals are believed to account for approximately 13% of how Google decides to display local search results in the “Local Pack” results, the small list of businesses displayed beneath the Maps result in some searches:</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hyperlocal-marketing-local-pack-ranking-factors-moz.jpg" alt="Hyperlocal marketing Local Pack ranking factors Moz" width="800" height="426" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Data via </em><a href="https://moz.com/local-search-ranking-factors" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Moz 2017 Local Search Ranking Factors report</em></a></p>
<h3>Distance</h3>
<p>You could be forgiven for assuming that distance is a strong ranking signal for hyperlocal SEO, and you’d be right – most of the time, at least.</p>
<p>Going back to Moz’s data, we can see that My Business signals – ranking signals indexed by crawling a Google My Business listing for data such as categorization, keyword relevance, and user reviews – account for almost one-fifth of how Google prioritizes local search results:</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hyperlocal-marketing-my-business-signals-moz.jpg" alt="Hyperlocal marketing Google My Business ranking signals Moz" width="436" height="511" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image/data via </em><em><a href="https://moz.com/local-search-ranking-factors">Moz</a></em></p>
<p>It’s worth noting that proximity – the distance between the user and a local business – is also considered a My Business ranking signal. However, this is where things get a little complicated.</p>
<p>For one, it appears that Google sometimes prefers to serve users local results in clusters if possible, even if other more relevant businesses are closer to the user’s physical location at the time of the search, according to research conducted by Darren Shaw in <a href="https://moz.com/blog/proximity-to-searcher-is-new-top-local-search-ranking-factor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fascinating blog post for Moz</a>.</p>
<p>However, this doesn’t hold true all the time, either. As Darren and his team observed, sometimes Google will display a shorter local pack of results – with only two businesses listed rather than three – if the location of a relevant business is determined to be too far from the user, even if more businesses are located within the proximity of the searcher.</p>
<p>This raises questions of how proximity interacts with other ranking signals – such as the quality of a business’ My Business listing – in local results. This can be complicated even further by additional considerations such as an individual’s search history, social ranking signals such as share count, previous purchasing behavior, and potentially dozens of other factors.</p>
<p>Then there’s the matter of <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=9,558,210.PN.&amp;OS=PN/9,558,210&amp;RS=PN/9,558,210" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this patent</a>, which was quietly filed by Google in January 2017, which appears to describe a system that determines the quality of a location-based search result based on distance and expected travel time, which seems to suggest a move toward even greater weight to proximity in local searches, if such a system isn’t already in place.</p>
<p>In short, proximity is likely to remain an important ranking signal in hyperlocal SEO, but as with everything else with trying to stay one step ahead of Google, your mileage may vary.</p>
<h2>How Do I Set Up a Hyperlocal Marketing Campaign?</h2>
<p>As hyperlocal marketing focuses on limiting ads to a highly specific geographical area, the settings we’re most interested in are <a href="/blog/ws/2013/11/13/adwords-geotargeting-local-ppc-guide">our geolocation settings</a>. We’ll also be taking a look at our keywords, as well as our options for hyperlocal social marketing.</p>
<h3>Hyperlocal Marketing in Google Ads</h3>
<p>To get started with hyperlocal marketing in Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords), we want to make sure our geolocation settings are configured correctly.</p>
<p>To do this, we’re going to navigate to the Campaigns tab within your Google Ads account, select the campaign you want to modify, then click “Settings”. From here, click the downward chevron in the Locations tab, then select “Advanced search.”</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hyperlocal-marketing-adwords-geolocation-settings-1.jpg" alt="Hyperlocal marketing AdWords geolocation settings radius targeting" width="800" height="297" /></div>
<p>Now, click “Radius targeting”:</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hyperlocal-marketing-adwords-geolocation-settings-2.jpg" alt="Hyperlocal marketing AdWords geolocation settings radius targeting" width="1031" height="549" /></div>
<p>All you have to do now is decide on the central point of your radius targeting. Most companies would use the physical location of their store as their central point, for example. You can do this by entering the address of your radius’ center directly into the search field in the radius targeting dialog box.</p>
<p>In the example above, I entered the zip code for WordStream’s offices to serve as the center of our radius, and kept the default distance of 20 miles.</p>
<p>While this might work for some businesses, it’s not nearly precise enough for a hyperlocal campaign. No, we need to be much more restrictive – why don’t we try a one-mile radius around the office?</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hyperlocal-marketing-adwords-geolocation-settings-3.jpg" alt="Hyperlocal marketing AdWords geolocation settings radius targeting" width="1026" height="544" /></div>
<p>To edit the radius from your central point, simply hover over a targeted location in the list, click the pencil icon to edit the target radius, then save your changes.</p>
<p>As you can see in our example, now we’re looking at a much smaller area for our hypothetical campaign. We’ve covered the entirety of Boston’s Back Bay, most of the South End, and we’re grazing Fenway to the west and Beacon Hill to the northeast. Much better!</p>
<p>We could specify an even smaller radius if we wanted to, simply by using kilometers instead of miles:</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hyperlocal-marketing-adwords-geolocation-settings-4.jpg" alt="Hyperlocal marketing AdWords geolocation settings radius targeting kilometers" width="1029" height="545" /></div>
<p>We’re off to a great start with our tight geolocation radius targeting, but that alone isn’t enough – you also need to think about your keywords and the intent of the people who may be searching for products or services like yours.</p>
<p>Using our targeted location radius settings above as an example, we’re now looking at individual <em>neighborhoods</em>, not entire cities or metropolitan areas. Already, this gives us a great starting point for our hyperlocal keyword research. For example, a plumber conducting a hyperlocal campaign may want to bid on “plumber back bay” or “emergency plumber shawmut” as keywords if they’re trying to attract more business from these two neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Conversely, this approach can also help you identify <a href="/blog/ws/2014/03/04/negative-keyword-list">negative keywords</a> to exclude from your campaigns. If our hypothetical advertiser were using the 1-kilometer radius settings above, it wouldn’t make much sense to bid on keywords like “plumber kenmore” or “24 hour plumber beacon hill” since both these areas are beyond the radius of our hyperlocal campaign.</p>
<p>Obviously, you’ll want to target relevant keywords including “near me” in your hyperlocal campaign. Note that this should be <em>in addition</em> to your locally focused keywords, such as the potential ideas above.</p>
<p>Just as you would with any campaign, you should use <a href="/blog/ws/2017/11/09/competitor-keywords">dedicated keyword research tools</a> to discover new keywords that could be suitable for near-me searches.</p>
<h3>Hyperlocal Marketing in Facebook Ads</h3>
<p>There are few hard and fast rules concerning hyperlocal social (HyLoSo?) marketing, but there are several things you can do to narrow the focus of your Facebook ads to target motivated prospects who are actively looking for businesses like yours.</p>
<h3>Local Awareness Ads</h3>
<p>There are several highly effective – and pretty cool – ways to <a href="/blog/ws/2016/06/27/facebook-ad-targeting-options-infographic">target prospective customers with Facebook Ads</a>, and one of the easiest is Local Awareness ads. This ad format was introduced back in 2014 and is aimed squarely at local businesses seeking to raise awareness of their physical location and drive foot traffic to stores.</p>
<p>Getting started with Local Awareness ads couldn’t be easier. Simply select this ad format from the list of ad formats in the Ads Create tool, then enter the address of your business. (Note: you won’t need to manually enter the address if this information is included on your official business Page.)</p>
<p>Next, you’ll see a visual representation of the coverage area of your Local Awareness ad, which can be expanded or reduced by selecting the desired radius in the drop-down menu to the right of the address field:</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hyperlocal-marketing-facebook-local-awareness-ad-radius.png" alt="Hyperlocal marketing Facebook Location Awareness ad example" width="619" height="482" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image via </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/facebook-local-awareness" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Facebook</em></a></p>
<p>As you can see, you can adjust other settings in this dialog box, including the age range and gender of the custom audience you wish to target. This is the point at which you’ll also specify your daily budget and the duration that your Local Awareness ad should run for. Once all this information has been entered, Facebook will provide you with an estimate of the potential reach of your ad.</p>
<h3>Local Insights</h3>
<p>One of the most useful tools that Facebook offers hyperlocal advertisers is Local Insights. This data can be invaluable to hyperlocal social advertisers, as it connects some of the most urgent dots in a hyperlocal campaign – namely, whether the right people in the right place are seeing the right ads at the right time.</p>
<p>Accessible from the Page Insights report, the Local Insights report offers advertisers a fascinating glimpse into just how well their local ads are performing.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hyperlocal-marketing-facebook-local-insights.png" alt="Hyperlocal marketing Facebook Local Insights report" width="676" height="477" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image via </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/local-awareness-updates" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Facebook</em></a></p>
<p>As you can see in the figure above, we can adjust our settings within Local Insights to provide more information about our campaign. We can set the time range to one week, one month, or one quarter, and we can specify a distance of 50 meters, 150 meters, or 500 meters to establish our baseline report, which is displayed below the map.</p>
<p>Local Insights keeps everything nice and simple. We can see a handy graph that shows the number of people nearby our local business – i.e. every Facebook user who entered the specified radius around our location – as well as the busiest day of the week and busiest time of day. We’re also provided with a percentage of people nearby our specified location who saw our ad, which we can see is roughly 29%. Not too shabby!</p>
<p>Like Google Analytics, Facebook’s Local Insights doesn’t offer specific figures, and only generalized, anonymized data is shown. It’s also worth noting that Local Insights only collects data on users who have Location Services enabled within the Facebook app on their mobile device (located under Privacy &gt; Location Services), so although it’s definitely useful, it’s not terribly precise or even necessarily truly representative.</p>
<h3>Refining Audience Segmentation by Location</h3>
<p>Our final tip for creating hyperlocal campaigns in Facebook Ads concerns <a href="/blog/ws/2015/10/20/facebook-audience">Facebook’s incredibly granular targeting options</a> – specifically, those relating to Location.</p>
<p>Let’s say we’re running a hyperlocal campaign using the Store Visits campaign objective. We want to target people within a certain distance of our store, so we’re going to use Business Location targeting. This allows us to target custom audience segments around our target location. We can enter the address of our location manually, or drop a pin on the map to get started.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hyperlocal-marketing-facebook-radius-targeting.png" alt="Hyperlocal marketing Facebook radius targeting " width="554" height="388" /></div>
<p>From here, we can start tweaking our settings. In the figure above, we can see that the radius around the specified location can be adjusted using numerical values or the slider, and that we can specify that the ad should include neighboring cities around our location or only the city in which our business is located, which can help keep ad copy uniform and relevant across larger areas.</p>
<p>There are several caveats to bear in mind when using radius targeting in Facebook Ads. The first is that radius targeting does not span country borders. This means that if you were trying to advertise to Facebook users within a 10-mile radius of Detroit, Michigan, for example, you’d have to either create a separate targeting radius for your Canadian prospects in neighboring Windsor, or accept that your targeting radius will only encompass and target individuals within U.S. territory.</p>
<p>The next thing to bear in mind about Facebook’s radius targeting is that the minimum and maximum targeting radius available to advertisers varies depending on the type of location. In some instances, you can specify a targeting radius as small as one mile, whereas other advertisers may have to cast their nets a little wider.</p>
<p>Also, as infuriatingly unintuitive as it may be, you cannot use radius targeting for specific zip or postal codes. If you want to target users within specific zip codes, Facebook’s targeting area will be indicated by a polygonal shape on the map, rather than a circular radius, which can be adjusted to encompass specific streets within a zip or postal code.</p>
<h3>Refining Audience Segmentation by Individual</h3>
<p>Once we’ve established the perimeter of our hyperlocal campaign in Facebook, we need to determine the kinds of people we want to target within that area. Facebook provides several broad options in this category:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone in that location: This option targets every single eligible Facebook user within the specified targeting radius, including people who update their status at that location (including entire cities) as well as individuals that Facebook determines are within the specified radius based on device-based location data.</li>
<li>People who live in a location: This option is ideal for small businesses hoping to attract new and repeat customers who live within the specified location. In addition to the information provided by Facebook users on their profiles, this option also includes people determined to be living in a specific area based on other data including device location.</li>
</ul>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hyperlocal-marketing-facebook-ads-radius-targeting.png" alt="Hyperlocal marketing Facebook Ads target people by where they live" width="609" height="450" /></div>
<ul>
<li>People who recently visited a location: This option includes every eligible Facebook user whose most recent location falls within the specified target area. This includes people who live in the specified area as well as visitors, tourists, and other non-residents.</li>
<li>People traveling to and within a location: This option targets all eligible Facebook users within the specified location who are at least 125 miles from their home city or location according to the data on their Facebook profile.</li>
</ul>
<p>By combining the audience segmentation options above with our radius targeting parameters, we can begin to really drill down into specific neighborhoods to reach new customers with our products and services.</p>

<p>Few industries can boast such a bright future, which makes looking forward to what’s next in the world of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/25/facebook-ecommerce">ecommerce</a> all the more exciting. Today, we’ll be taking a look at seven of the most significant and potentially disruptive <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/04/ecommerce-statistics">ecommerce trends</a> that marketers and consumers alike can expect in 2018.</p>
<p>We’ll be examining the current state of each of these areas, as well as taking a speculative look forward for the rest of the year to see what <a href="/blog/ws/2017/12/20/swot-analysis">opportunities – and challenges</a> – ecommerce retailers are likely to encounter in 2018.</p>
<h2>1. Faster Shipping and Better Delivery Logistics</h2>
<p>Looking beyond the idiosyncrasies of specific ecommerce platforms, one of the very few remaining genuine differentiators in the ecommerce sector is that of shipping times and delivery logistics.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2017/09/11/amazon-advertising">Amazon</a> is the indisputable king of ecommerce delivery, and seems poised to remain on its throne for the foreseeable future. Amazon is notoriously secretive when it comes to specific figures, but<a href="https://www.amazon.com/primeinsider/best-of-prime-2017.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> an infographic</a> recently published by the ecommerce giant states that Amazon shipped more than 5 BILLION items worldwide via Amazon Prime’s free one- or two-day shipping in 2017. Even more interesting is the data on Amazon’s fastest deliveries – just eight minutes for a forehead thermometer, and just nine minutes for five pints of ice cream.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>In 2018, we can expect Amazon and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/16/compete-with-amazon-ebay">other ecommerce retailers</a> step up their logistics game.</p>
<p>With more than 8,000 Amazon Prime members currently living in areas offering Amazon Now’s one-hour(!) delivery service – and Amazon’s plans to expand the service even further this year – reducing the time between click and delivery is likely to become one of the bloodiest fights on the ecommerce battlefield this year. Combined with other emerging technologies such as <a href="https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mercedes-benz/innovation/the-long-haul-truck-of-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">driverless freight</a> envisioned by automotive companies such as Mercedes-Benz, logistical improvements will drive (get it?) the ecommerce sector forward this year.</p>
<h2>2. Greater Integration of AI and Machine Learning</h2>
<p>Given the appetite for <a href="/blog/ws/2017/07/28/machine-learning-applications">machine learning technologies</a> in Silicon Valley and beyond, it’s inevitable that the ecommerce sector will continue to be disrupted by greater integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning technology in 2018.</p>
<p>Machine learning has already been integrated into many ecommerce systems, from product recommendation engines to improved search functionality. However, 2018 will see a dramatic increase in the applications of these technologies, allowing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/02/ecommerce-seo">ecommerce retailers</a> to offer customers exactly what they want in less time with less effort.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="95ca6b0c-49a0-4a10-8645-0a11b844e34b" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>One technological area of ecommerce that has already seen remarkable advances in both sophistication and adoption has been the rise of <a href="/blog/ws/2017/10/04/chatbots">the customer service chatbot</a>, and we’ll likely see continued development of these “conversational agents” in 2018.</p>
<p>These applications will become increasingly helpful and will be able to handle a more complex range of tasks, from problem resolution to assisted transactional functionality. Facebook has already offered some retailers access to new chatbot tools that allow conversational agents within Facebook Messenger <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/payments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to handle payments directly within the app</a>, without forcing users to process their transaction on another site.</p>
<p>Product recommendations are also poised to become even more accurate and helpful thanks to machine learning technologies. We’ll see a move away from <a href="/keywords">keyword</a>-based recommendations to systems that factor in a wider range of signals, from product purchase histories to thematically and semantically related products and greater personalization of results based on consumers’ shopping preferences.</p>

</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image via </em><em><a href="http://vibetrace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vibetrace</a></em></p>
<p>Advertisers can also expect to see greater adoption of machine learning within Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords) and other <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/11/ecommerce-ppc">online advertising platforms</a>. Systems such as <a href="/blog/ws/2015/12/15/adwords-smart-goals">Smart Goals</a> and Smart Bidding will become, well, smarter and more accurate, and it’s likely that more advertisers will turn to these tools as a way to maximize the impact of their campaigns – albeit in an opaque way.</p>
<h2>3. Augmented Reality Inches Closer to the Mainstream</h2>
<p>Until very recently, nascent augmented reality technologies have been largely novelties – think Snapchat filters rather than <a href="/blog/ws/2014/05/21/google-glass-sweepstakes">the glittering future once promised by Google Glass</a> and the like. However, this year will see AR tech take a giant stride forward toward true mainstream adoption, with ecommerce businesses leading the way.</p>
<p>Many leading retailers have been refining their AR offerings for some time, and the results have been striking. Everybody’s favorite Swedish furniture retailer IKEA debuted <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/about_ikea/newsitem/091217_IKEA_Launches_IKEA_Place" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its Place app</a> late last year, which allows you to see how various IKEA products would look in your home. Although early versions of the app were a little buggy (particularly in smaller dwellings with limited floor space), newer iterations are reportedly much more stable and intuitive.</p>
<p>Of course, IKEA isn’t the only player in the ecommerce space vying for a slice of the augmented reality pie. Amazon’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=17403032011" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AR View app</a> offers similar functionality, allowing shoppers to see how thousands of products would look in their home without committing to a purchase.</p>

</div>

</div>
<p>Expect to see competition in the ecommerce AR space to intensify throughout 2018.</p>
<h2>4. Explosive Growth in Mobile Checkout and IoT</h2>
<p>No list of anticipated ecommerce trends would be complete without the almost-obligatory mention of the continued meteoric rise of mobile – specifically, mobile checkout and payment systems, and the continued rise of internet-connected devices.</p>
<p>Mobile payment has been one of the most dramatic changes to the way people shop since the advent of ecommerce itself. Growth of the mobile payment market has increased steadily year-on-year since 2015, and there are at least 10 different mobile payment platforms available today, including mainstays like Apple Pay and Google Pay (the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/8/16863220/google-pay-consolidation-android-chrome-online-app-payments-announced" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently announced merger of Google Wallet and Android Pay</a>), as well as proprietary offerings from banks including Chase and Softbank. (Oh, and don’t forget everyone’s favorite cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.) As we move farther away from cash, it seems inevitable that we’ll see continued adoption and development of mobile payment systems throughout the year and beyond.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="b62936c9-60bc-4e12-89d0-8f5674be1297" data-langcode="en">

<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image/data via </em><em><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/384921/digital-payment-methods-retail-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statista</a></em></p>
<p>However, that’s not to say there aren’t significant challenges to be overcome in the mobile payments space. According to <a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-01-proceed-checkout-mobile.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent study</a> published by researchers at the University of East Anglia in England, although mobile accounted for 46% of all ecommerce transactions in Q2 2016, mobile conversion rates lag behind desktop conversion rates significantly due to consumer trepidation about mobile shopping, revealing that retailers still have much to do to sway the hearts and minds of their prospects.</p>
<p>Another closely related ecommerce trend that will (unfortunately) gain even greater traction in 2018 is the Internet of Things, or IoT. Contrary to every natural instinct, many companies seem locked in a frantic battle to see who can claim the title of Most Ridiculous Connected Device. So far, we’ve seen “smart” <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/icon-smart-condom-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">condoms</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/01/04/griffin-connects-your-toast-to-your-phone/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toasters</a>, <a href="https://www.rollscout.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom fixtures</a>, and <a href="https://thenextweb.com/gadgets/2016/01/30/welp/#.tnw_rfoFVIN7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even luggage</a>, and we haven’t hit bottom yet.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="aaf6d330-7ae1-4784-9076-fdb93eeb1caa" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Aside from serving as a reminder that not everything can (or should) be “smart,” this trend should also remind us that everything that can connect to the internet can serve as another point-of-sale system, a fact that will doom us to the kind of dreary dystopian future in which even our toasters and refrigerators mock us with annoying ads and special offers.</p>
<h2>5. Voice Search Everywhere</h2>
<p>These days, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to talk about mobile without mentioning <a href="/blog/ws/2017/03/14/google-voice-search">voice search</a>. In 2018, voice will be one of the leading drivers of innovation in the ecommerce space – and not just on mobile.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="67d93963-4dfd-414b-bdf8-bbad1975fe2f" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ecommerce-trends-2018-smart-appliance-sales-graph.png" alt="Ecommerce trends for 2018 Adobe Insights smart device appliance sales figures graph" width="1122" height="642" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image/data via </em><em><a href="http://www.cmo.com/adobe-digital-insights/articles/2017/6/21/voice-assistants-poised-to-be-the-next-tech-disruptor.html#gs.l=Eo1fk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Digital Insights</a></em></p>
<p>Adoption of smart home appliances such as Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home units has been a major driver of voice search, particularly in the ecommerce space. Data from Walker Sands Digital indicates that <a href="https://www.walkersands.com/Futureofretail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost one-quarter of consumers (24%) own a voice-controlled smart appliance</a> such as an Amazon Echo or Google Home, and a further 20% plan to purchase one in the coming year. Use of these devices to complete purchases has also grown, with 19% of consumers having used their smart appliance to make a purchase, and a further 33% of consumers planning to do so in 2018.</p>
<p>Voice search, particularly in the smart speaker market, isn’t just a neat trick or the novelty <em>du jour</em>; it’s the next stage of customer loyalty. According to data from equities securities research firm Consumer Research Intelligence Partners, consumers that use their Echo to make purchases <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/06/amazon-alexa-customers-buy-more.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are among Amazon’s most loyal customers</a>, spending an average of $1,600 per year compared to the $1,300 per-year average of Prime customers, a figure 66% higher than the average Amazon customer spends in a year.</p>
<p>Sales completed via Amazon Echo units also provided retailers with numerous upsell opportunities, with upsell rates of more than 60% observed among some product lines.</p>
<h2>6. The Rise of ROPO</h2>
<p>ROPO – Research Online, Purchase Offline – has been an observable consumer shopping habit for some time, driven largely by thrifty shoppers and eagle-eyed bargain hunters looking for the best possible deal. In 2018, we can expect to see a great deal more ROPO in the ecommerce sector.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="eee083f9-82cb-43e6-a009-2d11825d66a2" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image/data via </em><em><a href="http://www.bazaarvoice.com/robo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bazaarvoice</a></em></p>
<p>ROPO isn’t just the natural evolution of thrifty shopping in today’s digital world – it’s the culmination of the last 15 years of online shopping technology. Consumers like to research products online before making offline purchases because it empowers them to find the products they want at the best possible price, but to retailers, ROPO represents <a href="/blog/ws/2016/10/21/calculate-roi-offline-transactions">offline conversion tracking</a> at its most effective.</p>
<p>According to Montreal-based ecommerce agency Absolunet, <a href="http://10ecommercetrends.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">82% of consumers use their mobile devices to research local businesses</a>, and 18% of local searches results in a sale within 24 hours. By leveraging a range of techniques and metrics, such as mobile payment data, CRM and point-of-sale systems, geolocation tracking, consumer shopping history, social integration, and increasingly personalized advertising experiences, retailers can build incredibly detailed profiles of shoppers who conduct online research before making offline purchases throughout every stage of the customer journey.</p>
<p>British clothing retailer Matalan, for example, discovered that every £1 it spent on Google Ads resulted in £46 of sale revenue, £31 of which was in-store.</p>
<h2>7. More Storefront Apps</h2>
<p>With so much focus shifting from desktop to mobile, ecommerce shopping will be further transformed this year by storefront apps. Many major retailers have offered apps for several years, and shoppers are already well-accustomed to using dedicated storefront apps to browse and shop from their mobile devices. However, 2018 will see more smaller businesses leverage storefront apps to drive sales and, perhaps even more importantly, customer loyalty.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="7cfef2e2-fb1a-4e17-935e-fd4a1353e371" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ecommerce-trends-2018-storefront-apps.png" alt="Ecommerce trends for 2018 storefront apps" width="1200" height="836" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image via </em><em><a href="https://cobaltapps.com/dynamik-skins/storefront/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cobalt Apps</a></em></p>
<p>Data from ecommerce app platform Poq indicates that conversion rates among dedicated storefront apps are <a href="https://poqcommerce.com/app-commerce/2017/05/4-key-platform-stats-in-q1-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approximately 40% higher than those of mobile sites</a>, making the development of such apps a tempting proposition to many retailers. In addition, the average session duration and average order value (AOV) are both significantly higher using storefront apps than mobile sites, which suggests that dedicated apps are likely to become increasingly prevalent throughout the year.</p>
<p>The <a href="/blog/ws/2015/01/02/learn-to-code-free">barriers to entry for app development</a> have never been lower, meaning that even locally focused, family owned businesses can offer customers dedicated apps – and we’re going to see a lot more of this in 2018.</p>
<p>What trends do you think we’ll see in the ecommerce space this year?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These days, social media feels less like an idle distraction and more like an endurance blood sport.

<p>There is, however, some good news. Not every social media account is a Russian botnet or sock puppet (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/02/tech/social-media/facebook-fake-accounts/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only about 100 million of them</a>), and <strong>some of the world’s leading nonprofits use social media to great effect </strong>in their mission to make the world a better place.</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll be taking a look at several nonprofits that are making the most of social media in their work, as well as some tips and best practices for your own nonprofit social media campaigns.</p>
<h2>8 Examples of Nonprofits Using Social Media for a Good Cause</h2>
<h3>#1: Amnesty International</h3>
<p>Since its inception in London in 1961, <a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amnesty International</a> has tackled some of the world’s most urgent social problems and fought to protect the world’s most vulnerable people. Amnesty International works across a range of areas, including the fight to end the use of child soldiers, sex trafficking and human slavery, protecting human rights in war-torn nations, the movement to abolish capital punishment, and many others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>Although much of Amnesty International’s work is bleak and deals with the very worst crimes against humanity, the organization uses social media masterfully. The organization maintains highly active profiles across all major social media networks (including <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/amnesty-international" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tumblr</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@amnestyusa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medium</a>), and despite the shocking nature of Amnesty International’s work, it doesn’t rely on shock-and-awe tactics to motivate people to act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/social-media-for-nonprofits-amnesty-international-twitter.jpg" alt="Social media for nonprofits Amnesty International Twitter" width="800" height="332" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Amnesty International’s <a href="https://twitter.com/amnestyusa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter profile</a> is particularly powerful. With almost 4 million followers, Amnesty International uses Twitter to raise awareness of ongoing campaigns and urgent social issues. The organization’s social media content in general emphasizes education over all else, and uses <a href="/blog/ws/2017/01/05/social-media-marketing-statistics">statistics and research data</a> to highlight how severe many of the problems the organization deals with really are.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>Amnesty’s use of <a href="/blog/ws/2015/01/13/infographic-templates">infographics</a> and bite-sized charts are perfect for social media, and also encourage sharing due to their often highly emotional nature.</p>
<h3>#2: National Audubon Society</h3>
<p>Named in honor of renowned ornithologist John James Audubon, the <a href="http://www.audubon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Audubon Society</a> works tirelessly to protect the world’s birds. Incorporated in 1905, the National Audubon Society is comprised of almost 500 local chapters across the United States, and each individual chapter is an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit. Although any of the local chapters could serve as an example of how to use social media for good, we’ll be focusing on the National Audubon Society’s social media presence.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>The National Audubon Society’s social media profiles are all deserving of recognition, but <a href="https://www.instagram.com/audubonsociety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its Instagram profile</a> is particularly noteworthy. With almost 215,000 followers, the National Audubon Society’s Instagram feed is a visual feast for amateur birdwatchers and professional ornithologists alike. The photography featured throughout the Society’s Instagram feed is superb, rivaling the kinds of images you’d expect to see in renowned periodicals such as National Geographic.</p>
<p>The Audubon Society’s <a href="https://twitter.com/audubonsociety" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter profile</a> may only have roughly half the followers its Instagram profile has, but it knows how to leverage the strengths of each platform to great effect.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>Although many of the Society’s tweets are accompanied by beautiful images of America’s birds, the Society takes a more hands-on approach on Twitter, offering a wide variety of tips for birdwatchers, fun activities like how to build seasonal birdhouses for migratory species, and ways to get involved with bird conservation and habitat protection at the local level.</p>
<h3>#3: The Fight for 15</h3>
<p>According to data from the National Low Income Housing Coalition, there are precisely zero places in the entirety of the United States in which a single person living alone can afford a two-bedroom apartment on a minimum-wage income, and roughly 12 counties in which minimum-wage earners can afford a one-bedroom apartment. This is among the many reasons that minimum-wage workers across the country have joined forces to fight for a fair wage as part of <a href="https://fightfor15.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Fight for 15 campaign</a>, which advocates for a nationwide minimum wage of $15 per hour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although Fight for 15 is a movement rather than a “true” nonprofit organization, its social media presence is more than worthy of inclusion in this round-up given how effectively the movement has leveraged social media to advance its cause and raise awareness of and support for this crucial issue.</p>
<p>Much of Fight for 15’s work has been the result of grassroots labor organizing, and social media has been instrumental in these efforts. The movement’s <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmt_qZpt_XAhXhhOAKHZXHDdgQFggoMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FFightfor15%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw0hcyJdCu8DYtrI1h23oCye" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook page</a> regularly serves as a rallying call for people who want to lend their voices to this increasingly visible and rapidly growing movement. Aside from its obvious uses as a communication platform and organizing tool, Facebook has also provided Fight for 15 with ample opportunities to inform and educate a wider audience about crucial social issues such as job insecurity.</p>
<p>Interestingly, <a href="https://twitter.com/fightfor15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fight for 15’s Twitter profile</a> has leveraged positive sentiment very successfully. We know that <a href="/blog/ws/2015/11/09/emotional-ads">negative emotional triggers</a> are often highly effective at driving engagement with social media content and ads alike, but it’s not often that positive emotional triggers are used in the same way – or with the same results.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>Fight for 15 regularly spreads labor rights news from across the country, and shares success stories and legislative victories as it did when Target announced it would increase its minimum wage for all its 323,000 employees to $15 per hour by 2020. The movement has also leveraged its 41,000 Twitter following by sharing content from and working with other organizations such as the AFL-CIO.</p>
<h3>#4: Beyond Coal</h3>
<p>Despite low (and falling) costs, overwhelming public support, and the potential to create millions of jobs worldwide, renewable energy is still taking a backseat to coal – but not if Beyond Coal can help it.</p>
<p>Beyond Coal is <a href="https://content.sierraclub.org/coal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a project of the Sierra Club</a>, one of America and the world’s oldest environmental organizations, and aims to encourage the use of renewable energy with a view to eliminating our reliance on coal altogether. The organization operates in partnership with <a href="https://beyond-coal.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a sister campaign in Europe</a> to spread its message on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="45d54e48-5c9a-4cd1-bcbc-40a864d623e8" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/social-media-for-nonprofits-beyond-coal.jpg" alt="Social media for nonprofits Beyond Coal Sierra Club homepage" width="800" height="377" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Like many of the nonprofits mentioned here, Beyond Coal makes excellent use of primarily visual assets in its social media campaigns, such as infographics and charts. This kind of content is perfect for platforms like Twitter, as it allows users to quickly and easily understand often-complex legislative issues surrounding fossil fuel use, as well as visualize just how serious our reliance on fossil fuels really is.</p>
<p>Beyond Coal’s mission is predominantly one of education; unless you have a coal fire in your home, there aren’t many opportunities to personally reduce your coal consumption (aside from being mindful of <a href="https://www.nature.org/greenliving/carboncalculator/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your personal carbon footprint</a> in general). That said, it’s amazing how many people have no idea how much of our electrical power comes from coal-fired power plants, and the immense environmental impact coal burning has.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="d1c399f0-c376-499c-b9ee-236aa083e16e" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>For these reasons, much of the community engagement with Beyond Coal consists of sharing petitions, highlighting the policies of major political parties and individual politicians that have an impact on the use of coal, and other sustainability-focused content.</p>
<h3>#5: CARE International</h3>
<p>Poverty is a complex social problem with dozens of potential underlying causes. This is what makes fighting poverty so difficult; with so many other interrelated factors to consider, it can be tough to know what to focus on and when. Fortunately, <a href="https://www.care-international.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CARE International</a> is a nonprofit that is tackling poverty – and its underlying causes – head on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="4bb05ab0-bc4e-4ba4-a022-5d295e0c8ffa" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>CARE International is, as its name implies, a global organization that works in some of the world’s poorest countries. This allows CARE to offer its social media followers a wide range of content from a diverse array of places.</p>
<p>One element of CARE’s social media presence that really stands out is the organization’s commitment to helping girls and women around the world. Women are often impacted much more significantly by poverty due to institutional prejudice in many countries, which is why CARE highlights this vital work across its various social channels.</p>
<p>CARE is still building its social audience on some platforms, having <a href="https://twitter.com/CAREGlobal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only joined Twitter</a> in 2013. CARE’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/careorg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram profile</a>, however, is a lot livelier. With significantly more followers, CARE’s Instagram feed (cleverly) focuses on the real people it works to protect and help, making it easier for CARE’s social audience to connect with the human side of the organization’s work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="ef88d19a-80fb-4337-89c9-dc2264285230" data-langcode="en">

</div>
<p>It also reveals a lot about the lives of people around the world who are struggling with poverty and shines a light on issues that are all too easy to overlook in our media-saturated environment.</p>
<h3>#6: Human Rights Watch</h3>
<p>All over the world, particularly in developing nations, the human rights of the poorest and most vulnerable are routinely violated. From the illegal detention and torture of prisoners to young women and girls sold into sexual slavery, human rights violations are rampant, and getting worse in many parts of the world. That’s what makes the work of nonprofit <a href="https://www.hrw.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Human Rights Watch</a> so vital.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>HRW is another global organization with a wide range of focus areas. Most recently, HRW has been actively involved in raising awareness of and support for some of the world’s most vulnerable populations, including Rohingya Muslims fleeing genocide in Burma, the innocent victims of the Philippines’ “war on drugs,” and the millions of people who have been made refugees by the intensifying effects of climate change.</p>
<p>HRW uses social media to great effect in its numerous campaigns. With almost 4 million <a href="https://twitter.com/hrw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> followers, HRW offers fascinating and urgent insights into the world’s worst human rights violations, including domestic issues in the United States that typically receive little or no mainstream media coverage, such as the shocking prevalence of child marriage across the U.S.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>HRW’s YouTube channel is also an excellent example of how video can simplify complex policy issues for a wider audience, and HRW often incorporates animation and other techniques to diversify its social content.</p>
<h3>#7: To Write Love on Her Arms</h3>
<p>Despite its urgency as a public health issue, few people are willing to openly discuss mental health problems due to social taboos and the pervasive stigma associated with mental illness. Even fewer people are willing to talk about or even acknowledge self-harm. <a href="https://twloha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">To Write Love on Her Arms</a> (TWLOHA), a nonprofit based in Florida that aims to serve as a bridge between people struggling with self-harm and mental health professionals who can provide vital help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="b2e11195-8308-4918-b6c3-39a35a60b107" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>TWLOHA is extremely active on a variety of social media platforms. The organization has <a href="https://twitter.com/twloha" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a modest following on Twitter</a>, but has a significantly larger audience on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/twloha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/twloha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pinterest</a>.</p>
<p>Much of the social content published by TWLOHA focuses on the stories of real people who have personally struggled with and overcome self-harm, as well as inspirational messages for the millions of people still suffering from mental health problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="8c360ac2-0c57-4184-a734-8fd13a425a7c" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Sharing these stories is more than just a strategy to raise awareness of a vitally urgent social and public health problem – it’s a way to remind people struggling with mental illness and self-harm that they are not alone, that there is hope, and that they can reach out to people who understand. For some, this could quite literally make the difference between life and death, a powerful demonstration of how social media can be used for good.</p>
<h3>#8: The Trevor Project</h3>
<p>Suicide is the leading cause of death among young people aged 10-24, and LGBTQ youth are almost five times as likely to have attempted suicide than their heterosexual counterparts. These shocking statistics are among the many sobering figures available at the website of <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Trevor Project</a>, a nonprofit focused on providing crisis intervention and suicide prevention services to at-risk LGBTQ youths between the ages of 13-24.</p>
<p>The Trevor Project was established in 1998 by the creators of <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/about/history-film/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Academy Award-winning short film Trevor</a>. Since then, the organization has grown significantly and remains one of the most active LGBTQ advocacy nonprofits in the U.S.</p>

<p>Although The Trevor Project has a strong presence on both <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjO96a2qN_XAhUmY98KHfwYDskQFggoMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FTheTrevorProject%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw3n3H-AoGL56i1IWJiu28nT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TrevorProject" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>, the organization’s <a href="http://thetrevorproject.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tumblr account</a> is particularly interesting. Featuring predominantly <a href="/blog/ws/2014/04/28/user-generated-content">user-generated content</a>, The Trevor Project’s Tumblr page has dozens of stories from LGBTQ youth who have struggled with mental health problems and suicidal thoughts, as well as words of encouragement and inspirational stories of overcoming adversity in their communities.</p>
<h2>Social Media for Nonprofits: 6 Tips and Best Practices</h2>
<p>So, now that we’ve seen a few nonprofits in action on social media, it’s time to look at some broader tips and best practices that can help your nonprofit reach a wider audience on social media.</p>
<h3>#1: Tread Carefully with Controversial Messaging</h3>
<p>For people working to solve some of society’s most urgent problems and injustices, it can be frustrating to encounter so much apathy or indifference from the general public. This can lead to posting content that’s overly aggressive, forceful, or intimidating. While negative emotional triggers can be a powerfully persuasive tool to get people to take action, it can also deter potential supporters from joining your cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="9dfa619d-4278-48fa-ac8a-2e4325a42ad0" data-langcode="en">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Ensure your social content balances shock tactics with care and discretion.<br />

<p>When devising your social media content strategy, it’s important to balance negative information with educational content. Too much negativity can <a href="/blog/ws/2017/11/15/website-copy">harm perceptions of your nonprofit</a> or the cause you’re working to advance, so take care to ensure there’s a balance of content intended to spur people into action and more informational, educational content to raise support for your cause.</p>
<h3>#2: Foster a Strong Sense of Community</h3>
<p>Nonprofits rely on crucial support from their followers, donors, and supporters. However, the need to create a strong sense of community online isn’t just a necessity from a fundraising perspective – it’s also vital to growing your audience and maximizing visibility of your cause.</p>
<p>As we saw in several of the nonprofits profiled above, social media is arguably the most effective way for nonprofits to build their base and reach new potential supporters. And one of the best ways to foster a strong sense of community is to actively solicit and publish stories from your nonprofit’s supporters, followers, and fans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Think of it in terms of the ways in which commercial brands engage their followers on social media. Rather than highlighting brand evangelists’ love for your products, you’ll be sharing the stories of people whose lives have been affected by the issues your nonprofit is working to improve. If you opt to go the user-generated content route in your community building efforts, be sure to get permission before sharing the accounts and experiences of your followers before posting anything.</p>

<h3>#3: Use High-Quality Imagery in Your Posts</h3>
<p>Numerous data tells us that the inclusion of images in your content <a href="/blog/ws/2017/06/01/high-converting-landing-page-images">can boost engagement significantly</a>, which is why this should be a cornerstone of your social media strategy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="012b8998-d2d5-4ac4-8c2f-c8e5715a6f51" data-langcode="en">

<p><em>Image/data via </em><a href="https://coschedule.com/blog/visual-content-for-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>CoSchedule</em></a></p>
<p>However, using high-quality imagery in your social content isn’t just about improving engagement – it’s about providing a crucial glimpse into the very real lives of the people you’re trying to help. Several of the nonprofits featured above focus primarily on visual content, and while text-based content definitely shouldn’t be overlooked, opting for a more visual approach can boost engagement and put real faces to real problems.</p>
<h3>#4: Focus on Platforms That Deliver Results</h3>
<p>A common mistake that many organizations make – and not just nonprofits – is spreading themselves too thin or trying to cover too much ground. Even with a dedicated full-time social media team, it’s not always easy or even advisable to try and maintain active social media profiles on all social media sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="bcf02f9e-be44-4bab-9918-258ac53443d2" data-langcode="en">

<p><em>Evaluate your social performance regularly to ensure you’re working<br />
toward tangible gains. Image via </em><a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/facebook-insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Buffer</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Take some of the nonprofits above, for example. Although many of these organizations do have profiles on all the major social platforms, it’s obvious that some are significantly more effective than others. For this reason, it’s important to focus on the platforms that offer the greatest return, whether that’s in terms of engagement, conversions, or both.</p>
<p>For example, it might not make much sense to maintain a YouTube channel if your nonprofit only produces <a href="/blog/ws/2017/09/15/video-content-marketing">video content</a> periodically, or to spend too much time on Twitter if your Facebook presence delivers stronger engagement.</p>
<p>Use your resources wisely and be sure to take a data-driven approach to determining how and where to focus your social media strategy.</p>
<h3>#5: Leverage Paid Promotional Tools</h3>
<p>Social media is an amazingly powerful way to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/10/nonprofit-marketing-tactics">market your nonprofit</a>, helping you to reach new audiences and rally support for your cause. Unfortunately, as many marketers have noticed in recent years, the landscape of social media content has shifted from primarily organic to a “pay to play” model in which <a href="/blog/ws/2017/11/22/combine-ppc-with-social-media">paid promotion has become increasingly necessary</a>.</p>

<p><em>The most infamous chart in social media. Image/data via </em><a href="https://social.ogilvy.com/facebook-zero-considering-life-after-the-demise-of-organic-reach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>social@Ogilvy</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>It’s no secret that organic reach on Facebook has plummeted in recent years, forcing many marketers to evaluate their content strategies. Although regularly publishing <a href="/blog/ws/2017/03/15/quality-content-defined">high-quality organic content</a> across your social channels is incredibly important, it’s worth considering how paid promotion can help you achieve your goals.</p>
<p>Before committing to spending money on <a href="/blog/ws/2016/07/28/content-advertising">content promotion</a> or social advertising, you should carefully evaluate the strengths and relative return of each platform. It’s also important to choose a platform that aligns closely with the business objectives of your campaign. If you want to drive conversions, <a href="/blog/ws/2016/06/27/facebook-ad-targeting-options-infographic">Facebook’s myriad targeting options</a> and relatively low costs may make it a strong, reliable contender for your next paid campaign, whereas if you’re looking for relatively cheap impressions to drive greater awareness, <a href="/blog/ws/2016/12/14/why-use-twitter-ads">Twitter Ads</a> may be worth exploring.</p>
<h3>#6: Test – Then Test Again</h3>
<p>I know, I know – it seems as though <a href="/blog/ws/2015/06/16/ab-testing-tips">we’re always telling you to A/B test everything</a>, but with so much competition vying for attention on social, it’s <em>that</em> important.</p>
<p>A/B testing your social content isn’t just vital if you want to increase your conversion rate; it’s also crucial for determining the best angle to take if your nonprofit works in a controversial vertical, such as animal rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="f8f9b687-c1f4-4b83-851d-3b12d22776cb" data-langcode="en">

<p><em>A sledgehammer isn’t always the right tool for the job. Image via </em><a href="https://www.mediaite.com/online/petas-most-controversial-publicity-stunts/#0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>PETA/Mediaite</em></a>.</p>
<p>Take PETA, for example. PETA is arguably better known for its vociferous, often tone-deaf activism as it is for championing the cause of animal rights. Whether intentional or otherwise, this polarizing aspect of PETA as an organization serves as a valuable lesson in testing your social content to ensure the messaging is really resonating with your audience – in the right ways.</p>
<p>Of course, A/B testing your social creative is also important from a conversions standpoint. Many nonprofits have little choice but to work with modest promotional budgets, and some organizations literally cannot afford to waste ad spend, impressions, or clicks on ads that don’t advance their mission. It might take more time to thoroughly test your social content, but it could make a world of difference further down the line.</p>
<h2>Good Campaigns, Good Causes</h2>
<p>Nonprofits face unique challenges, especially when it comes to social media. Hopefully the examples and tips above have given you some ideas on how to spread the word about the work your organization is doing and how to get even more people excited about making a difference.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kurt Vonnegut, one of the heavyweights of 20th century literature, once said that every single sentence of a story should either reveal something about a character or advance the action.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/website-copy-header-11.jpg" alt="website copy tips" width="800" height="533" /></div>
<p>You might not be crafting traditional narratives on your website, but Vonnegut’s timeless advice still holds true whether you’re helping people learn a new skill or selling plumbing fixtures.</p>
<p>Every single line of copy on your website should help your visitors accomplish or learn something, and in this post, I’ll show you seven ways to write more engaging, compelling website copy.</p>
<p>These tips and techniques aren’t specific to any one particular type of website, so whether you’re in ecommerce or run a nonprofit, or whether you have a complex or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/31/basic-website">basic website</a>, there’s something here for everyone.</p>
<h2>1. Emphasize Benefits Over Features</h2>
<p>One of the most common mistakes companies make with their web copy is spending too much time talking about how great they are. While it’s understandable to want to highlight the accomplishments, distinctions, and aspects of your organization that make it great, this is not why your visitors came to your site.</p>
<p>We’ve said it before, but I’ll say it again – <strong>people don’t care about your company, they only care about how your company can solve their problems.</strong></p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/website-copy-i-dont-care.jpg" alt="Website copy I don't care rainbow illustration" width="504" height="315" /></div>
<p>That’s not to say that <em>none</em> of your visitors care about your company. Some, like <a href="/blog/ws/2017/02/24/brand-advocacy-paid-social">your fiercely loyal brand evangelists</a>, may in fact care about your company quite deeply. That doesn’t change the fact that most visitors are looking for a solution to a very real problem.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at <a href="/blog/ws/2017/02/21/features-vs-benefits">the differences between benefit-driven copy and feature-driven copy</a>.</p>
<h3>Feature-Driven Copy</h3>
<p>The screenshot below was taken from the Infinity website.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/website-copy-infiniti-features-example.png" alt="Website copy Infinity rear parking sensor illustration" width="1004" height="610" /></div>
<p>As you can see, this particular page tells the reader about Infiniti’s rear-view camera and proximity sensor technology, and features several high-resolution images showing this tech in action.</p>
<p>This is all well and good, but the copy – and the overall framing – doesn’t mention any benefits explicitly. You could argue that the benefits of this technology are obvious or implied; having a 360-degree field of vision around the entirety of the vehicle will definitely make parallel parking easier, but the copy doesn’t <em>tell</em> us that; we’re left to <em>assume</em> what the benefits of these features are.</p>
<h3>Benefit-Driven Copy</h3>
<p>The screenshot below is taken from Slack’s website.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/website-copy-slack-benefits-example.jpg" alt="Website copy Slack benefits illustration" width="800" height="415" /></div>
<p>As a communications platform, Slack could have focused on the bells and whistles that people like about Slack, such as private chat rooms, emoji responses, and the service’s many integrations. However, Slack knows that its ideal customers aren’t interested in that – at least, not as much. No, Slack’s potential users want to save time and hassle, which is why Slack’s primarily benefit-driven copy is so <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/13/persuasive-ads">persuasive</a>. Who wouldn’t want to receive almost 50% fewer emails or spend 25% less time in meetings?</p>
<p>By leading with the benefits, Slack is answering the user’s most important question – <em>how will this make my life better or easier?</em></p>
<p>Emphasizing the benefits of your products or services doesn’t stop you from mentioning features completely – it’s just a simple matter of priorities. By all means include copy that tells visitors how great your products are, but don’t do so at the expense of explaining clearly and concisely why using your products or services will make visitors’ lives better.</p>
<h3>How this improves your website copy</h3>
<p>By showing visitors exactly how your offerings will make their lives better.</p>
<h2>2. Use The Voice of the Customer</h2>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2014/07/31/brand-voice">Tone and style</a> are crucial when it comes to website copy, as they define the voice of your brand across multiple channels. However, as important as style and tone can be in establishing and maintaining editorial consistency, we can take it one step further to serve as a powerfully persuasive way to reach prospective customers with your copy, known as the “voice of the customer.”</p>
<h3>What Is the Voice of the Customer?</h3>
<p>As Brad McMillen explains in <a href="/blog/ws/2014/09/11/voice-of-the-customer">his excellent primer on the technique</a>, the voice of the customer is a technique commonly used in market research, which “focuses on customers’ (and prospects’) wants and needs, then prioritizes them into a hierarchical structure before prioritizing them in terms of relative importance and satisfaction with current alternatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Simply put, VOC is a way to describe your customers’ experiences with and expectations for your products or services in their own language.</p>
<p>What does this mean? Let’s take a look.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/website-copy-freshbooks-voice-of-the-customer.jpg" alt="Website copy FreshBooks voice of the customer example" width="800" height="453" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>An example of web copy written using the voice of the customer.</em></p>
<p>You can find examples of your customers&#8217; real language in a number of different ways; for example, reading customer reviews and conducting surveys are two of the best ways to gather this data, as they provide customers with ample opportunity to tell you about their problems in their own words.</p>
<p>Before we can <a href="/blog/ws/2014/09/18/beginners-guide-to-target-markets">create a profile</a> to begin crafting our voice of the customer, we need to identify several key data points, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The problems that frustrate people who could benefit from your products or services</li>
<li>What they would like to see as a potential solution</li>
<li>Customer desires and expectations for companies like yours</li>
<li>Powerful or <a href="/blog/ws/2017/07/19/customer-testimonial-examples">memorable quotes based on actual user experiences</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Identifying common pain points should be among the first things to look for in your customer research data. This likely includes the frustrations that are common in your industry; think labyrinthine automated customer service helplines, hidden fees or opaque pricing structures, lack of competition, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Following on from this, you should identify the things your customers want in a company or service provider like yours, such as responsive customer assistance from an actual person, or a simple, easily understood pricing structure.</p>
<p>Once you have this data, you can write copy that addresses each of these elements in order of importance. All the information on your site – from <a href="/blog/ws/2016/05/27/guide-to-about-us-pages">your About page</a> to <a href="/blog/ws/2017/09/07/ecommerce-sales-product-pages">individual product descriptions</a> – should address one of the dimensions you identified in your market research. This means that, wherever a user happens to be on your site (or within <a href="/blog/ws/2016/12/06/sales-funnel-stages">the traditional marketing funnel</a>), your copy is speaking to something that your prospective users have identified as a priority for them.</p>
<p>In the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/14/website-examples"> website example</a> above from FreshBooks, the copy mirrors common customer pain points, such as the time-intensive nature of some bookkeeping workflows, as well as the solution that these customers want, which is simplified, streamlined accounting software that lets them get on with actually running their business.</p>
<h3>How this improves your website copy</h3>
<p>By showing visitors your speak their language, you&#8217;re on their level, and you understand their problems.</p>
<h2>3. Conduct Customer Surveys to Determine Brand Values</h2>
<p>These days, many companies have jumped firmly on the “corporate values” bandwagon in an attempt to attract top talent. However, brand values aren’t just what you <em>say</em> they are – they’re just as much a byproduct of how your customers and audience views your business. How can you discover what values people associate with your brand? By conducting customer surveys.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/website-copy-survey-concept-illustration.jpg" alt="Website copy customer survey illustration" width="800" height="450" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image via </em><a href="https://www.lynda.com/Business-Skills-tutorials/Using-Customer-Surveys-Improve-Service/191341-2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Lynda.com</em></a></p>
<p>Similar to the market research you conducted to gather data to create the voice of the customer, <a href="/blog/ws/2014/11/10/best-online-survey-tools">surveys and questionnaires</a> are an excellent way to learn how people perceive your brand with regard to brand values. Just as there is often a considerable disconnect between how we <em>think</em> users behave and how they <em>actually</em> behave, there can sometimes be a similar gap between the brand values you think your company exemplifies and how prospective customers actually see your company.</p>
<p>At the heart of this process is a concept known as “brand attributes.” This refers to the characteristics that people associate with your brand. For example, philanthropy and charitable giving is a brand attribute of companies that have embraced <a href="/blog/ws/2017/09/20/ethical-marketing">ethical marketing</a>, such as TOMS shoes. Similarly, glamour and opulence are brand attributes commonly associated with brands such as Rolex or Swarovski.</p>

<h3>Conducting Brand Value Research</h3>
<p>One of the greatest challenges of conducting brand value research is that it is primarily qualitative, meaning that the responses necessary to create this kind of profile are often much more in-depth and personal to the person taking the survey. Quantitative research, on the other hand, usually relies on larger data sets often involving standardized questions, typically presented as yes/no or agree/disagree scenarios or multiple choice questions.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/website-copy-qualitative-research-concept.jpg" alt="Website copy qualitative research concept illustration" width="600" height="298" /></div>
<p>This presents both a challenge and an opportunity. Although this type of qualitative research can be tremendously valuable, it’s also significantly more time-consuming to gather than quantitative research data, and it asks a great deal more of your respondents. To offset this, many companies offer incentives such as discounts, coupons, freebies, and other goodies to tempt people into completing these surveys.</p>
<p>However you decide to structure your questionnaires, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t just ask respondents which brands they like – ask them <em>why</em> they like those brands</li>
<li>Invite participants to explain how their perceive those brands and the characteristics they share</li>
<li>Ask speculative questions about not only the brand attributes your audience already associates with your brand, but the attributes they <em>want</em> to associate with your brand in the future</li>
<li>Embrace negative feedback – it can be just as valuable (if not more so) than positive feedback</li>
<li>Ask open-ended questions that give respondents ample opportunity to answer</li>
</ul>
<h3>A Real-World Brand Values Case Study</h3>
<p>Fortunately for you, WordStream recently conducted this research for our own use, so I can show you exactly what this process looks like.</p>
<p>We asked respondents to select five brand attributes that they associate with the WordStream brand. Here’s what they told us:</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/website-copy-wordstream-brand-attributes.png" alt="Website copy WordStream brand attributes" width="502" height="441" /></div>
<p>As you can see, the top five attributes respondents associated with WordStream are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledgeable</li>
<li>Helpful</li>
<li>Educational</li>
<li>Influential</li>
<li>Friendly</li>
</ul>
<p>This data was not only immensely useful to us, but also very rewarding. Our aim is to make digital marketing and PPC accessible to businesses of all sizes – small businesses in particular – by providing valuable, actionable, and insightful content. The participants’ responses tell us that we’re succeeding in this goal, which is awesome.</p>
<p>We didn’t stop there, however. We also asked participants which attributes they want to associate with the WordStream brand in the future:</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/website-copy-wordstream-desired-brand-attributes.png" alt="Website copy WordStream desired brand attributes" width="515" height="443" /></div>
<p>This is almost as revealing as our initial results. Based on these responses, we know that the top five brand attributes people want to associate with WordStream in the future are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creative</li>
<li>Trustworthy</li>
<li>Influential</li>
<li>Helpful</li>
<li>Friendly/Educational</li>
</ul>
<p>This tells us several things. For one, people want to see WordStream as a creative brand; we like to think we’re on our way, but it’s clear we still have room to improve. Secondly, <a href="/blog/ws/2017/03/27/trust-signals">trust remains a highly desirable brand attribute</a>, and it’s one that we’re constantly striving to cultivate. Finally, this data tells us that what we’re doing is working and that we need to not only diversify and branch out into more creative avenues, but also that we need to continue to develop the influential, helpful, and friendly/educational brand values people already associate with the WordStream brand.</p>
<p>In just two slides of actual audience response data, we’ve gained incredible insight into how our audience perceives us, highlighting how useful and actionable this kind of market research data can be.</p>
<h3>How this improves your website copy</h3>
<p>By ensuring that your writers reflect the brand values that your valued customers want to see on your site.</p>
<h2>4. Create a House Style Guide to Establish Brand Voice</h2>
<p>You’ve probably heard of news agencies such as The Associated Press, or AP. The AP began as a newswire service, meaning that it provided newspapers around the world with syndicated news content produced in part by regional reporters known as stringers who work exclusively for news agencies rather than newspapers themselves.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/website-copy-ap-style-tweet.jpg" alt="Website copy AP style headline with corrections" width="599" height="253" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>TFW an Associated Press story doesn’t adhere to AP style.</em></p>
<p>Since the AP was founded long before the advent of online content, space in newspapers was (and still is) at a premium, meaning no space – typically measured in column inches – could be wasted. This necessary brevity resulted in the creation of <a href="https://www.apstylebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the AP Stylebook</a>, a bible for journalists and copyeditors alike that states how certain things should be written and formatted.</p>
<p>Of course, your own brand style guide doesn&#8217;t need to be as detailed as the style guides that newspapers use. Instead, you want to use the brand values you established in the last exercise to create some guidelines for all your content writers and creators to follow. This can help them make decisions like how formal to be, and whether it&#8217;s ever OK to swear (say, on your blog).</p>
<h3>Getting Started with an In-House Style Guide</h3>
<p>The first thing you need to do when creating an in-house style guide is to meet with your editorial team and relevant stakeholders and identify the priorities to be addressed by the style guide.</p>
<p>Voice and tone have an incredible impact on the entire experience of using your site, so it’s important to settle on an appropriate brand voice for your company that aligns with the business goals of your copy and content.</p>
<p><a href="https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MailChimp has a particularly good in-house style guide</a> that covers a range of content types including technical documentation, social media content, general copy, and also features <a href="https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/voice-and-tone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a section dedicated to voice and tone</a>. For example, it includes this list of guidelines for how to nail the MailChimp voice:</p>
<p><em>One way to think of our voice is to compare what it is to what it isn’t. MailChimp’s voice is:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fun but not silly</em></li>
<li><em>Confident but not cocky</em></li>
<li><em>Smart but not stodgy</em></li>
<li><em>Informal but not sloppy</em></li>
<li><em>Helpful but not overbearing</em></li>
<li><em>Expert but not bossy</em></li>
<li><em>Weird but not inappropriate</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This is an excellent resource for marketers hoping to create their own style guides, and should give you an idea of the kind of things a solid style guide should cover.</p>
<h3>How this improves your website copy</h3>
<p>By establishing brand standards that all your writers can reference for a consistent user experience.</p>
<h2>5. A/B Test Copy on High-Value Pages</h2>
<p>Nobody knows your customers better than you do, but that doesn’t mean you should gamble by making decisions based on how you think your visitors will behave. Just as you would (or should) <a href="/blog/ws/2015/06/16/ab-testing-tips">test crucial elements of your campaigns</a> such as landing pages, you should be regularly A/B testing the copy on your highest-value pages.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/website-copy-ab-test-concept.jpg" alt="Website copy A/B test concept" width="640" height="400" /></div>
<h3>Not All Copy Is Created Equal</h3>
<p>Before we go any further, it’s important to mention that even if you have the resources to do so, it’s probably unnecessary to A/B test every single word of copy on your site – you just need to focus on the pages that really bring home the bacon. Maybe your product overview page has a killer conversion rate, or maybe it’s your FAQ page or product documentation. Whatever your strongest pages are, those are the pages you should be testing.</p>
<p>Some web copy elements you might want to test could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Questions versus statements in headlines</li>
<li>Headline length</li>
<li>Short-form versus long-form copy</li>
<li>Language and/or word choice (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/22/power-words">power words</a> anyone?)</li>
<li>Points of view (i.e. first-person versus third-person)</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually <a href="/blog/ws/2014/03/27/ab-tests">conducting an A/B test on your web copy</a> is largely similar to the way you’d split-test pretty much anything else. Begin by identifying those high-value pages <a href="/blog/ws/2014/05/15/google-analytics-tips">using Google Analytics</a> or similar data, then create two versions of the page, each with its own unique copy. Send approximately 50% of your total traffic to the control version of the page (the original page as it exists today), and send the other half to the variant (the page with the new copy). Allow the test sufficient time to ensure you’re working with a statistically significant data set, and see which page converted better. Easy, right? Well, kinda.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/website-copy-ab-test-concept-2.png" alt="Website copy A/B test concept" width="1260" height="716" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image via </em><em><a href="https://vwo.com/features/">VWO</a>.</em></p>
<p>Since you want to figure out which copy performs more strongly, you need to test copy that actually asks the user to do something. This could be a prompt to download a guide, sign up for a free trial, subscribe to a newsletter – some kind of <a href="/blog/ws/2016/03/07/call-to-action-marketing">clearly defined call to action</a>. If you don’t focus on actionable copy with a true call to action, it’s harder to determine if the variant of your copy is any better than the control page. However, since your highest-value pages are likely already associated with a defined conversion pathway, this shouldn’t be an issue but it’s worth bearing in mind.</p>
<h3>How this improves your website copy</h3>
<p>By giving you data, rather than assumptions, on what copy really resonates with potential buyers.</p>
<h2>6. Think About Intent At All Times and Write From the Perspective of the User</h2>
<p>We’ve talked about <a href="/blog/ws/2014/06/30/commercial-intent-keywords">commercial intent</a> before (as well as the wider topic of <a href="/blog/ws/2016/01/26/intent-marketing">intent marketing</a>), but it amazes me how few websites seem to factor in user intent into their web copy.</p>
<h3>What Is User Intent?</h3>
<p>User intent refers to what a given person <em>intends</em> to do when they reach your site. Sometimes this intent leads to a clearly defined action – such as buying something – while other times it may not.</p>
<p>Although the underlying problems your users are trying to solve are likely quite diverse, there are only a few reasons a person visits a website. These align with one of the three primary types of search – informational, navigational, and transactional – and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>To learn about the industry in which your company operates</li>
<li>To learn more about service offerings in your industry</li>
<li>To learn more about your company in particular</li>
<li>To comparison shop and compare products, offers, prices etc.</li>
<li>To buy something</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, it’s impossible to account for every user’s intent in your web copy, and you definitely shouldn’t attempt to. However, considering user intent should inform every aspect of your web copy.</p>
<h3>How to Write Web Copy with User Intent in Mind</h3>
<p>Whether you’re writing the copy for <a href="https://localiq.com/products/websites-landing-pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your website</a> yourself or hiring someone to do it for you, it’s crucial that you consider user intent from the outset.</p>
<p>Picture yourself in your prospective customers’ shoes and ask questions about your copy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it immediately obvious what your company sells or does?</li>
<li>Is your web copy benefit-driven, and are those benefits clear?</li>
<li>Does your website assume prior industry knowledge on the part of the visitor? Is this knowledge necessary to understand and navigate your site?</li>
<li>Does your site’s navigation allow different kinds of users at different stages of the funnel to quickly and easily access the information they need?</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering user intent can be challenging, because it can be difficult to truly divorce yourself – and your considerable industry knowledge and expertise – from the reality of the experience of using your site. To this end, it may be worth conducting qualitative market research by asking laypersons who aren’t familiar with your business to use your site and provide feedback. This can highlight gaps in both your web copy and your awareness of these gaps, allowing you to craft web copy that better addresses these issues.</p>

<p>Writing from the perspective of the user, on the other hand, is a little easier than trying to preemptively solve for user intent. Whenever you’re writing any copy – or content – ask yourself whether your copy follows our variant of Vonnegut’s rule: does every single sentence of copy reveal some useful information about your products or services, or advance your visitors’ understanding of what you do?</p>
<p>Many people mistakenly assume that focusing on user intent or benefit-driven copy means there’s no room to talk about their company’s achievements. This isn’t true at all – you just have to consider where and when to wax lyrical about how great you are.</p>
<p>For example, if you’d never heard of a company and weren’t familiar with their goods, you probably wouldn’t care about how that company is a great place to work, or how many awards it has won – none of this information answers your questions or helps you solve your problems.</p>
<p>If, however, you’ve already done some research into the company, like its products, and can visualize how patronizing this company will make your life better – essentially at any point during or beyond <a href="/blog/ws/2017/04/04/nurture-marketing">the “consideration” stage of the classic sales funnel</a> – information about how great the company is might be a powerfully persuasive tool. <em>That’s</em> when you want to hit your visitors with your innumerable accolades.</p>
<p>It all comes back to thinking about the user and what <em>they</em> want, rather than what <em>you</em> want.</p>

<p>By giving your visitors what they want to see, increasing their satisfaction and encouraging them to stick around.</p>
<h2>7. Include Statistics, Quotes, and Original Data to Increase Your Site’s Authority</h2>
<p>Not so long ago, blogs and bloggers were rightly seen as amateur ventures whose passion and enthusiasm were faultless, but whose actual credibility and authority were suspect. Not so today, when some blogs and independent bloggers have become on par (or even surpassed) “traditional” journalism and media outlets.</p>
<p>However, the little guys still have to work harder than the bigger players, and one of the best things you can do to establish (or enhance) your credibility and authority is to use <a href="/blog/ws/2015/07/14/marketing-data">statistics, quotes, and original data</a> in your web copy and content.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/website-copy-wordstream-original-research.png" alt="Website copy WordStream original data" width="737" height="473" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>An example of WordStream’s original research data.</em></p>
<p>One of the reasons that the inclusion of statistics, quotes from industry experts, and original data is so persuasive is because it strengthens the points you make in your copy considerably. It’s one thing to make a vague assertion about, say, Facebook’s growing ad revenue, but it’s another thing to say that Facebook’s total revenue increased by 56% and <a href="/blog/ws/2017/01/05/social-media-marketing-statistics">ad revenue increased by 59% in 2016</a>.</p>
<p>This technique works so well because it’s an established journalistic convention, and readers expect this kind of citation in their content. However, it’s not without its downsides.</p>
<h3>The Dangers of Overreliance on Third-Party Data</h3>
<p>There is no doubt that including statistics, quotes, and original or third-party data in your copy can significantly increase the authority of your site. Overreliance on this kind of data, however, can have a detrimental effect.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/website-copy-how-many-citations-is-too-many.jpg" alt="Website copy how many citations is too many PhD comics" width="465" height="373" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Image via </em><a href="http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1821" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Jorge Cham/PhD Comics</em></a></p>
<p>You’ll already know what I’m talking about if you’ve ever read a blog post in which every other statement is cited or begins with, “According to…” Relying too heavily on cited stats – no matter how well-sourced or relevant – can dilute the authority of your copy because it suggests either an inability or reluctance to make an assertive, original statement. People don’t want to read copy or content that reads like a book report written by a nervous high-school student – they want to hear original thoughts and opinions that challenge their ideas or help them learn more about a topic.</p>
<p>One way to offset this without losing the authority that comes with including and correctly citing statistical data is to use original research. Here at WordStream, we devote a great deal of time and energy to producing <a href="/blog/ws/2016/02/29/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks">original data and research</a>. This isn’t just a ploy to increase our authority; it’s a way to reinforce our copy and content with research that other publications want to link to.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/website-copy-wordstream-original-research-2.png" alt="Website copy WordStream original data" width="643" height="392" /></div>
<p>Granted, creating original research requires sufficient data to draw from (which we’re lucky to have in abundance, something not every business has) or the financial means to commission professional researchers to produce original data, but as far as assets go, it’s hard to beat in terms of return on investment. Our original research has generated millions of unique visits and hundreds of inbound links over the past several years, making it one of our most consistently valuable and strongest-performing content assets.</p>
