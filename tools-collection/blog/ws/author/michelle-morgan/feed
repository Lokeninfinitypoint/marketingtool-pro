										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Performance Max campaigns are the farthest-reaching ads you can have on Google. In a single campaign, you can reach users on Google Search, Display, YouTube, Gmail, Discover, and Maps.</p>
<p>Advertisers using PMax can leverage many different types of assets that will be adjusted, combined, and reorganized to fit into each of the unique placements across those six channels. With that level of variability, it can be difficult to create compelling ads that fit into each place. Knowing what portion of an ad is going to show where, if you’re not already familiar with these ad placements, can be a challenge.</p>
<p>In this article, I&#8217;ll outline which assets from your ad unit can be used in which placements across the Google ecosystem so you’ll be able to create compelling ads that capture attention and convert.</p>

<h2>What does every PMax ad example include?</h2>
<p>Remember, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/performance-max" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PMax ads</a> shift and adapt to multiple placements that work best for your business. Check out the examples of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-audit-pmax-display-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all the possible PMax ad placements</a> below.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-placements.webp" alt="performance max placements" width="900" height="424" class="aligncenter wp-image-92109 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-placements.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-placements-480x226.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But what’s even more interesting is that not only can you reach all of these users in a single campaign, you can reach them in a single ad unit/asset group. Honestly, the ad builder is so large it’s impossible to get all of it in one screenshot, but the image below gives you a little taste of what’s in there.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-ad-builder.png" alt="pmax ad examples - performance max ad builder screenshot" width="750" height="631" class="aligncenter wp-image-95169 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-ad-builder.png 750w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-ad-builder-480x404.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>To give us a working vocabulary, let&#8217;s run through the asset types you can leverage in PMax asset group ad units and talk about what they are.</p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW112171623 BCX0"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW112171623 BCX0"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span></span>Are common Google Ads mistakes preventing your PMax campaigns from bringing in results?</strong> Find out, and learn how to fix them, with our free guide to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/google-ads-mistakes?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_googleadsmistakes_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six common (but costly) Google Ads mistakes</a>!</p>
<div id="pmax-ad-examples-brand-guidelines"></div>
<h3>Brand guidelines</h3>
<p>The first portion of the ad unit will be your <strong>brand guidelines</strong>. This helps you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/23/how-brand-your-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">control how your brand will look</a> across many different placements in the Google ecosystem. These controls are pretty self-explanatory.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-brand-guidelines.png" alt="pmax ad examples - brand guidelines" width="840" height="363" class="aligncenter wp-image-95170 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-brand-guidelines.png 840w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-brand-guidelines-480x207.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 840px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/08/business-name-ideas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business name</a> is required to run a PMax campaign. The only issue is that it can only be 25 characters long. This can be either the name of the business or your outward-facing brand name, but it needs to stick within that character limit.</p>
<p>Next are your logos. You can add up to five, but again, you need to stick within Google’s guidelines. They require only the square logo, but I encourage you to also upload the landscape version. It just looks so much better in some placements.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-logos.png" alt="pmax ad examples - brand logos" width="356" height="359" class="aligncenter wp-image-95166 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-logos.png 356w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-logos-297x300.png 297w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-logos-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px" /></p>
<p>Last will be some optional features you can use under the “more options” dropdown. Here, you can input custom color hex codes to ensure Google uses the exact right colors from your brand guidelines. This will come in really helpful for some placements where they regularly add in accent colors to make your ads stand out. There’s also a dropdown to customize the font used in your ads in case you want some control there as well. The list isn’t huge, but it’s nice to have some options to choose from.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-custom-brand-colors.png" alt="pmax ad examples - brand colors" width="801" height="387" class="aligncenter wp-image-95171 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-custom-brand-colors.png 801w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-custom-brand-colors-480x232.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 801px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="pmax-ad-examples-ad-assets"></div>
<h3>Ad level assets</h3>
<p>Next come the core ad unit assets. These will be the main foundation of the ad units, and all are featured in most ad units across the other campaign types.</p>
<h4>Text components</h4>
<p>These are all short snippets of text that will be combined to create the ad units.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Headlines: </strong>Up to 15 headlines, three are required, each with up to 30 characters.</li>
<li><strong>Long Headlines: </strong>Up to five long headlines, one required, with up to 90 characters.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Up to five descriptions, two required, with up to 90 characters.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/performance-max-ad-examples-copy.png" alt="pmax ad examples - ad text assets" width="594" height="857" class="aligncenter wp-image-95168 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/performance-max-ad-examples-copy.png 594w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/performance-max-ad-examples-copy-480x693.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 594px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Visual components</h4>
<p>These visual components will be used only in placements that require them and help you to<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-make-your-business-stand-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> stand out from the competition</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Images</strong>: Up to 20 images, but the minimum requirement is two (one square image and one landscape image).</li>
<li><strong>Videos</strong>: Up to five videos; zero are required, though. But as you can see, if you don’t provide a video, then Google will automatically create one for you using other assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these assets will be used and combined in all sorts of different combinations, which we’ll cover later on.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/performance-max-ad-example-images-videos.png" alt="pmax ad examples - image and video assets" width="731" height="415" class="aligncenter wp-image-95167 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/performance-max-ad-example-images-videos.png 731w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/performance-max-ad-example-images-videos-480x273.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 731px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="pmax-ad-examples-expanded-assets"></div>
<h3>Expanded assets</h3>
<p>As a side note, the naming convention in this section is confusing simply because Google insists on using “assets” all over the place. For those of you who have been around a while, you’ll recognize these<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-assets"> assets formerly known as ad extensions</a>. For those of you who are new, these are effectively other portions of your ad that are fundamentally different from the regular headlines, descriptions, videos, and images from above.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sitelinks</strong>: Additional links that operate as landing pages, combined with a short headline of 25 characters and up to two 30-character descriptions.</li>
<li><strong>Call to action:</strong> A short call to action message like “Learn More” or “Contact Us” that will accompany your ad. You can select your preference from a dropdown of provided options or select Automated to let Google choose the one it believes makes the most sense.</li>
<li><strong>Callouts</strong>: Short snippets of text, 25 characters or less, that provide additional context to your ads.</li>
<li><strong>Structured snippets</strong>: A short list of items accompanied by a header category selected from a dropdown.</li>
<li><strong>Promotions</strong>: Show off sales or discounts alongside your ad to create more interest.</li>
<li><strong>Prices</strong>: Highlight prices of specific products or services on your site.</li>
<li><strong>Locations</strong>: Show relevant, physical locations to your target audience based on your Google Business information.</li>
<li><strong>Calls</strong>: Advertisers have the option to add a phone number to help generate calls from ads.</li>
<li><strong>Lead forms</strong>: A customizable form hosted by Google that can collect user data just like a form on your landing page.</li>
<li><strong>Messages</strong>: A feature allowing users to send your company a message through WhatsApp rather than going through a more traditional landing page conversion route.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Performance Max ad examples by placement</h2>
<p>Now that we have all of the building blocks out of the way, let’s start to look at some PMax ad examples across each of the networks Google hosts, so you’ll have an idea of what your ads could look like.</p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW112171623 BCX0"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW112171623 BCX0"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span></span>PMax is an AI-powered campaign type, but did you know there are more ways to incorporate AI into your strategy?</strong> Download our free guide to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/ai-advertising?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_AIAdvertising_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 9 powerful ideas to use AI in Google and Facebook Ads</a>!</p>
<div id="pmax-ad-examples-search"></div>
<h3>Search</h3>
<p>More than likely, you’re already familiar with search ads on Google. Performance Max variants of those ads are pretty straightforward and mostly leverage the text components you provide in your asset group.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-pmax-ad-examples.webp" alt="google ads pmax ad examples - google search" width="717" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-95162 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-pmax-ad-examples.webp 717w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-pmax-ad-examples-480x402.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 717px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In the examples below, you can see the headlines and descriptions I’ve provided in all different combinations. Some have shorter versions of the ads, and some are longer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-pmax-ad-examples-serp.png" alt="pmax ad examples - search placement" width="756" height="629" class="aligncenter wp-image-95165 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-pmax-ad-examples-serp.png 756w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-pmax-ad-examples-serp-480x399.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 756px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Others have some of the assets we talked about earlier, and others don’t. They stick only to the text components.</p>
<p>While these ads do function very similarly to Responsive Search Ads, there is one big difference. Performance Max ads do not allow advertisers to pin assets into certain placements. Since these assets are used for all networks on Google, it doesn’t apply to all placements.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-headlines.png" alt="google ads pmax ad examples - ad headlines" width="721" height="499" class="aligncenter wp-image-95174 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-headlines.png 721w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-headlines-480x332.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 721px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>So when you’re writing your ads for Performance Max, keep the dynamism of RSAs in mind, but remember you don&#8217;t have the option to pin. All of these components can show in just about any combination, so it’s in your best interest to make sure all variants can combine with all other variants and still make a compelling ad.</p>
<div id="pmax-ad-examples-display"></div>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The display network variants for Performance Max ads have quite a wide range of spaces they can fit in. Because of that, there are lots of different examples we can look at to see how our same components will show up.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-dynamic.png" alt="pmax ad examples - display" width="821" height="337" class="aligncenter wp-image-95172 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-dynamic.png 821w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-dynamic-480x197.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 821px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>On mobile, ads can show with all different combinations of headlines, descriptions, images, and even videos.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-mobile.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - mobile" width="817" height="335" class="aligncenter wp-image-95175 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-mobile.webp 817w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-mobile-480x197.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 817px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Even in this next set, you can see that the colors of the ads are quite a bit different, and they include just one of the headlines in big text with small supporting text or the entirety of the video running with some surrounding text.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-dynamic-headlines.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - dynamic mobile search ads" width="964" height="394" class="aligncenter wp-image-95173 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-dynamic-headlines.webp 964w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-dynamic-headlines-480x196.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 964px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>When we get to the desktop examples, the ads look pretty similar, but they could show in either the top of the page&#8230;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-display.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - display desktop ads" width="604" height="398" class="aligncenter wp-image-95177 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-display.webp 604w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-display-480x316.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 604px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>&#8230; in between text, or&#8230;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-display-network.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - desktop display network" width="612" height="306" class="aligncenter wp-image-95157 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-display-network.webp 612w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-display-network-480x240.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 612px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>&#8230; on the right-hand rail.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-on-site.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - right hand rail" width="600" height="328" class="aligncenter wp-image-95156" /></p>
<p>As you can tell from the previews, these ads are going to show in placements where the user is engaging with a website external to Google. While search ads need to answer a user’s query, display ads need to capture their attention enough to make an impact. Providing assets to PMAX ads that are eye-catching and attention-grabbing will be very useful for the display placements.</p>
<div id="pmax-ad-examples-youtube"></div>
<h3>YouTube</h3>
<p>For each asset group, you can add up to five selected videos. But it’s important to know that all Performance Max ads will have video assets, even if you don’t include your own.</p>
<p>The message below that you&#8217;d see in the builder states that if you don’t provide your own videos, Google will make one for you with the image assets you provide. And let me tell you, those videos are…not super pretty. I highly encourage you to use your own compelling videos that follow the regular <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/15/youtube-algorithm">YouTube video best practices</a>.</p>

<p>Here are a few previews of what the YouTube placements will look like. Some use the image assets (which, yes, are cropped horribly in my examples), but others will use the videos. There are some with headlines and descriptions, others with long headlines.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-youtube.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - youtube placements" width="714" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-95160 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-youtube.webp 714w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-youtube-480x403.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 714px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-youtube-placements.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - youtube" width="737" height="616" class="aligncenter wp-image-95153 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-youtube-placements.webp 737w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-youtube-placements-480x401.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 737px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It’s important to note that some of these variants have the title of the video included as well, so be sure the videos you utilize will combine well with the text and image assets you leverage, or else you may end up with some inconsistent ads.</p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW168540966 BCX0"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW168540966 BCX0"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/26a1.png" alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span></span>PMax campaigns are just one strategy out of tons that SMBs are taking advantage of this year!</strong> Get the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/smb-marketing-trends-report/?cid=Web_LiQ_InContent_Guide_2026SmallBusinessMarketingTrendsReport_Download&amp;itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Small Business Marketing Trends Report for 2026</a> to find out what else beyond PMax you should be trying!</p>
<div id="pmax-ad-examples-discover"></div>
<h3>Discover</h3>
<p>Google Discover is likely one of the more unique placements for Performance Max ads, and if you don’t use the platform, this placement might seem a little mysterious to you.</p>
<p>Google Discover is a personalized content feed that proactively serves content on mobile devices in the Google app. This happens even before the user conducts a search and is based on their previous behaviors.</p>
<p>Using our same set of assets, here are a few looks at how a Performance Max can appear on Discover.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-discovery-ad-examples.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - discover" width="965" height="396" class="aligncenter wp-image-95154 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-discovery-ad-examples.webp 965w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-discovery-ad-examples-480x197.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 965px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>These ads look a bit like a cross between some of the display and YouTube placements. They leverage only the image assets and include headlines and descriptions, but just one of each.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that out of the images I have, they only used the landscape and square versions. There’s no preview option that leverages the more mobile-friendly 9&#215;16 format.</p>
<p>This content type promotion on a personal newsfeed should feel a bit like a social ad, and you’ll benefit from keeping social best practices in mind when writing variants that could show in the Discover feed.</p>
<div id="pmax-ad-examples-gmail"></div>
<h3>Gmail</h3>
<p>The last placement for Performance Max is<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/gmail-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Gmail ads</a>, and these are the only format that has two different views for each placement: one for the closed version and one for when the user opens the email line item.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-in-gmail.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - gmail" width="900" height="263" class="aligncenter wp-image-95161 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-in-gmail.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-in-gmail-480x140.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>On mobile, most of the closed versions are just text, but there is an option to have the image included. These also leverage headlines and descriptions, but no long headlines are to be found.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-gmail-1.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - gmail screenshot" width="900" height="348" class="aligncenter wp-image-95176 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-gmail-1.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-gmail-1-480x186.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Once those ads are opened, they all have images, but usually just repeat the same ad copy only in a bigger font.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-promotions.webp" alt="pmax gmail ad examples" width="966" height="343" class="aligncenter wp-image-95164 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-promotions.webp 966w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-promotions-480x170.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 966px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They look pretty similar on desktop devices. Relatively minimal copy in both the open and closed versions, but repeated in each. If anything, the headline disappears in the open version and is replaced by the image and a call-to-action button.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-gmail-inbox.webp" alt="pmax ad examples - gmail inbox ad" width="877" height="360" class="aligncenter wp-image-95163 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-gmail-inbox.webp 877w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pmax-ad-examples-gmail-inbox-480x197.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 877px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The biggest priority for these ads is still to make sure that all components can work together, but also expect that they might need to stand alone. In the open version on desktop, there’s only the description text left behind to convey your messaging, and although my image has text in it, yours might not.</p>
<h2>How to recreate these PMax ad examples</h2>
<p>Performance Max ads have many, many iterations of how they can manifest depending on what platform your ads are triggered for. Overall, it’s important to keep the dynamism in mind. Some ad units leverage lots of components and need to make sense in any combination. Others use very few assets and also need to be compelling in just a short portion of text, and maybe an image. Your goal should be to make as many compelling components as possible and assume that they all can show alongside any other asset or by themselves and still be compelling as a whole.</p>

<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-ai-mode">Google Ads in AI Mode: Here&#8217;s What We Know</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AI is becoming an increasingly integral part of online marketing as more advertisers adopt “smart” options in platforms and use AI tools to help generate, manage, optimize, and report on campaigns.</p>
<p>But from another angle, AI has also been impacting how and where our ads can show in a Google search results page. Earlier this year, Google released AI Mode, a new user experience that will continue to change the SERP game. That announcement immediately prompted many people to ask, “What will ads in AI Mode look like, and how can I get my ads to show there?”</p>
<p>Google is now testing ads in AI Mode, so ahead of a larger rollout later this year, we want to give an overview of what AI Mode is, discuss the settings you need to employ to be included, and what that could mean for your advertising strategy moving forward.</p>

<div id="what-is-google-ai-mode"></div>
<h2>What is AI Mode in Google?</h2>
<p>AI Mode is a self-contained search experience designed to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-experiments">use AI</a> in a conversation-type experience to answer complex queries. It’s powered by <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-use-google-bard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gemini</a>, Google’s largest and most capable AI model, and compared to normal search, which is more of a one-and-done type of experience, AI Mode is intended to drive further research and learning with multiple rounds of questions or query refinement. It will then deliver a range of information based on how that exchange goes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ai-mode-example.webp" alt="example of google ai mode with query for how to fix sink" width="900" height="519" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94858" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ai-mode-example.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ai-mode-example-480x277.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As a quick aside, here’s the next question we almost always get after defining AI Mode: “Is AI Mode different from AI Overviews?”</p>
<p>In short, yes and no.</p>
<p>Yes, from the user experience, AI Mode is different from AI Overviews.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-overviews-statistics">AI Overviews</a> show up within the regular search results and are just a single component of that page of answers compared to AI Mode’s contained experience. They also don’t allow for direct reengagement based on the answers provided. You can click on the supporting documentation links or the ads in AI Overviews, but if you want to go further than that, you have to conduct another search, effectively losing the thread of the previous one, and you may or may not be served another AI Overview.</p>
<p>But also, no, AI Mode and AI Overviews are extremely closely related to each other. The information served in them is usually pretty close (you can compare by clicking between the AI Mode and All tabs in Google), and the way advertisers can engage with them is pretty similar.</p>

<div id="the-types-of-queries-best-suited-for-ai-mode-and-ai-overviews-ads"></div>
<h2>The types of queries best suited for AI Mode (and AI Overviews) ads</h2>
<p>To try and discern the impact AI Mode may have for advertisers, we need to understand the types of queries that it’s best suited for.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ai-mode">AI Mode</a> is relatively new, we need to take some direction from the documentation around AI Overviews to understand how AI Mode might be impacted. Let’s dig into what we do know about AI Overviews and see how that can inform our expectations about AI Mode.</p>
<p>AI Overviews are not shown for all query types. They’re usually shown for queries that require a longer, in-depth answer rather than a series of links. That means AI Overviews are likely only going to show when the search is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broad and information-based</li>
<li>Comparison based</li>
<li>Multi-step</li>
<li>Explanatory</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these is heavily focused on transactions or sales. They’re all more research or learning based and, more often than not, an ad likely won’t show for this type of query anyway.</p>
<p>If you are getting search volume through your campaigns for these higher funnel, more generalized queries, you could likely already be seeing a decrease in impressions as AI Overviews are being shown more often and are likely pushing ads down the page.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong> Looking for more ways to drive people to your site?</strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website</a></p>
<div id="requirements-to-show-ads-in-ai-mode-and-ai-overviews"></div>
<h2>Requirements to show ads in AI Mode</h2>
<p>To know the impact AI Mode may have on advertising, we also need to know the criteria required to show your ads in AI Overviews. As ads on Google AI Mode are in the experimental stage, there&#8217;s very little documentation around it (just <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-ai-mode-ads-internal-document-459931" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this brief from Google</a> to brands in August).</p>
<p>Unlike regular <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/ppc-keyword">keyword targeting</a>, where the search term simply needs to closely match what your keywords are for an ad to show, ads on AI Mode require much more cohesion for the searcher. Not only does your keyword need to be relevant to the query, but your ad content and landing pages also need to be relevant to the answers provided by AI Mode as well (this is also how ads work in AI Overviews).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-ai-mode-benefits.webp" alt="google ads ai mode details from google" width="900" height="715" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94871" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-ai-mode-benefits.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-ads-ai-mode-benefits-480x381.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-ai-mode-ads-internal-document-459931" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Additionally, just like AI Overviews ads, Google is requiring advertisers to opt into AI-powered targeting solutions like broad match, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-max-for-search">AI Max for Search</a>, or keywordless targeting that accompanies Dynamic Search Ads or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/performance-max">Performance Max</a>.</p>

<div id="what-could-ai-mode-mean-for-advertisers"></div>
<h2>What could ads in AI Mode mean for businesses?</h2>
<p>Between the types of queries best suited for AI Mode and the settings required for advertisers to show up there, the implications for advertisers could be pretty large.</p>
<h3>A varied marketing approach</h3>
<p>For your ad to show in AI Mode (or in AI Overviews), you’re likely going to have to shift away from hard selling, as the queries these features are showing for aren’t the right fit. Additionally, you’re likely not going to get away with short landing pages with the minimum viable content to make the sale. Odds are, those pages aren’t going to be supportive enough of the AI answer experience to qualify your ads.</p>
<h3>Targeting expansion</h3>
<p>You’re also going to have to lean into Google’s intent-based query matching to leverage these placements. Without broad match or keywordless matching, you won’t be eligible for these new placements. Additionally, the expanded reach of campaigns like Performance Max goes beyond Search and into many other Google properties like YouTube and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/gmail-ads">Gmail</a>, which is obviously quite a big change.</p>
<h3>A bigger role for creative assets</h3>
<p>If you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-performance-max-pre-launch-optimizations">opt into Performance Max campaigns</a> or leverage the Text Customization and Final URL expansion features within AI Max for Search, you’re giving at least some control to Google when it comes to your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/21/emotional-ad-copy-examples">ad copy</a>. They’ll be able to create new text and visual components to leverage in your ads as you compete for these queries or expand into new placements that are much more creative forward.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/asset-optimization-ai-mode.webp" alt="ai mode asset optimization" width="900" height="369" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94862" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/asset-optimization-ai-mode.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/asset-optimization-ai-mode-480x197.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="should-you-be-focused-on-showing-ads-in-ai-mode"></div>
<h2>Should you be focused on showing ads in AI Mode?</h2>
<p>It’s no secret that things are changing quickly with AI and that Google is vying to be at the forefront of that industry. But it’s also no secret that Google still heavily relies on ads to account for much of its revenue each year. With those two truths in mind, it&#8217;s hardly a surprise that ads are being integrated into Google’s AI offerings from its search platform.</p>
<p>In my estimation, <strong>getting your ads to show with AI Mode (or AI Overviews) likely shouldn’t be your main goal with advertising.</strong> Your goal is still to hit your profitability or volume goals, but that doesn’t mean this shouldn’t be on your mind.</p>
<p>At this point in time, the advertisers who test and iterate on their strategy to both continue to see success with existing campaigns as well as find out what works for them in an AI-centered search experience will end up reaping the rewards in the future. Maybe it makes sense to opt into <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-max-for-search">AI Max</a> for a little while and see how it does. Have you run Performance Max campaigns recently? There have been a ton of updates to give advertisers better controls, and if you leverage them, maybe this campaign type can be profitable and get you eligible to show in AI experiences.</p>
<h2>What to do next</h2>
<p>In the immediate future, I don’t foresee AI Mode having a large impact on advertisers who have a dialed-in campaign strategy. At least not while user behavior is still relatively the same. That will almost certainly change over time as users get more used to AI and figure out ways to be more efficient with it. The advertiser who tests and learns in these early stages will be ahead of the game when these AI features are more widely adopted.</p>
<p>For now, it’s important to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/category/google-ads">keep up with the latest changes</a>, keep an eye on your existing Google Ads campaigns, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-experiments">use AI in smart ways</a> to further your marketing strategy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seasonality might be best associated with the major holiday events at the end of the year: Black Friday, Cyber Monday, etc., and while that time of the year can have a major impact on many businesses, focusing only on events that are large can leave you under-strategizing around other “seasonal” trends throughout the year.</p>
<p>Whether it’s an obvious change in behavior based on the time of year, like those end of year holidays, the changing of the seasons themselves, or a trend that repeats itself in your industry each year, there are quite a few strategies you can employ to make the most of those seasonal changes. Here are 10 strategies to lean into (or out of) seasonal trends within your accounts.</p>

<h2>10 seasonal PPC strategies for any business</h2>
<p>Whatever the occasion for your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/performance-max-holiday-strategies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seasonal PPC ads</a>, these 10 tips can help set you up for success.</p>
<div id="use-historical-data"></div>
<h3>1. Use historical data to forecast future fluctuations</h3>
<p>History might repeat itself, or it might rhyme, but either way, regular trends are something you should be aware of and ready for.</p>
<p>The first step in optimizing your accounts for these trends is to know when they’re coming and to know with enough heads up that you can actually do something about it.</p>
<p>Here are some places you can go to get insights on how these seasonal trends are impacting your campaigns and start to understand what each portion of the year holds for your accounts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ad platforms:</strong> Every self-serve ad platform includes some form of visualization. Leverage a long lookback window and review performance trends for high/low conversion rates, increased/decreased costs, and any other anomalous performance. Note the time of year they occur and for how long, then see if there’s a repeating pattern.</li>
<li><strong>GA4:</strong> Review overall site trends for your company, not just your campaigns. Are there performance spikes or dips that happen regularly? Do you see common trends in year over year data?</li>
<li><strong>Internal teams:</strong> Depending on your business model, the best insights around seasonality might come from your sales teams or another team within your company. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/20/google-ads-for-lead-generation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">B2B lead gen</a>, for example, usually has some component of personal selling that happens, and I’ll pretty much guarantee that if there’s a salesperson at your company who’s been there for more than a year, they’ll know the different trends that occur within the year and why.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’re able to pinpoint when these fluctuations are happening (and ideally why they’re happening), review the performance of your individual keywords, ad sets, and campaigns during that time to see if there are standouts or duds. Just because the account saw a big slowdown or spike doesn’t mean it was uniform across the account. Use those insights to inform your campaign strategy for the next time that the seasonality effect comes around.</p>

<div id="expand-targeting"></div>
<h3>2. Revisit and expand targeting to accommodate trends</h3>
<p>We’re mostly talking about how buyer behavior changes during these seasonal periods, but don’t forget to think about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-audience-targeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who your audience is</a> or how their shopping behavior might be changing.</p>
<p>For search campaigns, revisit your keywords. <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-revisits-15-unseen-queries-statistic-in-context-of-ai-search/543160/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15%</a> of queries are new every day and have never been seen before. That trend doesn’t go away during seasonal shifts. If anything, there may be outside factors influencing your audience to search differently than they have before.</p>
<p>Use tools like the Google Keyword Planner, Google Trends, and regularly review your search terms report to find new keywords to add to your account to capture any shifting behaviors.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-google-trends.webp" alt="seasonal ppc - google trends" width="713" height="397" class="aligncenter wp-image-93602 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-google-trends.webp 713w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-google-trends-480x267.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 713px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In some cases, you might even need to reach an entirely different audience than your regular clientele. If you’ve ever lived in a college town, you know the summers and winter break are drastically different from the school year. With many students going home over those time periods, it makes sense for bars and restaurants to take a more family-friendly stance than they might when students are in session and they’re only interested in what the drink specials are.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to think outside the box with your targeting and challenge your usual assumptions.</p>
<div id="customize-ad-copy"></div>
<h3>3. Customize ad copy</h3>
<p>This is probably the most obvious adjustment for seasonal campaigns and the one you normally think of when it comes to promotional times.</p>
<p>The most common way I see advertisers incorporate these messages is to adjust their existing ads’ headlines and descriptions to include the new messaging. While that strategy is totally acceptable and fine, I’d caution against that. Each time you adjust your ad, the data will get muddied and make it hard to tell how things are doing over time.</p>
<p>Instead, I’d suggest you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-run-google-ads">create an entirely new ad unit</a> that contains the seasonal messaging. This could run alongside your existing creative, or you could pause them. That’s up to you, just know Google might not serve your new creative if it doesn&#8217;t feel confident in how it will perform.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to make entirely new ads, there’s a good middle ground that I’m a pretty big fan of as well.</p>
<p>Use headline and description ad assets when you can’t or don’t want to update your existing RSAs. These will rotate individual headlines and descriptions into your existing RSAs. These can be scheduled to run during only your promotional period and then turn off when it’s over. Just remember that these will honor any pinning strategies you have in place.</p>

<div id="seasonal-assets"></div>
<h3>4. Don’t sleep on seasonal assets</h3>
<p>Speaking of assets, there are a few <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-assets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ad assets</a> you can utilize to highlight your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/seasonal-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seasonal messaging</a>.</p>
<p>Promotion assets are extremely customizable for just about any seasonal messaging you want to use.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-assets.png" alt="seasonal google ads promotion assets" width="294" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93605 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-assets.png 294w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-assets-147x300.png 147w" sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px" /></p>
<p>To start, you can select what your occasion is from quite a large list of options. From there, you can customize language, currency, the type of promotion you’re running, and then there’s space for info about the item, a final URL, and then you can customize the details of your promotion. It’s pretty obvious how these can be useful for promotional periods.</p>
<p>But while promotion assets were designed for this purpose, they’re not the only ones you can use to infuse seasonality into your accounts.</p>
<p>Callouts are standalone snippets of text, so you can easily add a handful with seasonal tilts in them to get into rotation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-callouts.webp" alt="seasonal google ads callouts" width="376" height="528" class="aligncenter wp-image-93601 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-callouts.webp 376w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-callouts-214x300.webp 214w" sizes="(max-width: 376px) 100vw, 376px" /></p>
<p>Structured snippets are similar. You can easily add a new variant or two with a new set of seasonal messaging that can rotate with your evergreen variants.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-structured-snippets.webp" alt="seasonal ppc - structured snippets" width="341" height="470" class="aligncenter wp-image-93600 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-structured-snippets.webp 341w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-structured-snippets-218x300.webp 218w" sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px" /></p>
<p>Sitelinks can also be customized to reflect your seasonal messaging, but they’ll take a little more effort than callouts and structured snippets. For sitelinks, you’ll need seasonal messaging, but you also need a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/08/landing-page-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unique landing page</a> that isn’t used in other sitelinks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-sitelink.webp" alt="seasonal ppc - sitelinks" width="353" height="419" class="aligncenter wp-image-93599 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-sitelink.webp 353w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-sitelink-253x300.webp 253w" sizes="(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px" /></p>
<p>Lastly, price assets can operate pretty similarly to promotion assets, and you can easily use the header and description fields to help incorporate your seasonal messaging.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-price-assets.webp" alt="seasonal ppc - price asset screenshot" width="354" height="544" class="aligncenter wp-image-93598 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-price-assets.webp 354w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-price-assets-195x300.webp 195w" sizes="(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px" /></p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW232331268 BCX0"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW232331268 BCX0"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Could your Google Ads account benefit from optimized seasonal ads?</span></span></strong> Find out with our free<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Google Ads Grader</a>!</p>
<div id="landing-pages"></div>
<h3>5. Make sure your landing pages are ready</h3>
<p>With all this ad customization you’re doing, it’s important to make sure those messages are reflected on the landing page. It’s easy to get excited about all the bells and whistles of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/03/ad-copy-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ad copy</a>, but if your landing pages aren&#8217;t delivering on those awesome messages, you’re likely to lose your customers when they feel like you’re not delivering on the promise of your ads.</p>
<p>If your seasonal shift sees an increase in traffic, it’s a good time to make sure your landing pages load quickly and that your site is able to handle the influx of traffic.</p>
<p>A great tool to help troubleshoot any speed deficiencies on your site is Google’s <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Page Speed Insights</a>. With this tool, you can find out which pages on your site are slow for mobile or desktop, then address specific problem areas to speed them up.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-page-speed-insights.webp" alt="seasonal ppc - google ads page speed insights" width="699" height="501" class="aligncenter wp-image-93593 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-page-speed-insights.webp 699w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-page-speed-insights-480x344.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 699px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="budget-alignment"></div>
<h3>6. Align your budget with your goals</h3>
<p>If the seasonal trend you’re about to experience is one where business slows, you might not need to adjust your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/14/google-ads-budgeting-strategies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads budget</a>. For example, over the holidays, my B2B accounts usually slow down quite a bit, but <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/06/small-marketing-budget" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we don’t lower the budget</a> for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>First, we’re likely not going to spend the entire budget anyway, so there’s no real risk of leaving it. Second, the people who DO convert during that time are usually pretty motivated. If you’re researching new software for your company in the week between Christmas and New Year&#8217;s, you’re likely up against some sort of annual renewal and need to make a move quickly.</p>
<p>But for other accounts where volume scales up, sometimes by multiple folds, not increasing your budget could mean that you miss out on incremental traffic and maybe not take full advantage of your promotional period.</p>
<p>Google Ads daily budgets do take into account the performance trends and will spend over your daily budget on strong days. But if your promotional period is multiple days, you’re likely going to be spending too hot and since the algorithm is going to try and balance out to a monthly average, you’ll almost certainly miss out.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-spend.webp" alt="seasonal google ads budget report" width="757" height="315" class="aligncenter wp-image-93596 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-spend.webp 757w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-spend-480x200.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 757px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="seasonal-adjustments"></div>
<h3>7. Use seasonality adjustments</h3>
<p>If you’re using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-smart-bidding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smart Bidding</a> and your seasonality is a short burst of large performance swings, like a 25% or more increase or decrease in conversion rate, you can use a feature from Google called a Seasonal Adjustment.</p>
<p>You can learn more about <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9352512?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seasonality adjustments</a> here, but effectively, they let you tell Google to expect performance that will be very different from your “normal” performance. That way, it doesn’t over- or underreact to performance changes during your short seasonality impact. Overall, these are intended to be used sparingly, but can have a very large impact on your performance.</p>
<div id="remarket-strategically"></div>
<h3>8. Remarket strategically</h3>
<p>Remarketing lists are a solid staple in regular campaigns, but when your seasonal promotions come around, they can be a great way to reach back into a valuable group of users.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of remarketing lists that could be great to leverage during promotional periods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cart abandoners during recent sales</li>
<li>Users who purchased during last year’s sales</li>
<li>Users who signed up to be notified when a sale occurred</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/11/call-to-action-examples-for-email-newsletter-signups" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsletter signups</a></li>
</ul>
<div id="schedule-ads"></div>
<h3>9. Schedule your ads ahead of time</h3>
<p>One of the biggest stress factors during promotional periods is making sure the right ads are active in the right places at the right time.</p>
<p>Many platforms will let you schedule your ads ahead of time to turn on when your sale starts and turn off when your sale ends.</p>
<p>My advice to you: trust but verify.</p>
<p>Leverage these tools to turn things on and off for you, but still spot check. You’ll alleviate the stress of needing to be present when ads need to change over, but you will still have peace of mind once you check in.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-schedule.webp" alt="seasonal ppc - ad and campaign scheduling action in google ads" width="672" height="458" class="aligncenter wp-image-93594 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-schedule.webp 672w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seasonal-ppc-schedule-480x327.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 672px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="real-time-optimization"></div>
<h3>10. Maintain and optimize your seasonal PPC ads in real time</h3>
<p>One last point for seasonal campaigns is to always maintain and optimize your ads during these times. Don’t put these as a “set it and forget it” strategy. During peak hours, things move fast. Just like other times of the year, it’s important to keep a close eye on how your campaigns are performing, especially if the window is short, i.e., a weekend-long sale. We might not like working on the weekend, but if you turn your promos on Friday evening, then don’t check again until Monday, you could miss out on important intraday trends that you could have capitalized on.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean you have to be tied to your computer the whole time during these periods either. Platforms like Google Ads have tools that can alert you when performance changes by large swings. In the image above, Google will review the ROAS performance of the ads every hour and send an email if the ROAS is below 100%.</p>
<p>Tools like this can give you peace of mind to go about your day but let you know when you need to log in and handle business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google Ads has been rolling out changes that nudge advertisers toward using more and more automation. If the idea of letting Google handle every aspect of your campaigns once made you nervous, you’re not alone—but with AI getting smarter and Google fine-tuning its tools, most businesses now use at least some automation in their accounts.</p>
<p>One big piece of that puzzle is automated bidding. Automated bidding simplifies your bidding strategy for you based on your budget and goals.</p>
<p>But just because it’s “automated” doesn’t mean it’s simple. There are different automated bidding strategies, each with its own pros and cons. So, should you use automated bidding? And if you do, which strategy makes the most sense for your business?</p>
<p>That’s exactly what we’re going to cover here. We’ll break down manual, automated, and Smart Bidding in Google Ads—plus when to use each—so you can make the most of your ad budget.</p>

<h2>What is automated bidding?</h2>
<p>When you set up a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-run-google-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads campaign</a>, you have to tell Google how much you’re willing to pay for your ad to be shown. This is called your bid, and there are two different ways to set your bids: manual or automated.</p>

<h2>Automated bidding vs. Smart Bidding: What&#8217;s the difference?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-smart-bidding" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7065882#zippy=%2Cautomated-bidding-signals">Smart Bidding</a> and automated bidding often get used interchangeably, but they’re not the same thing. Smart Bidding refers only to Google’s automated bidding strategies that use “auction-time bidding,” meaning it will optimize for conversion or conversion value in each and every auction. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximize Conversions</li>
<li>Maximize Conversion value</li>
<li>Target CPA</li>
<li>Target ROAS</li>
</ul>
<p>So while all Smart Bidding strategies are automated, not all automated bidding strategies are Smart Bidding strategies.</p>

<div id="types-of-automated-bidding"></div>
<h2>Every automated bidding strategy in Google Ads</h2>
<p>Here are all your automated bidding strategy options and their pros and cons.</p>
<div id="maximize-conversions"></div>
<h3>1. Maximize Conversions</h3>
<p>Maximize Conversions is a fully automated bidding strategy, meaning there are no individual keyword bids set by advertisers that Google factors in. It simply chooses a CPC bid based on the goal of the bidding strategy.</p>
<p>The Maximum Conversions bid strategy is designed to get as many conversions as possible while spending your daily budget. Max Conversions also gives you the option to add a target CPA to help guide its bidding.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-ads-automated-bidding-maximize-conversions.jpg" alt="Maximize Conversions" width="1246" height="240" /></div>
<p>Although this bid strategy is relatively straightforward, it warrants an abundance of caution. Here are some tips to keep in mind and precautions to take.</p>
<h4>Each campaign needs its own daily budget</h4>
<p>It’s important that each campaign using Maximize Conversions has its own daily budget assigned, as opposed to being part of a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-shared-budgets">shared budget</a>, as this strategy will always try to spend the full daily allotted budget per campaign. If included in a shared budget, Maximize Conversions will spend the daily budget of the entire shared group, not just its own allotment.</p>
<h4>You need conversion tracking in place</h4>
<p>Do not run this strategy without having conversion tracking in place. Google’s goal is to maximize the number of conversions being tracked, so if no tracking is enabled, the algorithm is more likely to make bad decisions to find a person willing to convert.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36587 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-conversion-tracking.png" alt="google ads conversion tracking setup" width="720" height="233" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-conversion-tracking.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-conversion-tracking-480x155.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Keep an eye on CPC</h4>
<p>Remember, Google’s algorithm is going to bid whatever it needs to bid to get you the most conversions possible. You may see your spend or average CPC creep up as Google is bidding more aggressively to meet your conversion goals.</p>
<p>However, while Max Conversions has a history of potentially spending more aggressively, the increased <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization-marketing">conversion rate</a> balances you back out. Your spend or average CPC may be higher, but you’ll have more conversions coming in—resulting in an overall lower CPA and higher ROI. Plus, with the new option to add a target cost per action (CPA), these risks can be kept in control.</p>
<p>In short, if your goal is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/performance-max-lead-generation">get more leads for cheaper</a>, Max Conversions might just work for you. However, if you’re tight on budget, try a target CPA with Max Conversions or go for another strategy instead!</p>

<div id="maximize-clicks"></div>
<h3>2. Maximize Clicks</h3>
<p>This strategy is very similar to Maximize Conversions but instead focuses on clicks. With Maximize Clicks, Google will work to get as many clicks as possible while spending your daily budget.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-ads-automated-bidding-maximize-clicks.jpg" alt="Maximize Clicks" width="1248" height="372" /></p>
<p>This strategy can be great if you’re trying to drive more volume to your site for <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/14/use-branding-to-improve-advertising" data-cke-saved-href="/blog/ws/2020/09/14/use-branding-to-improve-advertising">branding</a> and list building, or if you have very strong <a href="/blog/ws/2019/08/19/conversion-rate-benchmarks" data-cke-saved-href="/blog/ws/2019/08/19/conversion-rate-benchmarks">conversion performance</a> and want to find more volume.</p>
<p>Here are some other tips to keep in mind.</p>
<h4>Set a max CPC</h4>
<p>Always set a max CPC and keep an eye on your average max CPC as well. Google will work to get as many clicks as possible for your campaign, but as with Maximize Conversions, it will also work hard to spend your entire daily budget each day, even if clicks are far more expensive than normal.</p>
<h4>Regularly check on CPC performance</h4>
<p>Regularly check in on the CPC performance this bid strategy is generating (and any other goal metrics you have in place) to ensure it’s still meeting your goals. If not, then adjust your settings or potentially look to a new bid strategy.</p>
<div id="maximize-conversion-value"></div>
<h3>3. Maximize Conversion Value</h3>
<p>Max Conversion Value is the older sibling of the Max Conversions strategy because it’s slightly more advanced.</p>
<p>While the two strategies are fundamentally the same, Max Conversion Value looks to bring in conversions that will give you the highest return.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36586 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies-pros-cons-maximize-conversion-value.png" alt="google ads automated bidding strategies pros and cons: maximize conversion value setup" width="720" height="154" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies-pros-cons-maximize-conversion-value.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies-pros-cons-maximize-conversion-value-480x103.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In other words, it doesn’t necessarily look at how<em> many </em>conversions it’s bringing in, but the<em> value</em> within each conversion. It’s a strategy that looks at quality over quantity.</p>
<p>Similar to how Max Conversions allows you to set a Target CPA, Max Conversion Value gives you the option to set a Target ROAS to help guide its bidding.</p>
<p>There are two points of caution for this bidding strategy.</p>
<h4>Track conversions</h4>
<p>Just like with Max Conversions, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/24/google-ads-conversion-tracking" data-cke-saved-href="/blog/ws/2021/05/24/google-ads-conversion-tracking">properly setting up conversion tracking</a> is vital to the success of this strategy.</p>
<h4>Assign values</h4>
<p>Be sure <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/10/how-to-determine-conversion-value">each action is assigned a value</a>, or else the algorithm will be confused.</p>
<p>After all, a conversion worth $1000 to your business deserves a higher bid than one worth only $5. If your tracking is not properly set for value-based bidding, this won’t work.</p>
<div id="target-cpa"></div>
<h3>4. Target CPA (tCPA)</h3>
<p>Target CPA stands for target cost per action (or conversion). It used to be a separate bidding strategy but is now only available as an option within the Max Conversions strategy (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/google-retiring-tcpa-troas" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/google-retiring-tcpa-troas">learn more here</a>).</p>
<p>With tCPA, you set a target cost per action (conversion) and then Google adjusts bids to generate as many conversions as possible at that CPA.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36585 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-target-cpa.png" alt="google ads automated bidding strategies: target CPA setup" width="600" height="227" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-target-cpa.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-target-cpa-480x182.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Advertisers are able to set bid minimums and maximums to ensure Google doesn’t adjust bids through the floor or ceiling, but only for <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6263072" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portfolio-</a>level</span> use. If you’re targeting for individual campaigns, these bid caps aren’t available.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36584 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/gogle-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-target-cpa-options.png" alt="google ads automated bidding strategies: target CPA min and max setup" width="500" height="600" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/gogle-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-target-cpa-options.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/gogle-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-target-cpa-options-480x576.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There are three things to note about tCPA bidding.</p>
<h4>Set up conversion tracking</h4>
<p>Like Max Conversions and Max Conversion Value, Target CPA bidding requires conversion tracking enabled in your account. Without it, this bidding strategy is useless—it will never know if it’s driving conversions or not.</p>
<p>But that’s not all. Just because you have conversion tracking turned on doesn’t mean you’re off to the races just yet.</p>
<h4>Provide minimum conversion data</h4>
<p>To drive conversion performance, Google needs to have a certain amount of conversion data to be able to make smart decisions. If you don’t have enough conversion volume, then the algorithm can’t make smart decisions, and tCPA isn’t the right bidding option for you.</p>
<p>At the campaign level, Google says the minimum is 15 conversions in the last 30 days, but we’ve found this to be on the low side. Ideally, you should have at least 30 conversions, if not 50, in the past 30 days before testing tCPA bidding.</p>
<p>If your campaigns don’t reach this level individually, they might at a portfolio level. If they still don’t, tCPA likely shouldn’t be on your list of eligible bid strategies.</p>
<h4>Set a realistic target</h4>
<p>Lastly, when getting started with tCPA, it’s important to set realistic initial goals. If your campaign has had an average CPA of $40 over the past six months, it’s not in your best interest to set a target CPA of $20, as it will limit Google right away in the auctions it can enter in and learn.</p>
<p>If you’re planning to use tCPA bidding, plan on the first two weeks to a month being a learning phase. Set your target CPA slightly higher than what your average CPA has been recently, or use the Google-suggested CPA target to let Google find a groove, then slowly bring it down over time to your target CPA.</p>
<div id="target-roas"></div>
<h3>5. Target ROAS (tROAS)</h3>
<p>Target ROAS is nearly the same as Target CPA, but with return on ad spend (ROAS) instead. And just as tCPA has been reorganized under Max Conversions, tROAS has been reorganized under Max Conversion Value (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/google-retiring-tcpa-troas" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/google-retiring-tcpa-troas">learn more here</a>).</p>
<p>With this strategy, Google Ads will predict future conversion and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/25/conversion-value" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/25/conversion-value">conversion value</a> performance based on your historical data to enter auctions, and then adjust bids in real time to maximize conversion value while trying to achieve the target ROAS goal you’ve set at the ad group, campaign, or portfolio level.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36583 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-target-ROAS.png" alt="google ads automated bidding: target roas setup" width="720" height="261" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-target-ROAS.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-target-ROAS-480x174.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As with tCPA, individual conversions may have higher or lower ROAS than your goal, and Google will work to balance those out over time to achieve your ROAS target.</p>
<p>With tROAS, advertisers can set bid limits (minimums and maximums) at the campaign or portfolio level to help keep the Google algorithm from straying too far, but Google cautions against this as it can limit the machine&#8217;s decision-making.</p>
<p>All the same cautions for tCPA apply to tROAS.</p>
<h4>Set up accurate conversion tracking</h4>
<p>Ensure you have accurate conversion tracking in place including conversion values and that you have enough conversion performance in the recent past to leverage this strategy.</p>
<h4>Don&#8217;t set your target ROAS too high</h4>
<p>Also, be careful not set your target ROAS at a restrictively high level right off the bat. Start off with a goal slightly lower than what your performance has been recently, then slowly raise the target over time to achieve a more profitable ROAS.</p>
<div id="target-impression-share"></div>
<h3>6. Target Impression Share</h3>
<p>With Target Impression Share, advertisers set a goal impression share percentage in the same way you would set a target CPA for that bidding strategy.<br />
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-ads-automated-bidding-target-impression-share.jpg" alt="Target Impression Share" width="1072" height="558" /><br />
There are three placement options you have to bid for with Target Impression Share:</p>
<ul>
<li>Absolute Top of Page</li>
<li>Top of Page</li>
<li>Anywhere on the Page</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these will tell the Google algorithm different things about your preferences, and it will adjust bids accordingly.</p>
<p>Advertisers are also able to set a max CPC bid with Target Impression Share bidding to help guard against overspend, but Google cautions against setting it too low and throttling performance.</p>
<p>Like any other bidding strategy, this one has the potential to increase your bids beyond the profitability level if you’re not careful. This strategy is focused on awareness and reach (though it can be used for performance), but there are still limits to what makes sense monetarily for your campaigns.</p>
<h4>Keep an eye on CPC</h4>
<p>Always set a max CPC bid to ensure you don’t pay too much for any individual click. Although Google cautions against it, don’t worry about setting this bid too low to start. Try setting it at a percentage increase over your current bid of 20%-50%. If that works well, then leave that cap. If you’re not seeing the volume you’d like, increase the max CPC.</p>
<h4>Have realistic expectations</h4>
<p>Very few auctions will actually see 100% coverage anymore. So although you set a target to 100%, don’t be surprised or frustrated if you show up closer to 95% as a top achievable number.</p>
<p>Always keep an eye on CPCs and performance outcomes to ensure this bidding strategy is achieving your goals before continuing with this strategy.</p>
<div id="viewable-cpm"></div>
<h3>7. Viewable CPM</h3>
<p>Viewable CPM (vCPM) refers to cost per thousand viewable impressions. According to <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6026409?hl=en" data-cke-saved-href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6026409?hl=en">Google</a><em>, </em>an ad is counted as viewable when 50% of your ad shows on screen for one second or longer for Display ads, and two seconds or longer for video ads.</p>
<p>This is a Display-only bid strategy designed to let advertisers bid for impressions when your ad is shown in a viewable space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36582 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies-viewable-cpm.png" alt="google ads automated bidding strategies pros and cons: viewable CPM setup" width="600" height="153" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies-viewable-cpm.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-strategies-viewable-cpm-480x122.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>vCPM bidding is great if you’re working on expanding your brand coverage and simply want to get your message in front of a large group of people.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things to watch out for with vCPM bidding: frequency and placements.</p>
<h4>Be mindful of frequency</h4>
<p>With this strategy, Google will look to maximize the number of viewable impressions your ad receives. When using this strategy with a finite audience, your chances of hitting a high frequency count for each user go up.</p>
<p>We’ve all had the ads that seem to stalk us as we peruse the internet, so be sure that although you’re trying to maximize ad views, you’re not doing it at the expense of a small audience who now feel overwhelmed by your brand.</p>
<h4>Keep an eye on placements</h4>
<p>Additionally, not all viewable impressions are created equal. Just like any other display campaign, it’s important to keep an eye on your placements report to ensure you’re not showing up on unwanted sites.</p>
<div id="cost-per-view"></div>
<h3>8. Cost Per View (CPV)</h3>
<p>Bidding on individual views is only available for video ads. With Cost Per View, you set a campaign-level bid limit that implies the maximum you’re willing to pay for each view or interaction with your video (whichever comes first).</p>
<p>In this case, you’d only be charged for a view if someone watched your video for more than 30 seconds (or the entire video if it’s shorter than 30 seconds). Otherwise, if the viewer instead clicks on a link the video shares or takes part in other calls to action (app download, etc.), you will be charged for that interaction.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36581 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-cpv-automated-bidding-strategy.png" alt="google ads automated bidding strategies: cost per view setup" width="600" height="349" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-cpv-automated-bidding-strategy.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-cpv-automated-bidding-strategy-480x279.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The nice thing about CPV bidding is it also allows you to “bid up” when you show alongside popular YouTube videos that may be more likely to bring you in a return.</p>
<h4>Set up the right targeting</h4>
<p>Beware if you have loose targeting on your video campaigns! If you’re bringing in TONS of views at a cheaper cost, it most likely won’t make sense for you to use CPV.</p>
<h4>Only spend when it counts</h4>
<p>Since you’re bidding on individual views, you only want to spend when it really counts. So if you have looser targeting this will be tougher to gauge. Additionally, video views and average costs per view tend to be relatively cheap.</p>
<p>This makes CPV a great strategy for a hyper-focused video campaign in a highly competitive space, but not the best for those just starting out in video ads.</p>
<div id="manual"></div>
<h3>A note on Manual Cost Per Click (CPC)</h3>
<p>Although Manual CPC is not an automated bidding strategy, it&#8217;s still worth mentioning in our bid strategy roundup as it&#8217;s the easiest bid strategy to grasp on the Google Ads platform. Advertisers set their bids manually at the keyword level, and the bids stay where they are until the advertiser changes them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36589 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-manual-cpc.png" alt="pros and cons of every automated bidding strategy in google ads: manual cpc setup" width="720" height="207" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-manual-cpc.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-manual-cpc-480x138.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Despite the friendly warning from Google, this is the best place to start for folks starting out in PPC or using their spare time to manage their account but has its drawbacks.</p>
<p>Despite the friendly warning from Google, this is a recommended place to start for folks starting out in PPC or using their spare time to manage their account.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-manual-bidding-mistakes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manual bidding</a> has two drawbacks:</p>
<h4>It takes a lot of time</h4>
<p>When it comes down to it, manual bidding requires a time investment to look at performance, judge if the keyword bid needs to change, decide what that change needs to be, and then actually make that change.</p>
<h4>You could be underinformed</h4>
<p>When we review our <a href="/blog/ws/2011/05/10/common-ppc-metrics" data-cke-saved-href="/blog/ws/2011/05/10/common-ppc-metrics">performance metrics</a>, we’re at the whim of the metrics Google allows us to see for our campaigns. With automated bidding strategies, Google is able to take data points into account that we don’t even know exist.</p>
<p>These two downsides don’t mean all automation is good and that manual bidding isn’t the right solution for you. But they are something to consider when determining bid strategies.</p>
<div id="set-up-automated-bidding"></div>
<h2>How to set your automated bidding strategy</h2>
<p>Once you determine which automated bidding strategy is right for you, how do you select it?</p>
<p>It’s important to note that when you’re setting up your campaign, <strong>Google will automatically choose an automated bidding strategy for you based on your goals. </strong></p>
<p><strong>You do not have to use this strategy!</strong></p>
<p>You can choose any other automated bidding strategy, or instead choose to bid manually.</p>
<p>Simply select the blue text at the bottom where it says “Select a bid strategy directly (not recommended)”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36590 aligncenter" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-default.png" alt="bid strategy setup in google ads" width="600" height="270" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-default.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-ads-automated-bidding-pros-cons-default-480x216.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Alright, so now that you know the basics of Google Ads bidding, let’s go through every option you have for bidding.</p>
<div id="choosing-a-strategy"></div>
<h2>Which automated bidding strategy should you choose?</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve covered all the automated bidding strategies, it’s time to choose the one that’s right for your whole account, right?</p>
<p>Wrong!</p>
<p>The best thing about automated bidding and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/17/google-ads-bid-management">bid management</a>: we can pick and choose what we use where.</p>
<p>Google Ads allows for automated bidding strategies to be set at either the ad group, campaign, or portfolio level, depending on the strategy you choose. This means you can direct different aspects of your account to rely on different bid strategies depending on their goals.</p>
<p>When choosing a bid strategy, evaluate at the campaign level to determine if the strategy will help accomplish your goal and if you have enough data to make it work (e.g., enough conversion volume to make Target CPA effective). If not, you might benefit from another bid strategy, a portfolio-level strategy, or even an adjustment in account structure to better leverage it later on.</p>
<h2>Set it and <em>don’t</em> forget it</h2>
<p>Automated bid strategies in Google Ads are a fantastic way to save time while leveraging algorithms to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/offset-lower-website-traffic">optimize your account</a>, but only when evaluated and chosen wisely.</p>
<p>And even though automated bidding strategies require less maintenance than manual bidding, there’s no such thing as “set it and forget it.” Once these strategies are leveraged in your account, set reminders to check in on them to ensure they’re still accomplishing the goals they set out to hit. Happy automating!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve been paying attention to the Google Ads landscape over the past couple of months, you’ve likely heard of the release of AI Max for Search. I’ve heard from many advertisers that they’re worried that Google is messing with Search campaigns, but I think those worries are a bit premature.</p>
<p>In this article, I want to talk about what AI Max for Search is (and some of what it isn’t) and talk about when it might make sense to test in your account.</p>

<h2>What is AI Max for Search?</h2>
<p>First, let’s get something out of the way: AI Max is NOT a replacement for Search campaigns.</p>
<p>So, let’s talk about what AI Max <em>is</em> and how it will work.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-marketing-live-2025#:~:text=3.-,AI%20Max%20for%20Search%20campaigns,-AI%20Max%20for">AI Max</a> is a new set of optional features you can enable with your Search campaigns in Google Ads to help with targeting and creative assets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-for-search-campaigns.webp" alt="ai max for search campaigns" width="755" height="565" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93380" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-for-search-campaigns.webp 755w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-for-search-campaigns-480x359.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 755px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="ai-max-for-search-new-features"></div>
<h3>New features for AI Max</h3>
<p>Here’s a quick rundown of the new features available within AI Max:</p>
<h4>Search term matching</h4>
<p>This is a new form of keywordless targeting that combines a few different features. It uses Broad match (i.e., the Broad match campaign setting) plus keywordless matching that uses signals from keywords, assets, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">landing pages</a>.</p>
<p>From what I can tell, when it comes to keyword prioritization, AI Max will fall in line with the existing hierarchy in one of two ways.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-search-term-matching.webp" alt="ai max search term matching" width="684" height="687" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93381" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-search-term-matching.webp 684w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-search-term-matching-480x482.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 684px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If your ad is triggered for a search term based on the Broad match setting, that will fall into the level of the list alongside Phrase match and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/11/search-themes-for-performance-max-campaigns">Search themes</a> for PMax. If your ad is triggered with the keywordless matching option, i.e., the search term was determined by your keywords, assets, or landing pages, then it will fall into the last row where only Ad Rank serves to determine prioritization.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-for-search-campaigns-example-e1753987829552.webp" alt="ai max for search keywordless targeting" width="884" height="507" class="aligncenter wp-image-93386 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-for-search-campaigns-example-e1753987829552.webp 884w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-for-search-campaigns-example-e1753987829552-480x270.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 884px, 100vw" /></p>

<h4>Updates to reporting</h4>
<p>Since AI Max gets to choose search queries, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-google-ads-keywords">keywords</a>, landing pages, and assets for you, each of those reports will now have a portion that shows when AI Max selected them. Within search terms, you will also be able to see if the query was selected based on Broad match expansion or keywordless matching.</p>
<div id="ai-max-for-search-existing-features"></div>
<h3>Not-so-new features in AI Max</h3>
<p>There are some features in the AI Max for Search announcements that are effectively just carryovers from what’s usable in regular Search or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/10/dynamic-search-ads">Dynamic Search Ads</a> (DSA) campaigns currently.</p>
<h4>Brand settings</h4>
<p>With AI Max for Search, you’ll still be able to utilize Brand Inclusion and Exclusion lists just as you do with regular Search campaigns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-brand-settings.webp" alt="ai max for search brand settings" width="782" height="422" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93382" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-brand-settings.webp 782w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-brand-settings-480x259.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 782px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>URL rules</h4>
<p>Just like with Dynamic Search Ads campaigns, you’ll be able to control which URLs your ads are eligible to use with inclusions and exclusions. Advertisers will also be able to utilize Page Feeds, as well, if that’s a simpler option than having two separate inclusion-exclusion lists.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-url-rules.webp" alt="ai max for search brand rules" width="720" height="140" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93383" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-url-rules.webp 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-url-rules-480x93.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Text customization</h4>
<p>This feature is new to Search, but exists in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/23/optimize-performance-max-campaigns">Performance Max campaigns</a>. With Text Customization, Google will use text from your existing ads, landing pages, and assets along with generative AI to create a customized ad copy that’s relevant to your user&#8217;s query.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6e0.png" alt="🛠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Get the tools and tips you need to build the perfect landing page in our free guide &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLiQContentDLHowToMakeGreatLandingPages.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_LandingPages_HowToMakeGreatLandingPagesGuide_Download">How to Make Great Landing Pages (with Crazy-High Conversion)</a></p>
<h4>Final URL expansion</h4>
<p>Also, available in PMax campaigns, Final URL Expansion lets Google choose a more specific page from your site as the landing page for your ad if it believes it’s more relevant than the landing page you selected. This requires Text Customization to be turned on.</p>
<h4>Locations of interest</h4>
<p>These controls will be able to be adjusted at the ad group level to include people based on either their location, Presence or their Presence or Interest in a given location. The key difference here is the control at the ad group level rather than the campaign level as with existing Search campaigns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-locations-or-interest.png" alt="ai max for search locations or interest" width="602" height="93" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93390" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-locations-or-interest.png 602w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-max-locations-or-interest-480x74.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 602px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Many other features, like negative keywords and location exclusions, will still apply to your AI Max campaigns just like they do for regular Search.</p>
<div id="ai-max-for-search-note"></div>
<h3>A note about AI Max options</h3>
<p>One thing I want to stress about AI Max in its current form is its optionality. There are LOTS of features within this new set that you can pick and choose à la carte to apply or not apply as you wish. Each of the options listed below are features that can be opted into or out of based on your preferences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keywordless Targeting</li>
<li>Text Customization</li>
<li>Final URL Expansion (must have Text Customization enabled to use this)</li>
<li>Location of Interest</li>
<li>AI Max: You can toggle this on or off at your discretion</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> You still have lots of control, even when ceding some control to Google.</p>
<div id="requirements-for-ai-max"></div>
<h2>Requirements for AI Max</h2>
<p>There are just a couple of requirements for you to use AI Max.</p>
<p>First, your campaign type must (obviously) be a Search campaign. If you want to use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/04/google-ads-ai">Google’s AI features</a> with other campaign types, there are plenty of others to choose from.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-ads-campaign-type-search.webp" alt="google ads campaign types with search selected" width="830" height="397" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93384" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-ads-campaign-type-search.webp 830w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-ads-campaign-type-search-480x230.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 830px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Second, you must be using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-smart-bidding">Smart Bidding strategies</a> focused on conversions. This means Max Conversions or Max Conversion Value are eligible, as well as their augmented styles of tCPA and tROAS, respectively. No other bid strategies are supported at this time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-ads-bidding-strategies-conversion-focused.webp" alt="google ads smart conversion focused bidding strategies" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93379" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-ads-bidding-strategies-conversion-focused.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/google-ads-bidding-strategies-conversion-focused-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>What results can you expect from Google Ads?</strong> Download our latest <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/google-ads-industry-benchmarks?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2025GoogleAdsBenchmarks_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links">Google Ads Benchmarks</a> to find out!</p>
<div id="when-not-to-use-ai-max"></div>
<h2>When not to use AI Max</h2>
<p>While some of these features are really just a different packaging for options that are already available in Google Ads, there are some scenarios where I wouldn’t recommend using AI Max for Search.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Poor website:</strong> Just like with DSA campaigns, if your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/no-website-traffic">website isn’t a strong representation of your company</a>, AI Max for Search might not be a great idea if you leave the Text Customization and Final URL expansion on.</li>
<li><strong>Regulation-heavy industry:</strong> Just like with other automated features in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-run-google-ads">Google Ads</a>, if you need to have strict messaging in ads based on regulatory compliance, AI Max might not be a great option.</li>
<li><strong>Low conversion volume:</strong> Although Google touts its Smart Bidding as being able to generate results without much history, I’ve personally never found success with that. I’d always suggest following the 30/30 rule, meaning at least 30 conversions in the last 30 days, with 50 conversions in the last 30 days being an even better threshold to meet.</li>
<li><strong>Lead quality considerations:</strong> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-generation-ideas">Lead generation</a> is always a tough route with Google Ads automation. The platform is really good at getting leads, but <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-quality">generating quality leads</a> can be a challenge. If you have high thresholds to hit for quality, AI Max could still be an okay option, but will likely need to take a backseat to classic Search. Speaking of…</li>
</ul>
<div id="when-to-try-ai-max-for-search"></div>
<h2>When to try AI Max for Search</h2>
<p>For now, I’m thinking of AI Max for Search as a combination of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/performance-max">Performance Max</a> and Dynamic Search Ads. The biggest common factor in those campaigns: they’re here to drive incremental volume outside of my reach with my existing Search campaigns.</p>
<p>What does all this mean for me? I’m still going to build out a robust, old-school Search strategy that leverages Exact match terms just like I have for the last 15 years and manage it as usual. Given the prioritization schedule above, Exact match still outranks everything else, and since that’s where I’ll have the most control, that’s where I’m going to start.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I’ll leverage AI Max as an expansion tool, just like I would for DSA. If anything, AI Max, in my mind, just translates to a slightly more AI-centered Dynamic Search Ads strategy. It functions relatively the same, but just has a few more bells and whistles.</p>
<p>TL;DR: If you’re a fan of classic Search paired with Dynamic Search Ads for extra reach, then AI Max for Search might be your new favorite tool.</p>
<div id="how-to-get-started-with-ai-max"></div>
<h2>How to get started with AI Max for Search</h2>
<p>AI Max for Search started its rollout as of early 2025 but is going to take until Q3 of 2025 to be fully available to all accounts. If you want to test this campaign type, you’ll have to wait for it to hit your account.</p>
<p>Once the feature is available for you, there will be an option to use Google Ads Campaign Experiments to test AI Max for Search before jumping in full force. It’s not clear at this time exactly what the logistics of that setup will be, but there will be some functionality around it.</p>
<h2>Is AI Max for Search right for you right now?</h2>
<p>Google is continuing to roll out new features powered by AI to help advertisers find their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/target-audience-examples">target audience</a>. If you’re a classic marketer like me, this might be a nice addition to what you already have running. If you’re new to marketing and Search in general, this might be an easy option for you to get things started and see results.</p>
<p>Just like all other new features, I don’t think AI Max is for everyone, and it certainly can be a slippery slope for advertisers who aren’t sure what they’re doing, but it also could be a great option for folks who have maxed out traditional search and need to see incremental results.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AI is all the rage in the digital world now, and paid media is no different. While there are certainly lots of ways you can use AI outside of the ad platforms to enhance your campaigns, there are also features built directly into the platforms themselves that you can leverage to infuse AI into your campaigns.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll dive into the AI features available right now to help you personalize and optimize your ad campaigns broken out by audience targeting, ad creative tactics, and budget and bidding controls.</p>

<h2>AI features for audience targeting</h2>
<p>It may be a little more behind the scenes, but many of the targeting options we have access to within the ad platforms leverage AI in one way or another.</p>
<div id="behavior-and-interest-targeting"></div>
<h3>1. Behavior and interest targeting</h3>
<p>All of the targeting that is housed in the Behaviors and Interests sections of the major platforms are based on actions those users have taken around the web, both on platform and not. The AI portion comes into play when Google, Facebook, Snap, or another platform analyzes those user patterns and then groups them into the targeting options you see in the Ad Manager.</p>
<p>On Facebook, we’re able to target users who are interested in Advertising and Marketing simply by checking a box. That opts us into targeting users who have “expressed an interest in or like pages related to” Advertising and Marketing. All determined by Facebook’s AI systems, which we typically refer to in the ad world as machine learning.</p>

<h3>2. Lookalike audiences</h3>
<p>For an even more automated approach, i.e., using even more AI/machine learning in targeting, advertisers can leverage a few tools that don’t even require behavior and interest selection.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-lookalike-audiences">Lookalike audiences</a> on Facebook have been around for a long time and are still one of the better-performing targeting options available on the platform, in my opinion. For this audience, advertisers need to create a seed audience of desirable users, whether it’s customers, pipeline, or some other high-value group, then Facebook will analyze that user group for patterns and create an audience that “looks like” them. Hence, lookalike audiences.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-lookalike-audience.webp" alt="" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92473" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-lookalike-audience.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-lookalike-audience-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Many other platforms have their own version of lookalike audiences, but they all work in about the same way.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/snapchat-lookalike-audience.webp" alt="snapchat lookalike audience set up" width="900" height="596" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92474" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/snapchat-lookalike-audience.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/snapchat-lookalike-audience-480x318.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>

<div id="automated-targeting-with-and-without-guidance"></div>
<h3>3. Automated targeting (with and without guidance)</h3>
<p>For the most AI-driven targeting, I want to use both Google and Facebook as examples.</p>
<p>In recent years, both have released new targeting types that work in a more novel way: Advertisers can suggest targeting that the platforms take into account, but they’re able to target anyone the algorithms believe is potentially going to drive performance.</p>
<p>For Facebook, this is called <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-targeting#:~:text=3.%20Meta%20Advantage%2B%20Facebook%20ad%20targeting">Advantage+ audience</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-advantage-plus-audience.webp" alt="facebook advantage+ audience" width="599" height="224" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92475" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-advantage-plus-audience.webp 599w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-advantage-plus-audience-480x179.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 599px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>When you opt in, you’re able to give suggestions for targeting, leveraging all of the regular tools you have at your disposal, including saved audiences, demographics, behaviors, interests, etc. As a note, Facebook will still honor all location and language targeting you set. This is not dynamic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-advantage-suggested-targeting.webp" alt="facebook advantage plus suggested targeting" width="606" height="319" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92476" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-advantage-suggested-targeting.webp 606w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-advantage-suggested-targeting-480x253.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 606px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Typically, the platform will start off by targeting your suggested users, but then expand beyond that list once it finds good patterns and sees results.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-audience-expansion.webp" alt="how facebook audience expansion works in advantage+" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92477" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-audience-expansion.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-audience-expansion-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Google’s offering is slightly different in that it doesn’t explicitly say it prioritizes the targeting you provide first while learning, but it’s known that it will go after <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/17/retargeting-campaign-tips">remarketing</a> audiences to see early performance.</p>
<p>This targeting option is also a full campaign type: <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/performance-max">Performance Max</a> or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/performance-max-lead-generation">PMax</a>. These campaigns run ads across all Google-owned properties and the Google Display Network, giving them the widest reach of all the campaign types on Google.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-placements.webp" alt="performance max placements" width="900" height="424" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92109" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-placements.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-placements-480x226.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>With Performance Max campaigns you’re given two tools to influence targeting.</p>
<p>First is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6KmVX6OnX4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search themes</a>. These do not operate quite like keywords, but instead let advertisers indicate search queries you believe your customers may be looking for. These are optional, just like all other suggested targeting in this section, and are additive to any of the machine learning Google uses to find your target audience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/performance-max-search-themes.webp" alt="performance max search themes" width="829" height="175" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92494" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/performance-max-search-themes.webp 829w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/performance-max-search-themes-480x101.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 829px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The second option is <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-performance-max-pre-launch-optimizations#:~:text=be%20shy%20with-,audience%20signals,-In%20the%20same">audience signals</a>. Rather than search queries, this section lets you use audience segments to influence PMax targeting. For this option, you can use your own audience signals from remarketing lists or data from Google like Demographics and Interests and detailed demographics targeting.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-audience-signal.webp" alt="google ads audience signal" width="830" height="451" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92495" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-audience-signal.webp 830w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-audience-signal-480x261.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 830px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>AI tactics for ad creative</h2>
<p>When it comes to the ad creatives themselves, there are a few ways the ad channels use AI to enhance the user experience.</p>
<div id="text-and-image-asset-creation"></div>
<h3>4. Text and image asset creation</h3>
<p>The simplest version of AI in ad creation happens across just about every platform now.</p>
<p>Whenever you begin creating a new ad in their editors, just about every platform will have some version of what you see above in Google Ads. The platforms will suggest text variations you can use in each of the different fields, usually based on the website you provided and other assets already in your account.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-ai-asset-suggestion.webp" alt="google ads ai asset suggestion" width="337" height="609" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92496" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-ai-asset-suggestion.webp 337w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-ai-asset-suggestion-166x300.webp 166w" sizes="(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px" /></p>
<p>Both Facebook and Google now take AI ad creation one step further and have tools that will generate imagery for your ads as well. For Facebook, this is done through <a href="http://www.meta.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.meta.ai</a>, and on Google, this can be found in the asset creation portion of the interface under “Generate Images.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-image-generator-ai.webp" alt="google ai image generator" width="900" height="335" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92497" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-image-generator-ai.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-image-generator-ai-480x179.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>With just a simple <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-image-prompts">prompt</a>, these platforms will create images for you to use in your ads, and you can tweak and adjust them to your heart&#8217;s content before you launch.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/meta-ai-images-example.webp" alt="example of ai-generated image on meta" width="900" height="417" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92498" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/meta-ai-images-example.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/meta-ai-images-example-480x222.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>

<div id="dynamic-service"></div>
<h3>5. Dynamic service</h3>
<p>Once your ads are created, depending on how many assets you included, many ad platforms also leverage machine learning to dynamically serve ads with the combination of assets they think will perform the best.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/11/responsive-search-ads-new-default-google-ads">responsive search ads</a> on Google, you’re given up to 15 headlines and four descriptions. Depending on how you’ve leveraged pins, Google can then create almost any combination of those assets to fill the three available headlines and two available descriptions for each ad.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/responsive-search-ads-wordstream.webp" alt="how responsive search ads work" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92499" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/responsive-search-ads-wordstream.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/responsive-search-ads-wordstream-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Facebook has a similar option with its ad creatives as well.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-asset-suggestions.webp" alt="facebook asset suggestion from ai" width="900" height="565" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92500" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-asset-suggestions.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-asset-suggestions-480x301.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Each time an ad auction takes place, the platforms use machine learning to dynamically generate an ad from your assets that it thinks will perform best for that given user, and is focused on achieving the stated goals of your campaign.</p>
<p>While this use of AI is entirely behind the scenes and out of your control, aside from the assets you provide, it’s a highly important and impactful use of AI in the ad platforms.</p>
<div id="ad-enhancements"></div>
<h3>6. Ad enhancements</h3>
<p>This last option is really just for Facebook at this point but is still important to point out. When you create ads on Facebook, you can opt into a number of what are called Enhancements.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-ad-enhancements.webp" alt="facebook ad enhancements" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92502" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-ad-enhancements.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-ad-enhancements-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>These are all options that Facebook can either adjust your current creative or add to it with additional media to enhance the user experience.</em></p>
<p>There are eight different options for enhancements, including music, site links, text overlays, visual touch-ups, 3D animation, text improvements, image animation, and brightness adjustments.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-ads-ai-music-creation.webp" alt="facebook ads ai music generation" width="900" height="752" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92555" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-ads-ai-music-creation.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-ads-ai-music-creation-480x401.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Some of these you simply opt into, like the brightness adjustment, but others you can specify how you want the enhancement to look, even going so far as to choose the text and colors as well as the music. So even though they’re “automatic” enhancements, you do have some level of control over a few of the options.</p>
<h2>AI features for bidding and budget controls</h2>
<p>The last portion of AI within the ad channels I want to address will be around all of the algorithmic inputs for bidding and budget controls. But before we get there, we need to address the performance prediction abilities within the platforms.</p>
<div id="predictive-performance-forecasting"></div>
<h3>7. Predictive performance forecasting</h3>
<p>No matter which ad channel you use, their backend platforms are always trying to determine what it thinks your performance will be based on factors from other campaigns. Those could be campaigns within your own account or from other businesses in a similar sector. That’s why the platforms are almost always providing some estimated performance metrics within their interfaces, even if you’ve never advertised before.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-ads-estimated-performance.webp" alt="facebook ads estimated performance" width="520" height="504" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92556" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-ads-estimated-performance.webp 520w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-ads-estimated-performance-480x465.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 520px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean you can’t have an impact here. If anything, it’s the opposite.</p>
<p>The more information you give the systems, the better they can perform. And I’m not talking about just giving the platforms more budget.</p>
<p>Although Google claims they don’t need any conversion volume to optimize your campaigns for performance, the truth is they will always do better when you have a solid foundation of conversions to go on. The more data, the better.</p>
<p>The same is true for Facebook. The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-learning-phase">Learning Phase</a> is a time period where the platform is still learning how to get the best performance from your ads, and conversion (or result) performance is a big portion of that.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-learning-phase-example.webp" alt="facebook learning phase example message" width="900" height="651" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92557" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-learning-phase-example.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-learning-phase-example-480x347.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>So, although the platforms are very smart and always looking to forecast performance in your campaigns, the best results will always come when you’re using actions that have lots of volume and good data associated with them.</p>
<div id="smart-bidding-strategies"></div>
<h3>8. Smart Bidding strategies</h3>
<p>As a result of the platforms having predictive performance models, they’re able to adjust your bids in real-time as you enter the auctions for different users.</p>
<p>Google Ads has quite a few automated bidding strategies that can optimize toward just about any performance outcome you’re looking for.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-bidding-strategies-smart.jpg" alt="google ads bidding strategies" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91784" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-bidding-strategies-smart.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-bidding-strategies-smart-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Facebook also has a couple of different options depending on if you’re looking for volume or profitability.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-ads-bidding-strategies-wordstream.webp" alt="facebook ads bidding strategies" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92558" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-ads-bidding-strategies-wordstream.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facebook-ads-bidding-strategies-wordstream-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>No matter which you choose, just as I mentioned before, make sure you’re providing the platforms with as much data as possible to help them see patterns and predict where to best serve your ads for optimal results.</p>
<div id="dynamic-budget-allocation"></div>
<h3>9. Dynamic budget allocation</h3>
<p>The last way we can use AI in the platforms is to let them determine where our budget gets allocated. I left this one for last as it’s the extension of basically all the other factors combined.</p>
<p>Based on the conversion performance we see in a given campaign and the forecast performance, the platforms have some settings to choose where our budget should be spent.</p>
<p>For Google Ads, this can be used via a Shared Budget. With Shared Budgets, you can combined multiple campaigns into a single budget, then Google will decide where to allocate the spend based on predicted performance. Rather than having $20/day allocated to each of five campaigns, you could have $100/day allocated across those campaigns, then let Google decide where those funds are best spend.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ads-shared-budgets-product-example.avif" alt="google ads shared budget - product structure" width="929" height="488" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90878" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ads-shared-budgets-product-example.avif 929w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ads-shared-budgets-product-example-300x158.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ads-shared-budgets-product-example-768x403.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ads-shared-budgets-product-example-480x252.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px" /></p>
<p>Facebook’s answer to this is called Advantage+ Campaign Budget. The same logic applies, just across the ad sets within a campaign. Rather than setting individual budgets, you can add a budget at the campaign level, then Facebook will dynamically adjust the spend across ad sets based on what’s been performing well and what’s expected to help reach your campaign goals.</p>

<h2>Take advantage of AI to give your ads a boost</h2>
<p>While there are always going to be much sexier versions of AI being talked about in external tools that may or may not cost money (like the new <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-max-for-search">AI Max for Search</a>), don’t lose sight of the fact that there’s plenty of AI functionality baked directly into the ad platforms themselves. Whether you realize it or not, those systems have likely been helping you achieve better results for a while now. Hopefully, highlighting how AI plays a role in the interface will help you see it and take better advantage of it for personalizing your ads in the future (and if you want more, see the experiment we ran to see <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-accurate-is-ai-for-ppc">which AI tools had the best PPC ad advice</a>).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A common critique of Performance Max campaigns (and many of the advertising updates from Google over the last decade, to be honest) is that they’re not well suited for generating leads. However, with recent PMax advancements, this is no longer the case.</p>
<p>Since the launch of Performance Max, there have been tons of updates to make generating leads easier using this particular campaign type. However, it’s still not a &#8220;set it and forget it&#8221; lead gen strategy. You&#8217;ll have to find ways to consistently optimize your PMax campaign so that it can acquire as many leads as possible.</p>
<p>Plus, in my opinion, it’s a good strategy to find ways Performance Max can work for you and your business because it’s never guaranteed that the other campaign options will continue to stick around.</p>
<p>So with that, let’s talk about the strategies you can use to make PMax impactful for lead generation.</p>

<div id="funnel-conversion-tracking"></div>
<h3>1. Use a full(er) funnel approach to conversion tracking</h3>
<p>We’re going to start at the most foundational part of a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/are-google-ads-worth-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign in Google Ads</a>: the campaign objectives and goals.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge I’ve seen with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-audit-pmax-display-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PMax campaigns for lead gen</a> is that they can definitely generate leads. The problem is that some of the leads are straight up crap.</p>
<p>While it’s true that you’ll need to technically generate leads with PMax to build a funnel, it’s a simple but important distinction to make the goal of the campaign something other than those form fills that correlate with leads.</p>
<p>The better approach is to set your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-performance-max/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PMax campaigns</a> to optimize for a qualified lead, or some other action that’s further down the funnel than the initial lead itself.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-pmax-lead-generation-conversion-funnel.webp" alt="pmax lead generation - conversion funnel" width="823" height="410" class="aligncenter wp-image-92487 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-pmax-lead-generation-conversion-funnel.webp 823w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-pmax-lead-generation-conversion-funnel-480x239.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 823px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>To do this, you’ll need to use some combination of enhanced conversions and offline conversion imports from your CRM.</p>
<p>This process can be a bit finicky to set up, but it will really pay off in the end. The outcome will be a Performance Max campaign that uses Google Ads’ machine learning to generate qualified leads for your business.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-performance-max-conversion-funnel.webp" alt="pmax lead generation - enhanced conversions" width="773" height="477" class="aligncenter wp-image-92483 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-performance-max-conversion-funnel.webp 773w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-performance-max-conversion-funnel-480x296.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 773px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="audience-signals-buyer-funnel"></div>
<h3>2. Use audience signals that match the buyer funnel</h3>
<p>Similar to choosing a performance goal that’s further down the funnel, we can also leverage audience signals that are further down the funnel.</p>
<p>With Performance Max campaigns, Google will start by targeting the audiences you provide it, then extend beyond those lists once it feels like it has a good understanding of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a> and can find similar users who are likely to complete your given campaign goal.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-performance-max-audience-data.webp" alt="google ads pmax -lead generation audience targets" width="806" height="447" class="aligncenter wp-image-92490 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-performance-max-audience-data.webp 806w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-performance-max-audience-data-480x266.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 806px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>To help them find higher-quality users who are more likely to convert on your down funnel actions, you should give it as qualified an audience as possible. Website visitors and lead form submissions aren’t enough.</p>
<p>Use your customer lists, qualified form fills, opportunities, and lost contracts. Yes, even lost contracts are qualified. They got all the way to the final stages of your sales cycle, so my guess is you wouldn’t mind having more of them.</p>
<p>Although there are lots of options you can choose from in the preset Google audiences like In-Market, Life Events, and Detailed Demographics, for the most part, I find these to be too broad for lead gen companies trying to drive high-quality leads. Like most things Google develops, they can be excellent for ecommerce, but lead gen is just a different beast. I’d recommend sticking to your own audiences with PMax.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-performance-max-audience-options.webp" alt="google ads performance max - lead generation" width="863" height="354" class="aligncenter wp-image-92489 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-performance-max-audience-options.webp 863w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-performance-max-audience-options-480x197.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 863px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="search-themes-buyer-behavior"></div>
<h3>3. Leverage search themes based on buyer behavior</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/11/search-themes-for-performance-max-campaigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Search themes</a> operate similarly to keywords in search, but not exactly the same. They help guide Google to certain themes your audience may search. They have the same prioritization as phrase and broad match terms in Search campaigns, but will be outranked by your exact match keywords.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-performance-max-search-themes-1024x221.webp" alt="google ads performance max - search themes" width="1024" height="221" class="aligncenter wp-image-92488 size-large" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-performance-max-search-themes-1024x221.webp 1024w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-performance-max-search-themes-980x211.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-performance-max-search-themes-480x103.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For this reason, have a robust <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/offset-lower-website-traffic">search account set up</a> with exact match terms in place. Not just phrase and broad, even though Google prefers them. Let your Search campaigns tackle the exact match versions of your keywords, even if it will be to the detriment of PMax performance.</p>
<p>Instead, use PMax to find incremental conversions (remember, those high-quality, bottom-funnel conversions).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-pmax-bidding-priority.webp" alt="google ads pmax - bidding priority" width="793" height="451" class="aligncenter wp-image-92493 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-pmax-bidding-priority.webp 793w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-pmax-bidding-priority-480x273.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 793px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>To do this with search themes, create tightly themed asset groups, just like you would with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keywords in search</a>. Too often, advertisers will throw all their high-volume keywords into a single asset group, no themes included, and hope for the best.</p>
<p>With tightly themed groups, you’ll have a narrower focus for Google to go off of and have a better chance of finding the right type of users when they&#8217;re in the right state of mind.</p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW72712104 BCX0"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW72712104 BCX0"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/26a1.png" alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><span class="EOP SCXW72712104 BCX0" data-ccp-props="{}"> Could you be getting more out of your Google Ads PMax campaigns?</span></span></span></strong> Find out with an instant account report from our free <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads Grader</a>!</p>
<div id="negative-keywords-low-quality"></div>
<h3>4. Use negative keywords to exclude low-quality users</h3>
<p>Google didn’t have negative keywords in the initial version of PMax. Since then, they’ve slowly rolled out increasing options for negative keywords. As of early 2025, advertisers now have the ability to add up to 1,000 negative keywords at the campaign level to a PMax campaign, giving quite a bit of control over which search terms you show for.</p>
<p>To generate high-quality leads with PMax, there’s a simple rule: take full advantage of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/06/negative-keyword-guide">negative keywords</a>. This includes all of the regular, foundational negatives you likely have in your existing Search campaigns (read: the ones that are irrelevant to your business), but it also should include relevant, but lower quality queries. Make sure you’re focusing on the users with high intent and excluding those who are just window shoppers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-negative-keywords-.webp" alt="google ads performance max lead generation - negative keywords" width="707" height="623" class="aligncenter wp-image-92491 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-negative-keywords-.webp 707w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/google-ads-negative-keywords--480x423.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 707px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="asset-groups-personas"></div>
<h3>5. Treat asset groups like personas on LinkedIn or Meta</h3>
<p>PMax campaigns operate similarly to a social media campaign in that they have a broad network reach, and each asset group houses a different set of audiences and contextual targets. Put that structure to work, similar to how you would in LinkedIn or Meta Ads.</p>
<p>Use each asset group as a different persona: have the proper audience signals that align with those users, layer in any specific demographics or interests that match, include the proper <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/11/search-themes-for-performance-max-campaigns">search themes</a> they would be looking for (make a couple asset groups to target drastically different search themes if you need to), and tailor the creative assets to the messaging that would resonate best with this specific persona.</p>
<p>If need be, you can use Google’s AI tools to help you develop creative assets based on your website. There have been some great advancements in how this works, and it can help you better tailor your asset groups to each persona without taxing your design department too heavily. There’s even a portion for brand guidelines below where you can control your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/small-business-logo">logos</a>, color schemes, and more.</p>

<h2>Turn your Performance Max campaign into a lead-generating powerhouse</h2>
<p>While high-quality lead generation can be tough with Performance Max right out of the box, that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. There are plenty of tools and strategies available for you to leverage Google’s machine learning while also finding users who are a good match for your company, not just more empty form fills (while you&#8217;re at it, check out this guide to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/gmail-ads">Gmail Ads</a>).

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lead generation ads are one of my favorite formats across all paid media channels. I’ve been using them ever since they launched and have seen great results for all kinds of businesses.</p>
<p>A common struggle I hear is that people can set up and launch Facebook lead generation campaigns, but they’re unsure how to optimize them afterward. While every business is different, you likely fit into one of two categories when trying to optimize your Facebook lead ads. You either want more leads or higher lead quality.</p>
<p>In this article, I’ll talk about strategies that can help you achieve whatever you’re interested in, as well as some best practices for everyone to pay attention to.</p>

<h2>How to optimize Facebook lead ads</h2>
<p>Use these five<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/24/facebook-lead-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Facebook lead ad optimization strategies</a> to help your business source more high-quality leads from<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-advertise-on-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the Meta Ads platform</a>.</p>
<div id="how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-ad-text-creative"></div>
<h3>1. Focus on your ad text and creative</h3>
<p>Before we get to the form itself, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/24/facebook-lead-ad-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your Facebook lead ad copy and creative</a> are an important starting place. This is the impression you’re going to make on your audience, and it needs to align with your optimization goal.</p>
<h4>Facebook lead ad copy and creative tips for everyone</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use highly engaging visuals</strong>: This could be for static images, carousels, or video. Make sure you’re standing out from the crowd.</li>
<li><strong>Make the most of your copy</strong>: Use emojis or numbers in text to stand out.</li>
<li><strong>Test different text lengths</strong>: All industries and customer personas are different. Some want longer copy, others want something more succinct. Test different permutations and see what works best for your folks.</li>
<li><strong>Use vibrant, contrasting colors</strong>: More often than not, the ads I see work best have some sort of high contrast in the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/website-color-scheme" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> color scheme</a>. This creates a harsh experience that can often get users to stop scrolling and see what your ad is about.</li>
<li><strong>Format creatives for each placement size</strong>: There are lots of different placements on the Meta network, and they let you upload custom creatives for each. There’s no reason you should deal with dead space around the top and bottom, or sides of your visual assets. Try <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-image-prompts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using AI to create and upload images or videos</a> that fit each dimension for each placement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Use the power of AI to optimize your Facebook lead ads</strong> with our free guide on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/ai-advertising?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_AIAdvertising_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener">key ways to use AI in Google and Facebook Ads</a>!</p>
<h4>How to adjust your Facebook assets for higher lead volume</h4>
<p>To get more form fills, you need more people clicking on your ads. To <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/14/improve-google-ads-click-through-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improve click-through rate</a>, try some of these tactics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make your ads broadly appealing</strong>: Try to strike a tone of “all are welcome.”</li>
<li><strong>Change your offer</strong>: Test different things to give away. What does your audience want the most that you’re willing to “give away”? If you’re not seeing the volume you want, you might need to have something more appealing.</li>
<li><strong>Play on your audience&#8217;s emotions</strong>: If someone is going to work with you, are they happy, sad, fearful? While I would suggest you use some level of discretion so as not to be manipulative, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using emotion</a> in ads can get users to engage and convert more.</li>
<li><strong>Use social proof or industry awards:</strong> Showcase yourself through either reviews from your customers or awards you’ve won for your business. These help you differentiate yourselves from your competition and show that others think your products or services are high value.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How to optimize your Facebook ad copy and creative for better lead quality</h4>
<p>For <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-quality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher-quality leads</a>, our tactics need to be a bit different. We still want highly attractive and engaging creatives, but there are some tweaks on the theme to attract only the right users. The biggest thing to remember with tactics to improve lead quality is that you’ll almost always see less overall lead volume, but your percentage of high-quality leads should be better, bringing up your batting average.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tell your audience who you’re a good fit for:</strong> Speak only to the users you want to engage with. If your product only works for certain groups of people, call that out. Have a minimum spend on our site that lower budget folks can’t afford? Make that known.</li>
<li><strong>Incorporate your ideal persona in creatives</strong>: Don&#8217;t stop at ad text. If you’re able to visually showcase your actual target audience, do that in the imagery.</li>
<li><strong>Change your offer to fit a narrower one</strong>: Move away from the “everyone is welcome” offer and promote something only a serious buyer would want.</li>
</ul>
<div id="how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-type"></div>
<h3>2. Choose the right form type</h3>
<p>Whenever you build a new lead gen form on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/scale-meta-ads-with-first-party-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Ads</a>, the first choice you have is what type of form you want to use. There are two choices for this: <strong>more volume</strong> and <strong>higher intent</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-type.webp" alt="how to optimize facebook lead ads - form type screenshot" width="849" height="267" class="aligncenter wp-image-92265 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-type.webp 849w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-type-480x151.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 849px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>More volume Facebook lead ad forms</h4>
<p>The “more volume” option is going to align perfectly with anyone trying to get a higher number of lead-gen forms submitted to their campaigns. This form, as Meta says, is quick to fill out and submit on a mobile device.</p>
<p>There are almost no breakpoints with these forms (the only exception would be with your question strategy, which we’ll get to in a minute). These should be free-flowing and easy to zip right through.</p>
<h4>Higher quality Facebook lead ad forms</h4>
<p>While the options for this form are almost identical to the more volume option, a &#8220;higher Intent&#8221; form adds a step in the form submission process that acts as a speed bump for the user.</p>
<p>During this review step, the user can see their information based on the answers they provided to the questions and is reminded that the information they see is going to be submitted to your business. Additionally, the user has to slide the submit arrow rather than simply clicking a Submit button. A subtle change, but a meaningful one.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form.webp" alt="optimize facebook lead ads - user answer review options" width="850" height="409" class="aligncenter wp-image-92271 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form.webp 850w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/optimize-facebook-lead-ads-form-480x231.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 850px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This review step, while fairly basic, does a good job of reminding the user what this form is for and scaring off users who are less serious about engaging with a company. Just like I warned above, you’ll likely see fewer form fills with a higher intent form type, but the users who do submit should be higher quality since they were given the option to back out and didn’t.</p>

<h3>3. Create a form intro section that pops</h3>
<p>The intro of a lead gen form gives even more text space for you to set the stage for your potential customers. Think of this greeting in much the same way you thought about the ad copy and creative itself.</p>

<h4>Facebook lead ad form greeting tips for everyone</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using the ad image is fine: </strong>If you have the design capabilities and bandwidth and want to design new images for the forms, that’s great. They likely will perform really well. But I’ve been using the same image from the ads for a long time and haven’t seen any slowdown in performance because of it. We talk a lot about making sure your ads look their best in all placements, and this is one of them, but this is likely one of the few scenarios that you can let it slide.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-.webp" alt="how to optimize facebook lead ads - background image for form intro" width="711" height="361" class="aligncenter wp-image-92266 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-.webp 711w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads--480x244.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 711px, 100vw" /></li>
<li><strong>Set the stage in the greeting</strong>: Let the user know who they’re engaging with and what they’ll receive in return once they fill out the form. This should be a continuation of the messaging in your ad creative, but you get more of an opportunity to talk to your prospective customers.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ad-tips.webp" alt="how to optimize facebook lead ads - form greeting" width="705" height="501" class="aligncenter wp-image-92267 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ad-tips.webp 705w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ad-tips-480x341.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 705px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>How to make your Facebook lead ad form intro appeal to more people</h4>
<p>If you’re aiming for more volume, the best thing you can do in this section is to echo the same “all are welcome” message you used in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/03/ad-copy-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ad copy</a>.</p>
<p>That said, if you’re really trying to limit the friction in your lead gen forms, you could test not using the greeting text at all and sticking only with the image. There’s a blue toggle in the upper right of the greeting where you can turn it off, and users will go straight from the image to the form fields.</p>
<h4>How to make your form greeting attract more high-quality leads</h4>
<p>To improve lead quality, I suggest you use the greeting every time and use it to further prequalify your customers. Keep adding information that will help weed out the users who are less serious and focus only on those with higher intent.</p>
<div id="how-to-optimize-facebook-lead-ads-question-strategy"></div>
<h3>4. Add the right questions to your form</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve got the form type down, the biggest differentiator in optimizing your Facebook lead ads is going to be the questions you add to your forms. Everything matters in this section, from the types of questions you ask to the substance of them. Note: Only ask for relevant information! No matter your end goal, keep your questions focused on data points that are most important for you to know or helpful to your sales teams. Don’t get distracted.</p>
<h4>Optimize your Facebook lead ad form questions for increased lead volume</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on the prefill questions:</strong> All questions in this section will be auto-filled by Meta if it knows the information based on someone’s profile information. By using these questions, you’ll limit the work your audience has to do to fill out the form since there’s a higher likelihood of the information populating for them in the form.</li>
<li><strong>Ask fewer questions:</strong> The fewer questions you ask (or the less amount of information you ask for), the better chance you’ll see an increase in volume. Depending on your business, you might be able to get away with only a first name and phone number or a name and email. Even a form with two fields can be valuable if you have the right follow-up in place.</li>
<li><strong>Keep the information high level:</strong> Using prefill questions can help, but the less invasive you are in the form, the more likely you are to get users to fill it out. If your sales team is willing and able to get the other needed information out of the customers on the phone, then keep it simple here and let them do their thing.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ads-contact-form.webp" alt="optimize facebook leads - contact field option" width="733" height="666" class="aligncenter wp-image-92264 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ads-contact-form.webp 733w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ads-contact-form-480x436.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 733px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Try question strategies to get higher-quality leads</h4>
<p>We’re gonna take pretty much everything from the “more volume” section here and turn it on its head.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leverage the custom questions:</strong> Make the user think about their answer and type something in, or make a choice. Everything in the questions section is going to require you to craft the question and provide the space for the answers. Or, in the case of multiple choice, you get to select the possible answers too.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ads-question-logic.webp" alt="optimize facebook lead ads - conditional logic" width="803" height="367" class="aligncenter wp-image-92268 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ads-question-logic.webp 803w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/facebook-lead-ads-question-logic-480x219.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 803px, 100vw" /></li>
<li><strong>Ask more questions:</strong> Follow the best practice of keeping all questions relevant, but ask for more in the form. Users who are less serious won’t want to take the time to answer five or more questions.</li>
<li><strong>Get the details in the form:</strong> Do the job of a salesperson. Ask about the budget, timeline, and other important details right in the form. The serious buyer knows this information is necessary for you to do your job, so they’re willing to share it.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage conditional logic:</strong> In the first image of this section, you can see there’s a toggle in the upper right for conditional logic. With this activated, you can choose how the form will react based on how the user interacts with it. You can either send them a follow-up question, complete and submit the form, or send the user to an end page and not submit the form. This lets you create an entire experience directly in the form and allows them to choose the next step.</li>
<li><strong>Give the user an out:</strong> While it might seem strange to let people opt out of submitting the form, it’s actually in your best interest. Many times, forms get opened by accident, and the user isn’t sure how they got there. In your questions, specifically multiple choice, give the option (or something similar to) “I’m not interested,” then send the user to an end screen. They’re let off the hook in a nice way, and your sales team isn’t reaching out to folks who don’t want to talk to them.</li>
</ul>

<div id="master-lead-follow-up-strategy"></div>
<h3>5. Master your lead follow up</h3>
<p>Your job isn’t finished once you receive someone’s form. It’s on<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/11/03/lead-nurturing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> your nurture sequences</a> and sales team to close the leads that are coming through from your campaigns. For this stage, we don’t really have any different strategies for volume or quality plays, but here are some overall best practices that you should be doing when you generate leads through Meta Ads.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Offer a timely follow-up:</strong> As crazy as it sounds, if you’re not following up with your lead gen form submissions within about 24-48 hours, they’re likely going to forget they interacted with you in the first place. Be sure to reach out as soon as possible to keep the user engaged with your company, whether it’s through an email nurture sequence or a sales call follow-up.</li>
<li><strong>Make the next step logical and meaningful</strong>: Speaking of that next step, make sure it’s the right fit for your initial call to action. Someone who downloaded an infographic likely doesn’t want to talk to a salesperson right away. On the flip side, someone who opted for a demo likely doesn’t want to get tons of content from you right away. Use your follow-up to further the conversation with the potential customer in a logical way; don’t jump around the funnel too much.</li>
<li><strong>Remove users after a period of time</strong>: Regardless of how interested they were when they filled out the form, there are going to be people who simply don’t want to engage anymore for one reason or another. Set up safeguards to remove people from sales call sheets and email nurtures after a certain amount of time with no activity. It’ll save your team&#8217;s time and not leave a bad taste in the potential customer’s mouth.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It happens all the time. You do your best to build out a set of campaigns in Google Ads that follow industry best practices and that are aimed at your goals, but you just aren’t seeing the results you’re looking for. So what do you do?</p>
<p>Luckily, there are some pretty common issues that arise to cause poor performance and, for the most part, they can be pretty easily addressed assuming you’re willing to put in a little elbow grease.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of the things you should be looking at to get your performance turned around and make sure you’re hitting the goals you’re out to achieve.</p>

<h2>How to fix poor-performing Google Ads in 7 steps</h2>
<p>Follow these steps to turn your performance around.</p>
<div id="check-your-conversion-tracking-setup"></div>
<h3>1. Check your conversion tracking setup</h3>
<p>A foundational aspect of paid media campaigns is their trackability. It’s one of the key factors that sets these campaigns apart from other tactics. But it can also be a very easy mistake to overlook when trying to figure out why performance isn’t where you want it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-active-conversion-settings.webp" alt="conversion settings in google ads showing status" width="900" height="350" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92102" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-active-conversion-settings.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-active-conversion-settings-480x187.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Whenever I have a campaign that has started performing poorly, or that has never performed well, I always go back and check on the conversion tracking setup to ensure everything is working well. Only when that’s confirmed do I move on to other potential issues.</p>
<h4><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Action items</h4>
<ul>
<li>Confirm your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/14/how-to-use-google-tag-manager">Google Tag</a> is on all pages of your website.</li>
<li>Confirm your conversion pixels are firing on the right pages or events for all individual conversion actions on your site.</li>

<div id="look-into-your-goal-optimization-settings"></div>
<h3>2. Look into your goal optimization settings</h3>
<p>Just because your conversion actions are firing properly doesn’t mean we’re finished with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/17/how-to-set-up-google-ads-enhanced-conversions">conversion action setup</a>. Depending on how you have your account set up, you can be either prioritizing or de-prioritizing different conversion events.</p>
<p>Here are three things to look into:</p>
<h4>Account default goals</h4>
<p>In the conversion manager, each action item is organized into a conversion category. That conversion category is then considered either an account default goal, meaning the conversion actions in that category will be counted in the conversions column, or not.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-account-default-goals.webp" alt="google ads account default goals" width="900" height="350" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92103" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-account-default-goals.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-account-default-goals-480x187.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If the conversion actions you’re trying to optimize for are not in an account default goal category, then you may need to make some adjustments. (There are other settings you can use to overcome this that we’ll cover soon.)</p>
<h4>Secondary vs. Primary goals</h4>
<p>Issues can arise when your conversion action is set to a Secondary goal rather than a Primary one. Primary goals are counted in the conversions column and used as optimization events for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-smart-bidding">Smart Bidding</a>, but Secondary actions are not used as optimization signals and are only counted in the All Conversions column&#8211;not Conversions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-secondary-goal.webp" alt="google ads secondary goal" width="786" height="498" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92105" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-secondary-goal.webp 786w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-secondary-goal-480x304.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 786px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Individual campaign setting goals</h4>
<p>At the campaign level, advertisers can opt to use account-level or campaign-level conversions. If your campaigns are set up to focus on conversions that are different from your account-level goals, that could also be causing issues in performance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-campaign-specific-conversion-goals.webp" alt="google ads campaign specific goal" width="900" height="317" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92106" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-campaign-specific-conversion-goals.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-campaign-specific-conversion-goals-480x169.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Action items</h4>
<ul>
<li>Confirm all conversion tracking is working properly.</li>
<li>Ensure all account default goals are set up to your liking.</li>
<li>Make sure all goals are assigned either Primary or Secondary status as needed.</li>
<li>Don’t forget to confirm that all campaign-level settings are in line with your goals.</li>
</ul>
<div id="adjust-your-bid-strategies"></div>
<h3>3. Adjust your bid strategies</h3>
<p>All of the Google Ads bid strategies are designed to do a very specific thing, so if you’re using the wrong one, it could be causing issues.</p>
<p>For the most part, all of these bid strategies are pretty self-explanatory. Maximize Conversions and Maximize Conversion Value work to get you good results, but sometimes they can be less efficient than those same bid strategies with additional controls like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/google-retiring-tcpa-troas">tCPA and tROAS</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-bidding-strategies-smart.jpg" alt="google ads bidding strategies" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91784" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-bidding-strategies-smart.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-bidding-strategies-smart-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But in addition to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/19/google-ads-automated-bidding">picking the right bid strategy</a>, it’s also important to make sure the bid strategy is set up for success. Smart Bidding requires enough success points and wiggle room to see results.</p>
<p>Here are some common problems we see with bid strategies that hinder performance:</p>
<h4>Unrealistic goals</h4>
<p>While we would all like to have extremely high ROAS or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead">super low CPLs</a>, that doesn’t mean they’re realistic and achievable in the long run. To help keep your goals realistic, start out with targets that are in line with your performance as a business.</p>
<p>If your entire site sees a 300% ROI, then 300% is likely a reasonable ROAS to set. When you leverage unrealistic goals, like 1,000% ROAS on a site with 300% ROI, you’ll stifle the bid strategy, and it will slowly stop serving ads since it likely can’t hit your target.</p>
<h4>Limited performance indicators</h4>
<p>A common issue I see with bid strategies centers around the volume of conversions being tracked. A general rule of thumb is one conversion per day.</p>

<p>If your account (not campaign, account) isn’t averaging at least 30 conversions in 30 days, then you might not have enough volume to optimize for that action.</p>
<p>Without those positive indicators coming in regularly, Google won’t get enough positive signals that a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization-marketing">click leads to a conversion</a> and will, again, slowly stop serving ads.</p>
<h4>Restricted budgets</h4>
<p>Even if you have realistic goals and enough conversion volume, keeping your budget too low can cause issues. Yes, we know Google always tells you to increase your budget, but this could be a performance killer.</p>
<p>If your target CPL is $100, but your daily budget is only $50, then you’re setting that campaign up to hit only one conversion every couple of days, falling below our regular rule of thumb.</p>
<h4>Not adjusting bid strategies with time</h4>
<p>Just because a bid strategy works for you for a time, that doesn’t mean it will work forever. You may need to change bid strategies or tweak the settings for that bid strategy over time. These require regular maintenance and adjustment right alongside all the other aspects within your account.</p>

<h3>4. Evaluate your targeting</h3>
<p>There are tons of different types of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-audience-targeting">targeting options in Google Ads</a>, and depending on what your goals are, many of them can cause issues with your performance.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look into a few targeting options to evaluate:</p>
<h4>Keyword match types</h4>
<p>Even though Google loves them, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/29/succeed-with-google-ads-broad-match">Broad match terms</a> can reach a very wide range of users. They have the widest reach of all the match types and can end up showing for quite a bit of traffic that isn’t relevant to your business. Broad match isn’t categorically bad, but without oversight, it can get out of hand very quickly.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/keyword-match-types-broad-match-png.webp" alt="keyword match types chart with arrow pointing to broad match" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90367" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/keyword-match-types-broad-match-png.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/keyword-match-types-broad-match-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Performance Max</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/01/is-performance-max-right-for-you">Performance Max</a> targets users across all networks within the Google Ads ecosystem, and each of those placements has their own set of best practices when it comes to targeting.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-placements.webp" alt="performance max placements" width="900" height="424" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92109" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-placements.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-placements-480x226.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Within the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/23/optimize-performance-max-campaigns">Performance Max campaign setup</a>, you have some controls over where you show, but they’re less specific than other campaign types. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/11/search-themes-for-performance-max-campaigns">Search themes</a> are just suggestions, not keywords. Audience signals are just a starting point for targeting, not exclusive targeting settings that Google stays within.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-search-themes.webp" alt="google performance max search themes" width="900" height="728" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92110" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-search-themes.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/performance-max-search-themes-480x388.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Without full control over those targeting settings, you could see good results from Google’s machine learning, or you could struggle to hit goals as their system gets further from your intended targets.</p>
<h4>Optimized targeting</h4>
<p>In Display campaigns, there’s a setting that operates similarly to the expansion tactics in Performance Max&#8211;<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/22/google-ads-optimized-targeting">Optimized Targeting</a>. The difference is that you can opt out of this within Display campaigns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-display-optimized-targeting.png" alt="google display optimized targeting" width="900" height="295" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92111" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-display-optimized-targeting.png 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-display-optimized-targeting-480x157.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Google will warn you that your campaigns might not perform as well, but if the expansion is the reason for the low performance, then you’re likely on the right path.</p>
<h4><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Action items</h4>
<ul>
<li>Review your targeting to ensure you’re reaching the right people.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/search-term">Review search queries</a> to determine if your match types need to be tightened up.</li>
<li>Opt out of Optimized Targeting for Display campaigns.</li>
<li>Test using other campaign types other than Performance Max.</li>
</ul>
<div id="determine-whether-or-not-you-have-segment-inefficiencies"></div>
<h3>5. Determine whether or not you have segment inefficiencies</h3>
<p>Expanding on the idea of targeting inefficiencies, some pockets of performance aren’t necessarily targeting but are still sneaky subsets of targeting that can drive your account to underperform.</p>
<h4>Network problems</h4>
<p>For Search campaigns, you can opt into the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-search-partner-insights">Search Partner Network</a>, which is an expanded network of listings on sites other than Google, but powered by Google Search. These placements can range from totally legit to completely sketchy.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-network-segmentation-report.webp" alt="google ads network segmentation report" width="900" height="298" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92112" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-network-segmentation-report.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-network-segmentation-report-480x159.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Whenever I have bad performance in a Search campaign, one of the first places I look is at the Search Partner performance. On the campaigns tab, just segment your data by Network, and you’ll see how it’s doing compared to regular Google Search.</p>
<p>If things look bad, you can opt out in your campaign settings.</p>
<p>While we’re here, this brings up another Network issue. By default, Google will opt Search campaigns into the Display Network. Please, please, please, don’t do this. If you want a cross-platform campaign, use Performance Max. Just uncheck this box every time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-display-network-opt-out.webp" alt="opt out of google display network" width="900" height="234" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92113" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-display-network-opt-out.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-display-network-opt-out-480x125.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Device performance</h4>
<p>Another segment you can check on is Device. If you’re alive in 2025, you’re probably more than aware of the differences between being on a mobile device vs. a computer vs. a tablet vs. a television. Those differences can cause performance variance between the device categories.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Google has kind of buried the Device report in the newly rearranged interface. You can find your accounts’ device performance in the Insights and Reports section, in the When and Where Ads Showed report, then choose the Devices tab. Depending on the other settings for your campaign, you can either opt out of a device category as a whole or you can adjust your bids to be more or less aggressive for a specific device category.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-device-performance.webp" alt="google ads device performance" width="900" height="390" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92114" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-device-performance.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-device-performance-480x208.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Additional segments to review</h4>
<p>Other categories that are good to check include your Ad Scheduling, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/17/google-ads-location-targeting">Location targeting</a>, and Audience segments. These can each be found in different sections of the interface and don’t typically have runaway poor performance, but each could be the key to finding smaller-scale inefficiencies that cause performance to be lower than desired.</p>
<h4><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Action items</h4>
<ul>
<li>Keep Search campaigns focused on Search and opt out of the Display network.</li>
<li>Understand how different device categories, locations, ad schedules, and audience segments are performing in your account and adjust as needed.</li>
</ul>
<div id="assess-your-copy-and-landing-pages"></div>
<h3>6. Assess your copy and landing pages</h3>
<p>Google Ads campaigns definitely have lots of technical considerations that go into them to see good performance. The previous sections should highlight that pretty well.</p>
<p>But these campaigns also require you to have a personal marketing touch, which means the content and designs that feed your campaigns need to be compelling and user-friendly.</p>
<p>One problem area can be your ad copy. If your ads aren’t coherent and or action-oriented, you likely won’t see good results. There are tons of resources available that can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-copy">help you write great ads</a>. Just take advantage.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-benchmarks-example-ads-on-serp.webp" alt="google ads benchmarks - example ad serp" width="800" height="379" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91526" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-benchmarks-example-ads-on-serp.webp 800w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/google-ads-benchmarks-example-ads-on-serp-480x227.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Get <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/24/google-ads-examples">Google Ads examples</a> here for inspiration.</em></p>
<p>The same goes for your landing page. If the landing page is particularly slow, light on details, or is laid out confusingly, you’re likely not going to see the conversions you want from your campaigns. Again, there are <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/adwords-landing-page">so</a> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/15/landing-page-best-practices">many</a> <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/10/high-converting-landing-pages">resources</a> available for you to review to get ideas.</p>

<h3>7. Get on a good optimization schedule</h3>
<p>Just because you put in all that time and effort to launch a shiny new campaign strategy doesn’t mean it’s going to perform well forever. These are living, breathing things and need to be regularly maintained to see good results.</p>
<h4>Regular optimizations</h4>
<p>If you’re not regularly optimizing your account, you’re likely going to see issues. The good news is that the regular cadence of optimizations addresses many of the points in this post, but also, WordStream has a ton of posts that you can review to see all sorts of things you should be doing to your accounts at all times.</p>

</ul>
<h4>Automated optimizations</h4>
<p>Although you might think it’s in your best interest, one of the other problems I regularly see with accounts is when optimizations are left to the machines. Despite what they may say, Google doesn’t always know what your goals are with their automated optimizations. Some of them can be good, but without regular human oversight, they can “optimize” your account right into the ground.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-automated-optimizations.webp" alt="google ads automated optimizations option" width="900" height="245" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92116" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-automated-optimizations.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-automated-optimizations-480x131.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The Auto Apply Recommendations within Google Ads are easily turned off by visiting the Recommendations tab, then clicking the Auto-apply icon in the upper right of the screen, then turning off any or all of the automatic updates.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/turn-off-automated-optimizations.webp" alt="how to turn off automated optimizations in google ads" width="900" height="528" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92117" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/turn-off-automated-optimizations.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/turn-off-automated-optimizations-480x282.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There are also Automated <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-assets">Assets</a> that Google opts every account into that you can remove. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJKIe7c-9W8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">These have a few more hidden steps to deactivate</a>, but can be well worth it.</p>
<h4><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Action items</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create a regular cadence of tasks to execute on your account and stick to it.</li>
<li>Don’t let Google make changes on your behalf that you’re not aware of. Opt out of the recommendations you don’t want and keep the ones you’re okay with.</li>
<li>Do the same for Automatically Applied Assets and make sure all customer-facing messaging is approved by you.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What are Google Ads assets, and when can you use them?</h3>
<p>Google Ads assets are additional features you can tack onto your ads to make them more clickable, eye-catching, and actionable.</p>
<p>As you can see in the image below, there are quite a number of assets you can use to enhance your ads on Google, and in many instances, you can have multiple assets show at the same time, compounding their impact.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-menu-chart.webp" alt="google ads assets - asset options" width="942" height="105" class="aligncenter wp-image-92010 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-menu-chart.webp 942w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-menu-chart-480x54.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 942px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>No matter the asset you’re leveraging, each has options for where it can be applied in your account.</p>
<p>There are three levels of application: account, campaign, and ad group.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-levels.webp" alt="google ads asset assignment levels" width="566" height="360" class="aligncenter wp-image-91977 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-levels.webp 566w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-levels-480x305.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 566px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>While some assets can only be applied at certain levels, for the most part, your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/24/ppc-account-structure">account structure</a> is going to be the main determining factor as to which level you should choose for each of these.</p>
<p>If you have campaigns that are broken up by product groups and the assets you’re developing need to speak to those groups specifically, and there isn’t room for cross-promotion, you may need to stick to campaign-level assets.</p>
<p>If your account only sells one product or service and all your assets can apply to every campaign, ad group, and keyword you have, then the account level is likely good enough.</p>

<h3>Business name</h3>
<p>The<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/08/business-name-ideas" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> business name</a> asset is pretty straightforward. It’s simply your legal business name, and it must match either the name of the business as you have registered it with Google or your website domain. The challenge for some businesses is that you only have 25 characters, so depending on which source you’re using and how long your business name is, you may need to use one or the other.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-business-name.webp" alt="google ads assets - business name" width="422" height="379" class="aligncenter wp-image-91976 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-business-name.webp 422w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-business-name-300x269.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px" /></p>
<p>Business name assets can be applied to either the account or campaign level, so depending on how your account is set up and what you’re advertising, you may need to use one versus the other. That said, at the account level, you can only have one business name. Typically, this is an account-level setting, and it applies across all campaigns, resulting in a one-on-one process.</p>
<div id="business-logo"></div>
<h3>Business logo</h3>
<p>A<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-logo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> business logo</a> Google Ads asset is a small image that accompanies your ad, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/small-business-logo">highlighting your logo</a>. This image needs to be square and should not contain any text. Just like the business name asset, logo assets can be added at the campaign or account level, but you can only have one at the account level.</p>
<p>In the image below, the logo would be in the place of the green circle on both desktop and mobile.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-business-logo.webp" alt="google ads asset - business logo" width="852" height="333" class="aligncenter wp-image-91975 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-business-logo.webp 852w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-business-logo-480x188.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 852px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>While you can only have one asset at the account level, it may make sense to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/website-color-scheme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">change out the color scheme</a> every once in a while and see what performs best. Most companies have a dark version and a light version of their logo icon. That would be a great test to see if one or the other has an impact on performance.</p>
<div id="sitelinks"></div>
<h3>Sitelinks</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/09/06/sitelink-extensions-dos-and-donts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sitelinks</a> are one of the most customizable assets you can have run with your ads, and, in my opinion, they&#8217;re non-negotiable for search campaigns. They’re additional snippets of text you can use to enhance your ad, but they are also clickable and can send users to a different landing page on your site, depending on the content of the sitelink itself.</p>
<p>Specifically, each time sitelinks are shown, you can only have one instance of a single landing page.</p>
<p>So in the image below for Kohl’s, each line starting at “Save More With Clearance” is a different sitelink, and each of them takes you to a different landing page. As you can see, these can gain you quite a bit of real estate on the SERPs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-sitelinks.webp" alt="google ads assets - sitelinks" width="728" height="624" class="aligncenter wp-image-91974 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-sitelinks.webp 728w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-sitelinks-480x411.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 728px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>When creating a new sitelink, Google gives you a headline of 25 characters, then two optional description lines of 35 characters each. Google recommends you use those description lines, and so do I.</p>
<p>Sometimes, sitelinks appear without descriptions, but when they do, as in the Kohl’s example, they can have a significant impact.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-sitelink-settings.webp" alt="google ads assets - how to set up sitelinks" width="423" height="524" class="aligncenter wp-image-91973 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-sitelink-settings.webp 423w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-sitelink-settings-242x300.webp 242w" sizes="(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px" /></p>
<p>Sitelinks can be added to all three levels in an account: account, campaign, or ad group level. You can have as many sitelinks in an account, campaign, or ad group as you want, but typically only two to eight will show up (with usually only two to four sitelinks showing at a time).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yl5IeOuQqi8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here are some ideas for sitelinks</a> you can use to get started:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business information:</strong> &#8220;About us&#8221; page, &#8220;our story&#8221; page</li>
<li><strong>Category pages:</strong> Mens/womens/kids departments, shoes versus clothes</li>
<li><strong>Product pages:</strong> When possible, highlight specific products</li>
<li><strong>Social proof:</strong> &#8220;Reviews&#8221; page, customer stories, industry news</li>
<li><strong>Upsell or cross-sell:</strong> Products/services</li>
</ul>

<div id="callouts"></div>
<h3>Callouts</h3>
<p>Callouts are the second asset type that’s non-negotiable for me. These are even easier to set up than sitelinks.</p>
<p>Callouts are short snippets of text that are 25 characters or less. That’s it. In the following image (even though they’re blue and I’ve never seen a callout be blue before…this is from Google’s help article, so…I’m running with it), the callouts are “Free Shipping,” “24-7 Customer Service,” and “Price Matching.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-callouts-1.webp" alt="google ads assets - callouts" width="850" height="283" class="aligncenter wp-image-91989 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-callouts-1.webp 850w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-callouts-1-480x160.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 850px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Pretty simple and straightforward. Nothing to link to, no text to control. Just be 25 characters or less, and these can be added to your ad.</p>
<p>Callouts can be added at the account, campaign, or ad group level, so just like sitelinks, make sure whichever level you’re applying them to makes sense for the keywords and ads in that portion of your account.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas for callouts to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Benefit statements</li>
<li>Feature callouts</li>
<li>Price or shipping statements</li>
</ul>
<div id="structured-snippets"></div>
<h3>Structured snippets</h3>
<p>The last non-negotiable ad asset for me is structured snippets. These are likely a middle ground between sitelinks and callouts as they are just short snippets of text accompanied by a short header, and they don’t require any links.</p>
<p>In the image below (again, they’re not normally blue), the structured snippet text is “Services: Tech Support, E-Waste Recycling, Computer Repair.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-structured-snippets.webp" alt="google ads assets - structured snippet example" width="883" height="357" class="aligncenter wp-image-91982 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-structured-snippets.webp 883w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-structured-snippets-480x194.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 883px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>When you create a new structured snippet, you first choose your header, then you get to add in values to each field below. You can add up to 10 values for each header, and you can have multiple different structured snippets at the account, campaign, or ad group level.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-settings.webp" alt="google ads assets - structured snippets settings" width="483" height="579" class="aligncenter wp-image-91981 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-settings.webp 483w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-settings-480x575.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 483px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here are all the headers you’re able to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amenities</li>
<li>Brands</li>
<li>Courses</li>
<li>Degree programs</li>
<li>Destinations</li>
<li>Featured hotels</li>
<li>Insurance coverage</li>
<li>Models</li>
<li>Neighborhoods</li>
<li>Service catalog</li>
<li>Shows</li>
<li>Styles</li>
<li>Types</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on how specific your business is, you may or may not find a header that works for you. Clearly, these have a little more guidance on them than callouts since there does have to be a header, but more often than not, I’ll just choose the one that’s most closely related to my client’s business and run with it.</p>
<div id="images"></div>
<h3>Image assets</h3>
<p>Image assets are a relatively new type of asset to Google Ads and one that I think most folks overlook.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-image.webp" alt="google ads assets - images " width="389" height="479" class="aligncenter wp-image-91980 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-image.webp 389w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-image-244x300.webp 244w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></p>
<p>With image assets, you can provide Google with a handful of images that can accompany your search ads to make you stand out on the SERPs.</p>
<p>The image specs are pretty straightforward, and you’re able to add both square and landscape images to your account, campaign, or ad groups.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-image-specs.webp" alt="google ads assets - images assets specifications" width="705" height="500" class="aligncenter wp-image-91979 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-image-specs.webp 705w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-image-specs-480x340.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 705px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There are some limitations with image assets, namely the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>No text or graphic overlay</li>
<li>The image cannot have too much blank space</li>
<li>You cannot use a collage of images</li>
<li>The image can’t be blurry</li>
<li>The image can’t be visually skewed or warped</li>
<li>Your crop cannot be messy</li>
<li>No nudity or sexually suggestive images</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some ideas of images I like to use for different types of businesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product shots</li>
<li>People using a product or service</li>
<li>People executing a service</li>
<li>Photos of the company location</li>
<li>Stock imagery from the company website</li>
</ul>
<div id="headlines-descriptions"></div>
<h3>Headlines and descriptions</h3>
<p>I’ve grouped these together because they function the same way; they are just for different aspects of an ad.</p>
<p>Headlines and description assets let you extend the options within your Responsive Search Ads in a campaign. Notice these cannot be added to the account or ad group level.</p>
<p>With these assets, you provide Google with a headline or description that fits the normal character count (30 or 90 characters), you assign a pin location or leave that space blank, then Google will rotate that new asset in with all ads in the campaign.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-headlines-1.webp" alt="google ads assets - headlines" width="498" height="411" class="aligncenter wp-image-91990 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-headlines-1.webp 498w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-headlines-1-480x396.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 498px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Let’s say you have a sale coming up and you want to use some promotional copy in your RSAs, but you don’t want to adjust the search ad itself. That’s where headlines and descriptions can come in. You can write your promotional copy as an asset, turn it live, and then see the performance for that individual asset after it&#8217;s run for a while.</p>
<p>The biggest thing to watch out for here is your pinning strategy. If you’ve pinned all your headlines in your Responsive Search Ads, and you don’t pin this campaign-level headline extension, then it won’t show at all. These assets honor the same pinning strategy as all other assets in your RSA, so make sure you’re consistent with those controls.</p>
<p>One last feature I find really great is that you can schedule headlines and descriptions, so if you want to include seasonal messaging or promotional text (which we’ll talk about some other cool assets later), then you can schedule these assets to run during the needed time then turn off once they’re finished.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-scheduling.png" alt="google ads assets - asset scheduling" width="621" height="343" class="aligncenter wp-image-92027 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-scheduling.png 621w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-scheduling-480x265.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 621px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here are some scenarios where headlines and descriptions might make sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short-term promotional messaging</li>
<li>Changing out seasonal messaging</li>
<li>Testing different feature/benefit statements</li>
</ul>
<div id="call"></div>
<h3>Call assets</h3>
<p>Call assets are great for advertisers who want to get more phone calls to their business. This asset is the easiest way to get a phone number in your ad copy because adding a number directly in your ads can cause disapproval.</p>
<p>The call assets allow users to click directly to call your business, but they can also still find their way to your website.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-call-asset.webp" alt="google ads assets - call asset " width="791" height="500" class="aligncenter wp-image-91984 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-call-asset.webp 791w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-call-asset-480x303.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 791px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For those of you who are interested, when you click on the call button on a mobile device, it will open your dialer and ask you to complete the call. On desktop, it’ll show a<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/qr-code-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> QR code</a> like the one below that you can scan to open the dialer on your phone, or you could just type in the number in big text at the top.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-scan-to-call.png" alt="google ads assets - call scan" width="415" height="394" class="aligncenter wp-image-92015 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-scan-to-call.png 415w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-scan-to-call-300x285.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px" /></p>
<p>When you set up your call asset, you can use either account, campaign, or ad group level numbers. You can also schedule specific days and times for your phone number to be shown, which likely can and should match up with your business hours.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-call-settings.png" alt="google ads assets - call asset settings" width="424" height="584" class="aligncenter wp-image-92016 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-call-settings.png 424w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-call-settings-218x300.png 218w" sizes="(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px" /></p>
<p>Lastly, you can use Google forwarding numbers for search campaigns to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/25/google-ads-call-conversions">track those phone calls as conversions</a>. This can help you fully understand how your calls are impacting your account.</p>
<p>Depending on how your business functions, it may make sense for you to have different phone numbers for different campaigns or ad groups. If a company has many different service departments, it’s easier to connect directly to them rather than go through a phone tree, but that all just depends on how your phone numbers are set up.</p>
<div id="lead-form"></div>
<h3>Lead form asset</h3>
<p>You may have noticed the next asset in the call section. Right next to the call button is a message button. Unfortunately, this name will be confusing given that our next asset is called “message,” but this one is the lead form asset.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-call-asset-1.webp" alt="google ads call asset - messages and lead forms" width="791" height="500" class="aligncenter wp-image-91988 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-call-asset-1.webp 791w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-call-asset-1-480x303.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 791px, 100vw" />.</p>
<p>When I click on that call to action, I’m prompted to fill out the information in a window that looks like this. This information is then collected by Google and sent to your business in your account.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-leads.png" alt="google ads assets - lead asset" width="460" height="495" class="aligncenter wp-image-92017 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-leads.png 460w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-leads-279x300.png 279w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<p>The lead forms are highly customizable based on the information you want to gather and can be applied at either the account or campaign level. The customer information you collect can either be downloaded as a CSV in the account, or you could use a direct integration or webhook to get that data into your CRM for follow-up.</p>
<p>Lead forms can show on search, display, YouTube, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/gmail-ads">Gmail placements</a> and can be tied to a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/23/optimize-performance-max-campaigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Performance Max campaign</a>. They’re a great way to limit friction with customers since they don’t have to visit your landing page if they’re ready to convert, and much of the information in the form fields will automatically populate based on their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-business-profile-features">Google profile</a> information.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-lead-settings.webp" alt="google ads assets lead settings" width="203" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-91991 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-lead-settings.webp 203w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-lead-settings-102x300.webp 102w" sizes="(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px" /></p>
<p>Use these lead gen forms if you’re trying to generate more form fills for your business, have a challenging landing page, or if you’re trying to gather more first-party data in this new world of ever-changing privacy regulations.</p>
<div id="message"></div>
<h3>Message assets</h3>
<p>Message assets allow you to customize a button on your ads that, when clicked, will send your potential customers to WhatsApp to carry on a message conversation with you. You’ll have to have WhatsApp for Business set up and have your account integrated with Google.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-messages.png" alt="google ads assets - messages assets" width="528" height="334" class="aligncenter wp-image-92018 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-messages.png 528w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-messages-480x304.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 528px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>These assets are a little less customizable than others, but the only goal is to get the user to talk to you directly on WhatsApp, where you can fill in the blanks.</p>
<p>You have the option to add a starter message, meaning the first message the user will see from you. Then you’re able to customize the call to action from a dropdown, and then give a short description to support the call to action.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-messages-settings.png" alt="google ads assets - message asset settings " width="346" height="548" class="aligncenter wp-image-92019 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-messages-settings.png 346w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-messages-settings-189x300.png 189w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px" /></p>
<p>Message assets work on both Android and iOS platforms and can be added at the account, campaigns, or ad groups, so you can offer this call to action to only certain portions of your account.</p>
<p>Consider using message ads if you work with a customer base that’s inclined to message a company directly, but that would also want to do so to get more information.</p>
<div id="location"></div>
<h3>Location assets</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/07/google-ads-location-assets-enhancements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads location assets</a> let you incorporate store location information in your ads by listing either your physical store locations or those of your affiliates.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-ratings-1.png" alt="google ads assets - location example" width="324" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-91968 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-ratings-1.png 324w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-ratings-1-162x300.png 162w" sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px" /></p>
<p>For the stores you own directly, the listings will look similar to this and are generated based on your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-business-profile-features" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Business Profile</a> information.</p>
<p>For affiliate locations, or stores that you don’t own where you sell your products or services, your ads will still have a similar listing aspect on the ads themselves, but then will open a map for users to determine which location they want to visit, then easily view more information about that specific store.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-locations.webp" alt="google ads assets - locations" width="717" height="401" class="aligncenter wp-image-92002 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-locations.webp 717w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-locations-480x268.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 717px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Depending on the type of locations you have, the setup and integration process can be a little more cumbersome than other asset types, but the ease with which your customers can find you can’t be matched.</p>
<p>These can be applied to an account, campaign, or ad group within Google Ads, so depending on which portions of your accounts are supported by physical stores or if your stores vary by what you’re selling, then you can align your location strategy alongside your campaign structure.</p>
<div id="price"></div>
<h3>Price assets</h3>
<p>Price extensions are a great option if you have variable prices for your products or services and you want to highlight the different options you have on the table, but additionally, you can link folks to different pages on your site that relate to those prices.</p>
<p>Here’s a view of what a price asset could look like. There are boxes that highlight each price with a short description and some text.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-price.png" alt="google ads assets - price asset" width="406" height="312" class="aligncenter wp-image-92020 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-price.png 406w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-price-300x231.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 406px) 100vw, 406px" /></p>
<p>In the editor, each price box gets a header that’s 25 characters, a price that you can customize the units on, and a description of 25 characters.</p>
<p>But as you can see, they also get their own landing page, which means they operate with a similar power to sitelinks. Whatever price and text combo you’re highlighting, you can send the user directly to the portion of your website that relates to that offer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-price-example.png" alt="google ads assets - price asset settings " width="334" height="495" class="aligncenter wp-image-92022 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-price-example.png 334w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-price-example-202x300.png 202w" sizes="(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px" /></p>
<p>These assets can be added to the account, campaign, or ad group level, so strategize similarly to how you would with sitelinks.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas to get you started with price assets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Highlight different pricing tiers for different services</li>
<li>Show off different products with custom links</li>
<li>List package prices based on your offerings</li>
</ul>
<div id="promotion"></div>
<h3>Promotion assets</h3>
<p>Promotion assets are designed to help you show off your best deals to your customer base, and they are highly customizable. With these assets, you can add additional text to your ads that show your deals or discounts without having to change out your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/05/responsive-search-ad-copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Responsive Search Ads</a>. Promotion assets can be added at the account, campaign, or ad group level.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-promotion.png" alt="google ads assets - promotion asset" width="530" height="327" class="aligncenter wp-image-92021 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-promotion.png 530w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-promotion-480x296.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 530px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The first customization in the editor is to choose your occasion. There are 35 options available, or you could leave it as “None” if your promotion doesn’t align with any of the more popular holidays.</p>
<p>Next, you can select your promotion type, whether it’s money or a percent discount, or an “up to” discount.</p>
<p>There’s then a field to customize the information about your sale, and then a short description of 20 characters.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-promotion-settings.png" alt="google ads promotion assets - discount" width="479" height="402" class="aligncenter wp-image-92024 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-promotion-settings.png 479w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-promotion-settings-300x252.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px" /></p>
<p>Then, you can choose the promotion details, or effectively, how someone can achieve this promotion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-promo-code.webp" alt="google ads assets - promotion asset details" width="407" height="603" class="aligncenter wp-image-92005 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-promo-code.webp 407w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-promo-code-202x300.webp 202w" sizes="(max-width: 407px) 100vw, 407px" /></p>
<p>And lastly, you can schedule these to run during your promotional period. They’ll stay in the account ready to go until the launch date, then run as needed, pausing on the end date you set.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-limited-time-promotion.webp" alt="google ads assets - asset scheduling" width="882" height="379" class="aligncenter wp-image-92004 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-limited-time-promotion.webp 882w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-limited-time-promotion-480x206.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 882px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>These assets are great if you run regular promotions but don’t want to change out your RSAs to reflect the sales.</p>
<div id="app"></div>
<h3>App assets</h3>
<p>App assets are the last that Google has to offer, and they’re pretty straightforward. For companies that have an app, these assets let you complement your search ads by showing a call to action that directs users to the app instead of a website page.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-app.webp" alt="google ads assets - app asset" width="516" height="334" class="aligncenter wp-image-92003 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-app.webp 516w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-app-480x311.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 516px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>These can work on both Android and iOS, but you have to have your app listed in those stores ahead of time for them to show up in the builder. Once you choose that, you have a short 25-character link text that you can customize as needed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-app-promotion.png" alt="google ads assets - app promotion" width="533" height="365" class="aligncenter wp-image-92025 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-app-promotion.png 533w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-app-promotion-480x329.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 533px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>They can be added to your account, campaigns, or ad groups and can also be scheduled to run during certain dates as well as different days of the week and times of the day if you have any scheduling considerations that need to be taken into account.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-app-schedule.webp" alt="google ads assets - app schedules" width="559" height="522" class="aligncenter wp-image-91998 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-app-schedule.webp 559w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-app-schedule-480x448.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 559px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="google-ads-assets-automatically-created"></div>
<h3>Automatically created Google Ads assets</h3>
<p>Automatically created assets are the same assets we just covered, but rather than you setting them up as an advertiser, Google does it for you based on your website and account assets.</p>
<p>This is an opt-out option, meaning Google will create and run assets on your behalf by default unless you tell them otherwise.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering if Google has added assets for you, there’s a really easy way to check.</p>
<p>In the asset manager page in Google Ads, look at the column that says source. All assets will either be advertiser or automatically created. As you can probably tell, the ones that say automatically created are those that Google has made for you.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-automatically-created-assets.png" alt="google ads automatically created assets" width="531" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-91966 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-automatically-created-assets.png 531w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-automatically-created-assets-480x542.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 531px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Now the big question here is: are the assets Google makes for you good? Should you use those with your manually added assets? Instead of them? Or should you not use automatically created assets at all?</p>
<p>If Google has already created assets for you and you review them and they seem fine, then sure. It probably makes sense to leave what they’ve made.</p>
<p>But if you’re reading this blog post and you’ve made it through all the asset types, my guess is you’ll do a better job than Google will on your behalf.</p>
<p>So to turn off automatically created assets, you’ll need to jump through a couple hoops.</p>
<p>First, click the three dots in the upper right portion of the data table, then click <strong>account-level automated assets</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-automatically-created-assets-settings.png" alt="google ads automatically created assets - menu" width="821" height="367" class="wp-image-92028 size-full aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-automatically-created-assets-settings.png 821w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-automatically-created-assets-settings-480x215.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 821px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Next, click the three dots in the same portion of the next screen and click<strong> advanced settings</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-advanced-settings.png" alt="google ads automatically created assets - advanced settings" width="955" height="350" class="aligncenter wp-image-92029 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-advanced-settings.png 955w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-advanced-settings-480x176.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 955px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In the image below, you can see all of the automated asset types Google can run for you.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-settings-automated.png" alt="google ads automatically created assets menu" width="795" height="432" class="aligncenter wp-image-92030 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-settings-automated.png 795w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-settings-automated-480x261.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 795px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Some of these I wouldn’t recommend turning off because they aren’t going to hurt anything. And if anything, you might gain some better coverage.</p>
<p>Seller ratings showcase your store’s customer experience with star ratings and reviews. As long as you have good ratings and reviews, this is a good one to keep on.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-seller-ratings.webp" alt="google ads assets - seller ratings" width="744" height="321" class="aligncenter wp-image-91996 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-seller-ratings.webp 744w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-seller-ratings-480x207.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 744px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Longer headlines let your ads have longer variations of your headlines that could get more visibility in the SERPs. Also not a bad thing.</p>
<p>Automated locations leverage your business information to show folks where your physical stores are so they can visit you in person or call you to get in touch.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-ratings-1.png" alt="google ads assets - location example" width="324" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-91968 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-ratings-1.png 324w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-ratings-1-162x300.png 162w" sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px" /></p>
<p>Dynamic business names and logos are also usually pretty safe. They will populate your information based on your website (hopefully you’re using an up-to-date business name and logo there) to give a little more credibility to your ads.</p>
<p>But if you decide you want to turn off any of these asset types, which I usually recommend for things like sitelinks, callouts, and more, there’s a pretty easy process.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-dynamic-sitelinks.webp" alt="google ads assets - dynamic sitelinks" width="763" height="357" class="aligncenter wp-image-92008 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-dynamic-sitelinks.webp 763w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-dynamic-sitelinks-480x225.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 763px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Choose the automated asset you want to turn off and open up the dropdown. Switch the toggle to Off, then click Save.</p>
<p>You’ll notice there’s a big ole warning message that pops up telling you this could hurt your performance. But that’s OK. We both know you’re going to do a great job.</p>
<p>Depending on the user flow you get, after you click save, you’ll have to give feedback to Google as to why you want to turn off this asset, and then you’re in the clear.</p>
<div id="google-ads-assets-review-performance"></div>
<h2>How to review asset performance in Google Ads</h2>
<p>Once your assets have been running for a while, it’s time to review them and see how they’re performing. Just like with ads, we should be <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-audit">regularly reviewing the performance of our assets</a>, pausing underperformers, iterating new variants, and testing them against our top performers.</p>
<p>On the assets tab within Google Ads, you’ll be able to see the performance for each of your assets, but it’s important to know how to interpret the data in this report, as it’s different from that in other reports.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-asset-performance.webp" alt="google ads asset performance report" width="900" height="168" class="aligncenter wp-image-91985 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-asset-performance.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-asset-performance-480x90.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Each stat will show the performance for your entire ad unit when that asset was shown. So in the image above, the sitelink we’re seeing was associated with the account level and was shown in the ad unit for 3,122 impressions. Something in the ad unit was clicked 135 times for a 4.32% CTR, and three conversions were tracked.</p>
<p>This report is NOT saying that this sitelink was clicked 135 times for a 4.32% CTR and generated three conversions directly. It is merely reporting that a component of the ad unit generated that performance.</p>
<p>If you want to see the performance for the asset itself, you need to go to the <strong>segment</strong> option, then <strong>click type</strong>, and then you can see the data for this asset broken down more specifically.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-asset-proposal-request-1024x300.webp" alt="google ads asset performance click type" width="1024" height="300" class="aligncenter wp-image-92001 size-large" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-asset-proposal-request-1024x300.webp 1024w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-asset-proposal-request-980x287.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-asset-proposal-request-480x141.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here, the sitelink itself generated one click and zeo conversions, but that doesn’t mean it’s not useful.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, the impact of an ad asset is to lift the performance of the ad as a whole, not necessarily to generate the performance directly. So, as you’re reviewing performance for your assets, it’s best to compare how each asset is doing at a high level and not expect that each will drive the same performance as an ad unit will.</p>
<p>Additionally, it’s important to only compare assets within a specific type. In the image below, you can see I have sitelinks, a callout, and a call extension all showing. The performance for each is quite different, but just based on some quick reviews, you may determine that the call extension is the best performer since it has the most conversions for the lowest cost.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-asset-report.webp" alt="google ads asset report" width="858" height="227" class="aligncenter wp-image-92000 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-asset-report.webp 858w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-asset-report-480x127.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 858px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But again, if we segment by click type, you can see the conversions didn’t actually come from the call extension itself. Rather, just a headline click on the entire ad unit itself.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-asset-reporting.webp" alt="google ads assets - measuring asset performance" width="1013" height="359" class="aligncenter wp-image-91999 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-asset-reporting.webp 1013w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-asset-reporting-980x347.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-asset-reporting-480x170.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1013px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Additionally, what really compounds the problem is that these sitelinks, callouts, and call assets could have all been shown on multiple ads together. There really is an option for all of these to be bringing up performance together, even if their individual performance looks pretty poor.</p>
<p>The better view is to limit the report to show only one type of asset by clicking the button from the list shown below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-menu.webp" alt="google ads asset menu" width="942" height="105" class="aligncenter wp-image-91978 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-menu.webp 942w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/google-ads-assets-menu-480x54.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 942px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Then you can compare only those types of assets to each other to see which drives the best engagement and conversions for your ads.</p>
