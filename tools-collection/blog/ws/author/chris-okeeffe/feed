										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As marketers, every day we aspire to put our products and services in front of as many eyes as possible. We look for ROI on reach, engagement—any edge we can get in spreading the word.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, there’s been a trend of marketers trying to “eliminate friction” in an effort to attract consumers through convenience and accessibility. This has brought us new innovations like one-click checkouts, allowing consumers to bypass any sort of checkout process, making products easier to buy than ever before.</p>

<div><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/scarcity-marketing-push-for-pizza.jpg" alt="scarcity marketing ill-fated Push For Pizza" width="796" height="440" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">The ill-fated Push For Pizza app offered users a single-button solution for&#8230;pizza.</span></em></p>
<p>But if what if we go in the other direction? What if you hide your product from the world? If you make it hard to get? If you don&#8217;t make enough? What if you <em>create</em> friction? That’s what today’s article is about.</p>
<h2>What is scarcity marketing?</h2>
<p>Scarcity marketing is the idea of limiting the supply of a product, whether it be through restricting availability to a certain time-frame or decreasing production—oftentimes both.</p>
<p>The principle is sound—<a>we all want what we can’t have and love to flaunt when we have something others don’t.</a> Scarcity marketing takes advantage of this desire, creating demand through mystique and enticement. It’s an excellent way to ensure that a product is swept off the shelves with the hype that every brand wants to create.</p>
<p>Now that we’re clear on what scarcity marketing is, let’s dive into some examples of businesses in a few different industries using this principle successfully.</p>
<h2>Food &amp; Beverage</h2>
<p>Seasonal offerings are a common example of scarcity marketing. McDonald’s Shamrock Shake and Starbucks’ hugely popular Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL!) are some high-profile examples of seasonal products that attract even the casual customer with their limited-time offerings. Some companies take scarcity to another level, driving both demand—and consumers—up a wall. Here are three brands that have done just that.</p>
<h3>1. Pappy Van Winkle</h3>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="98a5c859-3f5b-4e90-aca6-f03fe6f835fe" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/scarcity-marketing-pappy-van-winkle.jpg" alt="scarcity marketing Pappy Van Winkle" width="909" height="503" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">I worked at a bar once where we drank this stuff like water. We didn&#8217;t know what we had!</span></em></p>
<p>Pappy Van Winkle is a whiskey connoisseur’s dream. Released exclusively in limited batches, this bourbon is one of the most highly sought-after liquors in the world.</p>
<p>Only 7000 cases are produced each year, and whiskey enthusiasts will pay <a href="https://kegnbottle.com/pappy-van-winkle-special-reserve-12-year-old-kentucky-straight-bourbon-whiskey?utm_source=google_shopping&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiArK_fBRABEiwA0gOOc-YM8ZgtYGixO2NftYgiiz_xxbsOygxb1vs64BEmHKisZeExDuqGXRoCoUQQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of dollars a bottle</a> just to get a taste if they’re lucky enough to find it. Because supplies are so limited, liquor stores who are lucky enough to get a few bottles often hold auctions. Some states—looking at you, <a href="http://mixblendenjoy.com/2018-pappy-van-winkle-lottery/">Idaho</a>—even hold an annual lottery to make the distribution of their limited Pappy Van Winkle supply fair.</p>
<h3>2. Goodnight Fatty and Back Alley Bacon</h3>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">You better have the password and exact change if you want this guy to feed you.</span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN"><a href="https://goodnightfatty.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goodnight Fatty</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Back-Alley-Bacon-1632212353728437/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Back Alley Bacon</a> of Salem, Massachusetts, utilize scarcity marketing in a way that harkens back to the days of the speakeasy. These two shops are open at very limited times, and whatever they are cooking up is what you get. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Back Alley Bacon serves their delicious, secret bites out of an unmarked shop by a man in a pig mask, known only as “Chef Jon Hamm” (of apparently no relation to the actor). Customers require a password and exact change, both of which are posted on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Back-Alley-Bacon-1632212353728437/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Back Alley Bacon Facebook page</a>. But they aren’t told anything about the food itself, adding a layer of mystery to the experience. Don Donato, owner of North Shore food marketing agency <a href="https://octocog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Octocog</a><u><span lang="EN">,</span></u><span lang="EN"> told us, <span lang="EN">“what really helped launch Back Alley Bacon wasn&#8217;t just scarcity of product, but scarcity of information.”</span></span></span></p>

</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">Advertising for Goodnight Fatty is limited to a blinking sign in an obscure back alley.</span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Goodnight Fatty offers cookies, or, as they refer to them, fatties. The menu is “top secret,” but each week they make three different types of cookies (pro tip: pay extra for bottomless milk). Their scarcity strategy has paid off: in the last few years, Goodnight Fatty has gone from occasional pop-ups at random Salem locations to a standing weekend location and, soon, a permanent storefront opening up this spring. </span></p>
<h3>3. McDonald’s Szechuan sauce</h3>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="820c87db-f2b8-4883-8862-7b3cc33b98aa" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">&#8220;I want that Mulan McNugget sauce, Morty!&#8221; — Rick Sanchez</span></em></p>
<p>In 1998, McDonald’s released the limited-edition Szechuan sauce to coincide with the release of Disney’s Mulan. After promotion of the film concluded, the sauce was taken off the menu and faded into obscurity for many years… that is, until popular sci-fi cartoon “Rick and Morty” featured it in one of their episodes. Discussion about the sauce exploded online, and McDonald&#8217;s seized the opportunity for exposure by bringing it back for one day only, in limited quantity. Fans and foodies alike stood in hours long lines for a chance to get the sauce—some savvy customers saw the opportunity to <a href="https://www.ebay.com/i/162704432319?chn=ps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resell it online for hundreds of dollars</a>.</p>
<h2>Apparel &amp; Design</h2>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">The shoes that started it all</span></em><span lang="EN">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clothes and apparel market themselves every time someone puts them on. There is nothing better for a clothing brand than to have their products instantly recognizable—brands like Nike and Ralph Lauren are so ubiquitous that we know what they are just by looking at the logo. Everyone sees it, and everyone knows what it is.</p>
<p>If you market apparel, then you know the value that consumers place on their wardrobe and use this to their advantage. The popular shoes Jordans have become famous for their “limited drops,” where shoes are created in limited supply and become highly coveted by shoe lovers the world over.</p>
<p>Humans are wired to collect resources; during ancient times, our survival depended on it. Whoever had the most food or the best tools would have a greater chance of survival. Today, marketers take advantage of our innate desire to collect and stockpile—<a href="https://twitter.com/BradySadler?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brady Sadler</a>, author of <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Collaboration-King-Game-Changers-Partnerships-Businesses-ebook/dp/B07G3JPRCJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Collaboration is King</a></em>, says, “Using the word ‘collect’ is another spin on scarcity. When brands deploy this word it implies demand, value, repetition and it bakes an element of creativity into the purchase. It gives the consumer permission to covet something and attempts to shape it as a productive outlet.”  Here are three brands that have made their products into collectable commodities through scarcity marketing.</p>
<h3>1. Mondo</h3>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="3cc5098e-5f6f-4a8a-9185-b8b77968f072" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">Collecting Mondo movie posters is a very expensive habit.</span></em></p>
<p>Mondo commissions artists to create alternative designs for T shirts and movie posters, largely focusing on classic or cult films like “Jaws” and “The Shining.” Their posters are so immensely popular that they are virtually impossible to buy online; the second it hits the store, it’s already sold out. As an added bonus, Mondo announces their limited edition posters on their <a href="https://twitter.com/MondoNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter account</a>, which drives considerable traffic to their website.</p>
<h3>2. Supreme</h3>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="c6be759f-5d54-4473-a54c-9d47036c4c39" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/scarcity-marketing-supreme.jpg" alt="scarcity marketing Supreme" width="800" height="600" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">Limited availability = mass appeal.</span></em></p>
<p>You’ve probably seen the red and white Supreme logo on the back of a sweatshirt somewhere (<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/cavaliers-j-r-smith-says-he-wont-speak-to-nba-about-displaying-his-supreme-tattoo-i-dont-talk-to-the-police/">or the back of JR Smith&#8217;s leg</a>). It’s grown immensely popular in the last few years due to their fervent fans and cult-like following. Supreme has just 11 locations worldwide, releases their clothes in “limited drops,” and is<a href="https://www.monkeyandelf.com/16-celebrities-you-probably-didnt-know-were-supreme-fans/"> popular amongst celebrities</a>—the perfect scarcity recipe.</p>
<h3>3. Bape</h3>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0968b295-bf93-453f-98d0-27364dbbf9f8" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/scarcity-marketing-bape.jpg" alt="scarcity marketing Bape" width="926" height="467" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">It&#8217;s a resellers&#8217; market, for sure.</span></em></p>
<p>Bape or A Bathing Ape is a Japanese streetwear brand that utilizes collaborations and limited drops to keep their style exclusive. Much like Supreme, fans go bananas to collect Bape apparel, and they <a href="https://stockx.com/bape">resell it online for a pretty penny.</a></p>
<h2>Entertainment &amp; Tech</h2>
<p>Exclusivity is just another word for scarcity. Dr. Dimitrios Tsivrikos, consumer psychologist at University College London states, &#8220;we collect articles or resources to survive, but survival doesn&#8217;t only rest upon what we need physically. We need, psychologically, to distinguish ourselves.” When a company offers something exclusive, it triggers this innate desire to stand out from others. Whether it’s a collector’s edition of a Beatles’ album or a <a href="https://stuarthughes.com/shop/luxury-mobile-phones/apple/18ct-solid-gold-iphone-xs-vintage-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solid gold iPhone</a>, the entertainment and tech industries have found myriad ways to lure consumers. Here are just three examples of scarcity marketing in action.</p>
<h3>1. Wu Tang Clan’s <em>Once Upon a Time in Shaolin</em></h3>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="6d004e00-ed92-4c26-9b34-750d58f8be96" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/scarcity-marketing-wu-tang-clan.jpg" alt="scarcity marketing Wu Tang Clan" width="819" height="486" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">Remember when U2 put that album on everyone&#8217;s iPhone? This is the opposite.</span></em></p>
<p>Although their legendary place in the pantheon of rap is unassailable, Wu Tang Clan had fallen out of cultural relevance at the hands of younger, trendier rappers. But in one of the greatest PR stunts in rap history, Wu Tang recorded an album titled <em>Once Upon a Time in Shaolin</em> and released <strong>just</strong> <strong>one copy</strong>, causing an auction house bidding war. According to Brady Sadler (<em>Collaboration is King)</em>, it was about more than just revenue. &#8220;Yes, it became the most expensive album ever sold, at a reported $2 million,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But the public relations and earned media far exceeded anything the group had done for many years.&#8221;</p>
<p><span lang="EN">As an added bonus, the Wu has ensured its place in history, as the album will <a href="https://www.thestranger.com/blogs/slog/2015/03/05/21834547/you-wont-be-able-to-listen-to-the-new-wu-tang-album-until-2103" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finally see a wider release in 2103</a>. </span></p>
<h3>2. OnePlus</h3>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="25817e51-38f4-42d8-b591-acedaf1616df" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/scarcity-marketing-oneplus.jpg" alt="scarcity marketing OnePlus" width="737" height="413" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">&#8220;The best smartphone you&#8217;ve never heard of.&#8221; — Business Insider</span></em></p>
<p>One Plus is now a popular smartphone brand, owing their rise to a clever, invite-only marketing campaign. This not only helped OnePlus manage demand in their favor, but it also added a layer of hype and mystique. Once OnePlus had established itself as a top-tier brand, they discontinued the invite only system and expanded their offerings to all.</p>
<h3>3. Gmail</h3>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="d8d0e9ac-8ab9-468c-b449-97067eb3bbce" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">Once a techy status symbol for those in the know, an @gmail.com email address is now ubiquitous.</span></em></p>
<p>Finally, we have a service that many of you probably use every day. Although now omnipresent, Gmail was originally a much sought-after, invite-only program. The exclusivity of the service helped create considerable buzz, while also serving as a test run for the email platform.</p>
<h2>Using scarcity marketing for your business</h2>
<p>These are examples of businesses that have used scarcity marketing with overwhelming success. But scarcity marketing doesn’t have to be used on such a large scale to elicit this response. As you can see from the examples, the strategy can work for businesses in a variety of industries. Remember, we all want what we can’t have, whether that’s a mystery meal served in an alley or a bottle of whiskey, a pair of shoes or an exclusive email address. So consider leveraging this desire in your next marketing campaign—you never know what might happen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations, you got your ad spend approved! SEM is ready to go, display ads are starting to get served up, and your new native advertising partner has such a subtle touch that the users will never even know (yeah, right&#8230;). Now it’s time to finish up your Facebook ads and hit “go.”</p>
<p>Not so fast, there. Your Facebook ads shouldn’t just be passable to get started. They should be set and ready to start attracting clicks and generating leads right away. To make sure that your ads are good and ready, take a few minutes and go through our quick Facebook Ads Checklist <em>before </em>you start spending that money.</p>
<p>Here are the five questions you need to answer before you launch that new Facebook ads campaign.</p>
<h2>1. What is the goal?</h2>
<p>Mission creep is a heck of a thing. By the time you&#8217;ve gone all the way through the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/30/facebook-ads-account-structure">dozens of steps necessary to launch a Facebook ads campaign</a>, you need to make sure the final product lines up with your initial goal.</p>
<p>There are plenty of options for Facebook ad types, so it’s easy to get distracted by cool features or new tools while you’re setting up a campaign. But you need to have clear goals laid out before you begin so that you can refer back to them throughout set up, and especially before hitting “go.”</p>
<p>Your goals will help you select your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/11/26/facebook-objectives">ad campaign objectives</a>, what ad types you want to run, and how to create KPIs to make sure you hit those goals.</p>

<h2>2. Have I properly targeted my audience?</h2>
<p>Great creative can elevate the success of your Facebook ads, but if you are not <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/22/facebook-removes-targeting-options">targeting the right audience</a>, you might as well be tossing that money on the grill. Before you set your ad campaign into motion, you should first identify who you are targeting as it relates to the campaign goals and objectives.</p>

<p>Facebook&#8217;s 20 percent rule is no longer, but having too much text on your image can still cause your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/16/facebook-ad-not-approved"> ad to not get approved</a>.</p>

<h2>4. What&#8217;s the frequency?</h2>
<p>No one likes to be bombarded with the same ad over and over, so it’s important to check this setting before you get started. Try to make sure you continue to check your ad frequency often to see if you are over-indexing your audiences, which can lead to fatigue and negative feedback.</p>
<p>Note, however, that &#8220;warmer&#8221; audiences tend to be more receptive to your messaging, so you can usually show remarketing ads more often and still drive conversions.</p>

<h2>5. Would I click it??</h2>
<p>This question requires a qualifier or two, sure, but it’s an important gut-check. If you fall reasonably within the audience for the ad in question, would you potentially interact with your own campaign?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN">Whether or not we&#8217;re truly in the <span lang="EN"><a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2015/02/golden-age-marketing-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Golden Age of Content Marketing</a><span lang="EN">, one thing is for sure: the once-uphill battle for content marketers to get client or internal buy-in for content strategy, creation and deployment has leveled off.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">People not only want content, they <em>know</em> they want it, and they&#8217;re willing to reward brands that give it to them. This realization is coming at an exciting time, as the platforms, technologies and opportunities for consuming content are more robust than ever. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">So what are the big trends driving content marketing today? Let&#8217;s explore how brands can cut through the noise and deliver their audiences value-driven content that they will engage with and share.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">1. Content Built for Voice Search </span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">According to TechCrunch, <span lang="EN"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/08/voice-enabled-smart-speakers-to-reach-55-of-u-s-households-by-2022-says-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voice-enabled smart speakers will be in a whopping 55% of households by 2022</a><span lang="EN">. Clearly, we’re in the midst of a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/04/10/voice-search-statistics-2018">voice search revolution</a>.</span></span></span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="d0869cee-663e-4040-a2c4-c4ef8fc1f528" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Because of that looming penetration, creators are scrambling to figure out how to provide actual value with this burgeoning interface. Personal genomics companies such as <span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hODPsllcQtA&amp;t=23s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Veritas</a><span lang="EN"> have trotted out impressive demos showing the potential integration between voice and next-generation healthcare.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">For Alexa, it&#8217;s the use of the <span lang="EN"><a href="https://dotcms.com/blog/post/how-to-build-an-alexa-skill-that-your-audience-will-love" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skills</a><span lang="EN"> functionality that&#8217;s going to allow 3rd-party companies to unlock the true power of the interface. With that kind of access, it&#8217;s only a matter of time before someone unleashes a truly killer app that goes past mere voice functionality and actually gets into content marketing. It’s no wonder <span lang="EN">VanynerMedia&#8217;s <a href="http://voicecon.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VoiceCon</a> in NYC explored voice-based opportunities for marketers and brands earlier this year.</span></span></span></span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">2. Automated Content Delivery</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">The idea of one golden megaphone or mono-message for a brand is becoming increasingly old-fashioned. This new world of multiple audiences and use cases, targeting and retargeting capabilities, and automation services from companies like <span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/marketing-automation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HubSpot</a><span lang="EN"> and <span lang="EN"><a href="https://sharpspring.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharpspring</a><span lang="EN"> offers marketers the opportunity to create individual content programs for much smaller audience segments.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">It also allow marketers to serve up key pieces of content at critical parts of the user journey. Meet the consumer where he or she is at, rather than firehosing a bunch of generalized content at a single newsletter list.</span></p>

</div>
<p><span lang="EN">While it will probably never get to be as ultimately targeted as what Skittles did with their Super Bowl ad for a <a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/skittles-wants-its-super-bowl-ad-to-be-exclusive-so-its-showing-the-spot-to-just-one-teenage-fan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single person</a>, we&#8217;re confident we&#8217;ll see brands exploring the happy medium between Marcos Menendez&#8217;s private commercial and a generalized billboard on I-84. </span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">3. Live-Streaming Everywhere</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">While live-streaming was pretty novel way back when <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/31/facebook-live-guide">Facebook Live</a> was opened to the public in 2016, you&#8217;ve got to do more than simply point and broadcast to stand out these days.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">The last few bits of monoculture we have left — sports, awards shows, and event television such as Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead — have created cottage industries of instant recaps, blogs, and yes, live-streamed instant takes of the preceding episode or game. There&#8217;s no more waiting until Monday morning to find out what your favorite critics thought of last night&#8217;s season finale. Pop-culture outfits like <a href="https://nerdist.com/podcasts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Nerdist </a>and <span lang="EN"><a href="http://baldmove.com/tag/instant-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bald Move</a><span lang="EN"> are probably live-streaming their hot takes on this very blog post&#8230;right now! (Spoiler alert: they found this blog stylistically interesting but ultimately predictable). </span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">So, how are brands capitalizing on these viewing trends? Like their pop-culture counterparts, brands that are successfully harnessing live-streaming are tapping into feelings of exclusivity and access. Dunkin&#8217; provided both with their company <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DunkinDonutsUS/videos/10154465505323238/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tour video</a> from a while back. And Wistia has gone behind the scenes as well.</span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">In addition to seeing more brands using live-streaming for their own content-creation efforts, look to see more deals pairing brands with individual gamers and esport teams as platforms like Twitch continue to gobble audiences&#8217; attention. Remember when your mom told you to stop wasting time with video games? Tell that to <span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.twitchmetrics.net/channels/popularity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these guys.</a> </span></span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN">4. Augmented Reality</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">If you&#8217;ve been on the Internet you&#8217;ve heard about augmented reality, or AR. Perhaps the biggest crossover AR hit thus far was when Nintendo and <a href="https://www.nianticlabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Niantic</a> scored big with Pokémon Go in 2016. But don&#8217;t take our word for it; just look at this guy: </span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">Universal Studios and Montreal&#8217;s <u><a href="https://www.ludia.com/en">Ludia</a></u> made another big splash recently with the<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/7/17090294/jurassic-world-alive-pokemon-go-ar-augmented-reality-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Jurassic Park Alive</a> app. Ever wanted your own dinosaur, but can&#8217;t get past that &#8220;no pets&#8221; clause on the lease?

<p class="text-align-center"><span lang="EN"><em>In the Jurassic Park Alive app, players can capture, collect and battle dinosaurs. And be reminded about the new film: Jurassic Park: Fallen Kingdom</em>.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">But it&#8217;s not just about giant global companies. The technology has gotten to the point where emerging brands such as Bareburger have found ways to personalize the augmented experience. Nabeel Alamgir, Bareburger CMO, said &#8220;with Bareburger&#8217;s Snapchat AR campaign, we gave away 5000 burgers via our to-go bags.&#8221; To redeem, customers had to <a href="https://digiday.com/social/bareburger-using-ar-snapchat-drive-people-restaurants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">return to their local Bareburger restaurant</a>. According to Alamgir, it was the company&#8217;s most successful promotion to-date.</span></p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">Bareburger gave away 5,000 burgers during a recent AR campaign.</span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">We can also expect a bigger AR presence in the retail space. &#8220;In retail, it has gone beyond the point where customers are interested shopping with brands that offer these immersive experiences; they are starting expect and demand it,&#8221; says Steve Curran, CEO at <a href="https://theroar.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ROAR AR</a>. &#8220;For the younger generation of consumers, immersive media (AR &amp; VR) is the transformational technology <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/09/28/generational-marketing-tactics">of their generation</a> — like the mobile phone was for Millennials, and the home computer was for Boomers and Gen X.&#8221;</span></p>

</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">Brands and agencies are investing more and more in having a comprehensive content strategy.</span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">At some point in the last few years, it feels like having a documented content strategy moved from a “nice to have” to a “must have.” Whereas content used to take a backseat to other pieces of the marketing budget, we&#8217;re seeing increased attention, forethought and resources being focused on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/18/content-marketing-examples">content marketing</a> strategies.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">&#8220;With a constantly evolving world of options for creating and distributing content, a documented strategic approach is a must have,&#8221; says Luke Garro, EVP/Content Director for GYK Antler. &#8220;That requires defining your vision of what success looks like, then working towards it by aligning the effort with the resources you have to work with. <span lang="EN">You’re more likely to find success by focusing on a niche audience, channel and content theme.<span lang="EN">&#8220;</span></span></span></p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">HubSpot&#8217;s The Turnaround focuses on inflection points in companies&#8217; histories, with Hubspot acting as the mid-roll sponsor.</span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">With 550,000 active podcasts out there, the day of streamable audio content is truly upon us. While traditional <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/05/podcast-advertising">ad spends</a> for pre-roll and midroll ads continue to spike (anyone need a mattress), a new wave of content creation by brands has emerged.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">HubSpot&#8217;s <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/the-growth-show" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Turnaround</a> is an engaging business documentary series that never comes close to veering into inbound marketing infotainment (seriously, it&#8217;s really good), and GE&#8217;s audio drama hit The Message performed well enough to keep the company serious about investing in <a href="https://www.adweek.com/digital/thanks-to-nearly-8-million-downloads-ge-remains-bullish-on-branded-podcasts/">the medium</a>. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">As more brands head in this direction, we hope they can follow the lead of HubSpot and GE by committing to creating great content rather than long-form radio commercials.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">Finally, the downside to all the new-found content marketing attention: bad content. Although poorly done content marketing efforts can be <a href="https://www.digitalcurrent.com/content-marketing/worst-marketing-campaigns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">catastrophic</a>, most miscalculations will end up being just kinda bad. This is an unfortunate effect of brands clumsily executing content plans, or of selling off their goodwill for quick traffic.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Whereas content creation used to feel like an underground religion with a few, strange emissaries trying to convert the uninitiated (and capture their marketing spends), content marketing has become an oft-used (and misused) buzzword. If conversations are starting off saying things like &#8220;We should make an infographic&#8221; or &#8220;we should make a video&#8221; then that could be cause for concern. As a brand, what story are you trying to tell? Where does your expertise lie? What do you want people to feel?</span></p>
