										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s no secret that Facebook continues to be a lucrative platform for brands to reach, engage, and convert customers. Just how lucrative? Well, for starters, it&#8217;s one of the cheapest social media advertising channels and has been proven to deliver the <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/hubspot-blog-marketing-industry-trends-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest ROI</a> for advertisers out of all social ad platforms.</p>
<p>But to officially answer that question, we&#8217;re going to dive into how much Facebook ads cost based on the latest data available, as well as how to keep your costs as low as possible.</p>

<h2>How much do Facebook Ads cost?</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ll be diving into different reports to get specific answers, but here&#8217;s the overview.</p>
<p>The average Meta Ads CPC is about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ads-benchmarks-2025">$1.92 for leads campaigns and $0.70 for traffic campaigns</a>, and the average cost per lead is about $27.66.</p>
<p>Of course, each of the studies above used different data sets. Keep in mind, too, that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-accurate-is-ai-for-ppc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when we&#8217;ve asked AI this same question</a> and very different results came up from each tool tested. Basically, costs vary by industry and campaign objective, which we&#8217;ll get to later.</p>

<h2>Factors that influence the cost of Facebook ads</h2>
<p>Just like <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/08/instagram-ads-cost">Instagram ads costs</a>, Facebook ad costs are influenced by a number of variables.</p>
<h3>1. Campaign objectives</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-objectives">Facebook campaign objectives</a> are a prominent factor in pricing since they relate to the value of the desired goal and where in the funnel your users are.</p>
<p>For example, Awareness or Engagement campaigns will cost less than lower-funnel campaigns like Sales that drive purchases. It’s easier to get someone to engage with an ad than it is to entice them to click through, open up their wallet, and complete a purchase.</p>
<h3>2. Audience size</h3>
<p>Facebook ads targeting larger and broader audiences will generally cost less than for smaller audiences.</p>
<p>You will typically see lower costs in prospecting, upper-funnel, cold-audience campaigns compared to retargeting, lower-funnel, warmer-audience campaigns, because the audiences of the latter tend to be more specific, smaller in size, and therefore more <a href="/blog/ws/2017/04/27/how-to-compete-in-facebook-ads">competitive</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/facebook-ads-trends-audience-size-indicator.jpg" alt="how much does facebook cost - audience size indicator" width="520" height="349" class="aligncenter wp-image-79160 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/facebook-ads-trends-audience-size-indicator.jpg 520w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/facebook-ads-trends-audience-size-indicator-480x322.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 520px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>3. Daily budget</h3>
<p>If your daily budget is on the lower end, it may take longer for Facebook&#8217;s algorithm to exit the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-learning-phase">learning phase</a>. For this reason, costs for new ad sets are often higher upfront while the system understands how your audience behaves with your ads and how to optimize them for the highest engagement. If your ads are well-engaged with, Facebook and Instagram will reward you with lower costs over time.</p>
<h3><span>4. Bidding strategy</span></h3>
<p><span>Similarly, the way you instruct Facebook to spend your ad budget affects how much your ads cost. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/31/facebook-ads-bidding-strategies">Facebook bidding strategies</a> include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span></span><span>Highest volume (formerly lowest cost)</span><span></span></li>
<li>Highest value</li>
<li>Cost per result (formerly cost cap)</li>
<li>ROAS goal (formerly minimum ROAS)</li>
<li>Bid cap</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Click-through rate</h3>
<p>Click-through rate (CTR) can also play a role in your Facebook ad costs. If CTR is low, especially in a website traffic campaign, you may then see higher costs as Facebook understands that there may be some disconnect between your target audience and the <a href="/blog/ws/2016/06/29/best-facebook-ads">messaging in your ads</a>.</p>
<p>A healthy Facebook CTR is about 1-3%. More often than not, the higher your CTR climbs, the lower your CPCs will be.</p>
<h3>6. Industry</h3>
<p>As you saw in our benchmarks above, Facebook costs vary by industry, which also includes varying click-through rates. Your market and industry will play a big role in what to expect in terms of your Meta Ads costs. For instance, the chart below indicates pretty big differences between CTRs across various industries, which could indicate how more or less competitive your vertical may be.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-fb-benchmarks-leads-ctr-846x1024.webp" alt="2025 fb benchmarks - 2025 leads click-through rate" width="846" height="1024" class="aligncenter wp-image-93930 size-large" /></p>
<h3>7. Seasonality</h3>
<p>Historically speaking, in the latter part of Q3 and Q4, costs tend to temporarily increase as the advertising landscape changes for the <a href="/blog/ws/2019/08/08/holiday-marketing-tips">holiday ecommerce season</a>. Competition ramps up as brands increase their budgets and gain more impression share, thus increasing costs for all advertising brands.</p>
<p>Keep seasonality in mind as you budget for the year. If you aren’t in ecommerce or running promotions during the end of the year, you may want to strategize on whether to keep a presence or to scale back.</p>
<div id="lower"></div>
<h2>How to lower Facebook ad costs</h2>
<p>There are a number of ways to lower your Facebook ad costs, but here are some of our favorite strategies.</p>
<h3>1. Create a full-funnel strategy</h3>
<p>To use your budget wisely and set yourself up to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/08/how-to-scale-facebook-ads">scale your Facebook ads</a>, choose funnel-appropriate campaign objectives. In general, Awareness and Consideration campaigns are suited for the top of the funnel; Consideration and Conversion campaigns align with the middle of the funnel, and Conversion campaigns are best for <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/01/bottom-funnel-conversions">bottom-funnel conversions</a>.</p>
<p>In short, begin with upper-funnel campaigns to reach more people in your target audience at a lower cost, and then move your way toward conversion campaigns that optimize for your purchase-driving conversion events.</p>
<p>You can learn how to create a <a href="/blog/ws/2019/02/21/facebook-funnel">full-funnel Facebook advertising strategy here</a>.</p>
<p>Note that some brands can certainly run a Sales campaign targeting upper-funnel audiences with lower-priced products or something that may make for a good impulse buy.</p>
<p>People can and do <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/13/facebook-ecommerce-tips">make purchases</a> upon first interaction with a brand on Facebook, however, most will need more touch points from a brand so you can gain their trust, showcase your benefits, and entice them to convert.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Want more Facebook ads tips like these?</strong> Download our free guide to the top <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLFBFundamentals.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FacebookFundamentals_Download">seven fundamental Facebook advertising tips</a> every advertiser should know.</p>
<h3>2. Broaden your audience</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, audience size impacts how much Facebook ads cost. So while you want to keep your targeting narrow, you should strive to make those targeted audiences as large as possible. This has become trickier as a result of privacy measures, but we&#8217;ve got some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/11/facebook-advertising-strategies">recommended Facebook ad strategies</a> to help you out with that.</p>
<h3>3. Check audience overlap</h3>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s audience overlap tool can be instrumental in saving money. Let’s say you have one ad targeting an audience of people interested in startups and another ad for people interested in entrepreneurship. You have different<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/07/facebook-ad-copy-examples"> Facebook ad copy</a> and creative to appeal to these different audiences. However, the overlap tool shows you that half of the startup audience overlaps with the entrepreneurship audience. Knowing this, you can use exclusions so those ads don’t overlap. Otherwise, you’d lose money bidding against yourself.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ad-costs-audience-overlap-tool.png" alt="" width="800" height="403" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18248" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ad-costs-audience-overlap-tool.png 800w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ad-costs-audience-overlap-tool-480x242.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>4. Use bid caps</h3>
<p>This is the manual bidding <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-tactics">strategy in Facebook ads</a>, where you can set a maximum bid instead of allowing Facebook to dynamically bid based on your goals. But this should be used with caution. It’s for advertisers who have a solid understanding of the conversion rate and profit margin and require regular maintenance. If you set your bid cap too low, Facebook might have a hard time spending all of your budget.</p>
<h3>5. Use the Pixel AND the Facebook Conversions API</h3>
<p>The goal of both of these pieces of technology is for you to track your ad performance. With visibility into what’s working and what’s not, you can allocate budget accordingly. You can also gain insights about the people viewing your ads, which you can use to further optimize your campaigns and maximize your budget.</p>
<p>The Facebook Pixel is still a thing, but it is losing its power since it’s cookie-based and cookies are crumbling. The Facebook Conversions API does not rely on cookies, but it doesn’t pick up the same exact information as the pixel. So, using the two together will ensure you capture the most accurate data. You can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/06/facebook-conversions-api">learn how to use the Facebook Conversions API here</a>.</p>

<h3>6. Run Facebook A/B testing</h3>
<p>You can also help lower your costs at the ad level by <a href="/blog/ws/2021/05/11/facebook-ab-testing">A/B testing</a> variables in your ads—one at a time—to better understand what is and is not working well. Test out the text, <a href="/blog/ws/2018/08/28/facebook-ad-headlines">headline</a>, images and/or videos, landing pages, and more.</p>
<p>Facebook is not the set-it-and-forget type of platform, so it is best to continuously test and aim for better results. Running tests at the ad level can help improve your engagement rates and CTR and stretch your budget further. Check out our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/23/facebook-ad-examples">Facebook ad examples</a> to get ideas and inspiration.</p>
<h3>7. Try Meta Advantage+</h3>
<p>Over the last couple of years, Facebook ads has rolled out <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-plus">Advantage+</a> settings that allow Facebook&#8217;s machine learning to automate campaign audience and placement targeting, ad creative, and more. These settings, which you choose to opt into, are easy to use and can be a timesaver for advertisers looking to scale more quickly. However, just know that there will be a trade-off of manual control with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Advantage Plus</a>, so be sure to keep a close eye on your campaign behavior and any AI-powered assets to maintain consistent performance.</p>

<div id="worth"></div>
<h2>What makes Facebook Ads worth the price?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/02/reasons-to-advertise-on-social-media">Advertising on social media</a> in general has its benefits, but let&#8217;s finish off with some of the money-saving advantages Facebook has over other platforms like Pinterest, LinkedIn, and Instagram.</p>
<h3>Facebook is still the most popular social media platform</h3>
<p>With over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3 billion active users</a> worldwide, Facebook currently ranks as the largest and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">most popular social media platform</a> in the world. This is compared to other front-runners like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok.</p>
<h3>&#8230;and the most widely used</h3>
<p>Facebook has the most even distribution of users compared to other popular social media platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn—which means you can target a larger range of age groups with your ads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/facebook-ads-cost-2021-facebook-even-age-distribution_0.png" alt="age distribution for facebook vs instagram and linkedin" width="720" height="196" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<h3>Precise targeting means higher ROI</h3>
<p>Precise targeting means reduced Facebook ad costs. If you want to target someone in a 15-mile radius of a particular address or zip code, you can do that. If you want to reach parents with children 3-5 years old who love ice cream, you can do that, too.

<p>Though we have faced some targeting limitations as a result of Apple iOS updates, Facebook still remains one of the best PPC channels for targeted advertising. This does require changes, however, so be sure to visit our guide to Facebook ad targeting.</p>
<h3>You have flexibility with budgeting</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="/blog/ws/2019/02/19/facebook-ads-daily-vs-lifetime-budgets">Facebook offers two types of budgeting</a> to accommodate different advertising strategies. Lifetime budgets, which are good if you run ads on a schedule and/or a fixed budget and end date; and daily budgets, which are good for maximizing ongoing campaigns and pacing and planning around a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/stretch-your-marketing-budget">fluctuating budget</a>. You can also use the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/audience-overlap-tool">Audience Overlap Tool</a> to save money.</p>
<h3>It&#8217;s affordable</h3>
<p>Facebook ads are among <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/30/cost-effective-ad-types">the most cost-effective </a>ad types for any business, whether it spends $10 a day or thousands. With testing, <a href="/blog/ws/2018/09/04/facebook-retargeting">retargeting</a>, and reporting capabilities, you have the tools to make the most of every dollar you spend.</p>
<p>For context, the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-google-ads-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> average cost per click in Google Ads</a> is higher than Facebook&#8217;s at $5.26. So, while you still want to hit all<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/26/marketing-channels" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> marketing channels</a>, including search advertising, Facebook ads can help fill any gaps in your strategy at a lower and more stable cost.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ah, Reddit. One minute you&#8217;re browsing r/ShowerThoughts, and the next you&#8217;re questioning the concept of time, capitalism, and whether pigeons have feelings.</p>
<p>It’s weird, it’s wonderful, and it’s a good place to advertise…that is, if you know how to properly target your ads and how much it’ll cost you.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into how the Reddit advertising cost model works, how much you&#8217;ll pay for Reddit ads, and whether Reddit ads are worth your moolah.</p>

<h2>How Reddit ads pricing works</h2>
<p>If you’re going to be <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/reddit-marketing">using Reddit for marketing</a>, let’s first lay down the foundation on how Reddit ad pricing works. It’s primarily a CPM bidding model (cost per 1,000 impressions), which allows you to set a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/10/26/marketing-budget">daily budget</a> and bid for visibility across the platform.</p>
<p>Reddit Ads Manager also supports CPC (cost per click) and CPV (cost per view) bidding for certain campaigns, like those optimized for engagement or video views. More on that later.</p>
<p>Note that Reddit does have minimums:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimum daily spend: $5</li>
<li>Minimum bid: Varies by objective but often starts around $0.20–$0.50 CPM</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4aa.png" alt="💪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Reddit can be a great source of website traffic.</strong> Download <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/increase-traffic-to-your-website?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website</a> for more</p>
<div id="average-reddit-cpm"></div>
<h2>What is the average Reddit ad cost?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/online-advertising-costs">Online advertising costs</a> are never cut and dry—and Reddit ads are no exception—so the best answer to this question is to provide a range. Since Reddit Ad CPMs vary depending on your targeting, ad type, and competition, we generally say that <strong>campaigns typically range in CPMs from $0.50 to $15</strong>, but advertisers have reported CPMs as low as $0.20 and as high as $100+, especially for premium placements (like front-page takeovers).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a chart of ranges from various sources:</span></p>

<h2>Reddit ad costs by ad type</h2>
<p>Now that you have a feel for how Reddit ad costs compare to other social media platforms, let’s go a layer deeper and take a look at average costs by ad type. There are several different Reddit ad types, and their names are always evolving, but this should give you a general idea of ad formats and prices:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Ad type</b></td>
<td><b>CPM range</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image ads</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">$0.50 &#8211; $12</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video ads</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">$2 &#8211; $20</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carousel Ads</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">$6 &#8211; $18</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Takeover ads</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">$20+</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As you can see, Takeover ads have the highest CPMs as they are a premium placement.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that pricing fluctuates based on audience size, targeting options, and competition. More on this in a bit.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Before you advertise on Reddit, make sure you’re targeting the right audience!</strong> Learn <a href="https://gannett.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/teams/ContentSEOTeam/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BF8A25C52-3731-4AAB-BEBE-40069BB61306%7D&amp;file=In-content%20CIDs.xlsx&amp;action=default&amp;mobileredirect=true">How to Find Your Target Audience</a></p>

<p>Below are Reddit CPMs compared to other <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/18/social-media-advertising">social media advertising</a> platforms, including Facebook, Twitter/X, and LinkedIn:</p>

<p>So the good news is that Reddit typically offers lower CPMs than larger social platforms, but success depends largely on message fit and community relevance.</p>
<p>Side note: If you’re looking to understand the costs of other advertising platforms, we have posts on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/12/facebook-ads-cost">Facebook ad costs</a>, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-cost">Google Ads costs</a>, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/linkedin-ads-cost">LinkedIn ad costs</a>, and more.</p>
<h2>Factors that affect Reddit advertising costs</h2>
<p>As we’ve established, advertising on Reddit can be cost-effective, but rates vary based on how, where, and to whom you&#8217;re advertising. Here&#8217;s a breakdown of the key factors that influence your CPM and overall ad performance:</p>
<h3>Audience targeting</h3>
<p>Reddit offers granular <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/15/audience-targeting">targeting options</a>, and your selections play a major role in determining ad cost. Here’s what we’re working with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Broad targeting:</strong> Here, you’re targeting general interests (gaming, technology, or entertainment). These typically have lower CPMs because you&#8217;re reaching a wider pool of users, which reduces competition in the ad auction.</li>
<li><strong>Narrow targeting: </strong>Here, you’re targeting specific subreddits, device types, or precise geolocations. This increases specificity but also competition. The more niche your audience, the higher your CPM is likely to be.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our advice? Start broad to gather performance insights, then layer in subreddit or interest-based targeting once you know where engagement is strongest. We have more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/24/reddit-advertising">Reddit ad targeting tips here</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/reddit-advertising-costs-wordstream-vacuum-ad.webp" alt="Reddit advertising cost - Ad for a vacuum on Reddit." width="361" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93026 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/reddit-advertising-costs-wordstream-vacuum-ad.webp 361w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/reddit-advertising-costs-wordstream-vacuum-ad-181x300.webp 181w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Pretty good targeting for the r/Adulting subreddit.</em></p>
<h3>Ad placement</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve just covered who your ads appear to; now we’re talking about where they appear. Here are your options and how they impact Reddit ad costs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Premium placements: </strong>Front Page Takeovers or Trending Takeovers give you tons of visibility across the platform, but they come at a hefty price (five to six figures per day). These are typically reserved for enterprise campaigns or major product launches.</li>
<li><strong>In-feed promoted posts: </strong>These appear within users&#8217; home feeds or subreddit threads, and are a better fit for small to mid-sized businesses. They function similarly to native ads, allowing for flexible budgeting and optimization.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/reddit-advertising-costs-wordstream-answer.webp" alt="Reddit advertising cost - Ad for an intelligence test on Reddit." width="351" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-93027 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/reddit-advertising-costs-wordstream-answer.webp 351w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/reddit-advertising-costs-wordstream-answer-176x300.webp 176w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>In-feed placement example (and good content for the r/law subreddit if you ask me).</em></p>
<h3>Campaign objective</h3>
<p>Reddit&#8217;s ad platform lets you choose from several objectives, and each one affects your bidding strategy and cost. Let’s break them into two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Awareness-based objectives:</strong> Objectives like reach or impressions generally lead to lower CPMs, since you&#8217;re paying for visibility, not engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Performance-based objectives:</strong> Objectives like conversions, clicks, or app installs usually require higher bids to remain competitive, but you’re also getting solid engagement. Reddit will prioritize showing these ads to users more likely to take action, which increases value (and cost).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Quality and relevance</h3>
<p>Reddit is a community-driven platform, perhaps the most community-driven out of all the social media platforms, so relevance matters more here than on many other ad networks. What that means is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ads should fit in:</strong> Ads that feel native, align with subreddit culture, and generate upvotes, comments, or click-throughs can reduce CPMs over time.</li>
<li><strong>Ads shouldn&#8217;t stir the pot:</strong> Ads that are downvoted, reported, or ignored may get deprioritized by Reddit’s delivery algorithm, which can drive up costs or hurt delivery altogether.</li>
</ul>
<p>Quick tip: Consider testing multiple ad variations with community-minded copy and creative. Redditors respond well to authenticity and humor that respects subreddit norms.</p>

<h2>5 tips to maximize Reddit ad ROI</h2>
<p>If you’re looking to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/drive-traffic-from-reddit">drive traffic from Reddit</a> at optimal costs, here are some final tips:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Be authentic</strong>: Reddit users value transparency and do not like being “sold to.” Use a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/05/conversational-tone"> conversational tone</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Remember the communities</strong>. Reddit ads are particularly effective for SaaS products, B2B tech, gaming and entertainment, niche e-commerce brands, and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/17/direct-to-consumer-marketing"> direct-to-consumer</a> products. That doesn’t mean that if you aren’t in that category, you won’t be successful, but you may need to work a little harder to match your messaging to the tone, interests, and culture of the communities you&#8217;re targeting. Which leads me to my next tip…</li>
<li><strong>Engage in the community</strong>: Try blending in by participating in relevant threads before running a campaign. Get familiar with the culture so you can find the best ways to resonate.</li>
<li><strong>Test multiple subreddits</strong>: A/B test targeting to discover where your audience actually converts.</li>
<li><strong>Use video or GIFs</strong>: Reddit users engage more with visual storytelling than static banners, so add some movement into the mix.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The verdict: Are Reddit advertising costs worth it?</h2>
<p>Reddit advertising presents a unique opportunity for brands that want to (and can) lean into community culture. While costs are generally lower than those of other platforms, success depends more on messaging, market fit, and authentic creative content than on pure budget.</p>
<p>So it can be a low-risk arena to test out ad experiments, but if you&#8217;re looking for plug-and-play campaigns requiring minimal creative effort, Reddit may not be your best bet.</p>
<p>If you’re curious to test Reddit for your brand, start small, engage organically, and optimize from there. With the right strategy, Reddit can deliver outstanding ROAS.</p>

<h2>Why advertise on Facebook?</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re reading this post, chances are you&#8217;ve already made up your mind as to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/10/14/advertising-on-facebook">whether you should advertise on Facebook</a>. But in case you&#8217;re still on the fence, here are some reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build brand awareness.</strong> Unlike Google Ads, which are all text, Facebook ads allow you to use images and video, which can support your branding. And while purchase intent is not as high on Facebook as on Google, imagery gives you the power to stand out in users&#8217; feeds through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/01/13/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing">emotional marketing</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Cost-effective. </strong>Because Facebook ads offer such specific targeting, you can rest assured that you&#8217;re making the most of your ad budget.</li>
<li><strong>Versatility. </strong>Between the wide range of ad formats and the different objectives available, you can use Facebook ads to target users at every stage of your marketing funnel.</li>
<li><strong>Gain audience insights.</strong> People spend a lot of time on Facebook and use it for a number of reasons in their day-to-day lives. The data you collect through Facebook ads provides invaluable <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/17/customer-insights">customer insights</a> you can use to inform your strategy elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
<p>And if that&#8217;s not enough, here are some numbers for ya:</p>
<ul>

<h2>Facebook ad account overview</h2>
<p>When you<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/21/how-to-run-google-ads"> run Google Ads</a>, you set up a Google Ads account and then off you go, but with the Meta Business Suite, there are several different properties involved. If you&#8217;re new to Facebook advertising or Meta Business Suite in general, you&#8217;re highly susceptible to falling into a black hole of confusion surrounding which accounts you need.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the breakdown (and don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m going to walk you through setting up all of these):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meta Business Suite</strong> (formerly Facebook Business Suite) is the umbrella account that encompasses everything. It&#8217;s a free account where you can manage your Facebook and Instagram pages in one place. You can create and schedule posts, reply to messages, get insights and notifications, and more.
<ul>
<li><strong>Business Manager </strong>is now one and the same with Business Suite. It used to be the backend where you manage permissions, payments, pixels, and more things that don&#8217;t begin with a P. All of these functions are now part of Meta Business Suite, but if you really want to perform them outside of the old Business Manager interface, you can click the help button and select Switch to Business Manager.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ads Manager.</strong> This is where your ad account(s) live. If you&#8217;re an agency, you will have multiple ad accounts in one Ads Manager account. If you&#8217;re the only one managing your properties, you don&#8217;t need a Meta Business Suites/Business Manager account to use Ads Manager, but it is recommended (and it&#8217;s free, so it can&#8217;t hurt).</li>
<li><strong>Ad account. </strong>This is what you create within Ads Manager. You should only have one ad account per business (or per Facebook business Page)</li>
<li><strong>Facebook Page</strong>. You need a Facebook Page in order to advertise on Facebook, but you don&#8217;t need to be advertising on Facebook in order to create a Page. In fact, this is a staple in any organic <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">social media marketing strategy</a>. You can create a Page entirely separate from all of the above, right from your Facebook profile. Or you can create one out of Business Suite.</li>
<li><strong>Ad campaign.</strong> This is where you choose an objective. You can (and should) have multiple campaign types within one ad account.</li>
<li><strong>Ad set.</strong> This is where you determine your ad budget/<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/31/facebook-ads-bidding-strategies">bidding</a>, schedule, and audience targeting, such as by demographics, interests, age, and more. You can have multiple ad sets in one campaign.</li>
<li><strong>Ad.</strong> This is your actual copy and creative. You&#8217;ll want to have at least two ads per ad set. We&#8217;ll talk more about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/30/facebook-ads-account-structure">Facebook ad account structure</a> later on.</li>

<p><span>Alright, now that we have the visual map to an actual Facebook ad, grab your charger and buckle up because it&#8217;s time for us to hit the road. Here are the steps that we&#8217;ll be covering:</span></p>

</ol>
<div id="suite"></div>
<h3><span>1. C<span>reate a Business Suite account</span></span></h3>
<p><span>To create an account, go to <a href="https://business.facebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business.facebook.com</a> and click “Create account” on the upper right. </span></p>
<p><span> <img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-meta-business-suite-account-creation.png" alt="how to advertise on facebook - meta business suite account creation" width="720" height="427" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60428" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-meta-business-suite-account-creation.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-meta-business-suite-account-creation-480x285.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></span></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll be asked to add your business name, your name, and then your business email. Upon confirming your email, your account will be set up.</p>
<p>Here is where you&#8217;ll be brought to the Meta Business Suite interface.</p>
<div id="page"></div>
<h3>2. Connect or create your Facebook Page</h3>
<p>Head down to the bottom left and click on Settings.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-suite-settings.png" alt="how to advertise on facebook - business settings" width="720" height="465" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60741" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-suite-settings.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-suite-settings-480x310.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul></ul>
<p>From there, click the second gear you see, or you might see a prompt to go to Business Settings. Both take you to the same place. Business settings is basically the legacy Business Manager.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-business-account-settings.png" alt="how to advertise on facebook - business settings" width="720" height="466" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60742" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-business-account-settings.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-business-account-settings-480x311.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You need a Facebook Page in order to advertise. On the left window, select Pages and then click Add. Here you can either add an existing Page, create a new Page, or request access to a Page (such as if you&#8217;re running ads for another business).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-add-page.png" alt="how to advertise on facebook - add facebook page" width="720" height="479" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60743" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-add-page.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-add-page-480x319.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>While you can supply the bare minimum just to get your page created, it&#8217;s best to build it out fully before you start advertising since users can navigate to your Page from your ad. Use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/16/facebook-business-page">our guide to creating a Facebook Business Page</a> to set your page up in full and optimize it for marketing purposes.</p>
<div id="account"></div>
<h3>3. Create your ad account</h3>
<p>Okay, now navigate back to Ad accounts in that left-hand pane. You&#8217;ll see an option on the right to create a new ad account.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-ad-account.png" alt="how to advertise on facebook - create ad account" width="720" height="478" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60744" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-ad-account.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-ad-account-480x319.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Provide your Ad account name, time zone, and currency, then click Next. Facebook will then ask you whether the ad account is going to be used to manage ads for the business account through which you&#8217;ve created this ad account or for another business or client.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-run-facebook-ads-who-this-ad-account.png" alt="how to advertise on facebook - select account" width="303" height="355" class="aligncenter wp-image-60745" /></p>
<p>Next, you&#8217;ll be asked to add people and permissions. Select your name and give yourself full control over everything.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-full-control.png" alt="how to advertise on facebook - user permissions" width="720" height="561" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60746" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-full-control.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-full-control-480x374.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Click Assign and then click Add Payment Info. Now you have an ad account set up.</p>
<div id="pixel"></div>
<h3>4. Add the pixel to your website</h3>
<p>You don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to do this step now, but you&#8217;re going to have to do it eventually, so you may as well get it over with! The pixel is a little snippet of code that will tell you what your ad viewers do once they land on your website. Insights from the pixel help you to further optimize your ads as well as create <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/04/facebook-retargeting">Facebook retargeting audiences</a> that tend to perform well.</p>
<p><strong>Note! </strong>For a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/scale-meta-ads-with-first-party-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> strong first-party data strategy in Meta</a>, it&#8217;s highly recommended you set up the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/06/facebook-conversions-api"> Facebook Conversions API</a> as well, as this is the best way to get the most complete picture of your data possible.</p>
<p>To set up the pixel, go to Data Sources, select Pixels, and on the right, click Add.</p>

<p>Facebook will ask you whether you want to install it manually or use a partner integration.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-install-facebook-pixel-choose-method.png" alt="facebook pixel installation methods" width="720" height="457" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60437" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-install-facebook-pixel-choose-method.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-install-facebook-pixel-choose-method-480x305.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The partner integration methods are designed to make the process easier without using code, so I&#8217;d encourage you to go that route first. Current partners include:</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress</li>
<li>WooCommerce</li>
<li>Tealium</li>
<li>Shopify</li>
<li>Makeshop</li>
<li>Magento</li>
<li>Google Tag Manager</li>
<li>Conversions API Gateway</li>
<li>Cafe24</li>
<li>Zapier</li>
<li>Segment</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/facebook-conversions-api-integrations.png" alt="facebook conversions api integrations" width="720" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60439" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/facebook-conversions-api-integrations.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/facebook-conversions-api-integrations-480x313.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If the partner integration method doesn&#8217;t work or you don&#8217;t use any of those platforms, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ynTNs5FAUm8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video tutorial on setting up the Facebook pixel manually</a> from <a href="https://ivanmana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ivan Mana </a>is super helpful.</p>
<h4>Set up your web events</h4>
<p>As part of the pixel setup process, you&#8217;ll have to verify your domain and configure your web events (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/20/facebook-aggregated-event-measurement">Aggregated Event Measurement</a>). Paid Media Pros offers an <a href="https://youtu.be/6ldKyiVkT4U" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easy tutorial video for configuring your web events</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-web-event-configuration.png" alt="how to advertise on facebook - configure web events" width="720" height="529" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60452" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-web-event-configuration.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-web-event-configuration-480x353.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Note that you can always revisit the domain verification process by going to Brand Safety &gt; Domains, and revisit the event setup process by going to Events Manager.</p>

<div id="campaign"></div>
<h3>5. Create your Facebook ad campaign</h3>
<p>Now, click the hamburger menu at the top left (All tools) and select Ads Manager.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-run-facebook-ads-ads-manager.png" alt="how to advertise on facebook - ads manager" width="720" height="552" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60748" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-run-facebook-ads-ads-manager.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-run-facebook-ads-ads-manager-480x368.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>On the left, select &#8220;Create.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-create-ad.png" alt="facebook ad manager - create ad" width="720" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60454" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-create-ad.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-create-ad-480x300.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Choose your campaign objective</h3>
<p>Facebook offers six ad objectives: awareness, traffic, engagement, leads, app promotion, and sales.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/facebook-ad-objectives-e1749239041209.webp" alt="facebook ad objectives" width="419" height="515" class="aligncenter wp-image-84952 size-full" /></p>
<p>In terms of which objective to choose, it will depend on what your offer is and who you&#8217;re targeting. Ultimately, you want to have a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/21/facebook-funnel">full-funnel Facebook ad strategy</a> where you create different campaigns for each stage of your funnel.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/facebook-ad-objective-chart.webp" alt="how to advertise on facebook - facebook ad objective chart" width="708" height="270" class="aligncenter wp-image-91936 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/facebook-ad-objective-chart.webp 708w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/facebook-ad-objective-chart-480x183.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 708px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Campaign settings</h4>
<p>Next, depending on the objective you choose, you may be prompted to choose your setup type. You can either go for an automated, &#8220;recommended settings&#8221; route or a manual setup route. We break down all the differences between the two<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-vs-manual-settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Facebook ad setup options</a> here.</p>
<p>Facebook ad campaigns built using recommended settings rely on the Meta Advantage+ suite, which is a set of AI-powered ad functions that behave similarly to Smart campaigns in Google Ads.</p>
<p>There is no right or wrong answer here, as you might want to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/meta-advantage-plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> try an Advantage+ campaign</a> if you&#8217;re not sure where to start. Or, Advantage+ can be helpful if you&#8217;re tight on bandwidth and can&#8217;t optimize and manage your campaigns to the fullest capacity.</p>
<p>On the opposite end, you may want more manual control over specific settings, placements, and audiences, as you test and scale your strategy. It all comes down to you and your team&#8217;s preferences and goals, so don&#8217;t be afraid to try both to see what works best.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-advantage-plus.webp" alt="how to advertise on facebook - facebook ad setup" width="652" height="434" class="aligncenter wp-image-91937 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-advantage-plus.webp 652w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-advantage-plus-480x320.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 652px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you opt for manual setup, you&#8217;ll see a panel of options like this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-campaign-settings.webp" alt="how to advertise on facebook - campaign settings" width="644" height="539" class="aligncenter wp-image-91944 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-campaign-settings.webp 644w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-campaign-settings-480x402.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 644px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Campaign name: </strong>Use whatever you want, as long as it makes sense to you.</li>
<li><strong>Campaign details:</strong> Here you can change your objective if you need to. Under &#8220;Show more options&#8221; you can also set a campaign spending limit.</li>
<li><strong>Advantage+ Campaign Budget:</strong> With this setting turned on, instead of choosing your budget separately for each ad set within a campaign, Meta Advantage+ machine learning will decide which ad sets should<span> receive a higher percentage of the spend based on performance.</span></li>
<li><strong>A/B test: </strong>We&#8217;re going to skip this for now, but you can learn more in our guide to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/11/facebook-ab-testing">Facebook A/B testing</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Special Ad Categories:</strong> If you fall into any of those special categories, declare that here so you can take care of any further documentation you may need to provide, depending on Facebook advertising policies.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Create your Facebook ad set</h3>
<p>Now we&#8217;re in the ad set stage. There are more features and settings here, too, but here&#8217;s what matters.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance goal:</strong> Choosing a performance goal helps Meta&#8217;s algorithms know how to best serve your ad according to your desired results. This may look different for different objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Cost per result goal</strong>: If you&#8217;re familiar with search ads, think of this like a maximum CPC bid target. You&#8217;re telling Meta your desired cost per result to help it deliver your ads according to your budget goals. However, know that way over- or under-shooting here could throw off the algorithm.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Frequency control:</strong> Depending on your campaign setup, you could set a cap or target for the number of times a user sees your ad.</li>
<li><strong>Delivery.</strong> Under &#8220;more options&#8221; you may be able to edit your ad set&#8217;s delivery settings depending on your overall campaign settings. This i<span>s where you tell the algorithm what you see as success for your ad set so that Facebook can further refine who it shows your ads to.</span></li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-run-facebook-ads-dynamic-ad-creative.webp" alt="how to advertise on facebook - facebook dynamic ads creative" width="648" height="154" class="aligncenter wp-image-91938 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-run-facebook-ads-dynamic-ad-creative.webp 648w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-to-run-facebook-ads-dynamic-ad-creative-480x114.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 648px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span>Scrolling further, there are a few more settings to set at the ad set level you&#8217;ll have to select before moving on. Again, the options here will vary depending on your campaign objective, but here is a quick guide on how to choose: </span></p>
<h4>Budget &amp; schedule</h4>
<p>Here is where you choose a daily budget or a lifetime budget. You can learn about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/19/facebook-ads-daily-vs-lifetime-budgets">daily vs. lifetime budgets here</a>, but in general</p>
<p>Choose<span> <strong>daily budgets</strong><span> when:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Your campaign will be evergreen</li>
<li>You want to maximize strong performance</li>
<li>You expect to change your budget regularly</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose<span> <strong>lifetime budgets</strong><span> when:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>You need to run your ads on a schedule</li>
<li>Your campaign has a set budget and end date</li>
</ul>
<p>If you go with a daily budget, it&#8217;s best to start with something like $5-10 a day. If you set it too low, your ad may not compete as well, meaning it will show less and not collect enough data for Facebook to further optimize for the best results. More on that in this list of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/05/facebook-ad-mistakes">Facebook advertising mistakes</a>.</p>
<p>You also have the option here to set up your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/13/how-to-set-up-ad-scheduling">ad scheduling</a>, which is fairly easy on Facebook. You can tell Facebook to only run your ads when it makes sense for your business (such as only during your operating hours) or audience (such as only running your breakfast cafe ads in the morning).</p>
<h4>Audience controls</h4>
<p>In this step, you select exactly <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ad-targeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who you want to reach with your Facebook ad</a>, which you can define based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Interests and behaviors</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/facebook-ad-audience-settings.png" alt="facebook ad audience settings" width="600" height="890" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60751" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/facebook-ad-audience-settings.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/facebook-ad-audience-settings-480x712.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You can check out our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/13/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-world">full guide to Facebook ad targeting</a>, but here&#8217;s a quick crash course:</p>
<p>Though it has taken a bit of a hit due to privacy changes, Facebook&#8217;s targeting is still among the most powerful out there since users provide such detailed information about themselves on this platform—their age, marital status, job, interests, and more. There are four types of audiences you can target in Facebook ads.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core audiences:</strong> target users based on their demographics, interests, and behaviors.</li>
<li><strong>Custom audiences:</strong> target and retarget customers and leads. These are pixel-based.</li>
<li><strong>Lookalike audiences:</strong> target people similar to your existing customers and leads.</li>
<li><strong>Advantage+ audiences:</strong> target people who fit your chosen &#8220;audience themes&#8221; using AI.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-advantage-plus-audience-suggestions-e1749241307119.webp" alt="facebook ad targeting - advantage plus audience suggestion example" width="713" height="593" class="aligncenter wp-image-87464 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-advantage-plus-audience-suggestions-e1749241307119-713x551.webp 713w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/facebook-ad-targeting-advantage-plus-audience-suggestions-e1749241307119-480x270.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 713px) 713px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li>For <strong>detailed targeting</strong>, you can create rules so that the ad targets users with one OR another or one AND another interest. Either way, it&#8217;s best to stick to just one or two interests or demographics per ad set. Otherwise, you won&#8217;t know what audiences are working for you. If you have more interests to target, you can always create new ad sets.</li>
<li>On the right, <strong>Audience definition</strong> will tell you how large or small your audience will be based on the criteria chosen, and <strong>Estimated daily results</strong> will tell you how many people you&#8217;re estimated to reach based on your daily spend. Keep in mind that these are just estimates and aren&#8217;t always 100% reliable, so take them with a grain of salt.</li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>

<h4>Choose your placements</h4>
<p>Now you&#8217;ll choose your placements. Placements refer to where your Facebook ad will appear on the Facebook network. Between mobile and desktop, Instagram and Facebook, there are a number of placements to choose from.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/b2b-facebook-ad-placement-priority-selection-1.png" alt="" width="650" height="377" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18759" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/b2b-facebook-ad-placement-priority-selection-1.png 650w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/b2b-facebook-ad-placement-priority-selection-1-480x278.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll have three options here: automatic, manual, or Advantage+ placements. You may be tempted to manually choose which placements you want, but if you&#8217;re just starting out, it&#8217;s best to leave it on the default, automatic placements, or choose Advantage+, and let your ad show on every possible placement to start. Then, after a week or two, you can look at which placements are performing best, switch to manual, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/01/08/facebook-ad-placement-optimization">optimize your placements</a> from there.</p>

<h3>7. Create your ad</h3>
<p>Now the fun part—creating your ad! The possibilities here are endless, but if you need a little inspiration, check out these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/05/23/facebook-ad-examples">Facebook ad examples</a>.</p>
<h4>Create your ad creative</h4>
<p>The creative refers to the visual part of your ad, and this should be the focal point of the ad. Facebook supports three ad formats: single image and video ads, carousel ads, and collection ads, and you have three creation options: use an existing post, a Creative hub mockup, or upload your own design.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/facebook-ad-setup.png" alt="facebook ad setup" width="413" height="586" class="aligncenter wp-image-60760" /></p>

<h4>Write your copy</h4>
<p>Next, it&#8217;s time for your ad copy, which consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary text:</strong> above the ad creative; only the first 125 characters show.</li>
<li><strong>Headline:</strong> just below the creative, 40 characters or less.<span> </span></li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong><span> just below the headline, 30 characters or less.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/facebook-ad-copy-ad-components.png" alt="facebook ad copy components" width="500" height="665" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55402" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/facebook-ad-copy-ad-components.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/facebook-ad-copy-ad-components-480x638.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>According to a study by <a href="https://adespresso.com/blog/we-analyzed-37259-facebook-ads-and-heres-what-we-learned/#:~:text=The%20median%20length%20for%20a,to%20the%20point%20each%20time." target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdEspresso</a>, The perfect Facebook ad headline length is five words. In terms of sentiment, split test both positive and negative <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotions</a> in your headlines. By using the same targeting, but switching up the ad copy, you’ll be able to see which emotional appeal resonates best with your audience.</p>

</ul>
<h4>Choose your call to action</h4>
<p>Once you enter your ad copy, enter your website URL and choose the call to action that makes the most sense for your offer. You can always A/B test this later!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/facebook-ad-call-to-action-list.png" alt="facebook ad creation - call to action list" width="434" height="368" class="aligncenter wp-image-60761" /></p>
<h4>Confirm your tracking</h4>
<p>Last but definitely not least, make sure your website event tracking is set up (if you skipped it earlier). You&#8217;ll have the option to set up app and offline events if applicable, as well as set a unique URL parameter so you can identify visitors to your website from this ad.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/facebook-ad-tracking.png" alt="facebook ad tracking setup" width="600" height="591" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60773" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/facebook-ad-tracking.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/facebook-ad-tracking-480x473.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="publish"></div>
<h3>8. Publish!</h3>
<p>That green button on the bottom right of your screen never looked so beautiful. Once you hit publish, an algorithm (and sometimes a person) will review for any <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/16/facebook-ad-not-approved">Facebook Ad disapprovals</a>, so your ad can take 24 hours (sometimes more) to get approved. Once it&#8217;s up and running, your ad will go through a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/13/learning-period">learning period</a> during which Facebook will gather the performance data it needs to optimize who it delivers the ad to and when.</p>

<h3>How does the Facebook ad auction work?</h3>
<p>The Facebook ad auction works differently from the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/14/how-does-google-ads-work">Google Ads auction</a>. The key factors involved in determining who wins the Facebook Ads auction include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your bid</li>
<li>Your ad quality and relevance</li>
<li>Your estimated action rates</li>
</ul>
<p>These qualities ultimately determine your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/14/facebook-advertising-cost"></a>Facebook cost per click, which goes a long way in determining Facebook metrics that are tied more closely to revenue, like cost per action and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/18/facebook-ads-cost-per-lead"></a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/18/facebook-ads-cost-per-lead">cost per lead</a>.</p>
<p>In order to make your ads as relevant as possible, make sure your audience is meticulously crafted, your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/best-facebook-ads"></a>Facebook ad creative and messaging resonate with said audience, and you’re rotating new ads in and out of your campaign periodically.</p>
<h3>How much do Facebook ads cost?</h3>
<p>Depending on industry, campaign objective, and other factors, the average Facebook cost per click can range anywhere from a quarter to $5. For a deeper dive, refer to our post on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/12/facebook-ads-cost">Facebook ad costs</a>.</p>

<h3>How does Facebook remarketing work?<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/11/16/facebook-remarketing"></a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/11/16/facebook-remarketing">Facebook remarketing </a>(or retargeting) allows you to advertise to users who have already engaged with your business, such as on your website, app, Facebook Page, other Facebook ads, or even offline. You can upload lists of leads or customers to target, or the pixel and Conversions API can also help identify these users. You can even layer audiences by combining retargeting with detailed targeting.</p>
<p>However, as pixel data is less reliable due to privacy, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/06/facebook-ads-on-platform-engagement">retargeting users based on their engagement with your business on Facebook</a> itself is the way to go.</p>
<h3>How should I structure my account?</h3>
<p>For <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/13/facebook-advertising-tips">effective Facebook advertising</a>, your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/30/facebook-ads-account-structure"></a><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/30/facebook-ads-account-structure">Facebook Ads account structure</a> should resemble a typical marketing funnel, with upper funnel campaigns devoted to prospecting, mid-funnel campaigns devoted to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-lookalike-audiences"></a>Facebook lookalike audiences and other audiences with mid-tier granularity, and lower-funnel campaigns devoted to highly refined Facebook remarketing audiences.</p>
<p>If you have the volume, you can also add broader Facebook lookalike audiences to your upper-funnel ad sets. And don’t forget to adjust your campaign objective based on the goal of each campaign. Your upper funnel campaigns should be geared toward driving awareness, getting clicks, and swelling your remarketing audiences, while your mid-and-lower-funnel audiences should be geared toward conversions (purchases, form fills, etc.). <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/26/how-to-optimize-facebook-ads">Head here for more Facebook ad optimization tips</a>.</p>
<h3>Why aren&#8217;t my Facebook ads working?</h3>

<li>Your targeting is too broad.</li>
<li>Your relevance score is too low.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How much does Google Ads cost? It’s a question we hear all the time, especially from newcomers to paid search. After all, you&#8217;ll want to know whether you can afford it. The good news is, you can! The slightly less good news is, there’s no easy, one-size-fits-all answer. The clearest (and most infuriating) one we can provide is: it depends.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-google-ads-benchmarks">benchmarks</a> we can use to guide our answer, but there are also plenty of factors that can mean your Google Ads cost will be lower (or higher) than these numbers.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t worry. In this guide, we&#8217;re going to cover all of the variables involved in Google Ads pricing so you can understand how much Google Ads will cost for your business and how to set a realistic budget. <a href="#spend"></a></p>

<h2>Typical Google Ads costs in 2025</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s start by reviewing some average <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-not-working">Google Ads</a> costs overall:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average cost per click in Google Ads in 2025 is <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-google-ads-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$5.26</a>.</li>
<li>The average cost per lead in Google Ads in 2025 is <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-google-ads-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$70.11</a>.</li>

<div id="factors"></div>
<h2>Factors that impact Google Ads pricing</h2>
<p>As mentioned above (and precisely why we&#8217;ve written this guide), there is no simple or one-size-fits all answer to the question of how much <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-ads-cost-too-much/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads will cost</a> your business. Google Ads pricing varies depending on your industry, customer lifecycle, current trends, and how well you manage your account.</p>
<h3>Industry</h3>
<p>The biggest influence on Google Ads pricing is industry. For example, the business services vertical (legal, accounting, real estate, etc.) is one of the more competitive verticals in Google Ads, which generally translates to higher costs per click (CPC) and costs per lead (CPL). This is due to the nature of the professional services industry: one new client could yield upwards of $1,000 &#8211; $10,000 depending on your business, so a CPC of $10 is a small price to pay for that client.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-GA-Benchmarks-CPC-871x1024.webp" alt="2025 google ads cost per click benchmarks chart" width="871" height="1024" class="aligncenter wp-image-91514 size-large" /></p>
<p>On the other hand, businesses in the arts and entertainment vertical have lower CPCs, but they need to reach a lot more customers to hit that $1,000 &#8211; $10,000 number.</p>

<h3>Customer lifecycle</h3>
<p>You also have to take into account the lifecycle of your customer. For bigger ticket offerings, it takes longer for potential clients to move through the decision-making process, and your business needs to stay top-of-mind throughout that journey. This may involve multiple visits to your website, a content download or two, participation in a webinar, and more—before taking that final step.</p>
<h3>Current trends</h3>
<p>Neither consumer trends nor online advertising platforms are ever in a state of rest. It&#8217;s important to keep up with what&#8217;s going on in your industry and within your niche—sentimentally and empirically. Take COVID, for example. At the height of the pandemic, the average cost per click for the apparel industry was about $1.40. It dropped down to $0.70 in April when average conversion rates went up, and then ended up at $0.89 in May.</p>
<h3>How well you manage your account</h3>
<p>A recent study by Google showed that the average ROI on Google Ads is 800%—that is, $8 for every $1 spent. Of course, this all depends on how well you manage your account. You can&#8217;t just activate your ads and kick back. If you want to keep your Google Ads costs low and your returns high, you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep a proper <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/05/02/adwords-account-structure-guide">Google Ads account structure.</a></li>
<li>Report on your performance and make data-driven <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/24/google-ads-optimization">optimizations</a>.</li>
<li>Maintain your keyword lists.</li>
<li>Perform regular account audits and more.</li>
</ul>

<div id="determine"></div>
<h2>How does Google Ads determine your cost per click?</h2>
<p>The great part about Google Ads is that while it works as an auction, the winners aren&#8217;t chosen based on bid alone, and you don&#8217;t necessarily pay your maximum bid. How is this possible? Let&#8217;s take a quick run-through of how Google Ads determines the winners and what they pay per click.</p>
<h3>Step #1: Quality Score</h3>
<p>When someone searches on Google, Google looks to see if any advertisers are bidding on keywords relevant to that query. If yes, an auction is triggered and Google enters all relevant ads into the auction. Its first step in choosing a winner is to assign each ad a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/quality-score">Quality Score</a>. This is a number from 1-10 determined by the ad and landing page&#8217;s relevance to the keyword, expected click-through rate (which involves your historic performance), and landing page experience.</p>
<p>To learn more, head on over to this post: <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/09/19/whats-a-good-quality-score">What is a Good Quality Score for Each Type of Keyword?</a><a href="/blog/ws/2013/07/16/quality-score-cost-per-conversion"></a><a href="/quality-score"></a></p>
<h3>Step #2: Ad Rank</h3>
<p>Google will then calculate each contending ad&#8217;s Ad Rank, which determines if and where your ad will be placed in the paid results section. Ad Rank is your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/09/19/whats-a-good-quality-score">Quality Score</a> multiplied by your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/maximum-bid">maximum bid</a> (the most you&#8217;re willing to pay per click on your ad).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-cost-google-ads-auction-formula.jpg" alt="google ads cost - google ads auction formula" width="935" height="326" class="aligncenter wp-image-91781 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-cost-google-ads-auction-formula.jpg 935w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-cost-google-ads-auction-formula-480x167.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 935px, 100vw" /><br />
The ads with the highest Ad Rank scores are the ones that get shown.</p>
<h3>Step #3: Cost per click</h3>
<p>If your ad gets shown, you only pay if someone clicks on it. But as mentioned above, you don&#8217;t necessarily pay your maximum bid. The Google Ads cost-per-click formula is: the Ad Rank of the ad below yours divided by your Quality Score, plus one cent.</p>
<p>With this formula, an advertiser can pay less per click than another advertiser in the SERP and still be in a higher position due to a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/19/does-quality-score-still-matter">better Quality Score</a>. This is why advertisers with a <a href="/blog/ws/2016/04/06/small-marketing-budget">small budget can compete with big spenders</a> on Google.</p>

<h3>Additional variables in your Google Ads costs</h3>
<p>There are several other variables that impact your Ad Rank—and ultimately, your ad spend—but maximum bid and Quality Score are the important ones to know. Here are some (but certainly not all) of the additional factors that influence your costs.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/11/14/ppc-landing-page-experience">Landing page relevance</a> and experience</li>

<div id="budget"></div>
<h2>How does budgeting work with Google Ads costs?</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s move on to the next component of Google Ads cost: budgeting. All too often, advertisers see their Google Ads budget for the month <a href="/blog/ws/2018/02/20/stop-burning-your-adwords-budget">get burned up</a> in a matter of days, leading them to believe Google Ads is prohibitively expensive. This isn’t necessarily the case; more often than not, it&#8217;s the result of a misunderstanding of how <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/14/google-ads-budgeting-strategies">Google Ads budgeting</a> works. So let&#8217;s set the record straight. Here are the terms to know:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget:</strong> How much you&#8217;re able to spend on Google Ads</li>
<li><strong>Bid:</strong> The most you&#8217;re willing to pay for a click on your ad.</li>
<li><strong>Spend:</strong> The amount Google takes out of your budget when an ad participates in an auction.</li>
<li><strong>Cost:</strong> The actual amount you pay for a click on your ad.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Daily average budgets</h3>
<p>When you set up a campaign in Google Ads, you will be asked to provide a daily budget. There is a shared budget feature, but if you&#8217;re just starting out, it&#8217;s best to give each campaign its own separate budget. But the daily budget you set does not mean Google will spend that exact amount each day. You’re giving Google a rough idea of what you’d like your daily spend to average out to at the end of the month—meaning it could exceed or fall short of that amount on any given day, which leads us to spending limits.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Spending limits</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Technically, Google could spend up to 100% more of, or double, your budget—if it means more clicks or conversions. This means that if you set a daily average budget of $50, your daily spending limit is $100. You will never pay more in a day than your daily spending limit, and you will never pay more than a month than your monthly spending limit (your average daily budget x 30.4; although if you&#8217;re not paying for Google Ads with the invoice method, you can <a href="/blog/ws/2021/05/26/google-ads-monthly-spend-limit">set a monthly spend limit</a> at the account level).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6385083" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>How to determine your average daily budget</h3>
<p>To calculate your average daily budget, simply take your budget for the month for that campaign and divide it by 30.4. What should your monthly budget be? This depends on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your overall Google Ads budget.</li>
<li>The average cost per click of the keywords you&#8217;re bidding on (which you can get with Google Keyword Planner or any other <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/09/18/best-keyword-research-tools">keyword research tool</a>).</li>
<li>The importance of that campaign relative to the others in your account.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, you may want to dedicate more budget to Campaign A, advertising your best-selling product, than to Campaign B, which promotes content to <a href="/blog/ws/2017/04/04/nurture-marketing">prospective customers</a> at the top of the funnel.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-cost-campaign-budget.jpg" alt="google ads costs - google ads budgets" width="550" height="395" class="aligncenter wp-image-91783 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-cost-campaign-budget.jpg 550w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-cost-campaign-budget-480x345.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 550px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You can also plug different daily average budget numbers into the budget report mentioned above to see how it would impact your monthly spend.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/15/google-ads-budget-report">The Google Ads budget report</a> gives you visibility into how much of your budget it spent on any given day.</p>

<h3>Bidding</h3>
<p>As we&#8217;ve mentioned a few times already in this guide, how much you&#8217;ll pay for Google Ads also depends on your bid. This is the maximum amount you&#8217;re willing to pay for a click on your ad. Simple enough, right? Well, as is the theme with this post, no. A few things to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even though Quality Score helps you to pay less for higher positions, that doesn&#8217;t mean you can set your bids super low. You need to make sure your bids are high enough to compete.</li>
<li>If you bid manually, you&#8217;ll set one maximum CPC per ad group, but you can set different bids for each keyword in that ad group.</li>
<li>If you choose automated bidding, you can still set maximum bid limits for strategies like maximize clicks.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-bidding-strategies-smart.jpg" alt="google ads bidding strategies" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-91784 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-bidding-strategies-smart.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-bidding-strategies-smart-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>

<div id="other-factors"></div>
<h2>What other factors influence my Google Ads costs?</h2>
<p>Just as there are factors that influence your Quality Score, which influences your Ad Rank, which influences your cost per click, there are factors that influence how your budget gets spent—which also play into how you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/21/how-to-save-money-google-ads">save money in Google Ads</a>.</p>
<h3>Ad scheduling</h3>
<p>Also known as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/13/how-to-set-up-ad-scheduling">ad scheduling</a>, dayparting is the practice of specifying when you want your ads to appear to prospective customers. Although your ads will still have to go through the ad auction process, you can tell Google <em>when</em> you want your ads to be displayed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-costs-ad-scheduling.jpg" alt="google ads costs - ad schedule" width="465" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-91785 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-costs-ad-scheduling.jpg 465w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-costs-ad-scheduling-233x300.jpg 233w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-ads-costs-ad-scheduling-400x516.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px" /></p>
<p>This is especially useful for <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/08/facebook-local-advertising">local businesses</a> that want to attract customers to a physical location through their ads. If you run a bakery that closes at 7 p.m., for example, you may not want your ads to be shown outside your normal business hours. Alternatively, you can specify that your ads run continually throughout the day, but allocate a greater portion of your daily budget for hours during which you want <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/02/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps">increased visibility</a>.</p>
<h3>Geotargeting</h3>
<p>Just as you can allocate more of your Google Ads budget to certain times of day, you can also spend more of your budget on certain geographical areas. This technique is known as geo-targeting, or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/07/google-ads-geotargeting">location targeting</a>.</p>
<p>Geotargeting allows you to ensure your ads appear only for Google searchers in specific areas, which can be as large as a state or province, or as small as a three-block radius from your store.</p>
<p>Google Ads geotargeting can be an excellent way to capitalize on growing mobile traffic trends and on-the-go shopping habits of today’s consumers, and it might factor into how you allocate your daily ad budget. For example, you may want your ads to appear alongside relevant searches in a particular state, but you could also allocate more budget to searches conducted in a specific city or even neighborhood.</p>
<h3>Device targeting</h3>
<p>Long gone are the days when prospects searched exclusively from desktop browsers. Today, consumers are searching online across multiple devices (often at the same time), which means you need to pay attention to where your most valuable leads are coming from. This is where <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/12/29/adwords-networks-devices-settings">device targeting</a> comes into play.</p>
<p>Let’s say that you want to appear on results across both desktop and mobile searches, but that mobile traffic is more valuable to you. If you&#8217;re using manual bidding, you could specify that a portion of your budget be used for desktop, but a greater portion be allocated to mobile devices. You may even want to devote more money to traffic coming from specific types of mobile devices, depending on what you’re advertising or your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/14/ppc-ad-copywriting"> ad copy</a>.</p>
<p>Setting a daily budget and understanding how it will be depleted are the most important aspects of budgeting for PPC, but it pays to be aware of how advanced targeting options can affect your Google Ads costs.</p>
<div id="cpc"></div>
<h2>Google Ads pricing: How much does a typical click cost in Google Ads?</h2>
<p>Now that you know how the Google Ads process works and how to set your budget, it makes sense for your next question to be, “How much does a typical click cost in Google Ads?” Unsurprisingly, the answer is complicated. But we&#8217;re going to break it down.</p>
<h3>The key influence on pricing in Google Ads: keywords</h3>
<p>In some ways, you can think of PPC advertising roughly along the same lines as traditional print advertising; you’d expect to spend more on a glossy full-page ad in a national magazine than you would for a classified ad in a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/now-is-the-time-to-lean-into-local-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local newspaper</a>. In digital marketing, however, the pricing isn&#8217;t influenced by the format of the ad, but rather the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-intent">intent</a> of and competition for the keywords you’re bidding on. So you can expect to spend more on a high-intent keyword like &#8220;roof repair near me&#8221; than something lower intent like &#8220;how much does it cost to repair a roof.&#8221;</p>
<p>In super-competitive markets like legal and accounting, clicks can get much pricier. Keyword costs can also fluctuate, and we typically see changes in Google Ads costs across industries year over year. Let’s take a look at some CPC benchmarks year over year in Google Ads to give you an idea of how much click costs can fluctuate for your business.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-GA-Benchmarks-CPC-YOY-836x1024.webp" alt="google ads average cost per click year over year benchmarks chart" width="836" height="1024" class="aligncenter wp-image-91515 size-large" /></p>
<h3>What is the average CPC in Google Ads?</h3>
<p>If you take the average CPCs across all different types of businesses and keywords in the US, <strong>the overall average CPC in Google Ads is $5.26</strong>. That&#8217;s on the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/05/20/google-adwords-search-versus-display">Search Network</a>. On the <a href="/blog/ws/2014/11/18/google-display-network-tips">Google Display network</a>, clicks tend to be cheaper, averaging under $1.</p>
<h3>What is the cost-per-click for long-tail keywords?</h3>
<p>People sometimes like to point at the grand, show-stopping keyword categories above as a definitive example of how expensive Google Ads can be. The reality, however, is that<strong> these keyword categories only make up a small portion of total search volumes.</strong> Long-tail keywords actually account for the majority of web searches and are also often significantly cheaper than shorter keyword-rich queries <em>and</em> can have as much—if not more—<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/30/commercial-intent-keywords">commercial intent.</a></p>
<p>For example, if someone has an ant problem in their kitchen, &#8220;exterminator [their town],&#8221; is one search they might perform. &#8220;Exterminator&#8221; as a broad keyword will likely have a high search volume and may be pricey. But they might also search for &#8220;how to get rid of ants in the kitchen.&#8221; This is a long-tail keyword with potentially lower competition and costs associated. The intent may not be as strong, since they could be looking to DIY, but it&#8217;s still pretty strong, so they&#8217;ll likely be open to—or even click on—an ad for an exterminator.</p>
<p>This is the kind of opportunity that long-tail keyword targeting presents to advertisers. In addition to making up the vast majority of searches,</p>
<p>You can learn more in this <a href="/long-tail-keywords">guide to long-tail keywords</a>.</p>
<h2>How much do Google Ads cost in my industry?</h2>
<p>As we&#8217;ve mentioned, Google Ads pricing varies from industry to industry, and even by subcategories within each industry. You can see the average CTR, CVR, as well as average cost per click and cost per lead in 20 different industries in our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/google-ads-industry-benchmarks?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2025GoogleAdsBenchmarks_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links">paid search advertising benchmarks report</a>. But here are some additional insights to help you <a href="/blog/ws/2015/12/08/should-i-use-adwords">decide whether you should use Google Ads</a>.</p>
<h3>What are the most expensive keywords in Google Ads and Bing Ads?</h3>
<p>As Google owns the largest paid search platform, we’ll focus on Google Ads first.</p>
<p>Listed below are the most expensive keyword categories in Google Ads, and the average cost-per-click of each. <strong>It’s worth noting that these are keyword <em>categories</em>, not actual keywords themselves</strong>—in some cases, the CPCs of keywords within each category may be higher than the averages stated:</p>

<h2>How much do typical businesses spend on Google Ads?</h2>
<p>Usually, once someone has asked about the average cost-per-click of a PPC ad, their next question will be how much do “typical” businesses spend on Google Ads as part of their larger <a href="/blog/ws/2017/07/05/online-advertising-costs">online marketing costs</a>. Unfortunately, this is another question without an easy answer. However, that doesn’t mean we can’t tell you a little bit more about how much a “typical” business spends on paid search. First, we need to look at overall spend data by industry.</p>
<p>If you look at the average cost per lead data below, you’ll see that the top five most competitive terms are likely found in these industries:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attorneys &amp; Legal Services</li>
<li>Furniture</li>
<li>Business Services</li>
<li>Apparel/Fashion &amp; Jewelry</li>
<li>Real Estate</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-GA-Benchmarks-CPL-871x1024.webp" alt="2025 google ads benchmarks - cost per lead" width="871" height="1024" class="aligncenter wp-image-91516 size-large" /><em></em><em></em></p>
<p>In our latest search advertising benchmarks report, we found these industries to have the highest average costs per click:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attorneys and legal services ($8.58)</li>
<li>Dentists and dental services ($7.85)</li>
<li>Home and home improvement ($7.85)</li>
<li>Education &amp; instruction ($6.23)</li>
<li>Personal services ($5.81)</li>
</ol>
<p>There&#8217;s also some overlap in the industries with the highest average cost per lead:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attorneys and legal services ($131.63)</li>
<li>Furniture ($121.51)</li>
<li>Business services ($103.54)</li>
<li>Apparel, fashion, and jewelry ($101.49)</li>
<li>Real Estate ($100.48)</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, companies in the business services and legal industries spend the most per month on Google Ads. Big brands in the industries above can spend $40 to $50 million a year, but this isn&#8217;t exactly relevant information to would-be advertisers who are still on the fence about Google Ads. And good news for you, you <em>don&#8217;t </em>need to spend millions on Google Ads to make it work for your business.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Are you making any mistakes in Google Ads? </strong>Find out instantly with the <strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Free Google Ads Performance Grader</a></strong>.</p>
<h2>How much do small businesses spend on Google Ads?</h2>
<p>As you might expect, the amount that small businesses spend on PPC varies widely. It can help to consider the<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-marketing-trends-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> typical SMB&#8217;s overall marketing budget</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/marketing-trends-report-2025-marketing-budget-breakdown-879x1024.webp" alt="google ads costs - overall budgets" width="879" height="1024" class="aligncenter wp-image-91788 size-large" /></p>
<p>Next, nearly half of small businesses are planning to invest more into search ads in the coming year. So, it&#8217;s safe to assume that a considerable amount of the average SMB overall marketing budget is being put towards Google Ads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/marketing-trends-report-2025-channel-investment-plans-1024x907.webp" alt="google ads costs - small business investment in paid search ads" width="1024" height="907" class="aligncenter wp-image-91789 size-large" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/marketing-trends-report-2025-channel-investment-plans-980x868.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/marketing-trends-report-2025-channel-investment-plans-480x425.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Additionally, for mid-sized companies and agencies, we typically see anywhere from $7,000 &#8211; $30,000 per month. That&#8217;s still a pretty wide range, but you can at least orient yourself with respect to where you fall on the spectrum.</p>
<p>You can find more helpful tips and strategies in our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/19/google-ads-for-small-businesses">Small Business Guide to Google Ads.</a></p>
<div id="costs"></div>
<h2>What are other Google Ads costs to be aware of?</h2>
<p>Your ad budget will always be the largest, most direct cost associated with your Google Ads campaigns. However, while your ad budget is important, it’s not necessarily the be-all and end-all of your paid search efforts. There are other potential costs you may have to consider, depending on your business, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-plan-goals-objectives-for-small-businesses/">marketing goals</a>, and individual situation, when <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/11/is-google-ads-worth-it">evaluating whether your investment in Google ads is worth it for your business</a>.</p>
<h3>Marketing partner costs</h3>
<p>Some small businesses opt to have an agency or a marketing partner handle their PPC work to save them the time and stress. This isn&#8217;t cheap, and even the smallest of boutique agencies will take a percentage of your ad spend, regardless of ROI. Google Ads management costs vary from one agency to another. Also, some agencies may guarantee a threshold ROI, whereas others won’t.</p>
<p>Even still, having a seasoned expert run your account can save you from costly errors and also help you yield the highest returns on your ad spend. To ensure you choose an agency, partner, or platform that is worth the investment, make sure you check off all your boxes when vetting them.</p>
<p>Obviously, it’s in the agency’s best interests to deliver results (to reduce churn and retain clients), but even if your ads don’t result in any conversions, you’ll still have to pony up and pay your agency unless it’s explicitly stated otherwise in your contract.</p>
<div id="takeaways"></div>
<h2>How much do Google Ads cost? Key takeaways</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve covered a lot in this guide, so let&#8217;s go over the key takeaways that you can use to orient yourself in terms of what you could spend in Google Ads:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before even getting into calculations, the cost of Google Ads for a business will depend on its industry, customer lifecycle, and current consumer trends.</li>
<li>Google Ads is based on an auction system that rewards high-quality ads with lower costs and better ad placement.</li>
<li>You can exercise tight control over how your Google Ads budget is spent using tactics like ad scheduling, geotargeting, and device targeting.</li>
<li>The average cost per click in Google Ads is $5.26.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Is the Google Ads price right for you?</h2>

<h2>What is a Google Knowledge Panel?</h2>
<p>A Google Knowledge Panel is the collection of information that appears on the upper right-hand side of your search results page (on desktop) when you search for a business, person, place, brand, or organization.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ads-knowledge-panel-example-png.avif" alt="google ads knowledge panel example" width="693" height="484" class="aligncenter wp-image-91098 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ads-knowledge-panel-example-png.avif 693w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ads-knowledge-panel-example-300x210.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ads-knowledge-panel-example-480x335.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px" /></p>
<p>The Knowledge Panel is part of Google’s Knowledge Graph, which uses existing, trusted data sources to surface quick, factual answers in the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-trends-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SERP</a>.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Ready to secure a Google Knowledge Panel for your business?</strong> Start with our<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/how-to-get-more-reviews?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_howtogetreviews_Download&amp;itm_source=localiq&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> free guide on how to get more reviews</a>, complete with tips to boost ranking, reputation, and revenue!</p>

<h3>Benefits of a Google Knowledge Panel</h3>
<p>A Google Knowledge Panel gives your brand an official and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/06/online-reputation-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> credible presence</a> in search results, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-make-your-business-stand-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helping you to stand out</a>, take up more real estate on the page, and surface key information at a glance. For businesses looking to build trust and visibility, it’s a powerful asset. Here are some quick benefits:</p>
<ul>

<li>Improves discoverability across platforms</li>
</ul>
<div id="google-knowledge-panel-vs-google-business-profile"></div>
<h2>Google Knowledge Panel vs. Google Business Profile: What’s the difference?</h2>
<p>Your Google Knowledge Panel is not the same as your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-business-profile-features">Google Business Profile</a> (GBP), which is your listing that also appears on the right-hand side of the SERP. Here’s a chart that helps to illustrate their differences, thanks to ChatGPT:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-knowledge-panel-benefits-png.avif" alt="google knowledge panel - google business profile comparison" width="785" height="431" class="aligncenter wp-image-91099 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-knowledge-panel-benefits-png.avif 785w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-knowledge-panel-benefits-300x165.avif 300w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-knowledge-panel-benefits-768x422.avif 768w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-knowledge-panel-benefits-480x264.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px" /></p>
<p>While Google may use information from your GBP in its Knowledge Graph, having a GBP doesn’t guarantee you’ll have a Knowledge Panel. A Knowledge Panel requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong online presence</li>
<li>Structured data</li>
<li>External authority sources (like Wikidata, news, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s dive into that.</p>
<div id="google-knowledge-panel-how-to-get"></div>
<h2>How to get a Google Knowledge Panel for your business</h2>
<p>If you’re trying to get a Google Knowledge Panel for your business, you’ve got your work cut out for you in five key areas:</p>
<h3>1. Request a Knowledge Panel claim</h3>
<p>For starters, search your business name and see if a panel already exists. If it does, click the three dots next to your company category and choose “Claim this knowledge panel.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-knowledge-panel-examples-png.avif" alt="google knowledge panel - example knowledge panel on serp" width="496" height="504" class="aligncenter wp-image-91095 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-knowledge-panel-examples-png.avif 496w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-knowledge-panel-examples-295x300.avif 295w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-knowledge-panel-examples-480x488.avif 480w" sizes="(max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px" /></p>

<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> This<a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLTheDefinitiveGuideBrandAwareness.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_BrandAwareness_Guide_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> definitive guide to brand awareness</a> can help you build your online presence for an optimized Google Knowledge Panel!</strong></p>
<h3>2. Claim and optimize your Google Business Profile</h3>
<p>As we mentioned above, your Google Business Profile doesn’t guarantee a Knowledge Panel, but it does influence it. Here’s what you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-claim-a-business-on-google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Claim your Google Business Profile</strong></a><strong>. </strong>This will allow you to edit your business information, respond to reviews, and more. Use our post for more detailed tips and instructions.</li>
<li><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/optimize-google-my-business-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Optimize your Google Business Profile</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Provided you’ve claimed your profile, you can optimize it with reviews, photos, and regular updates.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Build your online presence</h3>
<p>There are a few <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/05/seo-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buckets of SEO</a> to focus on to help secure your Google Knowledge Panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your listings.</strong> This is essentially your local SEO, which means making sure your business name, contact information, and descriptions are consistent across listings. Our <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/local-seo-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local SEO checklist</a> can help with this.</li>
<li><strong>Keyword-targeted content. </strong>Use our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/06/on-page-seo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on-page SEO</a> guide to make sure you’re writing quality, authoritative content that ranks.</li>
<li><strong>About us page.</strong> A strong About us page that includes your founding date, founders and leadership, location, products and services, industry, and other key milestones can help legitimize your business as well as other profiles across the web.</li>
<li><strong>Schema markup. </strong>This is a type of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/15/what-is-schema-markup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structured data</a> that you add to your website’s HTML to help search engines understand the meaning behind content as opposed to just the words on the page. Schema types that will help the most here are Organization, LocalBusiness, Person, SameAs, Logo, URL, ContactPoint, and Address.</li>

<h3>4. Build your online authority</h3>
<p>In addition to building up your own content, you’ll also want to get featured in other trusted content. This is where networking and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/digital-marketing/influencer-marketing-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">influencer marketing</a> come into play. Here are some ways to get featured in content across the web:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press releases</li>
<li>Interviews</li>
<li>Podcasts</li>
<li>Backlinks</li>
</ul>
<p>Use our <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/influencer-outreach/">influencer outreach email templates</a> or these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/10/link-building-secrets">backlinking strategies</a> to get started.</p>
<h3>5. Get listed on key sites</h3>
<p>This tactic is similar to the one we just talked about, since it’s about getting mentions on websites other than your own, but this time we’re referring to specific sites that have heavy influence on Knowledge Panel information. We’re also referring to official listings or profiles, as opposed to a featured article or mention in a blog post. Sites to get listed on include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page"><strong>Wikidata</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Google pulls information directly from here. It’s like a giant fact sheet, all written in Google’s love language (structured data)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/"><strong>Wikipedia</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Google also loves Wikipedia. This is like the human-friendly version of Wikidata, which helps keep Google’s Knowledge Panel readable.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/"><strong>Crunchbase</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Google doesn’t pull from here as directly, but it’s still a trusted source. Think of it as your business resume — third-party validation that helps build your credibility.</li>
<li><strong>Industry directories</strong> (for example,<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/angi-business-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Angi</a>, Houzz, and Thumbtack for home services or Avvo, Martindale-Hubbell, and Justia in the legal field.)</li>
</ul>
<p>A few notes: Just as we mentioned earlier when talking about SEO, it’s important to ensure that your information is consistent and accurate across each of these sites. Also, don’t try to game the system with these sites, especially the Wikis. They have strict guidelines in place precisely so these platforms can remain a trusted source of information.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick chart on Wikipedia vs Wikidata to help you understand their differences and how they impact your Knowledge Panel, thanks to ChatGPT.</p>

<h2>Google Knowledge Panel FAQs</h2>
<p>Here are answers to some other questions you might have about getting a Google Knowledge Panel.</p>
<h3>Can you edit your Google Knowledge Panel?</h3>
<p>You can’t directly edit your Knowledge Panel like you would a Google Business Profile, but you can influence it using the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-tactics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO strategies</a> mentioned above.</p>
<h3>How long does it take to get a Google Knowledge Panel?</h3>
<p>This varies from weeks to months, depending on how much web authority, citations, and structured data already exist in relation to your business.</p>
<h3>Who can get a Google Knowledge Panel?</h3>
<p>Businesses, public figures, artists, and organizations. You don’t have to be a celebrity or major brand either—local businesses and microinfluencers can get Knowledge Panels too.</p>
<h3>Does having a Wikipedia page guarantee a Google Knowledge Panel?<strong><br />
</strong></h3>
<p>No, but it helps a lot. <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-create-a-wikipedia-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Wikipedia page</a> will increase your business&#8217;s credibility and notability in Google&#8217;s eyes, especially when combined with the other strategies in this post, like structured data and other citations.</p>
<h3>Do I need a PR agency to get featured in external sources?<strong><br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Not necessarily. While a PR agency can help, you can also land mentions on your own through guest posting, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/04/how-to-write-a-press-release">press releases</a>, podcast interviews, and backlink outreach.</p>
<h3>What should I do if incorrect info appears in my Knowledge Panel?<strong><br />
</strong></h3>
<p>You can suggest edits after claiming your Knowledge Panel, but changes aren&#8217;t guaranteed. Your best bet is to edit the information at the source (like Wikidata or your Google Business Profile) and make sure it&#8217;s consistent across the web.</p>
<h3>Can I have both a Knowledge Panel and a Google Business Profile?<strong><br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Yes, and you should! The two often complement each other and work together to improve your visibility in both branded search and local results.</p>
<h2>Get working on your Google Knowledge Panel now</h2>
<p>A Knowledge Panel is a powerful trust signal that can boost your brand’s visibility, authority, and SEO. While you can’t control every aspect of how Google displays it, you <em>can</em> control how your business shows up across the web.

<h2>Fact-based Memorial Day captions</h2>
<p>We all know what Memorial Day is, but few of us know the real details behind the holiday. Incorporate some of these <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/holidays/memorial-day-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Memorial Day facts</a> into your captions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Memorial Day was originally known as Decoration Day, as men and women would decorate the graves of fallen soldiers with flowers.</li>
<li>It originated in the years after the Civil War (1865), but it wasn&#8217;t a federal holiday until 1971.</li>
<li>Every Memorial Day at 3:00 p.m. local time, a national moment of remembrance takes place.</li>
<li>In 1966, the federal government declared Waterloo, New York, the official birthplace of Memorial Day.</li>
<li>According to legend, &#8220;founder&#8221; General John A. Logan chose May 30 because it was one of the few days that didn’t fall on the anniversary of a Civil War battle. Some, though some historians believe the date was selected to ensure that flowers across the country would be in full bloom.</li>
<li>More than 36 million people will travel at least 50 miles from home to celebrate Memorial Day with friends and family <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f62e.png" alt="😮" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> What are you doing to celebrate Memorial Day?

<h2>Diversity, equity, and inclusion marketing ideas in May</h2>
<p>We all hear about diversity, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/05/accessibility-inclusivity-advertising">accessibility, and inclusion in marketing</a> but what does that look like? Let&#8217;s take a look.</p>
<h3>National Honor Our LGBT Elders Day</h3>
<p>This holiday, celebrated every May 16, was created by Chase Brexton Health Care, an LGBT health resource center. It is focused on honoring protestors, supporters, doctors, politicians, influencers, and others who blazed the trail with the LGBT movement.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/may-marketing-ideas-lgbt-elders-day-graphic-header.jpeg" alt="may marketing ideas - national honor our lgbt elders day" width="720" height="360" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60334" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/may-marketing-ideas-lgbt-elders-day-graphic-header.jpeg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/may-marketing-ideas-lgbt-elders-day-graphic-header-480x240.jpeg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.iona.org/honor-our-lgbt-elders-day-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Here are some ways to honor them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do some research and identify LGBT trailblazers in your geographic or industrial niche and write a blog post or social media fun fact post about them.</li>
<li>Ask your audience to share older LGBT mentors and thought leaders in their lives.</li>
<li>Raise awareness about the importance of taking care of LGBT elders who may still lack the care and support they need.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Jewish, Haitian, Asian &amp; Pacific Island Heritage Month</h3>
<p>In May, we celebrate individuals of Jewish, Haitian, Asian, or Pacific Island descent. Here are some ways to do just that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider learning about each of these groups and sharing your findings in a blog post or on social media.</li>
<li>Interview a coworker, client, or friend who identifies with one of these groups on a topic relevant to your audience.</li>
<li>Put a request out there to your network for individuals within those groups to write a guest post or share their experience about something with a dedicated hashtag.</li>
</ul>
<h3>National Foster Care Month</h3>
<p>Contrary to what we often see in sitcoms or novels, most people grow up with varying family dynamics. <a href="https://www.childwelfare.gov/fostercaremonth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Foster Care Month</a> is meant to <span>recognize &#8220;the important role that members from all parts of child welfare play in supporting children, youth, and families.&#8221;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Update your marketing copy to be more inclusive. For example, instead of promoting a sale for moms and dads, you may want to extend your offer to caretakers, grandparents, or guardians as well.</li>
<li>Post foster care facts on social media to inspire your audience to take action. For example, did you know that foster youth are <a href="https://www.afs4kids.org/blog/29-surprising-foster-care-facts/#:~:text=6%20percent%20of%20all%20children,more%20likely%20to%20have%20Anxiety." target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven times</a> more likely to have depression, and five times more likely to have anxiety? There are tons of interesting (and eye-opening) statistics like this on the current state of the foster care system that your followers could find both interesting and action-worthy. This will show that your business truly cares for the cause.</li>
<li>Connect with local foster care organizations to find ways you and your audience could donate or volunteer. For example, many foster care parents and case workers share Amazon wish lists and more on social media to allow people to support foster children or former foster youth.</li>

<p>This fitness center took their spin class outdoors to shake things up a bit. This is a great idea, especially during the pandemic. If lugging out equipment isn’t an option, go for a yoga class, dance class, or boot camp. This is also a great way to show potential customers how awesome your classes are.</p>

<h2>May marketing ideas for national days and holidays</h2>
<p>There are plenty of holidays and observances in May that can fuel your marketing plan.</p>
<h3>Kentucky Derby</h3>
<p>Use the Kentucky Derby in your May marketing efforts. Get <a href="/blog/ws/2014/06/12/marketing-ideas">creative</a> with derby fashion or horse-themed decorations, promotions, contests, and events. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>Change up your storefront with a derby theme to grab attention and attract customers.</li>

<li>Throw a derby party with derby hat contests and mint juleps.</li>

<h3>Cinco de Mayo</h3>
<p>In the spirit of Cinco de Mayo, there are many ways to infuse a Mexican-American spirit into your marketing. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Food or fitness businesses can post recipes or videos of recipes on social media.</li>
<li>Give out coupons the day before or a few days before, redeemable on Cinco de Mayo.</li>
<li>Share a festive discount “code word” on social media, and customers who mention the code in-store get 15% off.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/may-marketing-ideas-cinco-de-mayo-1.png" alt="may marketing ideas—facebook post about cinco de mayo event" width="400" height="599" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<ul>
<li>Use a triumph or underdog theme. This holiday comes from Mexico’s unlikely victory over the French in the Battle of Puebla. Give your customers the victory over high prices, long lines, slow service, and more with particular deals.</li>
<li>Use the number five in your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/13/sales-promotion-examples">promotions</a>, such as: get the fifth one free, $5 specials, 5% off, 5 for 5, etc.</li>
<li>Throw a party or cooking class revolving around Mexican food and culture.</li>
<li>Consider offering your followers information about where to enjoy Cinco de Mayo. Remember, not everything you post should be in an effort to make a sale. Providing useful information gives your followers another reason to keep watching you on <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business">social media</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Teacher Appreciation Day</h3>
<p>May 7 is Teacher Appreciation Day—a perfect time for preschools to market themselves to new parents in anticipation of the new school year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Throw a party for teachers or have students write thank you letters to show off on your blog, in <a href="/blog/ws/2021/01/05/creative-newsletter-names">email newsletters</a> to parents, or on social media.</li>
<li>Update your <a href="/blog/ws/2017/11/15/website-copy">website content</a> with new teacher bios and pictures.</li>
<li>Did anyone receive a new degree or have a teacher accomplishment to share? This is the perfect time to showcase them on an “<a href="/blog/ws/2016/05/27/guide-to-about-us-pages">About Us</a>” page on your website. Doing so not only highlights your teaching staff, but it also can <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-improve-seo-for-your-local-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improve your SEO</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Speaking of <a href="/blog/ws/2016/03/22/ppc-account-audit-tips">spring cleaning</a>, why not do a little of your own by going through your website, ad campaigns, social media profiles, and listings to make sure information is up to date, photos are relevant to the season, and links are working properly? You may want to refresh some of the evergreen <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/may-content-ideas">May content</a> from last year that performed well around this time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather up your top reviews from last year and share them on social media. These make for enjoyable Tweets with no pressure to click a link or read more. You might also share success stories with before-and-after photos to get clients excited about the warm weather.</li>
<li>What better time to get the chatter going about your business when people are getting excited about the warm weather? <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/26/word-of-mouth-marketing">Word-of-mouth marketing</a> is important for small businesses. Offer existing clients a discount or incentive for each new client they refer who becomes a paying customer.</li>

<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>April showers bring May flowers. If you own a flower shop, May marketing is your time to shine! (If you don’t, there are still opportunities!).</p>
<ul>
<li>Host that flower-arranging workshop you’ve been thinking about.</li>
<li>Start a Pinterest board to see if Pinterest is right for your business, or grow your <a href="/blog/ws/2012/05/01/pinterest-marketing-guide">Pinterest</a> following with your creations linked to your online store or blog.</li>
<li>You don’t have to be a florist to use flowers in your marketing. Spruce up your office, <a href="/blog/ws/2015/01/14/restaurant-marketing">restaurant</a>, or storefront with flowers. Nothing says “spring” like fresh-cut flowers that add a pop of color to your business space.</li>
<li>Buy flowers from a local florist and introduce yourself. Supporting other small business owners is the first step to getting more word-of-mouth <a href="/blog/ws/2019/05/06/referral-marketing">referrals</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Weddings</h3>
<p>May is the start of wedding season and a perfect time to market your business to new people who are in town. Unless, of course, you’re hosting a virtual wedding this year due to the pandemic. Here are some wedding-based marketing ideas for both live and virtual weddings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Caterers, event planners, DJs, photographers, bakeries, and other wedding-friendly services: Use social media to engage customers as much as possible. Whether you’re hosting the bachelorette party at your restaurant, baking the wedding cupcakes at your bakery, or photographing the event, be sure to take pictures and <a href="/blog/ws/2018/07/02/facebook-marketing-for-small-business">share them on Facebook</a> and other social media platforms. You may also want to ask and see if you can use the special custom hashtag for the event. This is a great way to put a name to the features of the wedding that stick out to guests (who can become or refer you to new customers) and their social media audiences.</li>
<li>Landscapers can capitalize on wedding venue owners looking to perfect their property.</li>
<li>Or perhaps you want to run a virtual wedding planning campaign, through organic content or <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/local-advertising-ideas-for-small-businesses/">paid ads</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/may-marketing-ideas-virtual-wedding-1.png" alt="may marketing ideas—wedding season ads and blog posts in the SERP" width="800" height="636" class="aligncenter" /></div>
<ul>
<li>Fitness and nutrition businesses can provide workouts, recipes, <a href="/blog/ws/2014/07/17/headline-writing">blog posts</a>, and tips on getting to your healthiest and best version of yourself in time for these heavily photographed events.</li>
</ul>
<h3>More May marketing magic</h3>
<p>Show how busy your business has been by simply providing some updates for the month of May. You could frame it as &#8220;May mayhem&#8221; to showcase to your audience how your business is rapidly progressing. You might:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://localiq.com/free-business-listings-grader/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Check your business listings</a> for anything that needs updating, like adding more images, new seasonal hours, etc.</li>

<li>And more!</li>
</ul>

<div id="google-ads-copy-best-practices"></div>
<h2>Best practices for writing Google Ads</h2>
<p>Here are some fundamental best practices for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/21/adwords-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writing super-effective Google Ads</a>.</p>
<h3>Prioritize relevance</h3>
<p>The Google Ads algorithm is all about relevance. Make sure your ad copy is super relevant to your keywords and that your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">landing page</a> is super relevant to your ads. The more continuity there is, the better.</p>
<h3>Use keywords in headlines for better visibility</h3>
<p>This helps with relevancy, allowing you to match search intent, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/19/does-quality-score-still-matter">boost Quality Score</a> (which can lower CPC), and increase CTR. Two quick tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>See if you can use long-tail keywords for high-intent searches. For example, “best metal roof installers for storm protection.”</li>
<li>For shorter keywords, place them at the beginning of the headline to ensure visibility.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use ad assets</h3>
<p>Use various<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/25/google-ads-extensions-guide"> ad assets</a> (formerly called &#8220;extensions”) to provide additional information and links, enhancing ad relevance and performance.</p>
<p>Popular ones include structured snippets, price, lead forms, sitelinks, location, and call assets.</p>

<h3>A/B test</h3>
<p>Even with responsive search ads doing the mixing and matching for you, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ab-testing-examples">you should still be testing different approaches with your ads</a>. You may even separate them into different campaigns based on an overall theme. After all, you only get so much visibility into the performance of each ad combination within a single RSA campaign.</p>
<p>Some things to test include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short vs. long-tail keywords</li>
<li>Direct vs. benefit-driven phrasing</li>
<li>Urgency-focused vs. informational headlines</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tricks for writing high-performing Google Ads</h2>
<p>It’s one thing to follow best practices for Google Ads. It’s another to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/03/how-to-write-exceptional-ppc-ad-copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">write exceptional Google ads</a>. Here are the techniques to employ, that go beyond best practices, to help you maximize conversions.</p>
<h3>Copywriting tricks</h3>
<p>Ah, copywriting. I’m in my natural habitat here. I could go on for days, but I’ll keep it short:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use emotion for high-performing headlines.</strong> We’ve got over <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/01/13/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">130 emotional words and phrases</a> for you to browse through, plus<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/21/emotional-ad-copy-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> these examples of emotional ad copy</a> to inspire you.</li>
<li><strong>Use psychological techniques to boost CTR. </strong>There are several ways to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/01/psychology-copywriting-tips-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use psychology in your ad copy</a>. You can appeal to moral values, scarcity, repetition, hyperbole, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Use social proof. </strong>Leverage testimonial quotes and stats to convey to your audience that others are happy with your product or service. This is the most powerful tool at your disposal.</li>
<li><strong>Use power words. </strong>Pair your keywords with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/22/power-words" target="_blank" rel="noopener">power words</a>. Examples include &#8220;exclusive,&#8221; &#8220;proven,&#8221; &#8220;award-winning,&#8221; &#8220;instant,&#8221; &#8220;guaranteed,&#8221; and &#8220;effortless.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Offer the right balance.</strong> Use our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/05/responsive-search-ad-copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">responsive ad copy template</a> to make sure you’re using the right mix of features, benefits, and pain points.</li>
<li><strong>Offer an incentive. </strong>The best way to stand out is to offer some sort of tangible incentive, like a discount, a free offer, or a high-demand feature.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ads-copy-example-png.webp" alt="how to write google ads - google ad auto example" width="843" height="271" class="aligncenter wp-image-90577 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ads-copy-example-png.webp 843w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ads-copy-example-480x154.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 843px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Nothing like a little fear-based copy about overpaying to complete your Google ad copy.</em></p>

</ul>
<h3>CTA tricks</h3>
<p>The more specific you are with your call to action, the better. Another pro tip: Tailor your CTA for the intent of your audience. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Top of funnel:</strong> Learn More, See How It Works, Get the Guide, Explore Solutions</li>
<li><strong>Middle</strong>: Start Your Free Trial, Compare Plans, See Pricing, Schedule a Consult, Book a Demo</li>
<li><strong>Bottom:</strong> Talk to an Expert Now, Get Started Now, Sign Up &amp; Save 20%, Order Now &amp; Get Half Off,</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ads-copy-example-ad-png.webp" alt="how to write google ads - dental google ads copy example" width="800" height="242" class="aligncenter wp-image-90576 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ads-copy-example-ad-png.webp 800w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/google-ads-copy-example-ad-480x145.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8220;Get dental implants in one day&#8221; is highly specific. Plus, this example has a nice nod to the importance of experience.</em></p>
<h3>Keyword tricks</h3>
<p>Try <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/17/dynamic-keyword-insertion-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dynamic keyword insertion</a>. This feature will automatically insert the exact search term into the headline. For example: “{KeyWord: Custom Window Installation} &#8211; Get a Free Quote.”</p>
<p>But you need to be careful with your template for this one because you can get some awkward phrasing. For example “Need Fix Leaky Faucet Myself? Call Now!” or “Get Cheap Roofing Companies Near Me.” These will convey carelessness and disingenuousness (sidenote: wow, I thought for sure autocorrect was going to tell me this isn’t a word. I’m pumped).</p>
<h3>Targeting tricks</h3>
<p>With some Google Ads campaign types (Performance Max especially), you can upload customer lists, email lists, CRM data, past purchase behavior, and more for more <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-audience-targeting">precise targeting</a> and therefore more precise ad copy. What’s more, this is all <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/12/first-party-data">first-party data</a>, which is accurate, privacy-compliant, and insight-rich. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Existing customers</strong> → cross-sell to existing customers, promote a special offer to VIP customers, reengage dormant customers</li>
<li><strong>Existing leads</strong> → win back old leads who visited your website or who booked a demo but never closed</li>
<li><strong>Website visitors</strong> → retarget people based on pages they visited or cart behavior</li>
</ul>

<p>So in this article, we’re sharing the 28 best advertising techniques broken into five different categories with examples for each. Let’s dive in.</p>

<h2>What are advertising techniques?</h2>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/advertising-techniques/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advertising techniques</a> are strategic approaches used when <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">promoting your products and services</a>, as a way to influence your audience’s decision-making and behaviors. While advertising <em>strategies</em> refer to the channel or medium you’re using (like social media videos, paid search ads, etc), the techniques are the underlying <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/23/influence-buyers-marketing-psychology">psychological approach</a> you take to make the message memorable, appealing, and effective.</p>
<p>Think of it as the means by which you connect with your audience&#8217;s needs, desires, or values.</p>

<h3>Design and aesthetic advertising techniques</h3>
<p>These advertising techniques rely on visual, auditory, or structural design to build a memorable impression.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimalism:</strong> Focuses on simplicity and clean design to communicate a message effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Typographic composition: </strong>Uses fonts, sizes, and layouts to convey tone, information hierarchy, or points of emphasis.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/12/color-psychology-marketing"><strong>Color psychology</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Leverages colors to influence emotions and perceptions of the brand.</li>
<li><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Uses icons, metaphors, or imagery to represent deeper meanings or emotions.</li>
<li><strong>Jingles and music:</strong> Uses catchy tunes to create auditory recognition (or get stuck in your head for days or weeks).</li>
<li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Draws attention with opposing colors, messages, or designs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use these advertising techniques to make an impact</h2>
<p>Advertising isn’t just about what you say—it’s about how you say it. The most successful ads don’t just present information; they engage, persuade, and stick with your audience long after they’ve seen them.</p>
<p>So as you refine your next campaign, think beyond the medium and focus on the method. Whether that’s tapping into emotion, leveraging social influence, crafting a striking visual, or using logic to drive action, the right technique can make all the difference.</p>
<p>Now use these techniques to go make some unforgettable ads.</p>

<h2>Meaningful February marketing ideas</h2>
<p>In addition to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/16/inclusive-holiday-marketing-ideas">inclusivity</a>, there are plenty of other themes during February that can help you with meaningful marketing.

<h3>Heart Health Awareness Month</h3>
<p>So February isn’t all about that $1 pink balloon heart but also that invaluable organ inside of you that makes you tick. If your business is focused on health and wellness, this is a great marketing opportunity for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fitness centers and gyms can partner with a local health center for heart disease awareness or screenings (here are more <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/offline-marketing-ideas/">offline marketing ideas</a>).</li>
<li>Host special classes focusing on cardiovascular activity.</li>
<li>Write informative blog posts about heart health and risk factors. Use this time to market your business by educating your customers on leading healthy lives.</li>
<li>Give out a free heart-healthy gift with purchases or registrations.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the example below, this fitness center is giving out free heart rate monitors to those who join in the month of February.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/february20marketing20ideas20national20heart20month.png" alt="february marketing ideas national heart month" width="800" height="584" /></div>
<p>If you’re not a health or fitness business, no problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>Any business can sponsor a Healing Heart 5k, or donate a portion of their profits to a heart health-related nonprofit.</li>
<li>Think outside the box—pet hearts, artichoke hearts, hearts of remain, website health (the heart of a business marketing strategy, for example).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Children’s Dental Health Month</h3>
<p>Dentists can certainly have a field day with this one, but other businesses can use this opportunity to teach parents and students about the importance of dental health.</p>
<ul>
<li>Daycares, fitness centers, and churches can host special classes about the importance of dental hygiene.</li>
<li>If you’re a dentist, you may offer to teach such classes. Or spruce up your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/29/dentist-websites">dentist website</a> with some extra decorations or promotions.</li>
<li>Ecommerce businesses can promote their oral hygiene products.</li>
<li>If you’re not a dentist, a simple social media post to bring your target audience’s attention to the cause can go a long way.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/february-marketing-ideas-kids-dental-month.webp" alt="February marketing ideas - Instagram post featuring children's dental advice." width="449" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88277 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/february-marketing-ideas-kids-dental-month.webp 449w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/february-marketing-ideas-kids-dental-month-225x300.webp 225w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" /></p>
<ul></ul>
<h3>Cancer Awareness Month</h3>
<p>In addition to having World Cancer Day, the whole month of February is dedicated to cancer awareness. Show your support on Facebook with a purple-themed post or initiative. You can encourage your <a href="/blog/ws/2016/10/19/get-more-instagram-followers">followers</a> to “purple” their profile, <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">promote your purple products</a>, or run a purple-themed contest.</p>

<h3>Wear Red Day</h3>
<p>National Wear Red Day is focused on raising awareness for heart disease. On this day, you could:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2019/05/21/facebook-ads-for-events">Host an event</a> in support of cardiovascular health and promote it on Instagram.</li>
<li>Promote your red products or give your social media profiles or homepage a red theme for the day.</li>
<li>Post an applicable picture to Instagram with an eye-opening stat. This is a great way to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/27/how-to-increase-instagram-engagement">increase Instagram engagement</a>.</li>

<h3>World Cancer Day</h3>
<p>You may also want to use some of your marketing muscle to promote awareness for World Cancer Day itself. This is a good option for health and fitness businesses. But any brand with a following can make a difference here, too.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/february-marketing-ideas-cancer-day.webp" alt="February marketing ideas - Instagram post about defeating cancer." width="427" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88278 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/february-marketing-ideas-cancer-day.webp 427w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/february-marketing-ideas-cancer-day-214x300.webp 214w" sizes="(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px" /></div>

<h3>Galentine&#8217;s Day</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re not focused on <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/valentines-day-marketing/">Valentine&#8217;s Day marketing</a> here, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re not going to have some fun with one of the best events in February: Galentine&#8217;s Day.</p>
<p>Galentine&#8217;s Day was first discussed on the sitcom Parks and Rec. In the show, Leslie Knope explains that &#8220;February 13th, Galentine&#8217;s Day, is about celebrating lady friends.&#8221; The cast of characters enjoy the day with gifts and brunch. But you can get as creative as you like. Here are a few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a Galentine&#8217;s gift guide filled with fun little gifts friends can bring to hand out at the celebration.</li>
<li>Partner with a few brands and giveaway a Galentine&#8217;s gift box (and get lots of cross-promotion).</li>
<li>Offer a Galentine&#8217;s discount, and promote it across all of your channels.</li>
<li>Publish a guide to celebrating Galentine&#8217;s Day with party ideas, fun activities, and more.</li>
<li>For physical locations, hold a Galentine&#8217;s Day get-together with decorations, beverages, and one-day-only deals and services.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Love Your Pet Day</h3>
<p>Love Your Pet Day is February’s opportunity for you to shamelessly post about your pet. But here are some additional ideas to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a blog post about what your pet can teach you about [topic relevant to your industry].</li>
<li>Have your employees share photos of their pets and put the montage on social media or in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-marketing-trends-2025?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=organic_social&amp;utm_campaign=blog?utm_source=Threads&amp;utm_medium=organic_social&amp;utm_campaign=blog&amp;utm_term=post" target="_blank" rel="noopener">February newslette</a>r.</li>
<li>Come up with a pet-themed incentive. For example, Select Hotels invited its followers to comment on its post with their favorite moments with their pets, and that if they did, “A surprise awaits the two of you on your next visit.”</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/february20marketing20ideas20love20your20pet20day20giveaway.png" alt="february marketing ideas love your pet day giveaway" width="647" height="414" /></div>
<h3>Make a Friend Day</h3>
<p>This day gives you lots of opportunities for creative marketing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Send out a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">review request</a> email themed around asking your customers to be your friend. (Use these <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/february-email-subject-lines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">February email subjet lines</a> for inspiration!)</li>
<li>Partner with a neighboring or complementary business and run a joint friends promotion.</li>
<li>Remind people of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/14/referral-program-ideas">referral program</a> or run a one-day special where referrals result in a discount or gift.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Groundhog Day Contest</h3>
<p>This superstitious day happens on February 2 every year. For the uninitiated, if the groundhog sees its shadow, winter will last six more weeks. If it does not see its shadow, spring will arrive early. Plenty of fun marketing material to work with here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Run a sale where the offer is contingent upon the outcome of the day.</li>
<li>Create content inspired by the Groundhog Day movie, sharing tips to break up the monotony or avoid repeating mistakes.</li>
<li>On Groundhog Day, you can run a contest, share a question or poll with your audience, or simply share a fun fact about the day.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Super Bowl</h3>
<p>The Super Bowl is one of the most watched programs on television. How does your target audience relate to football? Are they football fans? Spouses or parents of football fans? Athletes? Is your business located near a Superbowl venue? Run a special during Superbowl weekend, create Superbowl-themed products, or share a helpful tip relevant to what their Superbowl experience will be like.</p>

<h2>February hashtag marketing ideas</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">Hashtags</a> can expand your reach and add some personality to your posts. Here are some basic February hashtags to play around with.</p>
<h3>#Febsale</h3>
<p>If you’re just getting started with your Instagram marketing, start basic with something as simple as a #Febsale. In the below example, the small business Mexicali took a snapshot of their ready-to-ship orders to promote their February sale and encourage people to buy.</p>
<p>They didn’t use a photo shoot or fancy Photoshop graphics; just a simple behind-the-scenes sneak peek and a caption that closes with a question.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/february20marketing20ideas20febsale.png" alt="february marketing ideas febsale" width="733" height="468" /></div>
<h3>#FebruaryFeels for mood</h3>
<p>You don’t need to have a sale for a February-friendly Instagram post. How about just appealing to your audience’s mood during this time of year?</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/february20marketing20ideas20febuary20feels.png" alt="february marketing ideas febuary feels" width="745" height="476" /></div>
<p>Just make sure you’re appealing to the mood of your specific audience in February as it relates to your business. Is your audience&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Filing tax forms?</li>
<li>Returning back to school after break?</li>
<li>Reading love stories and seeking positive vibes?</li>
<li>Totally embracing singledom?</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/monthly-email-newsletter-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>
<h3>#FebruaryFeels for a testimonial</h3>
<p>Look back through your photos or even <a href="/blog/ws/2014/04/28/user-generated-content">user-generated content</a>. Can you repurpose any of them for a #FebruaryFeels-inspired <a href="/blog/ws/2015/05/05/customer-testimonials">testimonial</a>, as the Australian Girls Choir does below?</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/february20marketing20ideas20febuary20feels20testimonial.png" alt="february marketing ideas febuary feels testimonial" width="745" height="355" /></div>
<h3>#FebruaryFavorites to promote other content</h3>
<p>This is a good way to surface seasonal content or products or even to bring to light some of the forgotten ones. Share a roundup of your most popular products or services, or even your favorite tips, <a href="/blog/ws/2018/07/06/digital-marketing-tools">tools</a>, products, or resources related to your audience’s goals and needs.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/february20marketing20ideas20febuary20favorites20content_0.png" alt="february marketing ideas february favorites content" width="800" height="373" /></div>
<h3>#FebruaryFeature to promote products</h3>
<p>Whether the <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">product you&#8217;re promoting</a> is February-themed or not, you can make it so by <a href="/blog/ws/2015/07/02/twitter-hashtags">using the hashtag</a> #Februaryfeature. Pick something you’d like to promote in February and see if #Februaryfeature can help<a href="/blog/ws/2018/04/02/retail-marketing"> increase sales</a> and engagement related to it.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/february20marketing20ideas20february20feature.png" alt="february marketing ideas february feature" width="800" height="419" /></div>
<h3>#FebruaryFeature to feature an employee</h3>
<p>You could also feature an employee, student, or customer. These types of feature posts can get your employees, customers, and fans excited about your business. Plus, they’ll want to share their “celebrity” post with their network, which can help increase your reach.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/february20marketing20ideas20february20feature20employee.png" alt="february marketing ideas february feature employee" width="600" height="424" /></div>
<h3>#Februarychallenge</h3>
<p>Many people are coming down off their New Year&#8217;s resolutions (or maybe they purposefully avoided making them). That makes this hashtag a great option for February. Use it to encourage your audience to take on a new task or reach a goal they&#8217;ve been eyeing. Or, just have a little fun with it!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/february-marketing-ideas-february-challenge.webp" alt="February marketing ideas - Instagram post using february challenge hashtag." width="348" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-88276 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/february-marketing-ideas-february-challenge.webp 348w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/february-marketing-ideas-february-challenge-174x300.webp 174w" sizes="(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px" /></p>
<h3>#FreshStartFebruary</h3>
<p>Another theme you can take advantage of in your February Instagram marketing is #FreshStartFebruary. This is especially applicable for businesses in the health and wellness industry.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/february20marketing20ideas20fresh20start20february1.png" alt="february marketing ideas fresh start february1" width="600" height="325" /></div>
<div></div>
<p>As you can see, there is much more to February than Valentine&#8217;s Day (but we have plenty of <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/valentines-day-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valentine&#8217;s Day marketing ideas here</a>). Use the ideas (and these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/winter-puns">winter puns</a>) above for creative and quality engagement with your audience—the best way to market your business.
