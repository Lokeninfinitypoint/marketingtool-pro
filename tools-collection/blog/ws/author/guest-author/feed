										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Running PPC ads can burn through your SaaS marketing budget quickly—if you’re not using the right strategies and tactics.</p>
<p>Many SaaS marketers overlook the tactics that can make the biggest impact on their campaigns. In this article, I’m going to share the six tactics I use to drive results for SaaS clients at Aimers so you can try them yourself to get the cutting edge and outperform the competition.</p>

<h2>6 PPC tactics for SaaS marketers to try now</h2>
<p>Let’s dive into each of these tactics so you can start optimizing your SaaS PPC campaigns.</p>
<div id="use-lead-scoring-to-prioritize-high-value-prospects"></div>
<h3>1. Use lead scoring to prioritize high-value prospects</h3>
<p>Not all leads are created equal. Prioritize prospects based on their <strong>likelihood to convert</strong> or their <strong>potential value</strong> to your business.</p>
<p>We all want to attract the biggest clients possible, so why not immediately pass data about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/lead-quality">lead quality</a> to your advertising platforms? Additionally, at some point, you can try optimizing exclusively for top-tier leads. With sufficient data volume, the algorithms will start identifying the most relevant users for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scoring metrics</strong>: Develop a scoring system based on user behavior (e.g., the information provided when submitting a form on your website, such as the company size, the job title, etc.).<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lead-scoring-wordstream-lead-scoring-model.webp" alt="Lead scoring - lead scoring model matrix" width="910" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79507" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lead-scoring-wordstream-lead-scoring-model.webp 910w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lead-scoring-wordstream-lead-scoring-model-480x316.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 910px, 100vw" /></li>
<li><strong>Sales alignment</strong>: Work closely with the sales team to understand which scores correlate with high-quality leads, and adjust your scoring criteria based on their feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic retargeting</strong>: Use lead scores to adjust your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/08/lead-quality">PPC strategies</a>, directing more resources on high-scoring leads.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your lead flow is limited, avoid excessive segmentation of leads into multiple categories. Over-segmentation can complicate data analysis and hinder the optimization of your campaigns.</p>
<p>To ensure the effective performance of advertising algorithms, it’s important to meet the recommended conversion thresholds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meta</strong> requires at least 200 conversions per month per ad set.</li>
<li><strong>Google and Microsoft </strong>need a minimum of 30 conversions per month per campaign.</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn </strong>advises at least 60 conversions per month per campaign.</li>
</ul>

<div id="avoid-overreliance-on-a-single-platform"></div>
<h3>2. Avoid overreliance on a single platform</h3>
<p>One of the common pitfalls I see with our clients is that they use several platforms but don’t regularly <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/marketing-performance-metrics">evaluate the effectiveness of each channel</a>. For example, they continue to keep a 50/50 budget allocation between two networks, while a 70/30 split could dramatically boost their results.</p>
<p>Another case is when companies “get stuck” on one or two platforms without exploring new ones. If you’re not testing new channels, you could lose out on potential opportunities and leads. It’s all about staying agile and data-driven.</p>
<p>It’s important to constantly analyze your channel performance. Here are some of my recommendations to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your sales cycle is short, <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10089681?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics 4</a> may be enough.</li>
<li>For longer and more complex sales cycles with multiple stakeholders and sales calls, <a href="https://localiq.com/products/ai-lead-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a good CRM</a> is essential.</li>
<li>For businesses with a lot of traffic channels, consider investing in third-party tools with advanced attribution tracking.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/lead-management-localiq-dash-dashboard.webp" alt="view of lead management in dash by localiq platform" width="946" height="782" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90343" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/lead-management-localiq-dash-dashboard.webp 946w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/lead-management-localiq-dash-dashboard-480x397.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 946px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://localiq.com/products/ai-lead-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dash by LocaliQ</a> is an AI-powered lead management platform that allows you to track and follow-up with leads.</em></p>
<p>By consistently using data to evaluate your channels and redistributing your budget, you will see tangible results. In my experience, you can expect around a 20% boost in just a few months!</p>
<div id="deploy-display-remarketing-and-rlsa-campaigns-strategically"></div>
<h3>3. Deploy display remarketing and RLSA campaigns strategically</h3>
<p>For SaaS, decision-making cycles are usually long. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-audit-pmax-display-video">Display remarketing</a> and RLSA (Remarketing Lists for Search Ads) can give you a competitive edge by targeting warm leads when they’re ready to act:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Segmentation and personalization:</strong> Tailor your ads based on the user’s previous interaction with your website. For instance, display different messages to users who abandoned the trial period and those who just viewed a pricing page.</li>
<li><strong>Bid adjustments:</strong> Increase or decrease your bids for returning visitors based on their likelihood to convert, optimizing your ad spend for the best possible ROI.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s an extra tip from me: The audience in the SaaS niche is often quite narrow, and the number of website visitors is significantly smaller compared to the B2C segment. So when you’re launching <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/06/08/rlsa">RLSA</a>, I recommend <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">expanding your keyword list</a> to include more generic search terms and using <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/06/broad-match-smart-bidding">broad match</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/keyword-match-types-broad-match-png.webp" alt="keyword match types chart with arrow pointing to broad match" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90367" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/keyword-match-types-broad-match-png.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/keyword-match-types-broad-match-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="use-offline-conversion-tracking"></div>
<h3>4. Use offline conversion tracking</h3>
<p>Understand which campaigns drive real revenue by linking your CRM with the ad platforms. With this integration, you can assess lead quality, uncover weak points in your campaigns, and identify which ad groups, audiences, or keywords generate leads but fail to convert into opportunities.</p>
<p>The result? Smarter decisions, optimized ad spend, and a more effective PPC strategy.</p>
<p>To fully capitalize on this integration, focus on three key types of reports that transform raw data into actionable insights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/customize-google-ads-conversion-tracking">Conversion tracking reports</a>: </strong>These reports show the path from ad click to sale, helping you pinpoint which ads and campaigns generate revenue. Use this data to optimize spending on what works best.</li>
<li><strong>Customer segmentation reports: </strong>These reports segment your audience using CRM data like demographics, purchases, or behavior. Tailor campaigns to specific groups for better results.</li>
<li><strong>Customer lifetime value reports: </strong>These reports use CRM insights to let you estimate the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/10/cac-vs-clv">lifetime value of customers</a> acquired through PPC.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clients often ask me why exporting customer lists from their CRM doesn’t yield the desired results in ad campaigns. The issue doesn’t lie in incorrect settings or integration errors, but in the specifics of the B2B sector.</p>
<p>In B2B, most leads provide business emails (e.g., @company.com), which are rarely used to register personal accounts on platforms like Meta or Google.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/demio-form-example.webp" alt="lead form example from demio" width="572" height="692" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90366" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/demio-form-example.webp 572w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/demio-form-example-480x581.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 572px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Example of a typical B2B SaaS lead form at </em><a href="http://demio.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>demio.com</em></a></p>
<p>Since these platforms rely on personal accounts to match customer lists, business emails often fail to find corresponding users. As a result, the potential audience for ad delivery is significantly smaller—or even nonexistent.</p>
<p>Instead of just relying on customer lists, use other data sources like pixels or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/conversion-value-rules">conversion events</a> to track user actions on your website. This allows you to <strong>build audiences based on behavior</strong> rather than email addresses.</p>
<div id="conduct-regular-ppc-audits"></div>
<h3>5. Conduct regular PPC audits for constant optimization</h3>
<p>Even the most successful PPC campaigns require ongoing optimization. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-audit">Regular audits</a> help identify areas for improvement and ensure your campaigns align with your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-plan-goals-objectives-for-small-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business goals</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comprehensive reviews:</strong> Regularly assess all aspects of your campaigns, including keyword selection, ad copy, audience targeting, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-smart-bidding">bidding strategies</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Growth opportunities:</strong> Use audits to spot chances for implementing new ad formats or tactics to boost performance.</li>
<li><strong>Actionable insights:</strong> Turn audit findings into a clear plan of action, prioritizing changes that will have the biggest impact.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not sure where to start your audit, you can use a free<a href="https://aimers.io/tools/google-ads-optimization-checklist/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Google Ads Optimization Checklist</a> for SaaS that my team has developed. You can also run <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">WordStream’s Free Google Ads Grader</a> to get an instant audit of your account.</p>

<div id="optimize-your-landing-pages-for-conversions"></div>
<h3>6. Optimize your landing pages for conversions</h3>
<p>Your ad strategy might be brilliant. But if your landing page does not convert, you won’t see good results. A user’s journey doesn’t end at clicking the ad—it’s only successful when it ends in a conversion.</p>
<p>If you want outstanding <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/spring-content-ideas">Google Ads</a> results, focus on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/15/landing-page-best-practices">optimizing your landing pages for conversions</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Page speed optimization:</strong> Use tools like Google’s <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/">PageSpeed Insights</a> to ensure your landing pages load quickly. Even a second&#8217;s delay can significantly reduce conversions.</li>
<li><strong>A/B testing:</strong> Systematically test variations of your landing page elements (like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/20/call-to-action-buttons">CTA buttons</a>, images, and headlines) to determine what resonates best with your audience.</li>
<li><strong>User experience</strong>: Enhance the user journey by focusing on intuitive design and clear navigation paths that guide visitors towards conversion actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>We used these best practices to <a href="https://aimers.io/cases/optimizing-landing-pages-for-originality-ai/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimize one landing page</a> and were able to get a 148% increase in conversion rate!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/aimers-landing-page-optimization-example-png.webp" alt="example of before and after a landing page optimization done by aimers to increase cro" width="936" height="543" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90364" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/aimers-landing-page-optimization-example-png.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/aimers-landing-page-optimization-example-480x278.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul></ul>
<p>Thoughtful design and data-driven landing page optimization will drive measurable outcomes for your PPC, so don’t overlook this aspect.</p>

<h2>5 agency metrics that will boost your profitability</h2>
<p>There are dozens of ways to measure a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-a-marketing-agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing agency’s</a> operational and financial efficiency. The five agency metrics listed here are best at surfacing the biggest bottlenecks and leak points.</p>
<div id="Utilization-rate"></div>
<h3>1. Utilization rate</h3>
<p>If you have an internal team that delivers work to clients, utilization rate will be the first and most foundational metric to start paying attention to in terms of profitability.</p>
<h4>What is utilization rate?</h4>
<p>Employees who interface with clients can split their working hours into billable and non-billable hours. Billable hours are those spent on client projects or directly working with clients, while non-billable hours are those spent not directly on the client, such as with internal projects and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/07/marketing-meetings"> meetings</a>.</p>
<p>Utilization is defined as the percent of your employees’ billable total time. To increase your agency’s profitability, you need to make sure your team has enough work to do for clients to keep a threshold of billable hours.</p>
<h4>Why is utilization rate important?</h4>
<p>Understanding your utilization rate helps you avoid situations where you’re paying a salary to the team but not earning any revenue in return. If the team isn’t busy, optimizing for profitability is not much point because the time recouped from increased efficiency can’t be transferred to other revenue-earning opportunities.</p>
<p>Suppose you primarily lean on contractors or outsourced partners to do work for clients. In that case, you may not need to worry about utilization as much since you’re not paying those contractors when the agency isn’t busy. Your contribution or gross margins may be lower, but if you haven’t figured out how to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/01/16/get-more-clients"> predictably acquire clients</a>, keeping your workforce more elastic might be a good idea until you’ve<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/07/marketing-funnel"> sorted out your funnel</a> and acquisition channels.</p>
<h4>How do you calculate utilization rate?</h4>
<p>Use the following formula to calculate utilization rate:</p>
<p><em>Gross capacity / Billable hours = Utilization rate</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-utilization-rate.webp" alt="Agency metrics - graphic of utilization rate calculation" width="936" height="339" class="aligncenter wp-image-83182 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-utilization-rate.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-utilization-rate-480x174.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gross capacity:</strong> The total number of available billable hours (most employees are 40 hours per week for 52 hours per year less time off, or 2080 hours maximum).</li>
<li><strong>Billable hours:</strong> The amount of time spent doing work for clients (regardless of whether you’re billing hourly or not).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Utilization benchmarks</h4>
<p>On a week-to-week basis, you generally want your “pure” producers (designers, developers,<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/16/free-copywriting-resources"> copywriters</a>, etc.) to be utilized between 75% and 90%.</p>
<p>On an annual basis, you should aim to have your production team hit a utilization rate of between 65% and 80%.</p>
<p>With utilization above 65%, you should achieve healthy margins as a business, so long as you’re earning your revenue efficiently (more on that next).</p>

<div id="Gross-margin"></div>
<h3>2. Gross margin</h3>
<p>There are two primary ways digital marketing agencies track how efficiently they earn revenue: gross margin and average billable rate. I’ll break down the pros and cons of each to help you determine which metric is best for measuring and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/15/ppc-agency-pricing/"> improving your agency’s profitability</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s start with gross margin as the first of two metrics you can use to help track your revenue-earning efficiency.</p>
<h4>What is gross margin?</h4>
<p>Gross margin is a tried-and-true method for determining production profitability. Simply put, it means calculating the profit margin on a per-client or per-project basis by subtracting time and material costs from whatever the client has paid you.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-gross-margin-model.webp" alt="Agency metrics - graphic of grow margin factors" width="849" height="419" class="aligncenter wp-image-83187 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-gross-margin-model.webp 849w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-gross-margin-model-480x237.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 849px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This method is generally more accurate but can be more expensive and<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/16/spend-less-time-in-google-ads"> time-consuming</a> to calculate since it usually happens in an accounting tool. And without an aggressive bookkeeping schedule, this may be something you can only ever look at retroactively.</p>
<h4>Who should use gross margin?</h4>
<p>I recommend the gross margin metric to mature agencies with a bookkeeper who updates biweekly or weekly and agencies that work with many contractors.</p>
<h4>Why is gross margin important?</h4>
<p>Being able to hit gross margins in this range consistently means your delivery systems are efficient enough to scale profitably, allowing you to cash-flow<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/16/grow-your-digital-marketing-agency"> your agency’s growth</a>.</p>
<h4>How do you calculate gross margin?</h4>
<p>Use the following formula to calculate gross margin:</p>
<p><em>Adjusted gross income – (COGS/Labor costs) = Gross margin</em></p>
<p><em>Gross margin / Adjusted gross income = Gross margin %</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-gross-margin.webp" alt="Agency metrics - graphic of gross margin calculation" width="936" height="342" class="aligncenter wp-image-83183 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-gross-margin.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-gross-margin-480x175.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adjusted gross income (AGI):</strong> The amount of revenue left over for the agency to earn after pass-through expenses are paid (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/21/ad-spend-pacing">ad spend</a>, print budgets, equipment rentals, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>COGS and labor costs:</strong> The costs associated with the people you’ve brought on to work on this project, be they internal team members or external contractors.</li>
</ul>
<p>To calculate your<a href="https://parakeeto.com/blog/how-to-accurately-calculate-your-agencys-billable-employee-cost-per-hour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> employee cost per hour</a> for internal team members, you’ll need to take their salary + benefits and divide it by their gross capacity. For most employees, this comes to 2080 hours per year (40 hours x 52 weeks).</p>
<h4>Gross margin benchmarks</h4>
<p>To run a highly profitable, scalable agency, you’ll want to aim for a 50-70% gross margin per client or per project.</p>
<p>That should set you up to hit a margin of 40-60% agency-wide at the end of the year, leaving you enough room to carry normal overhead levels and accommodate<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing/marketing-during-slow-economy-recession/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> slow times</a> without compromising net profitability.</p>
<p>One way to increase efficiency and improve gross margin is using<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency"> AI marketing tools for agencies</a>.</p>
<div id="Average-billable-rate"></div>
<h3>3. Average billable rate (ABR)</h3>
<p>Average billable rate is often a much simpler, more accessible way to get an idea of your revenue-earning efficiency and benchmark different clients or projects against each other.</p>
<h4>What is ABR?</h4>
<p>ABR helps us understand the average rate we’re earning per hour based on the amount of time it actually takes us to earn our revenue. This method is generally a bit less accurate, but it is much faster and easier to calculate and doesn’t require a bookkeeper or accountant to figure out.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-ABR-model.webp" alt="Agency metrics - Graphic of ABR model." width="787" height="274" class="aligncenter wp-image-83188 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-ABR-model.webp 787w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-ABR-model-480x167.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 787px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Who should use ABR?</h4>
<p>I generally recommend using the ABR metric method for<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/02/manage-social-media-accounts"> smaller agencies</a> that may just be getting started with tracking metrics and for agencies that tend to work with fewer contractors and keep most of their labor in-house.</p>
<h4>Why is ABR important?</h4>
<p>For the same reasons mentioned about gross margin, if you hit ABR <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/smart-goals-examples">goals</a>, you can grow profitably. ABR is a gut check for both the profitability of a client and the efficiency with which you can deliver the service.</p>
<h4>How do you calculate ABR?</h4>
<p>You can use the following formula to calculate average billable rate:</p>
<p><em>Adjusted gross income / Hours worked = ABR</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-ABR.webp" alt="Agency metrics - graphic of ABR calculation" width="936" height="343" class="aligncenter wp-image-83184 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-ABR.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-ABR-480x176.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adjusted gross income (AGI):</strong> The amount of revenue left over for the agency to earn after pass-through expenses are paid (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/21/ad-spend-pacing">ad spend</a>, print budgets, equipment rentals, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hours worked</strong>: The total time your team spent completing the work for your client.</li>
</ul>
<h4>ABR benchmarks</h4>
<p>The target for the average billable rate is the same as the gross margin. When we look at our average cost per hour for production labor, we want to be in the 50-70% margin range.</p>
<p>Usually, that means aiming for around 2.5x your average employee cost per hour or whatever contractor rates you’re paying the team.</p>
<p>For example, if the cost per hour to pay someone to do the work for us is $50, we’d want to target an average billable rate of $125 (which is 2.5 x $50 and equates to a gross margin of 60%).</p>
<div id="Scoping-accuracy"></div>
<h3>4. Scoping accuracy</h3>
<p>The riskiest part of any service business is that many of its critical functions rely on assumptions made every day when scoping work.</p>
<h4>What is scoping accuracy?</h4>
<p>The information we use to determine<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/15/ppc-agency-pricing"> how much to charge for work</a>, when to hire employees, how to resource a plan, and how to assign team members all comes down to what we believe is required to complete the deliverables we’ve promised our clients—aka the scope of the work.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-scoping-accuracy-model.webp" alt="Agency metrics - bar graph of a project scope." width="873" height="423" class="aligncenter wp-image-83192 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-scoping-accuracy-model.webp 873w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-scoping-accuracy-model-480x233.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 873px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Why is scoping accuracy important?</h4>
<p>Without feedback about how accurate those assumptions are, building out the systems required to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/28/resilient-digital-agencies-2020"> scale our agency</a> and our team’s profitably is difficult. That’s why installing a feedback loop is essential to help us understand whether the assumptions behind our pricing are accurate.</p>
<h4>How do you calculate scoping accuracy?</h4>
<p>Scoping accuracy can be easily calculated by the following formula:</p>
<p><em>Estimated time and cost / Actual time &amp; cost = Scoping accuracy (%)</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-scoping-accuracy.webp" alt="Agency metrics - graphic of scoping accuracy calculation" width="936" height="346" class="aligncenter wp-image-83185 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-scoping-accuracy.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-scoping-accuracy-480x177.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Estimated time and cost:</strong> The amount of time or money we estimated it would take to complete the work.</li>
<li><strong>Actual time and cost:</strong> The amount of time or money we spend to complete the work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually, this will be divided into “buckets” like design, development, and project management. To learn more and avoid<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/03/07/common-agency-mistakes"> common agency mistakes</a> in this area, check out my guide on<a href="https://parakeeto.com/blog/how-to-track-time-with-marcel-petipas-episode-42/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> choosing the correct structure for your estimates and actuals</a>.</p>
<h4>Scoping accuracy benchmarks</h4>
<p>An acceptable margin of error is under 20% of the anticipated budget, with going over being more of a concern.</p>
<p>However, at scale, we should consistently aim to keep our margin of error under 10%. This should become achievable over time as we collect more data and install more processes to close the gaps between our assumptions and reality, thereby creating our own<a href="https://parakeeto.com/blog/the-agency-profitability-flywheel-marcel-petipas-episode-40/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> agency profitability flywheel.</a></p>
<div id="Overhead-percent"></div>
<h3>5. Overhead percent</h3>
<p>Once you’ve gotten a grip on utilization, earning efficiency, and scoping accuracy, you should already be head and shoulders above the competition.<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/28/resilient-digital-agencies-2020"> Your agency will feel more stable</a>, you won’t be worried about cash flow, and planning for growth won’t feel so obscure.</p>
<p>The last piece of the puzzle for really dialing in your agency’s profitability is paying attention to your overhead spending—making sure it’s balanced relative to your income.</p>
<h4>What is overhead percent?</h4>
<p>Overhead costs are expenses that support your agency but are not directly tied to creating a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product"> specific product or service</a>. They are the ongoing and necessary expenses of running your business that do not generate revenue. The three main overhead spending categories we’ll discuss in this post are administrative, facilities, and sales &amp; marketing.</p>
<p>Overhead percent is the amount you’ve spent on overhead expenses as a percentage of your adjusted gross income.</p>
<h4>Why is overhead percent important?</h4>
<p>Landing in the acceptable ranges for each area should allow you to meet your agency’s needs relative to its size while maintaining healthy profit margins.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that through periods of<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/06/02/growth-hacking"> aggressive growth</a>, you may find yourself spending out ahead of scale. For example, you may sign a lease on an office much larger than what is necessary for your current team, anticipating having to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/02/27/how-to-scale-an-agency"> make a lot of hires</a> in the coming months.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with this, so long as you’re making these investments consciously and with a plan to level your expenses back into a healthy relative range eventually.</p>
<h4>How do you calculate overhead percent?</h4>
<p>The percentages of overhead spending for each of the different areas below may shift depending on your accountant’s guidance on where to place expenditures that fall into “grey areas.”</p>
<p>Use the following formula to calculate overhead percent:</p>
<p><em>Overhead spending / Adjusted gross income = Overhead %</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-overhead-percent.webp" alt="Agency metrics - graphic of overhead percent calculation" width="936" height="350" class="aligncenter wp-image-83186 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-overhead-percent.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agency-metrics-wordstream-equation-overhead-percent-480x179.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overhead spend: </strong>Any expense related to admin, facilities, or sales and marketing (further defined below).</li>
<li><strong>Adjusted gross income (AGI):</strong> The amount of<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/21/revenue-operations"> revenue</a> left over for the agency to earn after any pass-through expenses are paid (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/16/return-on-ad-spend-roas">ad spend</a>, print budgets, equipment rentals, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Overhead percent benchmarks</h4>
<p>The general rule of thumb is that total overhead spending should be about 20-30% of your adjusted gross income (AGI). Within overhead, there are three primary categories to pay attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Administrative expenses:</strong> Administrative expenses include accounting, legal fees, a receptionist, part or all of the director’s or owner’s salary, and more. The target for administrative expenses should be <strong>8-12%.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Facilities expenses:</strong> These include any costs related to providing the team with a proper working environment, such as a building (rent), parking, and utilities. The target for facilities expenses should be <strong>4-6%</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Sales and Marketing expenses:</strong> Sales and marketing expenses include costs related to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/26/prospecting-strategies-ppc-agencies"> bringing in new business</a>, like marketing spend, sales software, and the sales and marketing team’s salary. The target for sales and marketing expenses should be <strong>8-14%</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>These agency metrics will have a big impact on your profitability</h2>
<p>If there’s one thing I’d urge you to take away from this post, it’s that it doesn’t take much to start measuring the simple numbers that will make a big impact on your profitability. What I’ve learned from working with hundreds of agencies over the last few years is that most of them don’t do this stuff well (if at all)—so even <a href="https://www.link-assistant.com/news/top-search-engines.html">reviewing</a> just part of it can help you set your agency apart from your competitors, and position you to outlast or outgrow them in the long term.</p>
<p>The peace of mind that comes with having good cash flow, efficient systems, simple yet clear-cut numbers, and visibility into your progress can make running your agency much easier and more enjoyable for you and your team.

<h2>What is neuromarketing?</h2>
<p>Neuromarketing merges neuroscience, psychology, cognitive science, and marketing to understand and influence consumer behavior. It uncovers subconscious and emotional factors impacting choices.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/what-is-neuromarketing.webp" alt="graphic showing what makes up neuromarketing" width="936" height="502" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81932" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/what-is-neuromarketing.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/what-is-neuromarketing-480x257.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Specialists use neuromarketing techniques to study the human brain and predict decision-making behavior. Let&#8217;s explore why you should implement neuromarketing techniques in your copywriting.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f9e0.png" alt="🧠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Speaking of neuromarketing… <strong>Get our free guide &gt;&gt; </strong><a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite26BrilliantWaysToUsePsychology.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_TextLink_guide_26waysPsychGuide_Download">26 Brilliant Ways to Use Psychology in Your Copywriting (with Examples)</a></p>
<div id="why-use-neuromarketing"></div>
<h2>Why use neuromarketing?</h2>
<p>Why apply neuromarketing techniques to your copywriting and other marketing activities? Here are some benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Better understanding of consumer behavior:</strong> Neuromarketing unveils emotions, attention, and memory triggers in consumer behavior, thus enabling the creation of impactful marketing messages.</li>
<li><strong>More effective ways to optimize website design:</strong> By studying eye-tracking data and user behavior, you can optimize design elements to encourage desired actions.</li>
<li><strong>Improved personalization and targeting:</strong> Uncover individual preferences and emotional triggers to tailor messages and offers for specific consumer segments.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced content creation:</strong> Understanding how the brain processes information helps you craft compelling stories that evoke emotions and drive engagement.</li>
</ol>
<p>Numbers speak volumes. According to the stats, neurological engagement can increase advertising effectiveness by up to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050920322389" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19%</a>. We also know that <a href="https://ethiqueadvisory.com/blogs/unleash-the-power-of-storytelling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">63%</a> of users remember brands that tell stories, and <a href="https://financesonline.com/customer-reviews-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">74%</a> of consumers trust businesses more after reading positive reviews.</p>
<div id="what-are-neuromarketing-examples"></div>
<h2>Neuromarketing examples in copywriting</h2>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to be a scientist. By analyzing research insights, you can identify neurological responses, emotional triggers, and attention patterns influencing your target most. Apply them to tailor your overall marketing strategy and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/performance-marketing">drive purchasing decisions</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of neuromarketing in action.</p>
<h3>1. Two odd numbers in headings</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/features/is-your-brain-wired-for-numbers-69194" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brain loves numbers</a>. They make content more digestible and provide order to chaos.</p>
<p>Why two numbers? To double the effect: The first one grabs attention, and the second one explains why read the content.</p>
<p>Why odd numbers? It&#8217;s about <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/odd-vs-even-number-psychology-6307047bf5de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">psychology</a> again: Even numbers look friendlier, while odd ones are more thought-provoking. It doesn&#8217;t mean you should use only the odd numbers. Consider the effect (emotion) you want to evoke with your content.</p>

<h3>2. Questions in subheads</h3>

<h3>3. The Socratic method in introductions</h3>
<p>Post three questions or statements in a row to engage users in communication.</p>
<p>Why three?</p>
<p>The human brain <a href="https://www.psychotactics.com/harness-the-psychological-power-of-3-to-improve-communication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grasps three the best</a>, so the sequence of three makes it easier to remember the information. Writers <em>do</em> love the <a href="https://copyblogger.com/rule-of-three/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rule of Three</a>: It builds the rhythm and keeps readers glued to your message.</p>

<h3>4. Power words and active verbs in content</h3>
<p>Power words are persuasive and descriptive. They trigger an emotional response, make readers experience different states, and push them in particular directions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/22/power-words">Power words</a> are adjectives indicating and explaining your statements. Like these:</p>

<h3>5. Sensory language when appropriate</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/sensory-words/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sensory words</a> are lexical items appealing to the human physical senses. When reading the content with such words, users &#8220;see,&#8221; &#8220;hear,&#8221; &#8220;touch,&#8221; &#8220;smell,&#8221; or &#8220;taste&#8221; it.</p>
<p>Sensory words are powerful because they paint scenes in readers&#8217; imagination. They activate the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0093934X12000028" target="_blank" rel="noopener">somatosensory cortex</a>, making us recognize these words faster.

<h2>20 neuromarketing techniques to encourage desired actions</h2>
<p>With the above emotional triggers in mind, include the following neuromarketing principles in your copywriting to make it work.</p>
<h3>1. Authority</h3>
<p>Position your brand as an industry expert through research findings, data, and credible collaborations.</p>
<p>Why do you think <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/26/influencer-marketing">influencer marketing</a> works? Users subconsciously believe famous people can&#8217;t go wrong because they choose the top products/services for themselves.</p>
<p>But: Authority isn&#8217;t only about top celebs with millions of subscribers on social media. Think of micro- or nano-influencers: They have the most loyal audience. Collaborate with experts in your niche: CEOs, top managers, or specialists who know what they talk about.</p>
<h3>2. Common enemy</h3>
<p>Struggling with a common enemy unites people. It&#8217;s not only about physical enemies but pains, complexes, or bad habits, as well. Concepts like hunger, poverty, diseases, or climate change are also here.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s your brand&#8217;s mission? Is it socially responsible?</p>
<p>Users are loyal to businesses that align with their identities and share the same values. Prescribe this element and incorporate corresponding meanings into your content strategy.</p>
<p>Create a positive ethos for your brand: Why does it matter? Why should people listen to your message?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-common-enemy.webp" alt="neuromarketing technique of common enemy in copywriting" width="936" height="403" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81940" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-common-enemy.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-common-enemy-480x207.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.deathwishcoffee.com/pages/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>3. Consistency and commitment</h3>
<p>Encourage commitment through regular communication, loyalty programs, and subscription services.</p>
<p>The more you interact with a customer, the more they trust your product, service, team, or individual specialist. The challenge is to establish a productive interaction and get a response.</p>
<p>You can initiate a dialog in messengers, newsletter emails, or online chat. Tests, quizzes, and other interactive content also work.</p>
<h3>4. Cross-marketing</h3>
<p>This trigger is about the intersection of several target audience segments. Organize your content so website visitors see your minor products with major ones.</p>
<p>In ecommerce, we know this trick as &#8220;You may also like&#8221; or &#8220;Buy together:&#8221; When examining a product description, a customer sees related items they might also want to buy.</p>
<p>Informative or educational websites address the same principle with content elements like &#8220;Related articles,&#8221; &#8220;Extra read,&#8221; &#8220;Editor&#8217;s Pick,&#8221; etc.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-crossmarketing.webp" alt="neuromarketing copywriting technique of cross-marketing" width="892" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81941" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-crossmarketing.webp 892w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-crossmarketing-480x322.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 892px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://cxl.com/blog/seo-vs-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>5. Framing</h3>
<p>Different framing techniques impact perception:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comparative framing:</strong> Highlight superiority over competitors.</li>
<li><strong>Loss aversion framing:</strong> Use phrases like &#8220;limited time offer.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Goal framing:</strong> Present your product as a solution to specific goals.</li>
<li><strong>Attribute framing:</strong> Highlight appealing features.</li>
<li><strong>Time framing:</strong> Encourage immediate action by prescribing deadlines (&#8220;today only,&#8221; &#8220;first three subscribers will get…,&#8221; &#8220;two hours left,&#8221; etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Flattery</h3>
<p>Incorporate genuine praise or appreciation to build rapport. Personalized emails and positive feedback boost customer loyalty.</p>
<p>Incorporate genuine praise or appreciation to build rapport. Personalized emails and positive feedback boost customer loyalty.</p>
<p>You can personalize a customer by name, profession, age, social status, or hobbies. It is realistic to find a suitable appeal for every niche and customer segment.</p>
<p>When a subscriber, prospective client, or webpage visitor sees a familiar hook, they subconsciously realize you&#8217;re talking to them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-flattery.webp" alt="neuromarketing technique using flattery in copywriting" width="817" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81942" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-flattery.webp 817w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-flattery-480x351.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 817px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.classcreator.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Their response to a personalized greeting will be faster and warmer than to generic wording.</p>
<h3>7. Greed</h3>
<p>Appealing to one of the core human weaknesses helps boost engagement and raise sales. Promotions, discounts, and contests encourage prospective customers to open their wallets.</p>
<p>Greed pushes subscribers to invite friends to groups, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-time-to-post-on-social-media">repost social media content</a>, and share links. Spontaneous purchases are also here.</p>
<p>Palmary examples of using this neuromarketing principle: Black Friday and Cyber Monday campaigns most brands organize.</p>
<h3>8. Herd behavior</h3>
<p>Every person is a unique individual, and no one wants to recognize themselves as part of a so-called &#8220;herd,&#8221; but:</p>
<p>Social instinct is among the top three basic ones, so we can&#8217;t resist appreciation and a sense of belonging to some group. Most websites appeal to this instinct with messages like:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&#8220;100,000+ downloads already&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;Rating: 4.5/5 stars&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;With over 300k subscribers and 4 million readers, we are&#8230;&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>When a user sees such messages, they subconsciously approve your offer. After all, so many people can&#8217;t be wrong, huh? So, everything is okay with the product/service you have for them.</p>
<h3>9. Intrigue</h3>
<p>This one is like cliffhangers in a movie series, cutting off episodes at the most intriguing moment to motivate the audience to come back and watch the next one.</p>
<p>A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>In next week&#8217;s video, I will tell how I&#8217;ve my first 100 thousand subscribers.</em></li>
<li><em>I&#8217;ve become popular by a happy accident, but I will talk about it a little later.</em></li>
<li><em>I have to pause now; please wait for the second part in tomorrow&#8217;s release.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>10. Justification</h3>
<p>It is easier to push a site visitor to the desired action if you explain <em>the why&#8217;s</em> behind it. Reveal all the benefits of purchasing in this particular place and time.</p>
<p>Collect all available arguments and added values. Simplify messaging, designs, and instructions to minimize cognitive load.</p>
<h3>11. Instant benefit</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/sales-funnel-template/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales funnel</a> is a core marketing instrument, but sometimes it&#8217;s possible to get loyal clients once they land at your website. Think of a perk (a here-and-now benefit) to offer to visitors:</p>
<p>A free template, checklist, or ebook can become the lead magnet to hook a user to stay with you and become your client.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-instant-benefit.webp" alt="instant benefit neuromarketing example" width="936" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81943" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-instant-benefit.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-instant-benefit-480x241.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.creative-copywriter.net/the-insiders-guide-to-copyediting-and-proofreading-free-checklist" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>12. Novelty</h3>
<p>Appeal to the brain&#8217;s attraction to novelty by introducing innovative elements and collaborations.</p>
<p>Please note that the word &#8220;new&#8221; itself doesn&#8217;t work. The trigger will do the job if your offer is <em>truly </em>fresh, unusual, and unique. Think of it as your UVP (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/unique-selling-proposition">unique value proposition</a>).</p>
<p>What makes you different from competitors? What can you do for a customer that they don&#8217;t?</p>
<h3>13. Reciprocity</h3>
<p>The principle of reciprocity suggests that when you provide value to your audience, they are more likely to engage with your brand. Offer free resources, trials, discounts, or personalized recommendations.</p>
<p>The catch is you&#8217;ll ask something in return. For example, an email address to send informative newsletters with compelling content, encouraging to buy.</p>
<p>But remember: Reciprocity works when used right. It&#8217;s critical to know your limit, especially today when the audience is fed up with tons of &#8220;gifts&#8221; and offers they find in inboxes daily. Being too aggressive with marketing messages, you risk unsubscriptions and negative reactions.</p>
<p>Be honest and write about what you&#8217;ll send users once they share emails with you.</p>
<h3>14. Result</h3>
<p>The common example is content assets presenting &#8220;before&#8221; and &#8220;after&#8221; to users. Photos or videos demonstrating how your product works do the magic!</p>
<p>The trick is to present everything in as much detail as possible so that people can see the difference between the first and second versions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before&#8221; and &#8220;after&#8221; is not the only way to demonstrate results. Case studies do wonders in all niches, too. Working with the same principle, they are the format where you can show results with a text.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-results.webp" alt="neuromarketing technique example of showing results" width="936" height="460" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81944" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-results.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-results-480x236.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://smartblogger.com/products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>15. Scarcity</h3>
<p>Create urgency through limited availability tactics. Ethically use limited quantity, time-limited offers, and scarcity techniques to drive action.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about FOMO again: People don&#8217;t want to miss an offer that will be unavailable soon.</p>
<p><strong>Two options here: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s a super popular product/service of extra quality.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s originally for a narrow circle of &#8220;chosen ones.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>Scarcity works with any restrictions: color, features, time, date, quantity, cost, etc. When using this trigger, it&#8217;s critical to keep your word. If sales close tomorrow, that&#8217;s what should happen.</p>
<h3>16. Social proof</h3>
<p>Use testimonials, endorsements, ratings, and reviews to establish trust and credibility.</p>
<p>Testimonials remain the most popular social proof, but it&#8217;s critical to make it trustworthy. Today&#8217;s users aren&#8217;t as naive as some marketers continue to believe: They won&#8217;t trust comments from John Doe with stock photos in avatars.</p>
<p>Share reviews from real people: Make videos, provide active links to their social media profiles, use signed and stamped thank-you letters from partners, etc.</p>
<p>Another instrument to boost social proof for users is your contact information. Many websites hide it, placing nothing but a standard contact form instead.</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>It hurts <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/14/google-e-e-a-t">E-E-A-T</a> factors and kills user loyalty and trust. Your address, phone number, email, and active social media accounts are worth placing on the website.</p>
<p>Certificates, ratings, budges–all they confirm your expertise and emphasize your responsibility and integrity in customers&#8217; eyes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-social-proof.webp" alt="social proof neuromarketing example" width="936" height="407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81945" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-social-proof.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-social-proof-480x209.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>17. Specifics</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s still an issue for many websites. They continue generating vague content assets, bringing words but no value.</p>
<p>Compare:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&#8220;We sell the best windows in Chicago!&#8221; </em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;Our energy-saving windows keep 93.4% of heat in your apartment.&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, the example is a little hackneyed, but numbers and facts work better than sophisticated metaphors when it comes to converting traffic into leads.</p>
<p>Even if your niche is info products, customers want to know how long it will take to get results.</p>
<h3>18. Storytelling</h3>
<p>Harness storytelling&#8217;s power to evoke emotions, build connections, and make your brand memorable.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.go-globe.com/storytelling-statistics-trends-infographic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human brain operates with stories</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It retains 70% of information through them, while only 10% comes from data and facts.</li>
<li>It responds better to narratives as they activate brain areas responsible for experiences.</li>
<li>Combining data with a story increases info retention from 5-10% to 67%.</li>
</ul>
<p>The secret is that stories don&#8217;t impose anything but, at the same time, bring the right idea to readers. Your task is to build a story in a way readers would choose your business over the others.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-storytelling.webp" alt="storytelling neuromarketing example" width="570" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81946" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-storytelling.webp 570w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/neuromarketing-techniques-storytelling-480x505.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 570px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>19. Upsell</h3>
<p>This trigger serves a specific purpose: Make a customer buy more than they planned.</p>
<p>The oldy-moldy <em>&#8220;Buy two–and take the third one for free&#8221;</em> hook still works, grabbing even the savvy customers who understand the trick. Indeed, it&#8217;s hard to resist the temptation to get a free product.</p>
<h3>20. More emotional triggers</h3>
<p>Here are some additional emotional triggers you can use in your copywriting:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Trust: </strong>Building credibility and reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Fear:</strong> Tapping into common anxieties or concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Belonging: </strong>The need to be part of a community or tribe.</li>
<li><strong>Curiosity:</strong> Piquing interest to learn more.</li>
<li><strong>Pride:</strong> Targeting one&#8217;s self-esteem and accomplishments.</li>
<li><strong>Guilt:</strong> Reminding the audience of a problem or responsibility.</li>
<li><strong>Urgency:</strong> Creating a sense of limited time or availability.</li>
<li><strong>Relief:</strong> Offering a solution to a problem or pain point.</li>
<li><strong>Anticipation:</strong> Building excitement for what&#8217;s to come.</li>
<li><strong>Validation:</strong> Confirming a reader&#8217;s thoughts or beliefs.</li>
</ol>

<h2>What is performance marketing?</h2>
<p>Performance marketing is a digital marketing strategy based on results in which the brands or businesses only pay the marketing agencies, advertising platforms, or affiliates when they achieve their specific campaign goals, typically in the form of sales, clicks, or leads.</p>
<div id="performance-marketing-vs-brand-marketing"></div>
<h3>What’s the difference between performance marketing vs. brand marketing?</h3>
<p>Performance and brand marketing are two different types of strategies that can be used to reach the intended audience.</p>
<p>While both forms have their benefits, the main difference between them is brand marketing aims to establish a long-term company&#8217;s reputation and awareness among potential customers; in contrast, performance marketing focuses on specific strategies to drive immediate sales without necessarily building an emotional connection with customers first.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f331.png" alt="🌱" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Download our <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite7StepstoGrowthStrategy.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_GrowthStrategy_Download">free, editable growth strategy template</a> to walk through seven simple steps for creating the right plan to grow your business.</p>
<div id="benefits-of-performance-marketing"></div>
<h2>What are benefits of performance marketing?</h2>
<p>Even though this marketing strategy can be challenging for some businesses, there are many benefits for those who dive in.</p>
<p>Here are three reasons why you should give performance marketing a try.</p>
<h3>Low risk</h3>
<p>Performance marketing is a low-risk method to introduce new strategies since it requires (relatively) little investment. If the campaign works, you can scale up and increase the budget; however, if it doesn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s easy to back up without a big loss.</p>
<h3>Targeted</h3>
<p>This marketing strategy allows you to target the right people with your message. You can focus on demographics and geographic locations or narrow your searches by interests and behavior, such as consumers who visited your site recently or who clicked on the ad in the last 24 hours.</p>
<h3>Increased ROI</h3>
<p>One of the biggest benefits of performance marketing is that it can result in higher ROI than other types of advertising because it&#8217;s focused on a specific goal.</p>
<div id="types-of-performance-marketing"></div>
<h2>What are types of performance marketing?</h2>
<p>Performance marketing can be done through various means. Here are some of the most common.</p>
<h3>Social media advertising</h3>
<p>Social media ads are one of the most popular forms of performance-based advertising. These ads can target people who have visited your website once or shown interest in similar products or services.</p>

<div id="how-to-measure-performance-marketing"></div>
<h2>How do you measure performance marketing?</h2>
<p>Performance marketing is the art of achieving your business goals through paid advertising. It’s not just about buying ads and hoping they work. It’s about getting a return on the money you spend, which means measuring performance and adjusting your strategy accordingly.</p>
<p>The following are some of the most important <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">metrics</a> you should track to ensure your campaigns are running smoothly and meeting goals.</p>
<h3>Cost per click (CPC)</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-cpc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cost per click</a> refers to the cost of each click on an ad. The higher the CPC, the more expensive it is for your business to advertise on that particular keyword or keyword phrase.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/what-is-cpc.webp" alt="cost per click definition" width="936" height="259" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-80515" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/what-is-cpc.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/what-is-cpc-480x133.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Cost per impression (CPM)</h3>
<p>The average amount paid by an advertiser for every 1000 ad impressions. This is calculated by dividing the total cost of the ad by the number of times it was viewed.</p>
<h3>Cost per lead (CPL)</h3>
<p>The number of prospects responded to your ad and filled out a form. CPL is a standard metric used in PPC campaigns because it gives insight into how much each lead costs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/google-ads-cost-per-lead.webp" alt="google ads cost per lead benchmarks from wordstream" width="696" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-80519" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/google-ads-cost-per-lead.webp 696w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/google-ads-cost-per-lead-480x412.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 696px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> You can use our <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteGoogleAdsBenchmarks2023.html?cid=Web_WS_incontent_guide_2023benchmarks_Download&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incontent_links">search advertising benchmarks</a> to find average the CPL for your industry.</p>
<h3>Cost per acquisition (CPA)</h3>
<p>The cost per acquisition refers to how much you spend acquiring new customers. When looking at CPA, you should consider both the cost of your ad and the value of each sale or conversion.</p>
<h3>Lifetime value transaction (LVT)</h3>
<p>LVT is a metric that can give marketers valuable insights into potential revenue from a customer over time. In other words, it estimates how much one customer will spend on your product or services during their entire relationship with your company.</p>

<h2>5 steps to build a successful performance marketing strategy</h2>
<p>Developing a successful performance marketing strategy takes time, dedication, and much trial and error. But the payoff can be huge if you can get it right.</p>
<p>Here are some steps to build a performance marketing strategy that will bring results.</p>
<h3>1. Define your objectives</h3>
<p>To create an effective performance marketing campaign, it is fundamental that you have a clear understanding of what you are trying to accomplish because it will help you define every other step.</p>
<p>Your targets should be specific, measurable, and achievable. It should also be aligned with your overall <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-plan-goals-objectives-for-small-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business goals</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/smart-goals-acronym.webp" alt="smart goals acronym" width="460" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-80522" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/smart-goals-acronym.webp 460w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/smart-goals-acronym-231x300.webp 231w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<p>For example, social media advertising is a great option if you want to sell a product or service. However, if your goal is to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drive traffic to your website</a>, then paid search might work better.</p>
<p>Once you have identified these goals, they should form the foundation of all your marketing activities. Every campaign should be designed to support them in some way.</p>
<h3>2. Choose the right digital channels</h3>
<p>One of the keys to being successful at performance marketing is using multiple channels. The reality is that not all channels are created equal, and some will work better than others for your particular business.</p>
<p>The best way to do this is by setting up a few channels, testing them with small amounts of money, and tracking the results over time so you can make better decisions in the future.</p>
<p>Here are some common types of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/26/marketing-channels">digital marketing strategies</a> you can choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content marketing: </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-marketing-trends-2024">Content marketing</a> is the process of creating, distributing, and promoting your company’s content to attract potential customers. It can build authority, trust, and loyalty with consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Social media marketing: </strong><a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/local-social-media-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social media</a> is an essential part of any online marketing strategy. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have become a place where your consumers spend the most time.</li>
<li><strong>Display ads:</strong> Display ads are typically placed on news sites, <a href="https://www.blogituplife.com/what-does-blog-stand-for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blogs</a>, or e-commerce sites. These ads often appear in the form of pop-up banners that contain a link back to your website.</li>
<li><strong>Email marketing: </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/27/email-marketing-ios15">Email marketing</a> helps you build relationships with prospects so they trust your brand and buy from you when ready.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/black-friday-email-template-sale.webp" alt="black friday email template - example of black friday sale email to customers" width="336" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76986" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/black-friday-email-template-sale.webp 336w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/black-friday-email-template-sale-168x300.webp 168w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" /></p>
<h3>3. Identify partners</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge of managing a performance marketing campaign is finding the right partners to work with. The relationship you have with your partner can make or break your campaign.</p>
<p>You need to find partners with a vision and goals similar to yours who will help you reach people that matter.</p>
<p>The best partners have access to a large following and provide high-quality leads with a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics">strong conversion rate</a>, meaning they&#8217;re more likely to convert into paying customers.</p>
<p>When looking for partners, ensure they offer transparency about their work and methods. This will help you understand what kind of return on investment (ROI) you can expect from working with them over time.</p>
<h3>4. Launch and optimize campaigns</h3>
<p>Now that you have a budget and a target audience, it is time to launch your campaigns. You will need to set up a landing page and website where you intend to direct the traffic from these ads.</p>
<p>Once you have all the elements in place, you&#8217;ll want to optimize your campaigns for performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics">Optimizing for performance</a> means constantly tracking and improving the metrics that matter most to your business. You should be looking at how many customers are being acquired, how much they spend, and how long they stay engaged with your brand.</p>
<p>Optimization is a never-ending process because it&#8217;s not about finding and sticking with the winning strategy. Instead, you must constantly test new ideas and see which works best in different situations.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/23/optimize-performance-max-campaigns">optimize your ads</a> by changing their keywords or budgets to improve performance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-optimization.webp" alt="google ads location targeting bid optimization" width="936" height="532" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76522" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-optimization.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-optimization-480x273.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For example, if an ad gets clicks but not conversions (sales), you should make changes or remove the ad altogether. Or, if an ad isn&#8217;t getting any clicks, you&#8217;ll want to try a different approach, keyword, or title until you find something that works better.</p>
<h3>5. Monitor results</h3>
<p>Monitoring the results of your performance marketing campaigns is crucial to your success. The key is understanding what&#8217;s working, what&#8217;s not, and what can be improved.</p>
<p>The best way to track your performance is to use a dedicated software program to give you all the information you need in one place. This way, you&#8217;ll be able to see how each channel is performing and make adjustments as needed.</p>
<p>You should also pay attention to the quality of traffic that your campaigns send to your site. You can do this by looking at bounce rate, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/expected-ctr">click-through rate (CTR)</a>, conversion rate, and other metrics over time.</p>
<p>The results should be monitored daily, and you should also look at the data weekly or monthly. This will help you identify trends and evaluate the performance of your campaigns over time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you getting paid what you&#8217;re worth or what you want? Many employees–<a href="https://www.payscale.com/career-news/2018/09/46-percent-of-workers-feel-like-theyre-underpaid-but-are-they" target="_blank" rel="noopener">46%</a>, in fact–feel like they&#8217;re underpaid. Additionally, the PayScale Gender Pay Gap Report for 2023 concludes a disparity still exists in how men and women are paid. Their data further shows the gender pay gap is wider for women of color, women at higher job levels, and women in certain occupations and industries.</p>

<p>For many, it can be difficult to navigate the tricky waters when it comes to asking for a raise.</p>
<p>With 12 years of recruiting experience, I&#8217;ve hired hundreds and coached thousands into employment. Over the last seven years of my <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/recruitment-marketing-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting</a> career, I made over 400 job offers and negotiated hundreds of salaries. By implementing the following strategies on how to get a raise, I personally grew my salary by 57% (from the same employer) and ranked in the top 1% of the highest-paid corporate recruiters in the nation.</p>
<p>I’m going to share my tried-and-true tips for getting a raise with you to help ensure you&#8217;re getting paid what you&#8217;re worth. Plus, I&#8217;ll share a couple of email examples and scripts you can use to get the conversation started with your supervisor.</p>

<h2>What to do before you ask for a raise</h2>
</div>
<p>To understand how to ask for a raise, you must first understand how <a href="https://www.salary.com/articles/knowing-what-you-re-worth-3-keys-to-determine-your-market-value/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market value</a> works. Why does the store manager make more than the cashier? The cashier is responsible for operating the cash register, checking customers out, and providing friendly customer service. The store manager is responsible for managing employees (hiring, firing, training), driving store sales, managing P&amp;L, maintaining inventory, and dealing with escalated customer service issues.</p>
<p>Both are important jobs but why does the store manager make double the cashier?</p>
<p>What separates the two are the skills they possess and the value they add to the store as well as their responsibility level. Market value is the relative worth of a particular skill set to a particular company within a particular industry.</p>

<h2>5 factors that determine your salary</h2>
</div>
<p>The key to asking for a raise and actually getting it is knowing your worth, <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improving your skills</a>, and increasing the value you add to your company. Your income is often commensurate with the value you add to the marketplace.</p>
<p><strong>Here are the five factors that determine your salary:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Skills:</strong> The set of capabilities you offer a company in exchange for compensation.</li>
<li><strong>Experience:</strong> The level of mastery you possess over your skills demonstrated by the results you&#8217;ve previously achieved.</li>
<li><strong>Company:</strong> The specific enterprise you offer your services to within an industry.</li>
<li><strong>Industry:</strong> The market sector your particular company belongs to (retail, banking, e-commerce, insurance, technology, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Geography:</strong> Where your job is located in the country (or world).</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#8217;s examine each factor to learn how they impact your market value and ability to ask for a raise.</p>
<p>Before we go further, I&#8217;d like to make clear, when I refer to something as having &#8220;low value&#8221; or &#8220;high value&#8221; it has nothing to do with a human being&#8217;s intrinsic or moral value. Rather, it has to do with the value associated with the marketplace from a business perspective.</p>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>Dan Lok, entrepreneur and investor, is well-known for talking about what he refers to as &#8220;high-income&#8221; skills. A particular set of skills that correlate to a higher income include <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/19/how-to-improve-presentation-skills" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public speaking</a>, cybersecurity, supervising, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/07/improve-writing-skills" target="_blank" rel="noopener">copywriting</a>, teaching, sales, web design, and digital content creation. As you can see, these are highly specialized skills that require training, time, and experience to develop competence and mastery.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to create a higher income and get the raise you&#8217;re asking for, learn <a href="https://www.payscale.com/data/which-skills-are-most-valuable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-income skills</a> and develop mastery.</p>
<p>Your job title may also impact your salary, and most job titles are given based on skill and experience, so take that into consideration when determining how much to ask for when you ask for a raise.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.payscale.com/data/which-skills-are-most-valuable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<h3>Experience</h3>
<p>Which doctor would you rather perform your heart surgery: the rookie or the veteran? Of course, the veteran! Why? Because you have a greater sense of certainty the more experienced physician will do the job right because of their experience. The same goes for your employer when they evaluate you for a raise.</p>
<p>There are four factors that make up your experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time:</strong> How long have you been implementing the skills associated with your job?</li>
<li><strong>Quantity:</strong> How many times have you completed the primary tasks associated with your job?</li>
<li><strong>Quality:</strong> How well did you complete the primary tasks associated with your job?</li>
<li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> How do the results you&#8217;ve produced measure up to your job&#8217;s KPIs (key performance indicators)?</li>
</ul>
<p>To enhance your experience and increase your value to your employer, take advantage of <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/professional-development-opportunities-to-grow-your-career/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professional development opportunities</a> associated with your job and industry. To maximize your income, do your job well, and strive to become the best at it over time.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3>Company</h3>
<p>Blockbuster or Netflix? It blows my mind to know these companies competed head-to-head at one point. Both started in the video rental industry but resulted in two completely different outcomes. When Netflix launched in 1997, Blockbuster was the clear market leader in the video rental industry. By 2020, Netflix was valued at $203 billion. Today, Blockbuster is now left with a single store in Bend, Oregon.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/blockbuster-vs-netflix-value-e1683227851444.jpg" alt="chart that shows the value netflix brings customers vs blockbuster" width="844" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71436" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/blockbuster-vs-netflix-value-e1683227851444-844x551.jpg 844w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/blockbuster-vs-netflix-value-e1683227851444-480x270.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 844px) 844px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://i2.wp.com/strategyjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/timeline.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>A company&#8217;s leadership, strategy, and execution make a difference in how it is positioned within an industry. How well your company is doing affects your chances of getting a raise. Be aware of what&#8217;s going on with your company and its competitors when it comes to asking for a raise.</p>
<h3>Industry</h3>
<p>The last few years have impacted different industries in different ways. The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jobs-industries-careers-hit-hardest-by-coronavirus-unemployment-data-2020-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pandemic heavily impacted industries</a> including travel, entertainment, and restaurants. And while some of those industries are starting to see upticks, others have been hurt by supply chain issues. And most industries have been severely impacted by <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-during-inflation/">rising inflation</a>.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the latest trends taking place in your industry and how they may impact your company and job. This can help you determine the right time to ask for a raise as well as for how much.</p>
<h3>Geography</h3>
<p>Salaries for the same type of job can vary depending on where you live due to the differences in cost of living, taxes, etc. I&#8217;ve hired candidates who&#8217;ve taken nearly a 50% pay cut just to relocate to Texas for the lower cost of living. You can use tools like <a href="https://www.payscale.com/cost-of-living-calculator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayScale&#8217;s Cost of Living Calculator</a> to see how your city measures up to the rest of the country.</p>

<h2>When to ask for a raise</h2>
</div>
<p>There&#8217;s no rule as to how often you can ask for a raise. But there are key times when asking for a raise and actually getting it is more probable.</p>
<h3>Salary review</h3>
<p>Most companies have an established <a href="https://www.hibob.com/hr-glossary/salary-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">salary review</a> cycle. The last company I worked for had yearly salary reviews. Some companies review employee salaries at least twice a year. If you don&#8217;t know what your salary review cycle is, ask your HR department. This is your prime time to ask for a raise.</p>
<h3>Performance review</h3>
<p>Companies generally conduct <a href="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/effective-performance-review-tips-1918842" target="_blank" rel="noopener">performance reviews</a> more frequently than salary reviews. My last company conducted performance reviews quarterly. Meetings with your supervisor specifically to discuss performance can be an opportunity to ask for a raise.</p>
<h3>Outlier event</h3>
<p>Good companies will reward outstanding performance. Did you land a huge account? Did you optimize a workflow that saved your company millions? Did you implement a recognition program that increased <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/17/how-to-train-new-hires">employee retention</a> by 50%? Any time you move the company forward in an extraordinary way can warrant an opportunity for you to ask for a raise.</p>

<h2>How to (gracefully) ask for a raise</h2>
</div>
<p>Now that you understand the details behind what factors determine your salary, when to ask for a raise, and how much you should ask for, it&#8217;s time to actually ask for a raise. Here are three simple steps to follow to ask for raise.</p>
<h3>1. Know your value</h3>
<p>Use salary research tools such as <a href="https://www.payscale.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayScale</a>, <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glassdoor</a>, and <a href="http://indeed.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indeed</a> as reference points to learn your market value. You can add parameters such as job title, years of experience, and geography to get as accurate of a valuation as possible.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/indeed-salary-comparisons.jpg" alt="indeed salary comparisons homepage" width="936" height="518" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71533" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/indeed-salary-comparisons.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/indeed-salary-comparisons-480x266.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.indeed.com/career/salaries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re bold, have direct conversations with others in your profession about their salary. Every time you get a call from a recruiter or another company, document the rate they are pitching you at.</p>
<p>Capture as many data points as you can wherever you can get them. We&#8217;ll use these data points to build your case to get a raise. The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/elanagross/2016/06/27/8-managers-share-the-best-way-to-ask-for-a-raise-and-get-it/?sh=2c312f3f74ff" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best way to ask for a raise</a> is using data and logic, not emotion.</p>
<h3>2. Be specific</h3>
<p>Like all negotiations, you can ask for whatever you want! However, you have to be able to justify what you are asking.</p>
<p>The market average is <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/090415/salary-secrets-what-considered-big-raise.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3-5%</a> of your current salary. This of course will vary depending on your industry and company as well as your experience and individual performance.</p>
<h3>3. Build your case</h3>
<p>Great results are the key to you getting a raise. Be meticulous about documenting every win, accomplishment, and result you&#8217;ve produced that moved the company forward. Yes, I&#8217;m asking you to keep a log of results.</p>
<p>This will actually make you a better employee because you&#8217;ll be more aware of the contributions you&#8217;ve made to your company. This greater awareness will also increase your confidence when asking for a raise.</p>
<p>The best results to document are ones you can tie to cost savings, time savings, increased revenue, and increased efficiency.</p>
<p><em>Here&#8217;s a real-world example:</em> On the first day of my job at my previous employer, I walked into a stack of receipts from staffing agencies. Staffing agencies charge on average 20% of a candidate&#8217;s base salary as a placement fee. Therefore, a $100,000 software engineer would cost $20,000 to hire. As the internal recruiter, my job was to relieve the company of its dependence on staffing agencies to save costs. During my seven years with this company, we hired over 400 team members and didn&#8217;t pay a single perm placement fee. I documented every hire we made as well as how much it would have cost if we hired through an agency. This is I how grew my salary by 57% and ranked in the top 1% of highest-paid corporate recruiters in the nation.</p>
<h3>4. Make the ask</h3>
<p>Be direct and lead with results. The key to making an effective ask is your preparation. Speak to your manager in terms they care about.</p>
<p>The following are actual supporting points I&#8217;ve used to consistently get raises.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hired 114 employees while paying $0 in hiring fees to 3rd party agencies (7 years consecutive).</li>
<li>Saved $8,000 / year by discontinuing unnecessary recruiting software licenses.</li>
<li>Effectiveness &amp; Results: 77 hires (42 regular, 22 temps, 13 contractors) despite the loss of one full-time recruiter.</li>
<li>Facilitated nearshore resourcing initiative which cut development costs 50%.</li>
<li>Implemented &#8220;pipeline recruiting&#8221; strategy which reduced time to hire by 50%.</li>
<li>Saved $5,000 of approved recruiting spend by maximizing organic recruitment strategies.</li>
<li>Achieved 60% y-o-y increase of internal referrals (135 total) by influencing a recruiting culture.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, I&#8217;m big into tying my results to cost savings and increased efficiency. This is a highly effective strategy to get a raise and should also give you an example of the way you can and should structure your results.</p>

<h2>What not to say when asking for a raise</h2>
</div>
<p>When asking for a raise, there are a few things not to say. Keep these examples in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>I haven&#8217;t had a raise in [amount of] years, so it&#8217;s time for a raise.</li>
<li>I know that [coworker] is making more than me, so I need a raise.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve been here for [amount of] years, so I need a raise.</li>
<li>Other companies have reached out offering me more money.</li>
<li>If I don&#8217;t get a raise, I&#8217;ll find a new job.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, if the request for your raise isn&#8217;t rooted in your accomplishments and what you bring to the company, it&#8217;s going to be hard for your manager or supervisor to make the case for a salary increase. By following the above steps we outlined, you will have provided enough evidence that you deserve a raise without resorting to these statements.</p>

<h2>Copy and paste emails to ask for a raise</h2>
</div>
<p>Actually asking for a raise can be difficult, but starting the conversation doesn’t have to be hard. Here are some email templates you can copy, edit, and make your own.</p>
<p>But remember, it&#8217;s always best to have the raise discussion in person (or virtually) so you can have a detailed conversation with your manager about why you feel you deserve a raise and also hear any <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/growth-lab-reputation-management/3-easy-ways-get-feedback-your-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feedback</a> they may have for you.</p>
<h3>Email template #1: Starting the conversation</h3>
<p><em>Dear [insert manager&#8217;s name here],</em></p>
<p><em>I would like to set up some time to discuss a performance-based salary increase. Due to the supporting points referenced below, which significantly moved the company forward, I believe my performance warrants the review of my existing compensation.</em></p>
<p><em>[Insert supporting points here]</em></p>
<p><em>Completed [specific task] which created [measurable outcome] that resulted in [quantifiable benefit to company].</em></p>
<p><em>Please let me know if you would be willing to have this conversation with me, and what day or time would work best.</em></p>
<h3>Email template #2: Scheduling a salary review</h3>
<p><em>Dear [insert manager&#8217;s name here],</em></p>
<p><em>I would like to set up some time to discuss my current salary. </em><em>According to market information referenced by PayScale, Indeed, and Glassdoor, the average salary for a [your title] with [# of years] experience in [your city/location] is [avg. market salary]. My current compensation is [%] below the industry average. </em></p>
<p><em>Respectfully, I&#8217;d like to ask for a review of my salary to ensure it&#8217;s aligned with the market average in our next one-on-one meeting. Please let me know if I can provide any additional details ahead of this conversation.</em></p>

<h2>Scripts to help you ask for a raise</h2>
</div>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve sent your email, it&#8217;s time to have a discussion about your raise in person. Use these scripts as a jumping-off point and keep the points you outlined as to why you deserve a raise handy so you can reference them as needed.</p>
<h3>Script 1: Starting the conversation</h3>
<p><em>Thank you for taking the time to meet with me and discuss my request for a raise. As I outlined in my email, over the last [amount of time], I have worked hard to deliver excellent results for [company]. Some of my recent accomplishments include [outline some of the key points and accomplishments you identified earlier]. These contributions have [how they&#8217;ve impacted the business], so I would like to request an increase in my salary. </em></p>
<h3>Script 2: Salary review</h3>
<p><em>Thank you for taking the time to talk with me. As I mentioned in my email, my market research shows that the average salary for a [your title] with [# of years] experience in [your city/location] is [avg. market salary]. My current compensation is [%] below the industry average. </em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve outlined some additional points that I believe support my request for an increase in my salary. For example, [outline some of the key points and accomplishments you identified earlier here]. </em></p>
<p><em>I appreciate your time and consideration. </em></p>
<h3>Script 3: If they said no</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s possible your company may be unable to offer you a raise for a number of reasons. If that&#8217;s the case, don&#8217;t fear! You can use this script to keep the conversation moving.</p>
<p><em>Thank you for your consideration. Would it be possible to outline some goals and next steps I can work toward so we can revisit this conversation in the next [six months or one year]? I want to make sure I&#8217;m making valuable contributions to the company and focusing on the right areas to move the business forward and move forward in my career. </em></p>
<h2>Now go get your raise!</h2>
<p>The ultimate strategy for getting the raise is to become more valuable to your company. You become more valuable by enhancing your skills, demonstrating effectiveness, and producing great results. Know your value, lead with results, believe in your case, and make the ask!</p>

<h2>The top 7 marketing strategies for ecommerce stores</h2>
<p>Below are the top<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/18/ecommerce-marketing-strategies"> ecommerce marketing</a> strategies we recommend for new store owners to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/09/b2b-sales-strategies">drive sales</a> and maximize profit.</p>
<h3>1. Influencer marketing</h3>
<p>As a new store owner, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/digital-marketing/influencer-marketing-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">influencer marketing</a> is one of the guaranteed ways to fast-track your journey to market. There are micro-influencers in every industry, and consumers respect and follow the recommendations and words of authority figures they know.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/how-to-increase-instagram-engagement-influencer-post.png" alt="how to increase instagram engagement - influencer post" width="600" height="386" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-64888" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/how-to-increase-instagram-engagement-influencer-post.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/how-to-increase-instagram-engagement-influencer-post-480x309.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Builds trust.</li>
<li>Easiest way to spread word of mouth.</li>
<li>Cheaper than mainstream media.</li>
<li>Very effective if executed properly.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Difficult to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/12/20/content-marketing-roi">predict ROI</a>.</li>
<li>A change in the influencer’s reputation could impact your brand.</li>
<li>Can be hard to identify and get responses from influencers.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Tips</h4>
<p>Gretta Van Riel, a multiple 7-figure ecommerce store owner, uses influencer marketing as her primary marketing channel. Here are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKivhEayDxU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some tips from her on how to get the best out of influencer marketing</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give your influencers creative freedom. They know their audience better.</li>
<li>Do not overwhelm influencers in your initial outreach message.</li>
<li>Be clear with deliverables. Quantify where possible. For example, they will write one round-up blog post mentioning your product and three social media mentions (Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok). And what are you giving them in exchange? A free trial, unlimited or early access, or a discount?</li>
<li>Stay small. Micro-influencers oftentimes have better engagement than macro-influencers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Social media marketing</h3>
<p>Organic social media marketing refers to using the free posting and online store options available on major social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, TikTok, and more.</p>
<p>Many consumers use social media to learn about brands and ecommerce stores and will look to see how other customers engage with your brand before they buy from you.</p>

<h3>5. Search engine optimization (SEO)</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO</a> is the science of optimizing a website so that it <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google">ranks high in search engine results</a> for terms relevant to your business and services. The more relevant traffic you get, the more you can convert that traffic into leads and sales.</p>
<p>The key to the blog is to write articles that target informational intent keywords. For example, Quip is an ecommerce site for oral care, and it’s got a blog on topics like how to use an electric toothbrush, how to clean an electric toothbrush, and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/best-ecommerce-marketing-strategies-quip-blog.png" alt="best ecommerce marketing strategies - quip's blog" width="700" height="710" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70780" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/best-ecommerce-marketing-strategies-quip-blog.png 700w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/best-ecommerce-marketing-strategies-quip-blog-480x487.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></p>

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>SEO is free! And <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/03/get-more-traffic-from-evergreen-content">keyword-targeted evergreen content</a> produces long-term traffic growth.</li>
<li>SEO is scalable so you can maintain performance as your traffic increases.</li>
<li>When combined with conversion rate optimization, your SEO can boost sales.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/pay-per-click-advertising">Pay-per-click advertising</a> (PPC) is a great choice for new <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2024-ecommerce-trends">ecommerce</a> store owners with some marketing budget. It simply means paying ad networks to show your marketing messages or banners across search engines or other online media.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ppc-advertising-examples-1.png" alt="ppc ad examples for search, shopping, display, social" width="720" height="464" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-64739" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ppc-advertising-examples-1.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ppc-advertising-examples-1-480x309.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>While SEO takes time to gain traction, PPC yields immediate results.</li>
<li>Because you can target highly specific audiences with PPC, and because you&#8217;re only paying when someone clicks on your ad, this method is cost-effective.</li>
<li>Data! With clear visibility into which campaigns are working and which ones aren&#8217;t, you can make data-driven decisions to optimize your campaigns and maximize your ROI.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Running effective Google Ads and other PPC campaigns requires regular maintenance, audits, and reporting.</li>
<li>You need to pay to play. If you underfund your campaigns, they won&#8217;t generate enough volume and data needed for machine learning to take place and optimize your campaigns for profitability.</li>
<li>The online advertising landscape is always changing, so it&#8217;s important to stay on top of platform updates.</li>

<h3>7. Video marketing</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible to overlook the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/08/video-marketing-statistics">power of video marketing</a>. Most social media platforms now favor video content over any other form of content. You can use video to create educational tutorials, ads, educational ads, product demonstrations, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/13/explainer-videos">explainer videos</a>, and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/video-ad-tools-ripl.png" alt="video ad tools - ripl" width="500" height="977" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61792" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/video-ad-tools-ripl.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/video-ad-tools-ripl-480x938.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Video gives you a competitive edge because it allows you to not only tell but show your value and demonstrate how your product provides benefits.</li>
<li>While it can be hard to take creative freedom with SEO and PPC content, video affords plenty of room for<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/03/video-marketing-ideas"> ideas and creativity</a> to help you distinguish your brand.</li>
<li>Live shopping streams are becoming more popular and accessible.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Video marketing can be resource heavy—it takes time to edit, and you need to have the right equipment so that you&#8217;re working with quality footage from the start.</li>
<li>Requires consistency. To gain traction with your YouTube Channel, you need to be consistently posting content and monitoring your YouTube analytics.</li>
<li>Lots of influencers use video, so your business can be up against some heavy competition with large audiences.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final tips for choosing the best ecommerce marketing strategy</h2>
<p>Not sure which marketing strategy to start with for your new ecommerce store, or which one will be best for you? Here are some final tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/10/15/multi-channel-marketing">multi-channel strategy</a> is the way to go. Each channel has its strengths and weaknesses, but employing multiple channels in concert with one another will bring you the best results.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">Research your target audience.</a> Find out the platforms your target audience uses most. For example, Tik Tok works more with Gen Z than the baby boomer generation. And emails work better with the baby boomer generation than with Gen Z.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll only know how each strategy works with your niche if you pay attention to your metrics. Use tools like Google Analytics,<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/18/how-to-use-google-data-studio"> Data (Looker) Studio</a>, a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/09/crm-for-small-business">CRM</a>, and the native analytics tools within each channel to monitor and measure your results. This will allow you to see which channels bring in the highest ROI as well as to A/B test different approaches within each channel.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you&#8217;ve got a new business or established one, there are lots of different ways to get your name out there in front of the right people. You&#8217;ve got pillar strategies like SEO, PPC, social, and more, and then there are more niche tactics within those strategies that can be wildly effective if you know how to use them right. One such tactic is through the platform Help a Reporter Out (HARO), which can help you to convey your expertise, build brand awareness, and improve your SEO through backlinks.How so? Read on and I&#8217;ll show you:</p>
<ul>
<li>What HARO is and how it works</li>
<li>How it can help you to build backlinks and brand awareness</li>
<li>How to respond to HARO queries the right way</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is HARO?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.helpareporter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Help a Reporter Out</a> (HARO) is a platform by Cision where journalists, businesses, and individuals post queries asking for information, statistics, and perspectives they need for articles they are writing. Experts can then respond to these queries, and the journalist can then quote them in the article and will often provide a backlink to their site (if applicable). <img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/haro-query-example.png" alt="haro query example" width="462" height="441" class="aligncenter wp-image-70546" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An example of a query in HARO</em></p>
<p>Journalists can come from well-known publications, making HARO a great means of <a href="https://splintereconomics.com/why-is-link-building-important/">link building</a>, which is crucial for SEO, while also <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">building your brand awareness</a> and media coverage. This platform is actually so effective that many HARO link-building services have sprung up in recent years, offering to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2010/04/01/build-amazing-backlinks">obtain high-quality links</a> from top media outlets (for a hefty price, of course).</p>
<h2>How to set up a HARO account</h2>
<p>To set up your HARO account, go to the <a href="https://www.helpareporter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HARO website</a> and create a profile. You’ll need to provide your name, email address, and some basic information about your expertise and industry. <img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/cision-haro-signup.png" alt="haro account creation" width="720" height="585" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70544" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/cision-haro-signup.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/cision-haro-signup-480x390.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /> Then, customize your preferences to see requests specific to your area of expertise and define your preferred frequency of email notifications.</p>
<h2>How to respond to HARO queries (template)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/10/link-building-secrets">To get backlinks</a> using HARO, it’s all about responding to the right queries at the right time, in the right way. And that’s what I’m going to walk you through now. Here&#8217;s a basic template I recommend: <div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'>Hi [NAME] My name is [NAME], and I have spent much of my career working as a [RELEVANT ROLE] ] at [COMPANY]. In [X years] of working in this industry, I have [LIST ACHIEVEMENTS]. Here’s my take on your query: Start every pitch following this outline, and you will quickly notice more responses from journalists and new backlinks to your website. Thanks in advance, [NAME]</div></div> Some things you’ll notice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Address them by name.</li>
<li>Thank the journalist for their time.</li>
<li>Say that you are willing to follow up/be interviewed (don’t worry, journalists will virtually never do this, but it’s good to ask)</li>
<li>Say thanks in advance. For some reason, this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/01/21/email-signature-examples-and-trends">email signature</a> is associated with the most positive responses.</li>
</ul>
<p>But there&#8217;s more to a HARO pitch than this, of course, so in the next section, I&#8217;m going to provide some key tips.</p>
<h2>Tips on using HARO for backlinks and PR</h2>
<p>Below you&#8217;ll find my top tips for responding to HARO queries in a way that paints your business in the best light, actually lands you backlinks and PR, and develops relationships with journalists.</p>
<h3>1. Check the media outlet’s domain rating</h3>
<p>Domain rating, also known as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/12/domain-authority">domain authority</a>—depending on which SEO platform you’re using—is an expression of your website’s SEO value. When you’re looking to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/06/21/b2b-link-building">build backlinks</a>, the higher the backlinker’s DR, the more it will help you to increase yours. That being said, checking the DR of the media outlet in question will help you to identify whether pitching to this journalist will be worth your time.<a href="https://ahrefs.com/website-authority-checker" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> <img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/domain-authority-domain-rating-ahrefs.png" alt="domain rating in ahrefs" width="650" height="207" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53633" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/domain-authority-domain-rating-ahrefs.png 650w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/domain-authority-domain-rating-ahrefs-480x153.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Use a tool like <a href="https://ahrefs.com/website-authority-checker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ahrefs’ Free Website Authority Checker.</a></em></p>
<h3>2. Only respond to relevant queries</h3>
<p>Hundreds of HARO queries get posted every day, so you should only respond to those for which you have relevant experience (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/05/seo-trends">experience is now part of Google&#8217;s E-E-A-T formula</a>, by the way!). In the example above, you can see in the requirements that Cynthia is looking for consumer analysts, so if you are one, have conducted research in the field, or have a relevant degree, you may be the perfect match.</p>
<h3>3. Show your credentials</h3>
<p>On that note, make it clear right away that you are a quality and credible source for them. State your credentials and relevant experience right away. And don’t underestimate the power of your own credibility. You don’t have to be Elon Musk to get a link from The New York Times!</p>
<h3>4. Respond within 30 minutes</h3>
<p>Time is of the essence for journalists, so being proactive with your responses is crucial. Most queries on HARO will have a pitch deadline, but the best advice is to try to be the first one to respond. Journalists are often looking for a quick quote to plug into their articles and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/04/how-to-write-a-press-release">press releases</a>. They want convenience, not a life story. Play to this and try to respond to a query within 30 minutes. Fast responses win HARO links! <img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/submit-new-pitch-haro.png" alt="submit new pitch on haro" width="504" height="380" class="aligncenter wp-image-70549" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/submit-new-pitch-haro.png 504w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/submit-new-pitch-haro-480x362.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 504px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://byjessicala.com/help-a-reporter-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<h3>5. Make it quantifiable and/or quotable</h3>
<p>Journalists will take you much more seriously if you can reference <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/03/how-to-write-a-case-study">case studies</a> and statistics that back up your input. For example, instead of saying “Focusing on B2B sales is important” try “Focusing on B2B sales can lead to a 138% year-over-year return.” Also, be quotable. Try and visualize your response in a Forbes article. Does it fit or sound clunky? Quotable excerpts are intelligent and memorable but brief and to the point. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/06/how-to-write-copy-that-sells">Being clear and concise with your copy</a> will make it easier for journalists to select your pitches over others.</p>
<h3>6. Don’t follow up until after you get a response</h3>
<p>If you don’t get a response, the journalist has probably deleted your pitch because you’re not qualified and time is of the essence. Don’t keep chasing them. This will signal to the journalist you are just desperate for backlinks and/or media exposure and they’ll avoid you in the future.</p>
<h3>7. Don’t expect every pitch to succeed</h3>
<p>On HARO, a success rate between <strong>5-10%</strong> is fairly common. Some specialists can get this a bit higher, but no one will acquire media coverage and a strong backlink for every pitch. Stay positive and consistent with your HARO pitches. You can even delegate this to one of your employees if needed. But please don’t give up after writing a few pitches! It’s not about the quantity of links you build but the quality of the links—and the quality of the relationships! Which is my next tip. <img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/google-ranking-factors-seo-backlinks-link-juice.png" alt="google ranking factors - how backlinking link juice is transferred" width="720" height="475" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63665" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/google-ranking-factors-seo-backlinks-link-juice.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/google-ranking-factors-seo-backlinks-link-juice-480x317.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>8. Focus on relationships</h3>
<p>HARO isn’t a one-way street. It’s give <em>and</em> take. Focus not on building backlinks, but on building relationships with journalists. Share the article with your network, and follow up with journalists to thank them, let them know you’ve shared it, and offer to help with new articles.</p>
<h3>9. Track your success</h3>
<p>As you know, not all links are created equally. Context, relevancy, and authority all influence how search engines determine a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google">website&#8217;s ranking power</a>. Create a spreadsheet to track your success. It can be as simple as “Publication Name” and “Yes/No” or it can be a little more sophisticated (like this one). <img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/how-to-use-haro-backlinks-spreadsheet-tracker.png" alt="haro backlink tracking spreadsheet" width="720" height="368" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70547" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/how-to-use-haro-backlinks-spreadsheet-tracker.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/how-to-use-haro-backlinks-spreadsheet-tracker-480x245.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /> This will help you measure, optimize, and scale your link-building efforts.</p>
<h3>10. Sign up for Google Alerts</h3>
<p>On a similar note, it’s a good idea to sign up for Google Alerts so that you will get a notification every time you earn a new link. Also, be sure to regularly run site searches and check SEO tools to find new backlinks. <div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><strong>Speaking of SEO tools, have you used our <a href="https://localiq.com/website-grader/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free Website Grader</a></strong>? Get a free audit of your website in less than a minute!</div></div> This can help you to identify patterns and trends in the type of backlinks you are getting e.g. topics, pitch style, etc. From here, you can make much more data-driven decisions about HARO link building and whether it can viably fit into your long-term <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO strategy</a>.</p>
<h3>11. Use it as a larger backlink strategy</h3>
<p>In the same way that different backlinks hold different levels of value, there are also many different ways to build links besides HARO. Other ways to build backlinks include <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/06/21/guest-posting-dos-donts">guest posting</a>, niche content, statistic posts, infographics, content syndication, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/15/lead-magnet-ideas">lead magnets</a> like free tools. Diversifying your efforts will help your backlink profile to grow naturally, with varied anchor text, and across multiple channels.</p>
<h2>Start building backlinks with HARO</h2>
<p>HARO outreach is one of the best ways for businesses to increase brand awareness, generate referral traffic, and, most importantly, build high-quality backlinks. Plus, seeing your business get featured in the media is very gratifying. Follow these HARO tips and best practices, and you will get to experience it yourself!</p>

<h2>21 copywriting mistakes to avoid for better marketing results</h2>
<p>Below you&#8217;ll find a list of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/seo-copywriting">copywriting</a> mistakes that are often all too easy or tempting to make.  Some are minor while others can really impact your marketing results.</p>
<h3>1. Not understanding the copy&#8217;s target</h3>
<p>The most obvious yet often ignored mistake some writers still make:</p>
<p>They craft content in a way that makes sense to <em>them</em>, not the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">audience they need to engage</a>. While it&#8217;s critical to know your product or service, there&#8217;s a difference between what you want to tell and what the reader wants to hear about it.</p>
<p>Ensure you know the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/23/buyer-personas">buyer&#8217;s persona</a> inside and out. A competent copywriter understands their needs, pains, motivations, frustrations, and possible objections because it helps craft compelling content that works.</p>

<h3>2. No problem to solve</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/06/how-to-write-copy-that-sells">Copywriting</a> is about getting the audience to act. But to act, they need to understand the problem this action will help them solve. It’s wrong to assume that the reader knows it.</p>
<p>Outline the problem in your content. Remember the <em>&#8220;What&#8217;s in there for me?&#8221;</em> issue: When reading, a person looks for a clear answer to this question.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grab our marketing guide!<br />
<em>No problem to solve here; a reader doesn&#8217;t understand why they need to take this guide.</em></li>
<li>Grab our content guide to help you write persuasive marketing copy!<br />
<em>The reader understands what&#8217;s in there for them in your content.)</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Wrong tone</h3>
<p>The golden rule of copywriting: Follow the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/07/31/brand-voice">brand&#8217;s tone of voice</a> when crafting all of your copy. If unable to capture that tone and stay consistent, you won&#8217;t hit the target market.</p>
<p>The tone of voice is about a brand&#8217;s values, philosophy, and attitude toward its audience. It determines the lexical items and sentence structure you&#8217;ll use in copies to communicate the message. It allows you to speak the same language as the audience and make them want to listen to you.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/brand-tone-of-voice.jpeg" alt="brand tone of voice" width="720" height="540" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-70294" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/brand-tone-of-voice.jpeg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/brand-tone-of-voice-480x360.jpeg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/tone-of-voice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>If your client doesn&#8217;t have a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/10/content-style-guide">brand book or style guide</a> describing their tone of voice, the minimum you can do is to read their previously published content to mirror their communication style in your writings.</p>
<h3>4. Opening with boring generalizations</h3>
<p>All too often, writers start out a blog post or marketing email with a generic absolute or boring generalization. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>It&#8217;s not a secret that sugar harms our health.</em></li>
<li><em>Everyone knows that smoking is dangerous.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Such claims convey no meaning or value. Why write it if it tells nothing new?</p>
<p>Anyone can create such generic content online. If you want to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/22/marketing-copy">write compelling marketing copy</a>, use interesting information backed up by statistics and research, quotes from influencers in the topic, or testimonials from customers.</p>
<p>Instead of the above, how about:</p>
<ul>
<li>When I learned that the <a href="https://the1thing.com/the-5-unexpected-benefits-of-sugar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sugar in chocolate can improve thinking skills</a>, I was thrilled&#8230;</li>
<li>Did you know that smoking causes <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/effects_cig_smoking/index.htm#:~:text=Smoking%20causes%20about%2090%25%20(or,of%20all%20lung%20cancer%20deaths.&amp;text=More%20women%20die%20from%20lung%20cancer%20each%20year%20than%20from%20breast%20cancer.&amp;text=Smoking%20causes%20about%2080%25%20(or,obstructive%20pulmonary%20disease%20(COPD).&amp;text=Cigarette%20smoking%20increases%20risk%20for,causes%20in%20men%20and%20women." target="_blank" rel="noopener">nine</a> out of 10 of all lung cancer deaths?</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Ignoring the audience&#8217;s motivation level</h3>
<p>This mistake is about forgetting the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/01/content-marketing-funnel">sales funnel stage</a> of your target reader. Before you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/03/ad-copy-examples">write effective ad copy</a>, you need to know where they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have they already heard of your brand or product?</li>
<li>Are they ready to purchase?</li>
<li>Do they have any questions, doubts, or fears left that could hold them back from purchasing?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s a great <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/21/emotional-ad-copy-examples">example of emotional ad copy</a> that plays on the target audience&#8217;s doubt:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/emotional-ad-copy-examples-mailchimp-doubt.png" alt="emotional ad copy examples - doubt" width="426" height="755" class="wp-image-62002 aligncenter" /></p>
<p>Bottom line: You need to understand how aware, skeptical, and motivated your reader is. It helps you choose the right <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/20/copywriting-techniques">copywriting technique</a> and decide on proper calls to action for a copy.</p>
<h3>6. Weak headlines and subheads</h3>
<p>Not only is reading online <a href="http://www.entheosweb.com/content_writing/tips.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25%</a> slower than from print, but users also don&#8217;t read but scan web copy. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/05/17/how-to-write-great-headlines">Headlines</a> and subheads guide them through content and help them understand if it&#8217;s worth their time.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why a good copywriter makes these two copy elements count.</p>
<p>Stellar headlines and subheads are short, specific, and relevant to the content. The element of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotional writing</a> is also worth trying to grab attention, evoke curiosity or FOMO, and motivate users to keep reading.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/compelling-headline-example.png" alt="compelling headline example" width="720" height="310" class="size-full wp-image-70296 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/compelling-headline-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/compelling-headline-example-480x207.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/01/headline-examples">headline example</a> for a piece of content about headlines&#8230;</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weak headline:</strong><em> Headlines to Try in Blog Posts, Ads, Emails, and More</em></li>
<li><strong>Strong headline:</strong> <em>88 Headline Examples you Can&#8217;t Help But Click</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Lengthy sentences</h3>
<p>Quick question: Can you find a period in this sentence?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/copywriting-mistakes-novel.jpg" alt="novel screenshot" width="410" height="591" class=" wp-image-70298 aligncenter" /></p>
<p>Unless you&#8217;re Oksana Zabuzhko, a Ukrainian novelist and essayist practicing super long sentences in her works (the above text is hers, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Museum_of_Abandoned_Secrets" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Museum of Abandoned Secrets</em></a>; you can find its audio version in English), avoid this practice.</p>
<p>Long sentences hurt your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/04/seo-content-readability">content&#8217;s usability and readability</a>.</p>
<p>Remember that online users read only <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-little-do-users-read/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20-28%</a> of your text; focus on brevity.</p>
<h3>8. Too formal</h3>
<p>Copywriters know that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/05/conversational-tone">web writing is conversational</a>, and we speak to the audience in their language if we want to engage them.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s challenging to strike a balance between conversational and casual. Afraid of losing this balance, some authors may sound too formal. They use complex sentences, academic language as if they write college essays, etc.</p>
<p>This is a mistake. It scares the reader away. The minimum you can practice to prevent this is to insert some conversational phrases like &#8220;you see&#8221; or &#8220;can&#8217;t&#8221; instead of &#8220;cannot&#8221; into your copies.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/copywriting-formal-vs-conversational-tone.png" alt="formal vs conversational tone" width="720" height="531" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-60880" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/copywriting-formal-vs-conversational-tone.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/copywriting-formal-vs-conversational-tone-480x354.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The ideal variant is to know and follow your brand&#8217;s tone of voice.</p>
<h3>9. Too much jargon and buzzwords</h3>
<p>Even though <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2019/2019179.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">21%</a> of U.S. adults are illiterate, even those with high literacy skills won&#8217;t spend time reading your unnecessarily complex texts.</p>
<p>Niche jargon and buzzwords are a no-no when it comes to copywriting.</p>
<p>If a person has to take a dictionary to understand what you write, they&#8217;ll hardly enjoy and get engaged with your message. Readability testing tools can help you see whether you&#8217;re stuffing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/04/marketing-collateral">your marketing collateral</a> with too many overcomplicated words.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-write-copy-that-sells-HBS-easy-reading-level-1.png" alt="" width="720" height="287" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7588" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-write-copy-that-sells-HBS-easy-reading-level-1.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/how-to-write-copy-that-sells-HBS-easy-reading-level-1-480x191.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This copy is written for Harvard graduate school candidates. But does it use fancy words? Nope.</em></p>
<h3>10. Ignoring mobile copywriting</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it: Most think of web-based copywriting when seeking a content specialist for their brands. But what about <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/mobile-internet-traffic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4.32 billion</a> internet users consuming your message from mobile?</p>
<p>When writing and formatting content, it&#8217;s critical to remember such a broad audience.</p>
<p>Design it for thumb-stopping visuals, short sentences, and easy-to-read font sizes for headlines. Eliminate unnecessary words, write up-to-point subheads, and consider short paragraph lengths.</p>
<h3>11. Ignoring or overdoing SEO</h3>
<p>When writing marketing copy, it&#8217;s also worth remembering how people will find it online. <a href="https://writingbreeze.com/seo-writing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO writing</a> elements will help search engines understand the context and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google">rank your pages</a> accordingly, but it&#8217;s essential to strike a balance here.</p>
<p>Focusing too much on optimizing your copy for keywords will do more harm than good. For Google, it will look like spam; for users, it will sound awkward and unnatural to read.</p>
<h3>12. Too many modifiers</h3>
<p>Adverbs and adjectives (especially beneficial ones) are powerful copywriting instruments. The trick is to know the limit.</p>
<p>Every modifier you use in content should serve for driving it. When overused, they make your copy wordy: Users can lose the core message you communicate.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Too many:</strong><em> Add this beautiful and comfortable leather couch to your bedroom to give yourself a cozy corner to sit with a neutral yet stylish look that matches your room design </em>(six modifiers).</li>
<li><strong>Just right: </strong><em>“This comfortable leather couch has a neutral color to match your room&#8217;s design. </em>(three modifiers).</li>
</ul>
<h3>13. Too many intensifiers</h3>
<p>Intensifiers are words we use to emphasize adverbs. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with them unless they become redundant, turning your copy into balderdash.</p>
<p>When used too often, intensifiers become nothing but fillers. They seem to be what Stephen King had in mind when saying, &#8220;The road to hell is paved with adverbs.&#8221; Most are<em> -ly</em> adverbs:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/copywriting-mistakes-intensifiers.png" alt="copywriting mistakes - intensifier words to avoid" width="720" height="494" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-70299" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/copywriting-mistakes-intensifiers.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/copywriting-mistakes-intensifiers-480x329.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/articles/delete-words-phrases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>When possible, avoid such words in your content. You can always find an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/22/power-words">alternative power word</a> that sounds stronger. Thus, &#8220;critical&#8221; or &#8220;essential&#8221; looks more confident than &#8220;very important.&#8221;</p>
<h3>14. Boring words</h3>
<p>Most writers have words or phrases they use too often. (Mine are &#8220;here,&#8221; &#8220;professional,&#8221; and &#8220;when it comes to&#8221;). When overused, they make your copy monotonous and dull to read.</p>
<p>Do your best to stop overusing certain words in writing. Analyze your copy, consider repeated phrases, and grab a thesaurus to change them and make your texts more engaging.</p>
<h3>15. Weak formatting</h3>
<p>As a rule, copywriters don&#8217;t think about their texts&#8217; makeup. They follow the basic rules of web writing but ignore the <a href="https://www.advancedwebranking.com/blog/content-usability-blunders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content usability blunders</a> that can make them lose readers.</p>
<p>These blunders are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right align</li>
<li>Hard-to-see subheads</li>
<li>Wrong font size</li>
<li>Complex text structure</li>
<li>Large text fields</li>
<li>Poor color-contrast ratio</li>
<li>No paragraphs</li>
</ul>
<p>When writing, please think of how your text will look online.</p>
<p>The ideal variant would be to know beforehand where the copy will go live. A page layout will help you see the website&#8217;s typography and format your text accordingly.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/psychology-copywriting-cognitive-fluency-taxes.png" alt="" width="409" height="295" class="size-full wp-image-50647 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/psychology-copywriting-cognitive-fluency-taxes.png 409w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/psychology-copywriting-cognitive-fluency-taxes-300x216.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px" /></p>

<p>Formatting influences the reading experience and communication with the audience. Why lose readers simply because they can&#8217;t visually perceive your information?</p>
<h3>16. Wrong use of emotional triggers</h3>
<p>Copywriting is about triggering an emotional response from users, encouraging them to stay with a brand, and motivating them to act.</p>
<p>Knowing this, some authors use emotional triggers for evil, manipulating a person&#8217;s fear, uncertainty, and doubt (<a href="https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/fud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FUD</a>) in their copies. While such manipulation can be a powerful sales tool, its overdose doesn&#8217;t work for building an ongoing customer relationship.</p>

<p><span></div></div></span></p>
<h3>17. Wrong CTA, multiple CTAs, or no CTA at all</h3>
<p>While copywriters know that a call to action (CTA) is a must, some aren&#8217;t sure how to make it effective.</p>
<p>A good CTA:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creates a sense of urgency;</li>
<li>Tells the user what to do right after reading the copy;</li>
<li>Gives the user a compelling reason to take that action.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/call-to-action-examples-coschedule-lock-in.png" alt="call to action examples - lock in my free account" width="720" height="417" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-59011" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/call-to-action-examples-coschedule-lock-in.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/call-to-action-examples-coschedule-lock-in-480x278.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>A big mistake is to include several CTAs on one page, especially if they lead to different pages or ask to take a few various actions. Readers won&#8217;t understand what to do.</p>
<p>Give them the easiest possible path to the next step, and don&#8217;t limit yourself to boring &#8220;Buy now&#8221; or &#8220;Click here&#8221; options. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/13/call-to-action-examples">Get creative with a CTA text</a>, and don&#8217;t hesitate to use &#8220;I&#8221; and &#8220;me&#8221; pronouns. It makes your CTA sound more authentic and personalized.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>18. Too many colloquialisms or idioms</h3>
<p>Colloquialisms (regional phrases) and idioms can add color and personality to your writing, but too many can be distracting with business copywriting.</p>
<p>Be careful with your &#8220;cold cucumbers&#8221; or &#8220;raining cats and dogs&#8221; as not all readers will understand them and you may not be able to convey the message you intend.</p>
<h3>19. Too many features but no benefits</h3>
<p>This is a common mistake of newbie copywriters and those lacking information about the buyer persona&#8217;s needs and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/28/pain-points">pain points</a>.</p>
<p>They describe the product features but don&#8217;t tell the audience how those features can benefit them, which is critical to do in marketing messaging: You should give readers <em>a reason</em> to buy.</p>
<p>Make friends with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/21/features-vs-benefits">feature-benefit</a> writing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lead with benefits. Answer the<em> &#8220;So what?&#8221;</em> question. Explain how your product or service can improve a reader&#8217;s life if they choose it.</li>
<li>Back up the benefits with the features that make them possible. This puts the customer first and adds credibility.</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/instagram-ad-copy-examples-feature-benefit.png" alt="ad copy examples - instagram ad with feature benefit copy" width="600" height="563" class="size-full wp-image-54358 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/instagram-ad-copy-examples-feature-benefit.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/instagram-ad-copy-examples-feature-benefit-480x450.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>20. Relying on copywriting formulas too much</h3>
<p>Tons of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-write-an-ebook">copywriting</a> best practices are online for us to learn and use in texts. Based on other writers&#8217; experience, these tips are great to use as a guideline or starting point.</p>
<p>But often, these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/16/copywriting-formulas">copywriting formulas</a> are just prevalent practices that worked for someone. Who said they would work for your readers?</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>They say: Odd numbers capture more attention. <a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/articles/neuro-writing-tactics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">True</a>, but it doesn&#8217;t mean even numbers will kill your copy&#8217;s engagement.</li>
<li>They say: The word &#8220;free&#8221; is a surefire way to grab a reader. Maybe, but some people will see it as a signal of spam.</li>
<li>They say: These headline formulas work. Let it be, but those formulas won&#8217;t rock if they don&#8217;t suit your audience or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/13/content-marketing-strategy">content strategy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The point I&#8217;m trying to drive home is, it&#8217;s a mistake to believe and follow all copywriting formulas in your texts. Test them with your audience rather than assuming they will work for you because they worked for another copywriter.</p>
<h3>21. Being too salesy</h3>
<p>Online users are not naive or stupid. They understand your copy is about selling something, so they don&#8217;t need you to focus their attention on that. Too aggressive, direct selling messages in texts cause a backfire.</p>
<p>Rejection.</p>
<p>Instead, tell a story about your product, use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/03/testimonial-advertising">testimonials from satisfied customers</a>, and focus on appealing language to make the audience want what you have for them. A compelling call to action at the end of your content will be enough for readers to act.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever paid for a domain name and the registrar offered you a free SSL certificate with your purchase?</p>
<p>If the answer is &#8220;yes,&#8221; the freebie may have left you wondering what an SSL certificate is and why you need one. As you&#8217;ll soon learn, installing an SSL certificate for your website is incredibly important, especially if your site collects data from users.</p>
<p>This article will answer all your questions about SSL certificates, including the available types, why you need one, and how to install one on your website.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s jump in.</p>
<h2>What’s an SSL certificate?</h2>
<p>The “SSL” in “SSL certificate” stands for “secure sockets layer.” It’s an encryption protocol that signifies that the connection between a browser and server has a higher level of security. Translation please? Here&#8217;s the plain English version:</p>
<p>Most internet users’ activity falls into two categories when they surf the web: asking for (and receiving) information, or sending it. When they do either of these, a back-and-forth occurs between their browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.) and the server that hosts the websites they visit.</p>
<p>SSL certificates make this exchange safer. These small data files establish a security protocol between your browser and the servers they send data to and receive data from.</p>
<p>When you visit a website and want to know if it has an SSL certificate, look to your browser’s address bar. If you see a padlock icon before the site’s URL, then it has an SSL certificate.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ssl-certificate-secure-website.png" alt="what is an ssl certificate - example of secure website" width="720" height="364" class="size-full wp-image-70091 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ssl-certificate-secure-website.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ssl-certificate-secure-website-480x243.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Also, the site’s URL will begin with “https” instead of “http,” with the “s” standing for secure (it’s the secure version of hypertext transfer protocol). These two indicators point to a website that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/22/customer-data-privacy">keeps user data secure</a> (as below).</p>
<h2>What information does an SSL certificate contain?</h2>
<p>SSL certificates contain the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The domain name that the certificate is meant to protect (usually this is your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/23/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name">business name</a> or something close to it).</li>
<li>The certificate recipient (i.e., the domain owner or device the certificate was issued to).</li>
<li>Subdomains associated with the domain.</li>
<li>The certificate issuer (i.e., the Certificate Authority).</li>
<li>The certificate issuer’s digital signature.</li>
<li>The certificate’s date of issue.</li>
<li>The certificate’s expiry date.</li>
<li>The SSL certificate’s public key (which is a long text string).</li>
</ul>
<p>What are public keys? To answer that question, we’ll need to understand how SSL works.</p>
<h2>How does SSL work?</h2>
<p>In a nutshell, encryption algorithms form the backbone of SSL and SSL certificates. These algorithms ensure data transferred between a browser and server is unreadable by scrambling it during transfer.</p>
<p>Everything from names, addresses, passwords, credit card details, and other sensitive data becomes a jumbled mess of characters when sent over a secure connection. The process prevents hackers from stealing such information.</p>
<p>A typical data exchange on a secure connection goes as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your visitor&#8217;s browser attempts to connect to your secure website</li>
<li>Their browser requests the web server serving your website identify itself</li>
<li>The web server responds with a copy of your website&#8217;s SSL certificate</li>
<li>Your visitor&#8217;s browser examines the SSL certificate and decides whether to trust it or not</li>
<li>If your visitor&#8217;s browser trusts the certificate, it&#8217;ll signal its trust to the web server</li>
<li>The web server will respond by sending a signed acknowledgment to commence an encrypted session</li>
<li>The browser and server share the encrypted information</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/https/how-ssl-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>It may sound like a lot (and it is), but the entire exchange described above happens within milliseconds.</p>
<p>However, the most crucial component of the exchange is the use of SSL keys. SSL certificates have private and public keys that browsers and web servers use to encrypt and decrypt data. The transferred data is encrypted and verified using the sender’s public key.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/what-is-ssl-certificate-private-public-key.png" alt="what is an ssl certificate - private vs public key" width="720" height="352" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-70095" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/what-is-ssl-certificate-private-public-key.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/what-is-ssl-certificate-private-public-key-480x235.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>

<h2>Why are SSL certificates important?</h2>
<p>There are several reasons why your website needs an SSL certificate. The most crucial reasons include:</p>
<h3>1. Security</h3>
<p>Online businesses and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/31/basic-website">websites</a> that ask their users for their personal information need SSL certificates.</p>
<p>The web has evolved such that businesses now store sensitive information like medical records and social security details online. That data represents a treasure trove for cybercriminals and <a href="https://www.aura.com/learn/what-to-do-if-your-identity-is-stolen">identity theft</a> perpetrators hunting for websites with lax security standards. And, as the infographic below shows, it will only get worse.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/what-is-ssl-certificate-cybercrime-rate.png" alt="what is an ssl certificate - cyber crime rate" width="500" height="499" class=" wp-image-70090 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/what-is-ssl-certificate-cybercrime-rate.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/what-is-ssl-certificate-cybercrime-rate-480x479.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/28878/expected-cost-of-cybercrime-until-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>SSL certificates ensure everything from login credentials to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/03/increase-sales-online">online transactions</a> remain private and safe from spoofing, phishing, and other kinds of attacks.</p>
<p>Also, SSL certificates inspire confidence in the average internet user. When they see the padlock, it tells them they’re browsing a secure site that values sensitive customer data. In point three below, we reveal what a user sees in place of the padlock when browsing an unsecured site.</p>
<h3>2. Rank higher in search</h3>
<p>In 2014, <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google stated on its blog</a> that it would use HTTPS as a ranking signal. In other words, the search engine would begin to rank websites with SSL certificates higher on its results pages than those without.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/search-engine-optimization-seo-google-ranking-factors.png" alt="search engine optimization - google ranking factors" width="720" height="659" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-63399" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/search-engine-optimization-seo-google-ranking-factors.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/search-engine-optimization-seo-google-ranking-factors-480x439.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>SSL is a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/09/google-ranking-factors">Google ranking factor</a>.</em></p>
<p>Google’s reason for this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/12/07/google-algorithm-update">algorithm update</a> was understandable and noble: “To keep everyone safe on the web.” The search engine didn’t want to send users to unsecured and potentially harmful websites. After all, doing otherwise would impact its business long term, as users would seek out competitors whose search algorithms returned safer sites.</p>
<p>The rest, as they say, is history: As of October 2022, https is a standard security technology adopted by <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ce-httpsdefault#:~:text=80%25%20of%20all%20websites%20now,from%2022.5%25%20five%20years%20ago." target="_blank" rel="noopener">81.5%</a> of the websites on the web.</p>
<p>If your website doesn&#8217;t have an SSL certificate, it risks falling behind websites that do. And considering <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/insiders/inbound-marketing-stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">75%</a> of people never scroll past the first page of SERPs, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/06/how-to-rank-higher-on-google">the higher you rank</a>, the better.</p>

<h3>3. Improve the user experience</h3>
<p>Finally, if your website doesn&#8217;t have an SSL certificate, it’ll give visitors a bad user experience, which, as you may or may not know, is becoming <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/05/seo-trends">more and more important in SEO every year</a>.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Remember our good friend Google? It made good on its promise “to keep everyone safe on the web” in <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2018/02/a-secure-web-is-here-to-stay.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more ways</a> than one. Other than a lower search ranking, your site risks being outed as carefree about its visitors’ safety if it doesn’t have an SSL certificate.</p>
<p>As the image below shows, Google’s Chrome browser will give your site’s visitors visual cues that tell them it’s not secure.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ssl-certificate-not-secure-website.png" alt="" width="720" height="286" class="size-full wp-image-70089 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ssl-certificate-not-secure-website.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ssl-certificate-not-secure-website-480x191.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.inmotionhosting.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/website-not-secure.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>Consider this: Chrome is the most widely used of the three major browsers (the other two being Safari and Edge). The browser has an enormous <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">64.5%</a> market share, meaning most of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">site’s visitors</a> will likely use it.</p>
<p>Would you want every visitor to see that conspicuous “Not Secure” message in their browser address bar?</p>
<p>But it doesn’t end there. The message will likely spook your visitors and send them fleeing from your site, resulting in a high <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/07/reduce-bounce-rate">bounce rate</a>. A high bounce rate will mean a lower ranking, which will mean less traffic. Less traffic means you’ll have fewer visitors, which means fewer leads, and so on and so forth.</p>
<h2>Types of SSL certificates</h2>
<p>So, you know what SSL certificates are and why they’re important for your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/14/website-examples">website</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/seo">SEO</a>. Now let’s discuss the types of SSL certificates available for your website.</p>
<h3>1. Extended validation certificates (EV SSL)</h3>
<p>An extended validation certificate is the most comprehensive and expensive type of certificate you can get. While any business is free to get this certificate, it’s usually larger businesses that have them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ssl-certificate-twitter-secure-site.png" alt="what is an ssl certificate - extended validation certificate example" width="600" height="99" class="size-full wp-image-70088 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ssl-certificate-twitter-secure-site.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ssl-certificate-twitter-secure-site-480x79.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As the image above shows, this certificate displays the following information about your website in a visitor&#8217;s browser bar:</p>
<ul>
<li>A green padlock symbol that indicates your site is secure</li>
<li>Your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/08/business-name-ideas">business’s name</a></li>
<li>The country</li>
<li>https</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason this type of certificate displays so much information is because the data helps to distinguish your website from malicious sites. And if you run websites that collect user data or process plenty of online payments, you’ll probably need these premium certificates.</p>
<p>Also, you’ll need to subject yourself to a standardized verification process to get this certificate. That involves proving you’re the legal holder of the domain you submit.</p>
<h3>2. Organization-validated certificates (OV SSL)</h3>
<p>Organization-validated certificates are a rung down the SSL certificate price ladder from extended validation certificates. Like the latter certificate, you&#8217;ll need to subject yourself to a verification exercise to obtain one. And, just like EV SSL certificates, they display information about your business in your visitors’ address bars.</p>
<p>OV SSL certificates encrypt data transmitted during sensitive transactions, minimizing cybersecurity risks. While not as powerful as EV SSL certificates, they’re effective enough that commercial websites use them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/types-of-ssl-certificates.png" alt="types of ssl certificates" width="720" height="462" class="size-full wp-image-70096 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/types-of-ssl-certificates.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/types-of-ssl-certificates-480x308.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>3. Domain-validated certificates (DV SSL)</h3>
<p>Compared to OV SSL and EV SSL certificates, domain-validated certificates provide a moderate level of protection from domain attacks. The verification process isn&#8217;t as stringent, so these certificates offer basic encryption.</p>
<p>They’re inexpensive to obtain, making them perfect for websites that don’t collect data from users (e.g., blogs and information websites).</p>
<p>Domain-validated certificates don&#8217;t display as much information in your visitors&#8217; browser bar as EV SSL and OV SSL certificates. They stop short of displaying information about your business, only showing the https before your website’s URL and the padlock icon.</p>
<h3>More SSL certificate types</h3>
<p>Please note that the above three aren’t the only types of SSL certificates available. Some other certificate types include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single-domain SSL certificate: </strong>A single-domain SSL certificate provides security for one domain. It doesn’t extend protection to subdomains or additional domains. So your single-domain certificate for yourdomainname.com won’t secure your blog.yourdomainname.com subdomain or the unique additional domain yourdomainname.net.</li>
<li><strong>Wildcard SSL certificate: </strong>These certificates are a step up from single-domain SSL certificates. A wildcard SSL certificate lets you secure your main domain and multiple sub-domains. They’re excellent for securing subdomains for mail, payments, login, and so on. Naturally, they’re more expensive than single-domain SSL certificates.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-domain SSL certificate: </strong>As its name suggests, this SSL certificate secures multiple domain names and subdomains. In addition, you can secure a mix of unique domain names, including ones that end in different extensions (i.e., .com, .net, .io, .ai, etc.). They’re also called unified communications SSL certificates.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the section below, we’ll briefly discuss the determining factor for choosing a certificate type for your website and how to install one.</p>
<h2>How to install an SSL certificate</h2>
<p>By now, you should be convinced about why your website needs an SSL certificate. So how do you set one up? The process goes something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Choose your certificate: </strong>This step is easy enough as you can let the nature of your website inform your decision. A domain-validated certificate will suffice if you don&#8217;t plan to collect data from your users or accept payments online. Otherwise, you’ll need an OV SSL or EV SSL certificate (if your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/28/small-business-budget">budget</a> allows).</li>
<li><strong>Choose a certificate authority:</strong> You can&#8217;t install an SSL certificate without obtaining one first, and you&#8217;ll need to approach a Certificate Authority like DigiCert for that. You can get your certificate from a <a href="https://www.ssltrust.com.au/digicert-ssl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DigiCert reseller</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Set up your server:</strong> Ensure your WHOIS record is up to date and matches what your Certificate Authority will have on file. Also, create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) on your server, or get your hosting service provider to do it for you.</li>
<li><strong>Submit your certificate signing request:</strong> Forward your CSR to your chosen Certificate Authority for validation. The CA will perform company details and domain validation.</li>
<li><strong>Install your SSL certificate:</strong> When the CA gives your CSR the okay, you can install your SSL certificate (more below).</li>
</ol>
<p>Your SSL certificate will require configuration on your web host&#8217;s server or your personal one (i.e., if you’re self-hosting your website).</p>
<p>Also, please bear in mind that the time it takes to obtain an SSL certificate varies depending on the type of certificate you decide to get. Whereas you can obtain a domain-validated certificate in minutes, an extended-validation certificate can take as much as a week or more to acquire.</p>
<h2>Secure your website with an SSL certificate</h2>
<p>If you intend to process online payments or collect sensitive data from your users, you’ll need an SSL certificate for your website. These digital certificates are crucial because they secure your website by encrypting data sent from and to it.</p>
<p>In addition, search engines like Google use the presence or absence of an SSL certificate to determine how well your website ranks. And the absence of an SSL certificate can impact your visitors’ user experience through off-putting visual cues.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are many types of SSL certificates you can use. When choosing, use your website’s security needs as the determining factor.</p>

<h2>What is a conversion path in Google Analytics?</h2>
<p>A conversion path is a series of actions a new website visitor takes before completing a desired action on your site, also known as a conversion. This action can be a form fill, a button click, a purchase, and more.</p>
<p>For example, suppose one of the goals on your website is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/12/how-to-generate-leads">generate leads</a> through an ebook. In that case, a conversion path will illustrate a connected channel of clicks that website visitors take to submit their contact information.</p>
<p>Here’s an illustration of some common conversion paths:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conversion-paths-examples.png" alt="conversion path examples" width="486" height="310" class=" wp-image-69920 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conversion-paths-examples.png 486w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conversion-paths-examples-480x307.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 486px, 100vw" /><a href="https://www.ashokcharan.com/Marketing-Analytics/images/wa07.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p><a href="https://metabox.io/improve-website-design-better-conversion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>
<p>Conversion paths typically include a landing page, content offer, and a call to action button. You can also include <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/23/thank-you-page-examples">thank you pages</a> in your path.<br />
<a id="why"></a></p>
<h2>Why are conversion paths important?</h2>
<p><a href="https://metabox.io/improve-website-design-better-conversion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">If you want to improve conversion on your website</a>, you need to know what&#8217;s leading to those conversions. And since customers often take several actions before converting, it&#8217;s important to know the ins and outs of those behaviors.</p>
<p>Let’s dive deeper into some of the reasons why tracking conversion paths is so important for creating and maintaining a <a href="https://sixgun.com.au/the-ultimate-guide-to-recruitment-marketing/">marketing action plan</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Know what’s working and what’s not. </strong>Knowing the behavioral paths of your leads and customers helps you to identify which campaigns and touchpoints are working so you can focus your budget and resources accordingly. For instance, you may notice that more of your users’ conversion paths start from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/ppc">PPC</a> ads than your social ads so you can allocate more budget to PPC to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/09/b2b-sales-strategies">boost your sales</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Identify bottlenecks in your funnel. </strong>Conversion paths help you to see where there are leaks in your funnel. For instance, you can see if there&#8217;s a drop-off for a particular offer, perhaps due to a bug, a tracking issue, or because an improvement is needed (such as to be more mobile-friendly, to have fewer fields, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Better understand your audience. </strong>You can also get insights into factors like location, income status, and gender to get a better feel for your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience"> target audience</a>. For instance, you may notice a high cart abandonment rate among users in a particular location. You can look to see if the issue is a lack of localized payment methods, which you can improve on to better customer experience and boost conversion rates as a result.</li>
<li><strong>Simplify campaign reporting. </strong>Finally, clear conversion paths allow you to easily gather metrics across channels, which helps you analyze your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/22/cross-channel-marketing">cross-channel marketing performance</a> more accurately and boost your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/12/20/content-marketing-roi">ROI</a>.</li>

<h2>How to set up conversion paths in Google Analytics</h2>
<p>Now that you know the importance of conversion paths, it&#8217;s time to dive into how to set them up successfully in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/how-to-use-google-adwords">Google Ads</a> and Google Analytics.</p>
<h3>1. Set up your conversion tracking</h3>
<p>To make use of conversion paths in Google Analytics, you of course need to establish what your conversions are. Depending on what marketing strategies you’re using, you can do this through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/30/google-ads-conversion-tracking">Google Ads conversion tracking</a> and/or through Google Analytics goal setup.</p>
<p>In Google Ads:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Tools and settings &gt; Measurement &gt; Conversions</li>
<li>Click on +New Conversion Action.</li>
<li>Click on the Website</li>
<li>Input your website’s URL</li>
<li>Click on Scan</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conversion-paths-google-ads-conversion-tracking-setup.png" alt="google ads conversion tracking setup" width="720" height="387" class="size-full wp-image-69921 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conversion-paths-google-ads-conversion-tracking-setup.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conversion-paths-google-ads-conversion-tracking-setup-480x258.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Next, you’ll set up your Google Tag, as shown below, then input the tag name and select the destination accounts.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conversion-paths-google-ads-google-tag.png" alt="conversion paths - google ads google tag" width="720" height="359" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-69922" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conversion-paths-google-ads-google-tag.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conversion-paths-google-ads-google-tag-480x239.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Set up your goals</h3>
<p>You&#8217;ll also need to set up goals in Google Analytics. With <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/23/google-analytics-4-vs-universal-analytics">GA4</a>, this setup will be different, but for now, here&#8217;s what it looks like in Universal Analytics.</p>
<p>Click Admin on the bottom left corner.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-analytics-custom-event-tracking-admin.png" alt="" width="800" height="701" class="size-full wp-image-17376 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-analytics-custom-event-tracking-admin.png 800w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-analytics-custom-event-tracking-admin-480x421.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Click on Goals</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conversion-paths-google-analytics-goals.png" alt="google analytics conversion path goals" width="720" height="352" class="size-full wp-image-69907 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conversion-paths-google-analytics-goals.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conversion-paths-google-analytics-goals-480x235.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>After that, click on the custom option to set a new goal and add your goal description and details. Your description entails a name and goal type, as shown below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-conversion-paths-goal-setup.png" alt="google analytics conversion paths goal setup" width="720" height="514" class="size-full wp-image-69909 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-conversion-paths-goal-setup.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-conversion-paths-goal-setup-480x343.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Though there are four key types of Google Analytics goals you can choose from, your desired conversion action will determine your goal type.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Duration</strong>: These track how long users stay on your site before leaving, which you can use to track engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Destination</strong>: These goals track when a particular page loads on your site as a way to track a conversion. For example the thank you page that triggers after an email newsletter signup or a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/07/thank-you-for-your-order-messages">thank you for your order</a> page.</li>
<li><strong>Pages per visit</strong>: These goals track the number of pages web visitors navigate before leaving your site—which can also be a helpful <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/27/seo-metrics">SEO metric</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Events: </strong>These goals track user interactions that Google does not typically record, like PDF downloads, button clicks, outbound link clicks, or even downloading a pricing quote for businesses like VoIP service providers.</li>
</ul>
<p>After filling in your goal details, click on the value button to set your goal’s monetary value (we show you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/10/how-to-determine-conversion-value">how to set conversion values here</a>). Click “verify” and save.</p>
<h3>Set up an attribution project</h3>
<p>To use the conversion path report in Google Analytics, you must first create an <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/attribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Attribution project</a>. Go to Explore&gt; Conversion Paths, and then follow the prompts to set up your project.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/attribution-project-google-analytics.png" alt="google analytics new attribution project" width="720" height="479" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-69915" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/attribution-project-google-analytics.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/attribution-project-google-analytics-480x319.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Once you have your project set up, you can now create a conversion segment.</p>
<h3>Create a conversion segment</h3>
<p>Go to Conversions » Multi-Channel Funnels » Top Conversion Paths. Then click on Conversion Segments.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-conversion-segments.png" alt="conversion paths google analytics - top conversion paths" width="720" height="577" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-69918" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-conversion-segments.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-conversion-segments-480x385.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Click on Create New Conversion Segment. The new segment can define your users from a particular geographic location, who buy a particular line of products, etc.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/create-new-conversion-segment-google-analytics.png" alt="" width="720" height="352" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-69919" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/create-new-conversion-segment-google-analytics.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/create-new-conversion-segment-google-analytics-480x235.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Define and name the new conversion segment. This ensures that your Google Analytics and your Data Studio show the same reports.</p>
<p>Click Apply then Save</p>
<p>Doing this will create a new conversion segment and also apply the segment to your conversion path report.</p>
<p>Now you&#8217;re ready to go!<br />
<a id="multichannel"></a></p>
<h2>Understanding the Top Conversion Paths report</h2>
<p>With your conversion paths set up, you can now use the Multi-Channel Funnels report in Google Analytics to better understand your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/15/multi-touch-attribution">marketing attribution</a>. This report will show you which channels contributed to a conversion on your site, such as organic, direct, paid, referral, and more.</p>
<p>To view these paths, go to Conversions » Multi-Channel Funnels » Top Conversion Paths<br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-top-conversion-paths-report.png" alt="google analytics top conversion paths report" width="720" height="389" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-69913" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-top-conversion-paths-report.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-top-conversion-paths-report-480x259.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Set the date range to the last three months. Remember, the time lag to conversion can run into days or weeks, so set your date range for at least the last three months. This is also often enough time to gain actionable data.<br />
<a id="assisted"></a></p>
<h2>Understanding the Assisted Conversions report</h2>
<p>Within the same tab in Google Analytics is another <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/08/attribution-models">attribution modeling</a> tool called the Assisted Conversions report.  Assisted conversions for a given channel are all the channels that assisted or led to conversion but weren’t the final interaction.</p>
<p>For instance, say a user scans a QR code for app download but decides not to download the app immediately. Later, they download the app through a link on your social media. While the social link tap is considered the last-click conversion, your QR code played the assisted conversion role which may not be accounted for by the conversion metrics.</p>
<p>The flowchart below illustrates assisted interactions further.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-assisted-conversions.png" alt="google analytics assisted conversions" width="720" height="539" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-69912" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-assisted-conversions.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-assisted-conversions-480x359.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ceblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/23113805/assisted-conversions.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>It’s important that you understand assisted conversions to identify marketing channels that introduce customers to your product. Then you can tailor your marketing strategies to ensure you attract quality leads from these channels and boost your conversion rates.</p>
<p>By understanding assisted conversions, you can also attribute values to paths and clicks in the line that made way for the final conversion, such as referral links, ads, etc., as shown in the report below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-assisted-conversions-report.png" alt="google analytics assisted conversions report" width="720" height="344" class="size-full wp-image-69914 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-assisted-conversions-report.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-analytics-assisted-conversions-report-480x229.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Doing this not only helps you understand the role of various assisted conversion channels but also goes <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7003286?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beyond the last-click conversion</a> to provide a clear picture of your campaign performance and the general customer journey.</p>
