If your agency is one of the many that has lost clients, you need to start prospecting for new accounts to rebuild your portfolio. </span></p>

</div>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Right now, that’s easier said than done. That’s why we’ve identified three key prospecting strategies for agencies rebuilding their portfolios during the pandemic:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Focus on industries experiences increased volume</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Target specific locations</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Time your outreach with reopening or rebounding performance</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Here’s why these strategies work, plus how to get started.</span></p>
<h2>1. Focus on industries experiencing increased volume</h2>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">It’s clear that the pandemic has affected different industries to different extents. Travel and tourism, restaurants, and hospitality are verticals that have been especially hard hit and face a long road to recovery. Other verticals have been able to remain at least partially open and adapt their services to restrictions, while still others have remained steady or even experienced an uptick in demand.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">For a detailed breakdown of how various types of businesses have fared over the last couple of months, start with our blog posts on Google Ads impact and benchmarks by industry:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/18/covid-19-google-ads-data">How COVID-19 Has Impacted Google Ads Results for 21 Industries [DATA]</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/06/google-ads-benchmarks-during-covid-19">Updated Google Ads Benchmarks for Your Industry During COVID-19</a></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Focusing on the industries with increased volume and performance during COVID-19 will help you put your resources into getting new businesses that need online advertising services the most right now. Here are a few we’ve identified:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Non-profits and charities</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Health and medical</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Business management</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Finance</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Beauty and personal care</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">On-demand media</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Greetings, gifts, and flowers</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Staying up-to-date with the latest news as countries and states begin to reopen can also help to narrow down which industries to target. This <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html">interactive map from </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The New York Times</em></a><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN"> shows which states are reopening and which are still shut down, as well as state-by-state details on which types of businesses are open or restricted. </span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Let’s take the beauty and personal care industry as an example. This industry showed up on our list of industries with increased performance on Google Ads during the initial weeks of COVID-19. Scanning the details of states who are allowing certain businesses to reopen, those in the personal care category are among the first to have restrictions lifted. This indicates an opportunity for beauty and personal care businesses to have success with online advertising, and they provide some clear benefits as clients for you as an agency:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Demand: </span></strong><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">These businesses are among the first businesses to have restrictions lifted in many states, and people are excited to return to the sense of normalcy that personal care services provide. </span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Omnipresent:</span></strong><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN"> This business type is found everywhere, and nearly everyone interacts with them in some capacity. </span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Repeatable:</span></strong><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN"> Advertising strategies for this type of business should translate well across geos, meaning you can develop verticalized expertise as an agency and employ the strategies that worked for one client for others in non-competing locations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">While it may not be a vertical that your agency usually specializes in, these unprecedented times call for adaptability. So leverage WordStream’s industry data and your online advertising expertise and put together a comprehensive, winning proposal that is customized to any prospect’s vertical. And be sure to fully <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/18/post-covid-19-customers">get to know your post-COVID-19 customer personas</a>, as they have most certainly changed.</span></p>
<h2>2. Target specific locations</h2>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">COVID-19 has impacted the entire world, but various countries and regions have differed in their responses and, especially, in their plans to reopen. This means that two businesses in the same industry but located in two different states, for example, may find themselves in very different positions in the coming weeks and months. While you’re <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/26/prospecting-strategies-ppc-agencies">prospecting</a><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN"> now, try targeting specific locations with higher demands.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/">Google Trends</a><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN"> is a fantastic (and free!) tool that provides insight into exactly how various search terms are trending in different geographic areas. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Sticking with our beauty and personal care example that we identified as an industry with potential in the previous section, let’s analyze a high intent search term that is indicative of opportunity for those businesses. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Searches for “salon near me” show only a modest increase in recent volume across the United States:</span></p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="3d70d048-ba6c-47e8-bd21-16e042967bde" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/prospecting-strategies-during-covid-19-salon-near-me-us.jpg" width="762" height="404" alt="&quot;salon near me&quot; in US" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">However, digging down to the state level reveals a much stronger rebound in certain states. In Colorado, for example, where personal care services were allowed to reopen within the past couple of weeks, search volume for the same “salon near me” query has spiked to nearly the highest level of any point in the past year:</span></p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="9cd3ee0d-fbc8-46d2-b078-bb5720e6154c" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/prospecting-strategies-during-covid-19-salon-near-me-co.jpg" width="756" height="400" alt="&quot;salon near me&quot; in Colorado" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">As an agency, this information can not only help you identify prospects to reach out to, but it can also help you make a compelling case to any beauty and personal care business in states that show a similar trend that a huge amount of demand exists for their services at the moment.</span></p>
<h2>3. Time your outreach with reopening or rebounding performance</h2>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">As you approach prospects to present the online advertising opportunities you see for them, the timing of any reopening measures in their region is one important factor to consider. You can also take a longer-term approach to this and incorporate seasonality into your pitch. Recent months have made it difficult to think of anything other than the here and now, but looking a bit farther down the road can help you demonstrate lasting value to your prospects. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Let’s shift our example for this section to the more seasonal business of landscaping. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Home improvement was a sector that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/18/covid-19-google-ads-data">showed mixed results</a><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN"> early on in the COVID-19 outbreak, but it was also at a natural seasonal low in March. As landscaping services have come into season, and people have been stuck at home with time to focus on household projects, Google Trends shows the same peak in search volume for these services that occurred at the same time last year.</span></span></p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="24bae739-73c1-4252-a7ec-3327cea924ad" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/prospecting-strategies-during-covid-19-landscaping-services.jpg" width="758" height="402" alt="&quot;landscaping services&quot; search trend" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">This type of business checks the same boxes as beauty and personal care businesses: There’s demand, it’s omnipresent, and your strategies would be repeatable. Furthermore, seasonal services like leaf removal will spike later in the year, when the economy will have hopefully recovered to a greater degree.</span></p>
<div data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="00a1d0d7-eaff-4418-b352-0e1aef6a2a46" data-langcode="en" class="embedded-entity align-center">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/prospecting-strategies-during-covid-19-leaf-removal-services.jpg" width="754" height="398" alt="&quot;leaf removal services&quot; search trend" typeof="foaf:Image" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Rather than pitching prospects solely on urgent actions that need to be taken right away in their accounts, you can line up longer-term value by presenting a seasonal plan and use downtimes to get campaigns set up so that they’re ready to go as soon as their high season hits. </span></p>
<h4><em>Looking for more ways to market after the peak of the pandemic? Check out these <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/27/post-pandemic-marketing-strategies">post-pandemic marketing strategies</a> that will help you to yield long-term gains.</em></h4>
<h4>Follow up with your proposal</h4>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">This isn’t a strategy, but it is something we need to talk about when we’re talking about prospecting. After all, your proposal is one of your best tools to sign your client. The best proposals always include a detailed analysis of your prospect’s advertising accounts with clear information about how your agency can help improve this performance.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Now, it’s important to also make sure to address current industry trends, like we talked through above.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">For WordStream customers, the New Business Center will help you create a customized proposal (which can be white-labeled) in minutes. Our tool provides projections for three budget tiers (which can be edited) with impression, click, and cost-per-click estimates for each. Using our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/06/google-ads-benchmarks-during-covid-19">industry benchmarks</a><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN"> for conversion rate allows the tool to generate conversion estimates, as well. And metrics for the proposal are pulled in real-time, so they reflect the current climate and any changes to paid search benchmarks that have occurred as a result of COVID-19, seasonality, or any other factors. </span></span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">So whether you’re using the New Business Center or creating your own, you should <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/19/using-proposals-as-a-sales-tool">use your proposals as a sales tool</a><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN"> and make sure that it’s up-to-date during COVID-19.</span></span></p>
<h2>Use these prospecting strategies now</h2>
<p><span lang="EN" xml_lang="EN">Hopefully these strategies will help you to <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/28/resilient-digital-agencies-2020">maintain resiliency in the face of 2020&#8217;s challenges</a>. By taking a targeted approach to industries and businesses that are stable or experiencing increased volume, keeping up-to-date on changes to trends, and producing a high volume of high-quality proposals, you can keep your agency’s pipeline fresh and establish a client base that will help you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/01/small-agency-strategies-during-covid-19">stay afloat during COVID-19</a>, and emerge from this struggle even stronger than before. </span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN">As the world grapples to contain and bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses are beginning to reopen, and we&#8217;re seeing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/05/04/ppc-rebound-covid-19-data">signs of a rebound in online advertising</a><span lang="EN">. For digital marketing agencies, this likely means that your clients—who may have significantly reduced spend in their accounts or paused their campaigns entirely—should begin to think about ramping back up.</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Knowing <em>how</em> to ramp up that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/05/06/google-ads-account-recovery">Google Ads account</a><span lang="EN"> is the first step. For agencies, however, the know-how is only half the battle. Clients are understandably shaken by the economic impact of COVID-19, and the instinct to tighten purse strings on their advertising budgets is natural. So, communication around the reasons (and opportunities) for reactivating ads when the time is right is both a sensitive subject and incredibly important to your relationship. </span></span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="c1981a00-de11-4b90-a7b8-696dec3599c8" data-langcode="en">

</div>
<p><span lang="EN">So whether you’re looking for guidance for challenging client conversations or a place to start with your entire portfolio, we&#8217;re here to help. Here are the five fundamental, data-backed talking points that we’ve found to be effective when guiding our own clients through COVID-19.  </span></p>
<h2>1. Review paid search conversions data</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">This point is quick, but it’s important because it’s a good reason to start having these conversations with your clients now. The drop-off in overall keyword searches and conversion rates in late March and early April was dramatic, but so was the rebound in late April. In fact, by the second half of the month, conversion volume on Google search had returned to nearly <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/05/04/ppc-rebound-covid-19-data">90% of its pre-COVID level</a><span lang="EN">. </span></span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="4535e0bc-2acd-4591-9ea1-957e686333e6" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/covid-19-ppc-campaign-rebound-conversions.jpg" alt="COVID-19 rebound: conversions graph" width="776" height="436" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">This means that opportunity exists for your clients, and this opportunity is especially compelling when presented alongside the fact that many of their competitors may still not be advertising as aggressively as they were before the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">That brings us to our next point. </span></p>
<h2>2. Check Auction Insights for competitive analysis</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Overall trends are a great starting point, but what clients really care about (and rightfully so) is their own specific situation. <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2579754?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s Auction Insights</a><span lang="EN"> have always provided invaluable competitive insight, but they are now more useful than ever in their ability to show clear opportunity if competitors have scaled down or paused their advertising efforts outright. </span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Start by showing clients their Auction Insights from a period of time pre-COVID. Here’s an example of an account’s impression share compared to competitors in February and early March:</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="ac20f43c-4f53-424f-b6af-0b70e9a201c8" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/client-communication-during-covid-19-auction-insight-february.jpg" alt="Auction Insights Feb-March" width="622" height="481" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Next, compare this to more recent data that reflects the impact of COVID. Here’s that same account’s impression share compared to competitors from April 1 to May 18:</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="310057e1-c139-4045-8cdd-5825c9c0afe3" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/client-communication-during-covid-19-auction-insight-april.jpg" alt="Auction Insights April-May" width="652" height="506" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">In this case, the account’s primary competitor has nearly dropped off the map entirely, and as a result, the account’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/07/26/search-impression-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impression share</a> has shot up—even while spending significantly less than before. If you can find a similar example in your client’s account, it paints a clear picture that ramping up spend or reactivating certain campaigns is in their best interest.</span></p>
<h2>3. Walk your client through strategy changes for account reactivation</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Change has always been a constant in the world of online advertising, and keeping up with change is always a challenge. But over the past few months, changes to online behavior has accelerated in pace with the other large-scale changes. Keeping up is a nearly impossible challenge—and that’s on top of all the other challenges of living through a pandemic. It can seem safer or simpler for clients to stop spending money on ads and avoid that challenge entirely right now. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">That’s where you come in. As an agency, you are your clients’ expert guide to navigating these changes and employing strategies that will make their advertising effective at growing their business. This talking point will need to be the most detailed and perhaps the biggest conversation, so we’re going to give you more to work with. Here are some key strategies to discuss with clients, showing them that you’re up-to-date and can keep their account that way, too. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">On a related note, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/18/post-covid-19-customers">here are some ways to get to know your post-pandemic customers</a>, because they have certainly changed, too.</span></p>
<h3>Use Google Trends to research changes in search terms</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">For clients in many industries, search terms related to their products and services may have changed significantly as a result of the pandemic. <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Trends</a><span lang="EN"> can provide this insight for you, allowing you to view the relative volume of your clients’ core keywords and test them against other search terms that may have become more popular by comparison. </span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Here are a couple of examples that show major shifts in search terms related to the restaurant and fitness industries.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">This tool can also drill down to the state level, so you can view trends for your clients’ geographic area. Test some core keywords against any new search terms that might be relevant for your client’s business. Then, when discussing their account with them, it’ll be clear that you’ve already identified traffic changes and are ready to help them adapt.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">For national advertisers, viewing these trends at a regional level is especially important, because different parts of their target market will experience an increase in search volume at different times. <a href="https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s Community Mobility Reports</a><span lang="EN"> show detailed data on movement trends at a regional level, providing a clear view of when people in various geographies are returning to more normal levels of activity, and when it will make sense to reactivate advertising campaigns targeting those areas. </span></span></p>

<h3>Shift focus to social, display, and any top-of-funnel campaign types</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Search ads are not the only way for your clients to reach their target customers online, and some recent trends indicate that this might be the right time to explore other types of ads. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_news/Facebook-Reports-First-Quarter-2020-Results-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook’s Q1 2020 report</a> <span lang="EN">shows that more people than ever are using social media during COVID-19, and as a result the platform has reached a new record high in terms of monthly active users. At the same time, the cost of Facebook advertising has declined during the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Similarly, ad traffic on Google display, YouTube and shopping increased significantly in April, while Google search traffic was still depressed. </span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0fbbb093-5083-428e-96fe-09b02ef63184" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/covid-19-ppc-campaign-rebound-ad-traffic.jpg" alt="ad traffic during COVID-19 ppc reboudn" width="788" height="475" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Even if your clients aren’t seeing the same volume of traffic or conversions they’re accustomed to with Google search, maintaining their online presence via these more visual, top-of-funnel campaign types is a fantastic way to stay in front of their target audience, which is online now more than ever.</span></p>
<h3>Review ad copy (and extensions) for relevance</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Before reactivating a client’s campaigns, a full review of ad copy and associated ad extensions is critical. While ads cannot speak directly about COVID-19 (this will result in disapprovals with Google), they should highlight any unique <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">value propositions</a><span lang="EN"> the business is offering during the pandemic (such as a shift from in-person to virtual services). Ensure all messaging in existing ads is still relevant and up-to-date. </span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7506719?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Callout extensions</a><span lang="EN"> are a great way to highlight quick bits of information that show your client’s business is staying with the times. Think along the lines of “High Sanitation Standards” for any home services business that requires employees to visit customers’ homes.  Clickable <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2375416?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sitelink extensions</a><span lang="EN"> can also direct traffic to pages on the client’s website that cover safety protocols or changes to the business’s operations due to COVID. </span></span></p>
<h3>Ensure client’s website speaks to COVID-19 circumstances</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">As you begin driving traffic to a client’s landing pages through paid ads, make sure they are acknowledging the COVID-19 situation in some way on their website. Some businesses have created dedicated pages on their site to address how their business is <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/02/marketing-during-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">operating during the crisis</a>, while others employ banners or blurbs on their homepages. The most important thing is simply that they acknowledge the situation in some way and speak to any changes to their business operation or safety protocol as a result. At this point, a website that does not share any information about the impact of COVID-19 makes the business appear disconnected and outdated—or, worse, out of business. </span></p>
<h3>Employ the 80/20 rule</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">The famous <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2016/03/07/80-20-rule/#5bd456003814" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80/20 rule</a><span lang="EN"> is often applied to all sorts of business cases, and this is a great time to remember it. Review past performance of your client accounts, and focus on the campaigns, ad groups, and keywords that drove the best results historically. Focus on reactivating the top 20% and ignore the rest. Clients will feel more comfortable knowing that you’re taking a smart, tempered approach to their reactivation, and sticking with the top performing components of their account will put them in the best position to see good results.</span></span></p>
<h3>Stay up-to-date with reopening in key areas</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">As countries and states reopen different businesses at different times, staying current with each client’s industry and geographic status is vital to know when you can make a strong case for ramping their advertising back up. This <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interactive map from <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em></a><span lang="EN"> not only shows which states have reopened but also provides specific details as to which types of businesses can operate.</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Again, leverage Google Trends to ground your case in data. A search for certain businesses, such as those in the beauty and personal care industry, may reveal only a slight uptick across the United States.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">Viewing the same search at the state-level in a state where those businesses have been allowed to reopen, however, may show a much stronger resurgence.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">Knowing any restrictions your client businesses face, and when those restrictions are lifted, ensures that you can present a reactivation strategy at the right time.</span></p>
<h2>4. Find out if your client is eligible for any credits</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Providing your clients with expert guidance and maximizing their return on ad spend is nearly as good as it gets … but <em>nothing </em>beats free ads. That’s exactly what some ad platforms are offering to help <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/01/small-agency-strategies-during-covid-19">businesses survive COVID-19</a>, and helping your clients obtain these offers will go a long way during this challenging time. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Google Ads credits for SMBs: </span></strong><span lang="EN">Google is leading the charge with $340 million in ad credits for SMBs. Eligible advertisers who spent on ads in at least 10 out of 12 months in 2019, as well as January and/or February of 2020, will see this credit appear in their account sometime in late May or the following months. Read up on the eligibility requirements and other details on <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9803410?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s FAQ page</a><span lang="EN">. </span></span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Free shopping listings on Google: </span></strong><span lang="EN">For ecommerce advertisers, Google is also providing free Shopping listings to help retailers capitalize on the increase in online shopping that has occurred during the pandemic. Review <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/22/free-google-shopping-listings">our blog post on this announcement</a><span lang="EN"> not only for details about the free offer but also for guidance on starting and optimizing Google Shopping listings.</span></span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">Facebook small business grants: </span></strong><span lang="EN">Facebook announced its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/boost/grants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small business grant program</a><span lang="EN"> in late March, and the application for the United States has since closed. Their page states that they are “still working through eligibility details” for other countries, so this is worth keeping an eye on. The page also promises new resources coming soon for businesses that were not able to obtain a grant in the first round of applications. </span></span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span lang="EN">5. <span lang="EN">Set proper expectations for the reactivation period</span></span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN">As your clients become ready to reactivate their advertising, it’s important to set the expectation that performance will not immediately pick up where it left off. Their online advertising landscape has almost definitely changed, and their account will need to adapt to those changes. One of the most important things you need to do is to <strong>advise your clients that there will be a </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/09/13/learning-period"><strong>learning period</strong></a><span lang="EN">. Any time an account experiences significant changes, it will take time for the ad platform’s algorithms to adjust to things, such as bidding strategy and campaign structure. </span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Here are three other ways you can set expectations for your clients.</span></p>
<h3>Evaluate current search volume and compare to pre-COVID levels</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Use Google trends to determine how current search volume on your client’s core keywords compares to the same time period last year, and set expectations accordingly. There simply may not be as much available, or the nature of those searches may have changed (as mentioned above), so be sure to keep their expectations in line with these developments.</span></p>
<h3>Highlight current metrics with WordStream’s New Business Center</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">While <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/27/agency-new-business-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordStream’s New Business Center</a> <span lang="EN">is primarily used for generating proposals to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/05/27/prospecting-strategies-during-covid-19">pitch prospective clients</a>, you can also use this tool to estimate traffic and conversion volume for your current accounts. </span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">The New Business Center pulls real-time data for its impression, click, and CPC estimates, as well as its industry benchmarks. That means it will reflect the current climate and help you provide clients with foresight as to how traffic volume and click prices have changed in their industry and location. </span></p>

<h3>Assure clients you will be monitoring their account closely as it reactivates</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Clients may be a bit nervous about reinvesting in advertising, and who can blame them? The last couple of months have been the strangest most of us have ever lived through, and the global uncertainty is unprecedented. Knowing that you’ll be <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/17/agency-tools-during-covid-19">monitoring their account daily</a> (as well as the changing trends in their industry, location and paid advertising overall) should help to put their mind at ease. </span></p>
<h2>Communicating with your clients is key</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">As an agency, it has never been more important to position yourself as the expert your clients can turn to for a wise investment of their ad spend and the growth of their business. By following these strategies—and keeping clients informed of them along the way—they should have full confidence in you to help them navigate the uncertainty, ramp their account back up and take advantage of the opportunity that exists. </span></p>

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/homer-simpson-pie.png" alt="adwords search impression share" width="512" height="765" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>That mantra holds up whether we’re talking about dessert or the <a href="/articles/what-is-google-adwords">Google Ads auction</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords) version of this proverb, the “pie” is the total amount of search queries where an advertiser wants to show their ads. If that advertiser’s ad gets an impression every single time a relevant search happens, they’re enjoying the entire pie. More likely, their ads will show for a smaller percentage of that total number of possible impressions.</p>
<p>Lucky for us as advertisers, Google provides a metric designed specifically to estimate how much of the pie we’re getting and why we’re missing out on the rest. That metric is Search <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/07/impression-share">Impression Share</a>.</p>
<p>By definition, impression share is the percentage of impressions that your ads receive compared to the total number of impressions that your ads are eligible to get.</p>
<p><strong>Impression Share = actual impressions / total eligible impressions</strong></p>
<p>That eligibility is determined by the <a href="/keywords?dt=1">keywords</a> you’re bidding on, as well as settings such as <a href="/blog/ws/2017/07/24/local-marketing-tips">location targeting and ad scheduling</a> that determine the extent to which your ads can show.</p>
<h2>The Importance of Impression Share</h2>
<p>So why is this metric important? It’s the perfect tool to identify missed opportunities within your account. While most of the metrics Google gives us in Google Ads help to gauge <a href="/google-adwords">how our campaigns are performing currently</a>, impression share tells us how much more we <em>could</em> do.</p>
<p>I always stress that impression share is not a “good vs. bad” type of metric, the way something like Quality Score can be evaluated. Instead, it’s all about identifying opportunity. A low search impression share isn’t necessarily a bad thing; it simply means that a campaign has a lot of opportunity remaining.</p>
<p>For that reason, impression share is a metric to pay attention to once a campaign is well optimized and returning a profitable <a href="/blog/ws/2016/02/29/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks">cost-per-conversion</a>. You shouldn’t worry about impression share when your campaign is in its infancy, casting a wide net with general keywords. Wait until you’ve tightened things up, and then use impression share to scale your success.</p>
<h2>Analyzing Your Google Ads Impression Share</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s how you go about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/01/24/analyzing-google-adwords-ads">analyzing your Google Ads</a> impression share. WordStream displays impression share in a colorful column on the Campaigns tab:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="c52bf9b6-6ee1-4d52-9cdf-4b2ac9b90ccd" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Each campaign will show a Recent Impression Share status ranging from Very Low to Very High. Clicking on that status will open a bar graph that can be viewed in a Daily, Weekly or Monthly view.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="825c8178-7296-489f-9533-8d5b7f01686d" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>The green portion represents the percentage of eligible impressions your ads in the selected campaign are getting. The rest of the bar represents impression share lost. Those impressions are being lost for one of two reasons: low ad rank (yellow) or budget restrictions (blue).</p>
<p>So, that’s great – now you know how much of the pie your campaigns are getting, and why they’re losing out on the rest. But what can you do about it?</p>
<p>The actions you can take to increase impression share depend upon the reason you’re losing that share. Let’s dive into each of those two reasons separately.</p>
<h2>Search Impression Share Lost to Ad Rank</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="d6abc762-df45-472f-8647-1a37fe4e6c52" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ws-impression-share-lost-to-rank.png" alt="impression share lost to rank" width="1289" height="612" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>When your campaign is losing impression share to ad rank, it means that your keywords are entering the auction with an ad rank that isn’t high enough to win you an impression some percentage of the time. Google uses the following formula to calculate ad rank:</p>
<p><strong>Ad Rank = Max CPC Bid x Quality Score</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, there are two levers we can pull to increase impression share when it is being lost to low ad rank.</p>
<p>1) <strong>Increase Max CPC bids.</strong> This is the quick and dirty way to improve your ad rank and get a higher impression share. By simply increasing your Max CPC bids, you’ll improve your ad rank by telling Google you’re willing to pay more per click. If your keywords already have a good Quality Score but are getting few impressions and/or a low average position, that’s a good indication that raising your bids is necessary to maximize their performance.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Improve Quality Score.</strong> This is the more cost-effective way to improve ad rank and thereby increase impression share. If you can boost your keyword’s Quality Score, you’ll be able to achieve a higher ad rank without having to spend more money. Look for opportunities to split your ad groups into smaller, more tightly-themed groups of keywords so that you can write <a href="/blog/ws/2016/12/13/expanded-text-ads-deadly-sins">more relevant Expanded Text Ads</a> and landing page copy. Ensure that you are utilizing ad extensions, as those will contribute to a higher click-through rate which in turn will improve your Quality Score.</p>
<p>Keep a close eye on your impression share graphs as you make these adjustments to your bids and optimize for Quality Score. If your changes are having the desired effect, you should see a decrease in the yellow portions of those graphs and an increase in the green.</p>
<h2>Search Impression Share Lost to Budget</h2>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="6e22dd5a-d548-49fa-af1b-67f666d28858" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/impression-share-lost-to-budget-ws.png" alt="impression share lost to budget" width="1281" height="605" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Impression share lost to budget is more self-explanatory. In this case, your keywords are eligible for additional impressions that you currently aren’t getting because the budget you have allocated to your campaigns is running out. Give those campaigns more budget to work with, and they’ll reward you with a higher volume of impressions.</p>
<p>Once again, the quick and dirty way to increase impression share when you’re losing to budget is to simply throw more money at it. However, that might not be the only (or best) solution.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="0cd8245b-2b86-479b-83d8-570beef04e43" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/throw-money.png" alt="throw money at the problem" width="600" height="700" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>Here are a few other strategies to try.</p>
<h3>Audit your keywords</h3>
<p>The first course of action when a campaign is losing impression share to budget should be to audit its keywords. Watch out for broad match keywords, single-word keywords and overly general keywords, as these may be eligible for a wide array of impressions that you don’t even want. Tightening up your keywords with more restrictive match types and longer-tailed, more specific terms can make your campaign more efficient and achieve a higher impression share without needing to increase your budget.</p>
<h3>Check average position</h3>
<p>Second, evaluate your keywords’ average position. If you’re consistently showing up near the top of the page, you have an opportunity to decrease your Max CPC bids. While this may mean that you show up in a slightly lower average position, it’ll also result in a lower average cost-per-click. That will allow you to get more clicks within your existing budget, maximizing search impression share without having to pay more for it.</p>
<h3>Work on Quality Score</h3>
<p>I mentioned Quality Score optimization as a way to increase impression share when it’s being lost to ad rank, and the same strategy applies for impression share lost to budget. Improving QS means you can achieve the same ad rank at a lower Max CPC bid, allowing you to <a href="/blog/ws/2016/09/14/adwords-budget-guide">stretch your budget farther</a> without actually increasing it.</p>
<h3>Last resort…</h3>
<p>Finally, if you’ve looked for these opportunities and your campaign is optimized but still losing impression share to budget, simply increasing your daily budget will allow you to scale it. A campaign that is returning conversions at a profitable cost while losing impression share to budget indicates clear opportunity to bring in more conversions at the same cost per acquisition when its budget is increased.</p>
<h2>Search Impression Share is High or Very High…Now What?</h2>
<p>Once you achieve a High or even Very High search impression share on a campaign, its graph will show a whole lot of green.</p>

</div>
<p>This means that for the vast majority of searches your target audience is performing on your keywords, your ad is showing up. Fantastic!</p>
<p>But…now what? Does this mean you’ve tapped out the potential of paid search and reached the limit of what it can provide?</p>
<p>Of course not! If your campaign has reached a high search impression share, it’s time to think about expanding.</p>
<p>This could mean doing additional keyword research to discover new ad group and keyword concepts to test in your campaign. You could even try running a broad match keyword for a while to expand your reach, which can clue you into quality search queries you may not have come across in your keyword research. (P.S. <a href="/blog/ws/2017/06/27/new-free-keyword-tool">Have you tried our new keyword tool yet?</a>)</p>
<p>Expansion may also mean trying out some new advertising platforms, like <a href="/blog/ws/2015/02/25/bings-ads-vs-google-adwords">Bing</a> or <a href="/blog/ws/2017/04/18/facebook-advertising-features">Facebook</a>. If you’re maximizing the search impression share on an Google Ads campaign, importing it into Bing Ads could be a great way to keep growing your business.</p>
<p>So, check out the recent impression share for your campaigns, and find out where the opportunity lies. Google will supply the pie – it’s up to you how big of a piece you can get!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most common questions we see here at WordStream is, “How do I structure my account?” so today, we’re going to lay it out for you. This is the last guide to structuring a Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords) account you’ll ever need!</p>
<p>Building a successful Google Ads account is a lot like building a house – whether you’re starting with an empty lot and building from the ground up, or renovating an old dump of an account that’s falling apart. (Sometimes, you inherit a campaign that’s so irreparably damaged, it’s better to just tear it down and start over.)</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/broken-bridge.png" alt="adwords account structure guide" width="750" height="386" /></div>
<p>In this guide, we’ll cover the basics of building out an awesome Google Ads account structure in five parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Campaign Level: Laying the Foundation</li>
<li>The Ad Group Level: Building Your House</li>
<li>Keyword Selection: Interior Decorating</li>
<li>Ad Copy: Exterior Design</li>
<li>Ad Extensions: Adding a Backyard Pool</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, you’ll have a beautiful <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/10/google-ads-account-structure">Google Ads campaign structure</a> that looks like this:</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-ads-account-structure-19.png" alt="Google Ads account structure overview" width="800" height="424" /></div>
<p>Let’s get to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Google Ads Campaign Structure: Laying the Foundation</h2>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-ads-account-structure-04.png" alt="Google Ads account structure campaigns" width="806" height="432" /></div>
<h3>Campaign type &amp; settings</h3>
<p>First, you need to lay a solid foundation for the rest of your account. Start by choosing your tools, i.e. your campaign type. Ask yourself, what is your advertising goal? The right campaign type for your business depends on your answer.</p>
<p>Most businesses will want to start with a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/09/google-ads-campaign">search campaign</a>, but if you’re primarily looking to generate calls (if, say, you’re an emergency plumber), a <a href="/blog/ws/2015/11/11/call-only-campaigns">call-only campaign</a> is the right choice. If you’re trying to generate awareness for a completely new brand/product, <a href="/blog/ws/2014/11/18/google-display-network-tips">display campaigns</a> are a great option. You can also create multiple campaign types to satisfy multiple goals.</p>
<p>The next step is planning your blueprint, depending on what kind of business you’re running. In other words, how is your <em>business</em> structured?</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/business-goals-adwords-campaign-types-chart-2.png" alt="campaign goals in adwords" width="717" height="248" /></div>
<p>When those decisions are made, it’s time to consider your campaign settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Location Targeting</li>
<li>Language Targeting &#8211; Any language customers speak</li>
<li>Bid Strategy &#8211; Automatic vs. Manual</li>
<li>Budget</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to set your campaign budget</h3>
<p>Where to start? First, you need to know how Google spends your money. Your monthly budget is your daily budget x 30.4. So, start with a monthly budget and work backwards (divide by 30.4). Consider: Based on your estimated CPC (cost per click), how many clicks per day can your budget support?</p>

<h2>The Ad Group Level: Building Your House</h2>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-ads-account-structure-03.png" alt="Google Ads account structure ad group level" width="806" height="432" /></div>
<h3>What do ad groups accomplish?</h3>
<p>The level below campaigns in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/02/google-adwords-rehab-facilities">Google Ads</a> account structure consists of your ad groups. Ad groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create the structure within each campaign</li>
<li>Are organized by <em>theme</em></li>
<li>Control keyword/ad association</li>
</ul>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adwords-ad-group-structure-guide.png" alt="what do ad groups do" width="421" height="511" /></div>
<h3>The golden ratios of ad groups</h3>
<p>How big should an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/03/the-case-against-skags">ad group</a> be? Here are some guidelines to follow when determining the size of your ad groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Max of 7-10 ad groups per campaign</li>
<li>Max of ~20 keywords per ad group</li>
<li>2-3 ads per ad group</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there will be exceptions to these rules, but for most businesses, these are solid guidelines to make sure your ad groups don’t get bloated and difficult to manage.</p>

<h2>Keyword Selection: Decorating Your House</h2>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/keyword-selection-interior-decor-compressor.png" alt="AdWords Account Structure" width="1030" height="584" /></div>
<p>Now it’s time to define your keywords, the level under your ad groups.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/keyword-level-last-account-structure-guide-2.png" alt="keyword research for ppc" width="489" height="436" /></div>
<p>Don’t rely on your instincts here – use keyword tools to do your keyword research so you’ll know for sure that you’re bidding on keywords with <a href="/blog/ws/2017/01/23/keyword-search-volume">search volume</a>. Google Ads Keyword Planner is available within<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/14/adwords-gdpr"> your Google Ads account</a>, and you can also use <a href="/free-keyword-tools">free keyword tools</a> or third-party paid options like SEM Rush.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/justin-bieber-intent-compressor.png" alt="AdWords Account Structure" width="502" height="362" /></div>
<p>They key to great keyword research is <em>intent</em>. You want to choose keywords that have clear <a href="/blog/ws/2014/06/30/commercial-intent-keywords">commercial intent</a>, meaning that people who search using those terms are looking to buy something. Keywords with intent often include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Qualifying terms such as specific product details, brand names, the word “cost,” etc.</li>
<li>Location terms (e.g. “used cars seattle”)</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally speaking, very broad terms don’t show much intent, and can have very low click-through and conversion rates, and <a href="/cost-per-action">high CPA’s</a>.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/keyword-intent-demonstration.png" alt="adwords keyword intent" width="1105" height="413" /></div>
<h3>Keyword match types</h3>
<p>Keyword match types are a way of defining how the keywords in your campaign can match up with the queries people search on Google. There are four keyword match types to choose from, show below from least to most restrictive:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Broad match:</strong> Your ad may match to any generally related search, including synonyms. For example, if you bid with broad match on “laptop case,” your ad might show when someone searches for “computer bags.”</li>
<li><strong>Modified broad match:</strong> This match type is a little more restrictive; your ad will only match when the search term includes words that you designate with a plus sign. However, the words can be in any order. <a href="/blog/ws/2010/08/18/modified-broad-match">More on this match type here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Phrase match:</strong> The keyword must include the terms you’re bidding on uninterrupted and in order, but may include other terms before or after.</li>
<li><strong>Exact match:</strong> Self-explanatory … right?</li>
</ul>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/trump-wrong.png" alt="wrong" width="717" height="585" /></div>
<p>Google recently announced <a href="/blog/ws/2017/03/20/exact-match-keywords">some changes to the way exact match keywords work</a>. The upshot: exact match keywords aren’t so exact anymore, and your ad may show when the terms in your keyword are reordered or the “function words” change, as in the examples shown below:</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-adwords-exact-match-keyword-change-examples-compressor.png" alt="AdWords Account Structure" width="640" height="300" /></div>
<p><a href="/blog/ws/2017/04/12/exact-match-keyword-change-data">What’s the impact of this change?</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Better for low-volume terms/niche industries</li>
<li>Not so good for Branded campaigns</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example: the brand term HomeRate Mortgage now matches the non-branded search “home mortgage rates.”</p>
<p>So what’s the best match type?</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/modified-broad-is-king.png" alt="modified broad match is king" width="360" height="449" /></div>
<p>As always, it depends on your account goals, but my personal opinion is that modified broad is king:</p>
<ul>
<li>Casts a wide net not limited by order or use of additional terms</li>
<li>Restrictive enough to stay relevant</li>
<li>Use 2-3 term keywords</li>
<li>Avoid single-term keywords</li>
</ul>
<h3>Max CPC bids</h3>
<p>The next piece of the keyword puzzle is setting max CPC bids. This tells Google how much you’re willing to pay for a click. Your Ad Rank is then determined by your Max CPC bid multiplied by your Quality Score. It determines your ad position and your cost per click.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hacking-adwords-how-quality-score-impacts-cpc-2.png" alt="Quality Score Impact" width="525" height="336" /></div>
<p>Much like your budget, the question when it comes to Max CPC bids for a new campaign is “Where should I start?” There are a couple of good ways to determine this.</p>
<h4>Option 1: Automatic Bidding</h4>
<p>Most of us at WordStream preach the value of Manual bidding over Automatic, because it gives you control over your keyword bids rather than leaving it up to Google. That said, starting a new campaign is one of the few good use cases for Automatic bidding. Let Google determine your Max CPC bids for a bit, and keep an eye on the data to get an idea of how much clicks will cost. You can switch back to Manual bidding once you have some data to work with.</p>
<p>A couple of guidelines for using Automatic bidding:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Use the “Maximize Clicks” bid strategy. Google will try to get as many clicks as possible out of your daily budget.</li>
<li>Be sure to implement a Max CPC bid limit. Although you don’t have control over your keyword level bids with this strategy, you can set an overall limit that you don’t want Google to exceed for a single click.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Option 2: Manual CPC</h4>
<p>If you want total control, you can use the Manual CPC bidding strategy right from the start. To determine where to start your Max CPC bids before your campaign starts running, there are a couple metrics that can help:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Page #1 CPC</li>
<li>Top of Page CPC</li>
</ul>
<p>These are both estimations that Google provides for each keyword, giving you an idea of what it’ll cost to rank on the first page of results and at the top of that page. Placing your Max CPC bid between these numbers is usually a good starting place when using Manual bidding.</p>
<h2>Ad Copy: Exterior Design</h2>
<p>Now we come to part four of the guide, writing your ad copy – the part of your account “house” that most people are actually going to see.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ad-copy-last-account-structure-guide-compressor.png" alt="AdWords Account Structure" width="485" height="436" /></div>
<p>First, a reminder that we’re living in an <a href="/blog/ws/2016/05/25/google-expanded-text-ads">Expanded Text Ad</a> world. So-called ETA’s are now the default ad type, and they’re about twice as big as Google text ads used to be.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/expanded-text-ads-account-structure-guide.png" alt="ad copy examples" width="753" height="251" /></div>
<p>Make sure you’re following <a href="/blog/ws/2016/08/08/create-expanded-text-ads">ETA best practices</a>, and pay attention to these <a href="/blog/ws/2016/12/13/expanded-text-ads-deadly-sins">dos and don’ts for ETA’s</a>.</p>
<h3>Ad copy A/B testing</h3>
<p>It’s crucial to run tests on your ads so you can find the text/creative that resonates most with your audience, driving more clicks and conversions for lower costs. Here are a couple of examples of A/B tests I love.</p>
<h4>Test keywords vs. creativity</h4>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/a-b-tests-i-love.png" alt="great adwords a/b tests" width="489" height="414" /></div>
<p>The first ad focuses on straightforward, keyword-centric ad copy. The second tests a more <a href="/blog/ws/2015/12/02/creative-display-ad-ideas">creative, attention-grabbing approach</a>. Don’t assume you know what your audience will respond to! Run a test and get conclusive data.</p>
<h4>Test price vs. no price</h4>
<p>Another thing to test: including a pricing information in your ad.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ab-test-pricing-info.png" alt="ab testing for adwords ads" width="471" height="381" /></div>
<p>Specific numbers often drive clicks, but might also help you qualify your audience (weeding out people who aren’t truly in your market, for example <a href="/blog/ws/2017/02/15/luxury-marketing-strategies">if you offer a luxury product</a>).</p>
<h3>Writing conversion-friendly ad copy</h3>
<p>Make sure you’re setting the table for conversions. A couple of tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use self-selecting ad copy</strong> – As mentioned above, including pricing info can help you reach your best audience and avoid clicks from non-buyers.</li>
<li><strong>Match your call to action (CTA) to your landing page</strong> – When the same CTA appears in your ad and on your landing page, people are in the right mindset to convert before you even pay for the click.</li>
</ul>
<p>See how the ad below has great “message match” with the corresponding landing page?</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/account-structure-message-match-ad.png" alt="adwords account structure" width="804" height="196" /></div>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ad-structure-cta-landing-page-match.png" alt="adwords landing pages" width="819" height="332" /></div>
<h2>Ad Extensions: Honey, Let’s Get a Pool!</h2>
<p>Ready for some home improvement?</p>
<p>Ad extensions are a foolproof way to make your ad more enticing – they garner high CTR’s at no added cost to you. (I can’t say the same for adding a pool, unfortunately.)</p>
<h3>Which extensions should I use?</h3>
<p>There are many ad extensions available with new ones popping up all the time. Not all of them are going to be right for your account.</p>
<p>Here are my top four favorite extensions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sitelinks</li>
<li>Callout extensions</li>
<li>Call extensions</li>
<li>Location extensions</li>
</ul>
<p>Sitelinks and callouts are almost universally applicable. Sitelinks are clickable links to other pages on your site (more options for the searcher than just one landing page) – but if you’re using static lead capture landing pages, you may want to avoid these. Callouts are additional snippets of text that form an extra line of copy (but are not clickable).</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/account-structure-guide-which-extensions-to-use.png" alt="adwords ad extensions" width="665" height="232" /></div>
<p>Call extensions and location extension are not always, but often applicable. Call extensions make it easy for mobile users to call you direct from the SERP (<a href="/blog/ws/2015/08/10/increase-conversion-rates">skipping the landing page entirely</a>). Location extensions offer your physical business information, <a href="/blog/ws/2015/06/11/local-ppc-tips">great for local businesses</a>.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/call-and-location-extensions-in-adwords.png" alt="call and location extensions" width="749" height="394" /></div>
<p>Depending on your business type there may be <a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/7332837">other extensions you should explore</a>. All of these extensions have the power to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a more direct path to conversion</li>
<li>Take up more real estate on the results page</li>
<li>Improve your Quality Score (by raising your click-through rate)</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t launch your ads without them!</p>
<h2>TL;DR – Google Ads Account Structure, Simplified</h2>
<p>Whether you’re ready to build a brand-new <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/28/google-ads">Google Ads account</a> from scratch or want to overhaul a messy account you’ve just inherited, here are your main takeaways for your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/24/ppc-account-structure">PPC account structure</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with a strong foundation. Give your campaign structure and settings the attention they deserve.</li>
<li>Ad groups are simply containers, but they’re very important to control keyword and ad association.</li>
<li>Make your keywords work for you: Start with modified broad match keywords (2-3 terms in each keyword) that show clear intent.</li>
<li>Write ad copy that sets you up for conversions and always be testing!</li>
<li>Remember ad extensions are your friends. Choose wisely and don’t start spending money until they’re enabled.</li>
