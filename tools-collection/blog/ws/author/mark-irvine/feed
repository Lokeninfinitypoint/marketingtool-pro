										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of Google Ad’s top benefits is its massive reach. Advertisers can easily reach billions of people across the greater web through Google search, Shopping, Maps, Gmail, YouTube, Discover, and more than 2 million different partner websites and apps. Google makes it easy for advertisers to reach all of these constantly updating placements across the web, too. Some of Google’s campaign types–such as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/05/performance-max-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Performance Max</a>, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/18/universal-app-campaigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App</a>, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/08/11/google-adwords-express-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smart</a> campaigns–even automatically target all of these available placements to further simplify reaching this massive audience for advertisers.</p>
<p>However, seasoned advertisers know that not all placements are equally valuable. In fact, your brand’s ad next to the wrong content can upset your customers, damage your brand, and work against your goals. It’s crucial to monitor where your ads appear online to prevent these missteps, but for years, advertisers couldn’t view or control some of their ad placements on Google, specifically in their search partner network.</p>
<p>However, after some recent vocal concerns from brands, Google has responded and released a new tool for some advertisers to review their ad placements across the search partner network and exclude placements that may be inappropriate.</p>

<h2>What is the Google Ads Search Partner network?</h2>
<p>Believe it or not, Google isn’t the only search engine across the web! There are hundreds of smaller search engines and millions of websites with search bars–and many of them serve similar PPC ads within their search results. However, most of these smaller sites don’t build their own advertising platforms, such as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ad-strength">Google Ads</a> or Microsoft Advertising. Instead, they partner with Google (or Microsoft) to help advertisers connect with searches on their sites. These secondary search engines across the web make up the Search Partner network and collectively make up a decent share of search traffic for many industries.</p>

<ul>
<li>Google search sites, which include Google Search, Google Shopping, Google Images, and Google Maps.</li>
<li><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2616017?sjid=9275154813595273542-NA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Search Partner network</strong></a> includes YouTube search, smaller partner engines, and sites that host a search bar powered by Google. A surprising number of local and specialty websites are part of the Search Network–including some recognizable tertiary search engines like Ask.com.</li>
</ul>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-search-partner-network-ad-example.webp" alt="google ads search partner network - example search partner network ad" width="715" height="329" class="aligncenter wp-image-82631 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-search-partner-network-ad-example.webp 715w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-search-partner-network-ad-example-480x221.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 715px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In Google Ads, advertisers can easily view their search campaigns’ results and segment their performance between Google search and the Search Partner network. Within search campaigns, advertisers can easily opt out of the Search Network at any time within their campaigns’ settings.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-search-partner-network-settings.webp" alt="google ads search partner network - screenshot of network settings in google ads platform" width="751" height="140" class="aligncenter wp-image-82633 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-search-partner-network-settings.webp 751w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-search-partner-network-settings-480x89.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 751px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>However, Google’s Performance Max campaigns don’t offer that visibility or flexibility to advertisers. Google’s Performance Max (and other fully automated campaign types) dynamically places your ads across the entire Google network (Google search, search partners, display, YouTube, video, discover, and Gmail) to dynamically <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-in-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use AI to maximize your campaign’s results</a>.</p>
<h3>The problems with Google’s Search Partner Network</h3>
<p>Google’s Search Partner network&#8217;s additional reach is generally positive for advertisers–but that reach comes at additional costs and concerns. Even if most search partners on the network are from reputable, high-quality sites, the vast internet unfortunately hosts many low-quality sites and bad agents.</p>
<p>Google has never previously shared a list or directory of its ever-changing search partners. And unlike <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/30/mastering-display-placements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">placements across the Google Display Network,</a> advertisers haven’t been able to review where their ads appeared on the Search Network. Search advertisers had the choice to buy ads on the entire Search Partner network–or opt out entirely. Advertisers using Performance Max campaigns were automatically included across the entire Google network, including Search Partners.</p>
<p>Over the years, advertisers have become <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/12/05/breitbart-ad-boycott" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly worried and vocal</a> about the kinds of content their ads appeared alongside, and many advertisers have serious concerns about their brand image across the web.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://adalytics.io/blog/search-partners-transparency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adalytics published a study</a> revealing some concerning placements across the search partner network and discovered that several large companies, agencies, and government agencies were allegedly paying to show ads across some very questionable sites. Some of the examples from their study include pornographic content, pirated content, and sites that may be subject to international sanctions.</p>
<p>Google largely refuted the claims from Adalytics and assured advertisers <a href="https://twitter.com/edantaylor/status/1729591667294921038" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that ad revenue wasn’t being shared with sanctioned entities</a>. They further asserted that Adalytics claims were exaggerated and that such sites “represent a minuscule amount of [Google’s] Search Partner network.”</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, Google announced it would <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-advertisers-opt-out-search-partner-network-adalytics-435513" target="_blank" rel="noopener">temporarily allow advertisers</a> to opt out of the Search Partner network in Performance Max and App campaigns until March 1. Advertisers would have to contact Google directly to opt out of Search Partners in these campaigns.</p>
<div id="google-ads-performance-max-placement-report"></div>
<h2>Google’s new Performance Max campaign placement report</h2>
<p>Addressing advertiser’s growing concerns, Google announced that it would begin to share more insights into where advertisers’ ads appeared across the web, including on the Search Partner network. Starting on March 4, advertisers can review how frequently their ads appeared across individual placements within their Performance Max and App campaigns.</p>
<p>The report is now available to all advertisers with active Performance Max and App campaigns. However, the reporting is slightly hidden from how advertisers generally review their search queries or other ad placements. Instead, advertisers can find these two new reports within the “report editor” section of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-marketing-live-2024">Google Ads</a> dashboard.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-search-partner-network-performance-max.webp" alt="google ads search partner network - performance max" width="966" height="316" class="aligncenter wp-image-82630 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-search-partner-network-performance-max.webp 966w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-search-partner-network-performance-max-480x157.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 966px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The new Performance Max campaign placement report shows where and how often your Performance Max ads appeared on different placements from the web. Unfortunately, the report only shows the ad impressions from your Performance Max campaigns–other performance metrics, such as clicks, costs, and conversions, are unavailable.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-performance-max-campaign-placements.webp" alt="google ads search partner performance max placement report screenshot" width="899" height="315" class="aligncenter wp-image-82632 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-performance-max-campaign-placements.webp 899w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-performance-max-campaign-placements-480x168.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 899px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This reporting is only available for Performance Max and App campaigns. Traditional search and shopping campaigns still do not have any reporting available for individual placements across the search partner network.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6e0.png" alt="🛠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span>Set your Google Ads campaigns up for success with our free guide to the perfect <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLAccountStructure.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_LastAccountStructureGuide_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads account structure</a>!</p>
<div id="how-to-opt-out-of-google-ads-search-partners"></div>
<h2>How to opt out of Google Search Partner placements</h2>
<p>Starting in March, Google will also allow advertisers to exclude individual Search Partner placements from showing ads for any campaigns in their account, including Performance Max. The placement exclusion can only be added at the account level–unlike many other placement exclusions, which are available at the campaign or ad group level.</p>
<p>To exclude a placement from showing your ads, you will need to create a placement exclusion list and apply it to your account. The Placement exclusion lists are kept under the “Tools and Settings” menu in Google Ads, under the “Shared Library.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-searech-partner-network-placement-exclusions.webp" alt="google ads search partner network - placement exclusion lists in shared library screenshot" width="764" height="328" class="aligncenter wp-image-82634 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-searech-partner-network-placement-exclusions.webp 764w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-searech-partner-network-placement-exclusions-480x206.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 764px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Once you create a <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7331110?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new exclusion list</a>, it will automatically be added to all of your campaigns in that account. New placement exclusions may take up to 12 hours to go into effect.</p>
<h2>Take control over where your brand shows online</h2>
<p>Google’s newest placement reports and exclusion options are designed to give advertisers more visibility into where their ads appear across the web and more control over their brand online. How much you decide to use these controls is up to you, but it’s always a best practice to review your placements and add new exclusions regularly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Local businesses know how important it is to be found in their communities when users search online. However, it can be difficult for small local businesses to compete with national brands that can afford to outspend them on Google Ads. Instead, local businesses need to be smarter and make the most of targeting their local area within Google Ads.</p>
<p>But local advertisers have some powerful tools when it comes to advertising online. More than <a href="https://www.ipx1031.com/small-business-statistics-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80%</a> of consumers would prefer to shop locally–and nearly 60% would even pay more to support a local business! Savvy advertisers can take advantage of this and highlight their local status when customers are searching for their products and services online.</p>
<p>In fact, Google Ads and Microsoft Ads have several features that any local business should take advantage of to have their ads stand out in their local searches. So, here are my top three strategies for localizing search ads.</p>

<h2>How to localize your Google Ads</h2>
<p>Here are three ways any business can localize its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/promotions-in-google-ads">Google Ads</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Looking for other ways to get more out of your local campaigns? Try our free <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads Grader </a>to get an instant read on key metrics plus optimization ideas.</p>
<div id="local-dynamic-keyword-insertion"></div>
<h3>1. Dynamically insert locations in your Responsive Search Ads</h3>
<p>Of course,<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/15/local-marketing-ideas" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> localizing your ad copy</a> for each city, town, or state you serve is a clear and effective way to show your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/06/online-reputation-management">business is local</a> to your searchers. But, manually creating hundreds of ads for every town where people might search for your services will quickly get time-consuming. Plus, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-search-partner-insights">targeting</a> each one in its own campaign? A nightmare in the making for your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/10/google-ads-account-structure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">account structure</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/local-google-ad-example.jpg" alt="local google ads - example of google ads for different cities" width="642" height="445" class="aligncenter wp-image-81853 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/local-google-ad-example.jpg 642w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/local-google-ad-example-480x333.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 642px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Instead of manually adjusting each ad for every city, you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-performance-max-updates-2024">tailor your ads</a> easily by using <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9773001?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dynamic location insertion</a> in your Responsive Search Ads. Dynamic location insertion works almost identically to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/17/dynamic-keyword-insertion-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s Dynamic Keyword Insertion</a>, just instead of inserting the keyword directly into your ad’s text, these ads will automatically be customized to your user’s location.</p>
<p>To get started with Dynamic Location Insertion in your RSAs, simply write a new headline or description in an RSA. You can insert the location anywhere in the headline or description (just be mindful of character limits). As you type out your new message, when you’re ready to dynamically insert the location in your text, hit the<strong> {</strong> open bracket to trigger the prompt below, then select “location insertion” from the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/local-google-ads-dynamic-keyword-insertion.jpg" alt="local google ads - example of adding dynamic keywords in the Google Ads ad editor" width="432" height="345" class="aligncenter wp-image-81859 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/local-google-ads-dynamic-keyword-insertion.jpg 432w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/local-google-ads-dynamic-keyword-insertion-300x240.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px" /></p>
<p>From here, Google what type of location you want your ads to highlight. Within the United States, your locations should be formatted as a city, state, or country. Effectively, this tells Google how “local” you want to highlight yourself. A searcher from Boston, Massachusetts, for instance, would read an ad differently depending on how this location was formatted.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="312">Location format</td>
<td width="312">Ad Text Inserted</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="312">LOCATION(City)</td>
<td width="312">Boston</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="312">LOCATION(State)</td>
<td width="312">Massachusetts</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="312">LOCATION(Country)</td>
<td width="312">United States of America</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Outside the US, advertisers can either show the city or country. Unfortunately, local international equivalents like provinces or prefectures aren’t yet supported.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s a final option to include “default text” within your dynamic location insertion parameter. This default text will only show when Google can’t insert the name of the searcher’s location directly in the ad text. This might happen due to character limits or if Google can’t easily identify the exact location of a searcher.</p>
<p>This headline might read &#8220;Proudly Serving {LOCATION(City): Your City}&#8221; when you see it in Google Ads. But Google will dynamically change it to read “proudly serving Boston” or “proudly serving Cambridge” when users search from those locations. But when someone from a long-named place like Manchester-by-the-Sea searches for you, your ad will use the default text and simply read “proudly serving your city.”</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4cd.png" alt="📍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Is your Google Ads account structure optimized for local ads?

<div id="google-ads-location-assets"></div>
<h3>2. Create location assets (optimize your Google Business Profile)</h3>
<p>The first absolute must-do for any local business is to claim, complete, and keep their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/03/google-my-business-optimization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Business Profile</a> (GBP) up to date! This helps customers searching for your business, and will also hugely improve your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/12/local-seo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local SEO</a> to help you stand out from your competitors on the SERP. But your GBP can also help you with your PPC results as well. You can link your Google Business Profile directly to your ads and create <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/09/19/adwords-location-extensions-guide#:~:text=Location%20extensions%20allow%20you%20to,is%20a%20pretty%20powerful%20option." target="_blank" rel="noopener">location assets (formerly location extensions).</a></p>
<p>With location assets, your text ads will highlight your local business address(es) and current hours to local searchers. On mobile devices, searchers will also have the option to call your local branch from the SERP directly. Clicking on the address will open up your full Google Business Profile and allow searchers to get directions or begin navigating to your branch in Google Maps.</p>

<p>Additionally, once you’ve enabled location assets within your campaigns, your Google Business Profile may occasionally show at the top of the local map pack as a prominent sponsored listing with extra lines of text to distinguish you from other local businesses.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/local-google-ads-google-business-profile.jpg" alt="local google ads - google business profile ad examples" width="804" height="456" class="aligncenter wp-image-81857 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/local-google-ads-google-business-profile.jpg 804w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/local-google-ads-google-business-profile-480x272.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 804px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Recently, Google also started rolling out <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/07/google-ads-location-assets-enhancements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">additional enhancements to its location assets</a>, such as automatically highlighting your GBP’s cover photo alongside your text ads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/localize-google-ads-google-business-profile-and-ad.jpg" alt="local google ads - screenshot of google business profile images in ads " width="677" height="434" class="aligncenter wp-image-81856 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/localize-google-ads-google-business-profile-and-ad.jpg 677w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/localize-google-ads-google-business-profile-and-ad-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 677px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>These advantages aren’t unique to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-scripts">optimizing</a> just your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ad-strength">Google Ads</a> though. Microsoft Advertising has similar location extensions. Unlike Google Ads, you don’t need to link your GBP or Bing Places account to Microsoft Advertising to use location extensions. You can enter each location’s address and hours within Microsoft Advertising to enable this feature. Additionally, Microsoft also recently launched <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/microsoft-launches-local-search-ads-for-bing/481731/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Local Search Ads for Bing</a>, which highlights advertisers&#8217; location extensions in local map results.</p>

<h3>3. Take advantage of other local ad assets</h3>
<p>Although location assets are the most well-known asset for local advertisers, there are several other assets that can also be used to add a local flair to your PPC ads. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/03/structured-snippets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Structured snippets</a>, for instance, can complement your ads with a list of neighborhoods that your business serves.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/localize-google-ads-callout-assets.jpg" alt="local google ads - example of google ad using structured snippet" width="780" height="232" class="aligncenter wp-image-81854 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/localize-google-ads-callout-assets.jpg 780w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/localize-google-ads-callout-assets-480x143.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 780px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>To set up neighborhood structured snippets, simply create a new structured snippet asset and choose the “neighborhood” header. Then proceed to list at least three neighborhoods or areas that you serve as “values.” Generally, these values will appear in the same order that you enter them here, so prioritize your top neighborhoods in the first positions to maximize their effectiveness and visibility. Your neighborhood structured snippets can still appear alongside other structured snippets used to highlight your services, brands, models, and other headers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/localized-google-ads-headline.jpg" alt="local google ads - local headline examples " width="600" height="633" class="aligncenter wp-image-81861 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/localized-google-ads-headline.jpg 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/localized-google-ads-headline-480x506.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Sitelinks can also be incredibly useful to help highlight your local ads. If you service different areas and have a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dedicated landing page</a> for each area or office, these can easily be utilized as highly visible sitelinks that both spotlight your local experience and help send local searchers to the most relevant page.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/local-google-ads-sitelinks.jpg" alt="local google ads - sitelinks for locations example" width="842" height="240" class="aligncenter wp-image-81860 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/local-google-ads-sitelinks.jpg 842w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/local-google-ads-sitelinks-480x137.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 842px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Finally, don’t overlook the small but versatile <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/09/08/adwords-callout-extensions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">callout assets</a>! With up to 25 characters of text each, these assets are flexible and easy ways to call out unique pieces of your business. Differentiate yourself from national brands by including callouts like “local family owned,” “serving Boston since 1989,” “local experts,” and other similar messages to add some local flair to your ads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/local-google-ads-ad-assets.png" alt="local google ads - google ad callout assets screenshot" width="530" height="234" class="aligncenter wp-image-81851 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/local-google-ads-ad-assets.png 530w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/local-google-ads-ad-assets-480x212.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 530px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Bing has some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/25/bings-ads-vs-google-adwords" target="_blank" rel="noopener">additional unique features</a> that Google doesn’t have for your ads. Hidden deep among your account level settings, there’s the ability to opt-in to Microsoft Advertising’s <a href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/post/september-2021/show-your-brand-values-marketing-with-purpose-business-attributes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marketing with Purpose Business Attributes</a>. These attributes allow advertisers to share how their brand takes pride in different aspects as it relates to community responsibility, accessibility, environmental responsibility, and inclusivity. Among these attributes that advertisers can highlight for their brand are &#8220;small business” and &#8220;local business.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/local-microsoft-ad-attributions.jpg" alt="local microsoft ads - screenshot of microsoft ad attribution options" width="889" height="385" class="aligncenter wp-image-81850 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/local-microsoft-ad-attributions.jpg 889w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/local-microsoft-ad-attributions-480x208.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 889px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You may choose any relevant attributes for your brand within the &#8220;marketing with purpose&#8221; business attributes. Once applied to your account, your ads will sometimes show with a relevant attribute highlighted next to them, such as below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/local-microsoft-ad-example.jpg" alt="local microsoft ads - example of a microsoft ad taking advantage of attributes" width="832" height="177" class="aligncenter wp-image-81852 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/local-microsoft-ad-example.jpg 832w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/local-microsoft-ad-example-480x102.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 832px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>Write your PPC ads like a local</h2>
<p>Big budgets or not–you’ve got the local advantage when it comes to advertising on the SERP. Take pride and highlight yourself as a local business within your PPC ads. Not only will searchers support you, but most are going to prefer to engage with your ad over the generic brands that you’re competing against. If you try these ideas but still want more out of your localized ads, see how <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/marketing-services?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Demo_Blog_Demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our solutions</a> can help you maximize your campaigns no matter how near or far your customers are!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Location matters when you’re searching online. Whether you’re searching for a plumber, repairman, or even a lawyer–we aren’t looking to connect with someone several states away. Optimizing your business to show for these local searches is critical–and since 2015, many advertisers have taken advantage of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/11/google-local-service-ads">Google’s Local Services Ads</a> as part of their strategy to be found by customers in their area.</p>
<p>However, Google previously offered little data or insight into how often Local Services Ads (LSAs) were shown on the SERP, and advertisers had very little opportunity to troubleshoot and optimize their LSAs. Thankfully, Google recently started sharing new ad impression and impression share metrics with advertisers which can help guide you to make the most of your Local Services Ads.</p>

<h2>What are Google Local Services Ads?</h2>
<p>Google Local Services Ads are a simple (and safe!) way to connect local searchers to professionals in their area (like dog walkers and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/roofing-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roofers</a>). This unique local ad format highlights locally screened professionals that are ready to take on their job at the very top of the SERP. Over the years, Google has opened these Local Services Ads to over 80 <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/15/google-ads-benchmarks">different local industries</a>–from <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/home-services-promotion-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home services</a>, car repair, pet care, accountants, lawyers, and more. Local Services Ads are available in the US, Canada, the United Kingdom, and several European countries.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/11/google-local-service-ads">Local Services Ads</a> appear above the traditional paid search ads and organic listings–and advertisers can take advantage of running both LSAs and traditional PPC ads simultaneously, often showing up twice for the same search.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/google-local-services-ads-vs-google-ads.webp" alt="screenshot of google local services ads vs google ads" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81003" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/google-local-services-ads-vs-google-ads.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/google-local-services-ads-vs-google-ads-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Unlike traditional paid search ads though–Local Services Ads have no keywords or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/06/negative-keyword-guide">negative keywords</a> to manage. LSA advertisers simply select the types of jobs they want to show ads for, and Google matches your listing to relevant search terms. Additionally, Google Local Services Ads charges advertisers a fee for each lead (usually a call or message) from their ads, whereas traditional paid search campaigns <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/21/how-much-does-adwords-cost">charge advertisers</a> for each ad click to their website’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages">landing page</a>, regardless of whether they contact that business.</p>

<h2>New Google Local Services Ads metrics</h2>
<p>Previously, Local Services advertisers could review very limited data on their ads’ performance. You can view your leads and your total costs during any given time frame–but apart from that, very little else. Since November 2023, Google has been rolling out new impression and Impression rate metrics for your Local Services Ads. Advertisers can view these metrics under the “reports” tab in the left-hand menu of the Local Services Ads interface.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/google-local-services-ads-metrics.webp" alt="google local services ads dashboard" width="936" height="510" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81020" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/google-local-services-ads-metrics.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/google-local-services-ads-metrics-480x262.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Local Services Ads now include metrics for your ad impressions, top impression rate on search, and absolute top impression rate on search.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> What results can you expect from Google Ads?

<div id="google-lsas-ad-impressions"></div>
<h3>Ad impressions</h3>
<p>Simply put, ad <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6320?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impressions</a> tell you how many times your LSAs were shown on the SERP. Getting seen on Google is important and your ad impressions is a metric to quantify your ads’ <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/search-visibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visibility</a>.</p>
<p>But like other search ad formats–most people who see your ad won’t click or become a lead. That’s fine and expected–and you don’t pay Google every time your LSAs show, only when someone clicks and becomes a lead.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to use the ad impressions metric.</p>
<p><strong>Troubleshoot your LSAs</strong></p>
<p>Previously, it could be tough for small businesses to know if their ads were even running if they <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/21/google-ads-not-converting">weren’t getting leads</a>. If you see zero ad impressions, that’s a sign that something with your profile isn’t set up correctly, or that your ads are paused.</p>
<p><strong>Understand your reach</strong></p>
<p>Lots of SMBs generally start their advertising campaigns small. That’s understandable, but oftentimes they reach a much smaller audience than they expected and get disappointed. This additional insight into the reach of your LSAs may encourage you to expand your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/17/google-ads-location-targeting">targeted locations</a> or include more job types in your listing.</p>
<p><strong>Improve your LSA engagement</strong></p>
<p>Remember that the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/15/google-ads-benchmarks">average search ad CTR is only 6%</a>! And unlike search ads, Local Service Ads push searchers to call or message the provider directly. As a result, LSAs may have far less engagement than the links from your search campaigns. You may only see that 0.2% of your ad impressions turn into a lead!</p>
<p>You can use your leads/impressions ratio as a proxy metric for your LSA engagement. If you see that people are seeing your LSAs but not engaging, it may be a sign that your LSA profile could use a refresh. Simply updating your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-write-a-business-description/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business bio</a> with new, competitive offers or uploading a fresh high-quality photo or headshot can make a huge difference in improving your Local Service Ads.</p>

<div id="top-impressions-rate-on-search"></div>
<h3>Top impression rate on search</h3>
<p>Top impression rate on search tells you how often your LSAs show above the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/03/organic-traffic">organic search results</a>. The top impression rate on search is calculated as:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Search top impression rate = Impressions on top/Impressions</strong></p>
<p>Local Services Ads <em>nearly</em> always appear above the organic results. In my experience, this metric has always been 100% for my advertisers–but it wouldn’t surprise me if Google was including this metric because it plans to start testing LSAs in different positions of the SERP or within its new <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/19/google-search-generative-experience">Search Generative Experience</a>.</p>
<p>Bear in mind though–this metric is <strong>NOT</strong> the same as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/07/impression-share">search impression share</a>, which measures how frequently your ad showed for relevant searches. Just because your ad is showing at the top doesn’t mean that you aren’t <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/14/google-ads-budgeting-strategies">missing potential ad impressions due to low budgets</a> or poor ranking.</p>
<div id="absolute-top-impression-rate-on-search"></div>
<h3>Absolute top impression rate on search</h3>
<p>Absolute top impression rate on search tells you how often your LSAs show in the very first spot on the SERP.  Absolute top impression rate on search is calculated as:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Search absolute top impression rate = Impressions in the first spot /Impressions</strong></p>
<p>Here are some ways you can use this metric.</p>
<p><strong>See how competitively your LSAs are performing</strong></p>
<p>Being in that very first spot will get you a lot of reach, attention, and engagement. But it can also be very expensive. If you see a low absolute top impression rate, it may be a sign to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/17/google-ads-bid-management">increase your bids</a>. But if you see a higher top impression rate, be sure that you’re comfortable with your current cost per lead. There’s no shame in being in a lower position if you can afford more profitable leads.</p>
<p><strong>Guide your LSA budget decisions</strong></p>
<p>Google allows businesses of all sizes and budgets to run LSAs–allowing them to set a weekly budget for their ads to run across the SERP. However, small businesses often fall into a trap–they’re overly excited about showing up in that absolute top position but also have a relatively <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/home-services-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small budget</a>.</p>
<p>Consequently, they can only afford a few (very expensive) leads before they run out of budget. It’s much better to afford more leads in a lower position at a better cost per lead when <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/11/google-local-services-ads-tips">managing an LSA on a smaller budget</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re consistently spending your weekly LSA budget and also have a high absolute top impression rate on search, you’re likely missing out on a lot of opportunities for your ads to show. Consider either increasing your budget or decreasing your bids if you run into this dilemma.</p>
<p>To help benchmark what leads for your business cost on LSAs, consider using Google’s <a href="https://ads.google.com/local-services-ads/cost/#!/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LSA budget estimator tool</a>.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly everything we do online is tracked. That may not be a secret, but it’s certainly an uncomfortable reality for most. In a <a href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/insights/g/in-brands-we-trust-the-intersection-of-privacy-and-trust-in-the-age-of-the-empowered-consumer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 study</a>, 91% of respondents were concerned about the amount of data companies can collect about them. Today, we’re seeing legislation slowly catch up to these concerns, and Big Tech companies are rolling out new privacy solutions to minimize abuse and anonymize the data they collect from users. But consumers are still skeptical and frequently opting to find their own way to explore the web, privately.</p>
<p>This growing audience of privacy-minded searchers is increasingly abandoning Google for a search engine with this goal in mind, DuckDuckGo. So, is DuckDuckGo legit? If so, what do you need to know about it? We&#8217;re sharing all the answers.</p>

<h2>What is DuckDuckGo?</h2>
<p>DuckDuckGo is an emerging search engine that should look and feel similar to what users should expect from Google or Microsoft (although they&#8217;ve been around since 2008!). From DuckDuckGo.com, searchers can find answers to their queries collected from <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/results/sources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">countless sources</a>, oftentimes indexed from their own crawler (DuckDuckBot.) More than just links—the DuckDuckGo SERP includes common features like maps, weather, local business information, images, videos, shopping—and even ads.</p>
<p>And just like Google and Microsoft, DuckDuckGo also offers its own <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web browsers</a> for desktop and mobile devices and <a href="https://www.spreadprivacy.com/protect-your-inbox-with-duckduckgo-email-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free personal email</a> services. The suite of products from DuckDuckGo is very comparable to what most would expect from other major search networks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/what-is-duckduckgo.webp" alt="screenshot of duckduckgo on mobile and desktop" width="936" height="578" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79523" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/what-is-duckduckgo.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/what-is-duckduckgo-480x296.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The key differentiator that DuckDuckGo highlights in its suite is its high focus on its user’s privacy. Unlike Google and Microsoft’s search engines, browsers, and other products—DuckDuckGo does not create unique cookies, store your IP addresses, search and browsing history, or any other unique identifiers. DuckDuckGo has none of your personal information and therefore has never sold any personal information. DuckDuckGo is always encrypted, and privacy is its core value.</p>
<p>Most tech companies’ privacy policies are tombs of legalese. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DuckDuckGo’s privacy policy</a> opens simply and shortly: “We don’t track you. That’s our privacy policy in a nutshell.”</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo’s unique respect for its users&#8217; privacy has earned it more praise and attention over the past few years and it’s quickly emerging as more than just a niche tertiary search engine into a more prominent alternative to Google. As DuckDuckGo’s user base grows, so does its opportunity for savvy marketers to reach a very unique audience that are ditching Google.</p>

<div id="duckduckgo-statistics"></div>
<h2>5 DuckDuckGo statistics you need to know</h2>
<p>To learn more about this new audience, I’ve collected several fascinating statistics from DuckDuckGo.</p>
<div id="how-many-people-use-duckduckgo"></div>
<h3>1. How many people use DuckDuckGo?</h3>
<p>When looking into DuckDuckGo, your first question is probably how many people use it? How often are they searching?</p>
<p>Today, 3.1 billion searches occur on DuckDuckGo every month. DuckDuckGo has grown its audience to over 46 million users around the world. And although that may be just a small fraction when compared to Google’s impressive reach—many people who search on DuckDuckGo do so because they no longer trust Google with their data. 6.4 million users on DuckDuckGo can’t be reached on Google Search.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/duckduckgo-statistics.webp" alt="three duckduckgo statistics" width="936" height="272" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79524" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/duckduckgo-statistics.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/duckduckgo-statistics-480x139.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="who-uses-duckduckgo"></div>
<h3>2. Who uses DuckDuckGo?</h3>
<p>Both Google and Bing see roughly a 50/50 split between male and female audiences. Interestingly—DuckDuckGo has a slight skew along gender lines, with nearly 60% of their traffic from males.</p>
<p>The age demographics of DuckDuckGo users are similar to that of Google and Bing’s, with a small promising growth in the younger 18-24 age range.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/duckduckgo-demographics.webp" alt="chart showing duckduckgo user demographics by gender" width="936" height="514" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79526" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/duckduckgo-demographics.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/duckduckgo-demographics-480x264.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The income distribution of DuckDuckGo’s audience is really where it shines to most marketers. DuckDuckGo attracts a small but very affluent audience. The median income in the US is about $44,000, but more than 85% of DuckDuckGo’s users make above that average income—with over 60% of them making at least $100,000!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/duckduckgo-user-income.webp" alt="chart showing duckduckgo users by income" width="936" height="535" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79527" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/duckduckgo-user-income.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/duckduckgo-user-income-480x274.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="how-do-people-search-on-duckduckgo"></div>
<h3>3. How do people search on DuckDuckGo?</h3>
<p>Google prides itself on its “mobile-first” mantra—and for the better half of the last decade, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/13/google-ads-mobile-benchmarks">mobile has made up most Google’s reach</a>. Microsoft—and it’s personal computing dominance—has strongly cemented its own <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/19/who-uses-bing-anyway">Bing search engine as a major player in the desktop search market</a>. Privacy-focused DuckDuckGo users actively take their preferences across both devices. In the US, over 15 million searchers use DuckDuckGo on both desktop and mobile—with less than 5 million using the privacy-focused search engine on just one device.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/duckduckgo-unique-users.webp" alt="chart showing duckduckgo unique users by device" width="936" height="491" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79525" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/duckduckgo-unique-users.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/duckduckgo-unique-users-480x252.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Interestingly, these over 20 million mobile searchers help catapult <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports/searchengines-2023-q2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DuckDuckGo to the #2 search engine on mobile in the USA.</a> Still considerably behind Google’s massive mobile dominance, these 20 million users still make up a sizable population of the US market.</p>
<div id="where-do-people-use-duckduckgo"></div>
<h3>4. Where do people use DuckDuckGo?</h3>
<p>DuckDuckGo is headquartered in Pennsylvania and for most of its history has been an emerging competitor in the US Search Market. But as Google has struggled to calm privacy concerns across the globe, it has been successful in taking market share from the search giant in several major international markets. Today, DuckDuckGo makes up about 1% of all mobile searches in the United Kingdom and Germany and 2% of mobile searches in the United States. Similarly, DuckDuckGo makes up about 2% of all desktop searches within the United Kingdom and Germany and about 3% within the US.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/duckduckgo-market-share.webp" alt="chart showing duckduckgo market share across us, germany and uk" width="936" height="513" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79528" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/duckduckgo-market-share.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/duckduckgo-market-share-480x263.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Roughly 58% of all of DuckDuckGo’s searches come from the United States. DuckDuckGo’s major international markets are in Europe, Canada, and Australia—where it receives 22%, 3%, and 2% of its remaining traffic, respectively.</p>
<div id="are-people-using-only-duckduckgo"></div>
<h3>5. Are people using only DuckDuckGo to search?</h3>
<p>The primary reason people start using DuckDuckGo is because they want the privacy that they can’t get from other search engines, browsers, and email services. DuckDuckGo isn’t the default search engine or browser on any device—searchers generally have to manually update their preferences to make the switch to DuckDuckGo. Given that active decision—most users don’t readily switch between the privacy-focused search engine and its traditional competitors. Three-quarters of DuckDuckGo searchers don’t use Google search at all and 69% don’t use Bing either.</p>
<p>This means that these searches on DuckDuckGo are a unique audience that you simply cannot reach if you’re simply just advertising on Google Ads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/duckduckgo-reach.webp" alt="chart showing duckduckgo reach" width="936" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79529" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/duckduckgo-reach.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/duckduckgo-reach-480x246.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>

<div id="how-to-advertise-on-duckduckgo"></div>
<h2>How to advertise on DuckDuckGo</h2>
<p>The growing DuckDuckGo audience of affluent, privacy-concerned searchers that can no longer be found on Google or Bing is a valuable one that marketers will want to reach. DuckDuckGo prominently displays paid search ads atop their SERP like other search engines, but it doesn’t have its own ad platform like Google or Bing. Instead, DuckDuckGo partners directly with Microsoft Advertising as an exclusive premium search partner.</p>
<p>To advertise on the DuckDuckGo SERP, first create a <a href="https://ads.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Advertising</a> account. Then, create a new search campaign or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/25/bing-ads-scheduled-imports">import your current Google Ads campaigns into Microsoft Advertising</a>. Finally, when setting up your ad groups, be sure to select your ad distribution settings to show your ads across the entire Microsoft Advertising network.</p>

<h2>Give it a go with DuckDuckGo?</h2>
<p>While it’s not likely that users will flee Google for this newer search engine, it’s important to know the key players in the search engine game. This is especially true as advertisers and marketers look for ways to reach users no matter where they’re searching online, making DuckDuckGo a potential place for you to expand your audience and reach.</p>

<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/11/search-themes-for-performance-max-campaigns">Google Adds Search Themes to Performance Max: What You Need to Know</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Google first introduced its Performance Max campaigns, it set off with a goal to make advertising across all of its properties (search, display, video, Discover, Gmail, and Maps) simple to manage within one campaign type.</p>
<p>Getting started with Performance Max campaigns is easy. Optimizing Performance Max campaigns? Well, that can be much more difficult.</p>
<p>Luckily, Google recently released a new beta feature for Performance Max campaigns called “<a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/14179631?sjid=9794266004901960563-NA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search themes</a>” designed to help advertisers better target their ads with a similar keyword-inspired approach that most advertisers are used to. In this article, we’re covering what search themes are, how to create them, and how to use them the right way.</p>

</ul>
<div id="what-are-search-themes"></div>
<h2>What are search themes for Performance Max campaigns?</h2>
<p>Google’s fully automated campaign type allows you to control very little. You can improve your different ad assets, website, product feed, and even provide audience signals to better target your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/20/performance-max-pros-cons">Performance Max campaign</a>s–but that’s still very lacking to the rest of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/21/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheat-sheet">Google Ad’s targeting options</a>. Especially for most of us who are used to running search campaigns with robust <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-match-types">keyword targeting options</a>–running search ads through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-performance-max-pre-launch-optimizations">Performance Max</a> campaigns can be a frustrating experience.</p>
<p>Search themes are a new feature that allows advertisers to provide some additional context and signals to Google to help target their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-performance-max-updates-2024">Performance Max</a> campaigns. Advertisers can provide search themes to Google to share how they expect their customers to search for their products or services.</p>
<p>With this additional context, Google can consider these search themes as new signals to target audiences based on their search behavior. Google may use these search themes to better <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/performance-max">refine their Performance Max</a> campaign targets, or to reach new relevant placements on the SERP and beyond.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/google-ads-search-themes-performance-max.webp" alt="google ads search themes in performance max campaigns" width="845" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-78423" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/google-ads-search-themes-performance-max.webp 845w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/google-ads-search-themes-performance-max-480x341.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 845px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Search themes is an optional feature in Performance Max campaigns. However, we’ve seen time and time again that Performance Max campaigns perform the best when they’re given better signals, so I’d encourage you to provide Google with at least a few search themes to give Google enough signals to optimize your campaigns with. Advertisers can provide up to 25 search themes per asset group.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Worried you&#8217;re wasting spend in Google Ads? Find out with a free, instant audit &gt;&gt; <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Google Ads Performance Grader</a></p>
<div id="search-themes-to-replace-custom-segments"></div>
<h2>Search themes are set to replace custom segments based on search intent</h2>
<p>Within Google’s most recent announcement introducing Search themes, Google also shares that they’ll be ending support for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/10/18/google-ads-custom-segments">custom segments</a> based on past search activity within Performance Max campaigns in early 2024. These audience segments will automatically be upgraded to Search Themes.</p>
<p>Previously known as “Custom Intent” audiences, these audiences used very similar signals to the new Search themes, effectively targeting people based on their past searches on Google. Since this audience signal is so similar to Google’s new “search themes” beta, the automatic upgrade in 2024 is unlikely to negatively impact campaign performance. Hopefully, it streamlines workflows and makes signal management easier for advertisers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/google-ads-search-themes-custom-segment.webp" alt="google ads search themes in performance max replacing custom segments" width="753" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-78424" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/google-ads-search-themes-custom-segment.webp 753w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/google-ads-search-themes-custom-segment-480x381.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 753px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Custom segments based on previous search activities will continue to function uninterrupted in other campaign types, including search campaigns. Additionally, all other custom segments based on other attributes (affinities, interests, apps, URLs, and demographics) will continue to exist in Performance Max campaigns and serve as valuable audience signals for Google’s ongoing optimization.</p>
<div id="how-to-create-search-themes"></div>
<h2>How do I create search themes in my Performance Max campaigns?</h2>
<p>Search themes is a new feature in beta and may not currently be available to all advertisers, however, Google is expected to release it to more advertisers throughout the rest of the year.</p>
<ol>
<li>To add search themes to your Performance Max campaigns, simply:<br />
Select a Performance Max campaign.</li>
<li>Select an Asset group. Each asset group can have different audience signals and search themes.</li>
<li>Next to your ad assets in your Asset group, you’ll notice a card for “Signals.” Select the pencil icon to edit your signals.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/google-ads-search-themes-audience-signals.webp" alt="how to set up search themes in performance max - signals audience segment" width="648" height="502" class="aligncenter wp-image-78425" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/google-ads-search-themes-audience-signals.webp 648w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/google-ads-search-themes-audience-signals-480x372.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 648px, 100vw" /></li>
<li>Here, you’ll see the new Search Themes beta. Advertisers can add up to 25 unique search themes per asset group to help improve the signals of their Performance Max campaign. Each search theme must be shorter than 80 characters in length.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/google-ads-search-themes-setup.webp" alt="google ads search themes set up in performance max" width="936" height="286" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-78426" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/google-ads-search-themes-setup.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/google-ads-search-themes-setup-480x147.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></li>
<li>Be sure to scroll to the bottom of the page and save your changes to your Asset group signals!</li>
</ol>
<p>Search themes can also be edited or removed at any time from this menu. Once changed or removed, Google will no longer use that signal when targeting its ads to an audience.</p>
<p>But removing a search theme isn’t like removing a keyword or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/negative-keywords">adding a negative keyword</a> in a search campaign–Google may continue to serve ads on similar search queries if it believes it’s relevant to users. However, Search themes will still respect any brand exclusions or account-level negative keywords that you’ve implemented. If you want to prevent your Performance Max campaigns from serving for irrelevant and unwanted traffic&#8211;you’ll still want to use those tools!</p>

<h2>How will search themes in Performance Max campaigns affect my search ads?</h2>
<p>Performance Max campaigns and traditional search campaigns are both eligible to serve ads on the Google SERP and search partner engines. Advertisers who are running both Performance Max campaigns and search campaigns will often run into issues where both campaign types are targeting the same searches and risk serving different ad experiences to the same searches or struggle to manage the two campaigns synchronously. Using search themes in Performance Max may ease some of those issues for advertisers.</p>
<p>In these issues where multiple campaigns or ad groups are eligible to serve an ad to a searcher, <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2756257?sjid=9794266004901960563-NA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google prioritizes exact match keywords</a> that are identical to the search above all others. Google’s new Search themes are treated as a lower priority, equal to that of phrase and broad match keywords.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/google-ads-search-themes-match-types.webp" alt="google ads search themes - match types prioritized in google ads" width="936" height="504" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-78427" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/google-ads-search-themes-match-types.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/google-ads-search-themes-match-types-480x258.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Your exact match keywords in your search campaigns will also take priority over your Performance Max campaigns–so they’re still a must-have for advertisers now.</p>
<div id="best-practices-for-search-themes"></div>
<h2>Best practices for using search themes in Performance Max campaigns</h2>
<p>While nearly all additional data and context will help these Performance Max campaigns continue to improve, advertisers can make the most of search themes in their accounts by following a few tips.</p>
<h3>1. Use search themes to provide information missing from your landing pages</h3>
<p>If you’ve just launched a new product or website, your landing page may not include every single feature, benefit, use, value, and detail that a searcher might consider–and that’s okay! In fact, a clean and simplified <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/landing-page-optimization">landing page may help more people convert</a> on your site.</p>
<p>If Google can’t find that context from your landing page–fret not. Liberally use search themes in your Performance Max campaigns to provide those extra signals to Google so it best understands what your audience may be looking for and can optimize its placements accordingly.</p>
<h3>2. Be direct—especially when using ulterior brand messaging</h3>
<p>What does direct mean? Well, consider the well-known fast-casual restaurant Hooters. If you were to just read their website or its descriptions, you might mistakenly describe their business as a chicken wings restaurant. But we all know that there are a few missing keywords in that description that serve their core value prop and distinguish them from similar competitors.</p>
<p>There’s nothing shameful about having hidden benefits that you don’t expressly convey within your ads or on your website. Maybe your hotel welcomes all but is known best for catering to families, tourists, a religious community, foreign-speaking nationals, or people recovering from a nearby medical procedure, or maybe it has a history of being haunted. You might not want to explicitly write some of that on your website or within your ads—but if someone is specifically looking for a paranormal vacation a Sabbath-friendly accommodation, or a sanctuary nearby their treatment, advertisers can use search themes to better signal their ads within a Performance Max campaign.</p>
<h3>3. Maximize your varied and unique search themes</h3>
<p>Advertisers are allowed up to 25 search themes within each asset group. Generally, the more signals you can provide to Google, the better your Performance Max campaigns will perform. However, quantity isn’t the only factor in quality.</p>
<p>Treat your search themes similar to how you’d treat broad match keywords in your search campaigns–make sure that they aren’t effectively the same signal. For example, the search themes “car” and “automobile” will reach the exact same audience and won’t improve performance incrementally.</p>
<h3>4. Consider competitor terms as search themes</h3>
<p>Especially if you’re a new brand on the market–this will help Google more quickly understand who your prospects are currently searching for. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/06/12/bidding-on-competitor-brands">Google allows bidding on your competitors&#8217; keywords</a> (in many cases) within your search campaigns and includes your competitor&#8217;s brands and product names as search themes. Before implementing this strategy, however, make sure that you understand any local laws or regulations about how you can advertise on competitor brands and trademarks.</p>
<h3>5. Use traditional search campaigns alongside your Performance Max campaigns</h3>
<p>Search themes are a powerful signal to add to your Performance Max campaigns. Even though your Performance Max campaigns will automatically target the search network, don’t neglect the importance of your search campaigns on their own.</p>
<p>Use search themes within your Performance Max campaigns to find new placements and scale incremental traffic and continue to apply that found insight to your search campaigns. As you build your search campaigns, be sure to incorporate exact match keywords so that they take priority over your Performance Max search theme signals, and you can continue to target, optimize, and refine your newfound traffic.</p>
<h2>Use search themes the right way in Performance Max campaigns</h2>
<p>Google’s new search themes beta will help advertisers share their human expertise and provide better signals to their machine learning powered Performance Max campaigns. Search themes gives you a little more control over your Performance Max campaigns, making them more effective and tailored for your audience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It can be challenging for local businesses to break through and get found–particularly online. Local SEO has grown in importance over the past few years for businesses who want to dominate the SERPs within a particular city or region. But even with the best SEO strategy, you&#8217;re still not likely to own the first (or second, or third!) spot for local searches&#8211;especially those with purchase intent. Those belong to local search ads.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Every result above the fold is a paid search result.</em></p>
<p>But showing up in these coveted spots requires expertise in a number of areas. You need to bid on the right keywords, have the right ad strategy, and target the right locations.</p>

<h2>5 common pitfalls of setting your Google Ads location targeting</h2>
<p>When you create a campaign in Google Ads, you have near-limitless location targeting options to choose from. Targeting the whole world, country, state, city, or zip code–the steps are easy and nearly identical.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-setup.webp" alt="google ads location targeting set up" width="936" height="383" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76512" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-setup.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-setup-480x196.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But that simplicity and ease with endless choice often cause advertisers to make mistakes before their first ads are even live.</p>

<h3>1. Don’t make decisions with your gut!</h3>
<p>All humans are biased, and we over-appreciate our own experiences. Don’t let your experiences blind your marketing. You’re likely the most experienced searcher regarding your own business–and your prospective customers certainly have a different background than you.</p>
<p>You might assume that only people in your business’s town or neighborhood would become customers. Still, you might be surprised at how far people are prepared to travel to find a dentist, doctor, or lawyer they trust (or how far they’ll travel to get away from the options in their own backyards!).</p>
<p>Instead of considering just your immediate area, view data within <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/02/17/ga4-features-for-advertisers">Google Analytics</a> to see where past visitors came from and how well they converted on your site. You may be surprised to see how intentionally people might search for your business, even several cities or states away.</p>
<h3>2. Don’t target areas based on their demographic profile</h3>
<p>You see your customers every day, and you likely know them the best! <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">Understanding your target audience</a> will be key to building your campaigns, but it might lead you astray when setting up your location-targeting settings. Towns and cities might have very different demographic profiles, but none are strictly homogenous. Even if your target audience is more concentrated in one area, they will search for you wherever they are.</p>
<p>Instead of strictly targeting areas based on their demographic profile, consider improving your ads to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/31/detailed-demographics">target users based on their demographics</a> and other audience signals.</p>
<h3>3. Don’t over-rely on your CRM data for your customers’ locations</h3>
<p>If you’re <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collecting data</a> from your past customers–you’re setting yourself up to make better decisions in both your business and advertising. But when it comes to their customers&#8217; location data in your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/09/crm-for-small-business">CRM</a>, take that with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>Remember that their home address isn’t always where they’re searching. Especially since <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/google-search-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly two-thirds</a> of searches in the US are coming from mobile devices, your customers are likely finding you while they’re searching at home, at work, and everywhere else they go.</p>
<p>Your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/12/first-party-data">first-party customer data</a> is among the most powerful tools to optimize your Google Ads campaigns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/types-of-customer-data.webp" alt="types of customer data" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76534" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/types-of-customer-data.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/types-of-customer-data-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Use your CRM data to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/10/21/calculate-roi-offline-transactions">measure offline conversions</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/11/02/adwords-customer-match-setup">create customized audiences with Customer Match</a>. But when setting up location targeting, use your customer’s location data as a starting point for your analysis, not the end.</p>
<h3>4. Be cautious of radius targeting</h3>
<p>A common approach for many local businesses is to set their campaigns’ location as a few-mile radius around their storefront. It’s a simple approach that can help you ensure that you’re reaching your local audience in all directions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-radius-targeting.webp" alt="google ads location targeting - radius targeting setup screen" width="738" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76513" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-radius-targeting.webp 738w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-radius-targeting-480x390.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 738px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1722043?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">radius targeting</a> is deceptively simple–setting a radius of “a few miles” can quickly escalate to your ads reaching a much larger audience than you intended. Agreeing to “target a 10-mile radius” might quickly sound like it’s twice the area of “targeting a 5-mile radius”–but it’s actually not. That 10-mile radius area is <strong><em>four times as large</em></strong> as that 5-mile radius area. Remember–a circle&#8217;s area grows exponentially with its radius&#8217;s size!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-area-of-circle.webp" alt="google ads location targeting - radius of circle" width="448" height="314" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76514" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-area-of-circle.webp 448w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-area-of-circle-300x210.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px" /></p>
<p>Be aware of that verbal trick when you set up your radius targeting. Even if unintentional, your agency or marketing team may increase your reach (and necessary budget) significantly more than you first hear.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-increase-radius.webp" alt="google ad location targeting - increase radius" width="936" height="266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76515" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-increase-radius.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-increase-radius-480x136.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Of course, the opposite is also true. If you’re a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/09/free-and-low-budget-marketing-ideas">local business with a limited budget</a>, an effective way to reign in your campaigns’ needed budget is simply to reduce the size of your targeting radius. This verbal trick can be a sneaky way to get a proud business owner or stakeholder to agree to a significant cut in their campaign’s ambitious reach without sounding like you’re cutting your targeting too much.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-decrease-targeting.webp" alt="google ads location targeting - decrease location targeting" width="936" height="252" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76516" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-decrease-targeting.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-decrease-targeting-480x129.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>5. Revisit your targeting regularly</h3>
<p>Once your campaigns are up and running, it’s easy not to look back at their settings. After all, campaigns require enough <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/adwords-optimization">regular review and optimization</a> of their keywords, negative keywords, ads, assets, bids, and account structure. But still, too many advertisers never revisit the location settings they launched their campaigns with. Even if perfect at the time–people move, cities change, and how people search evolves.</p>
<p>Make it a point to review and revisit your location targeting in your campaigns at least every six months. A campaign that is performing well may be worth expanding into some new areas. Or a campaign that is struggling may have too ambitious reach as-is.</p>

<div id="how-to-analyze-google-ads-location-performance"></div>
<h2>How to analyze your location performance in Google Ads</h2>
<p>Over the years, Google has changed and hidden its reporting for how your ads perform in different geos. Luckily, you can still see exactly where your ads show the most, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/15/google-ads-benchmarks">their costs</a>, and conversions across different geographic areas.</p>
<h3>1. Using the Google Ads location report</h3>
<p>The most straightforward place to start is the most obvious. The locations report directly within Google Ads is readily accessible from the left-hand menu in a campaign. Sometimes hidden at the bottom of the bar, click “Locations &gt; Locations,” and you’ll see a standard report that includes each targeting region you typed into your campaign settings.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-location-report.webp" alt="google ads location report for location targeting" width="936" height="341" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76517" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-location-report.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-location-report-480x175.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you’ve only created one location target in your campaign, this is a trivial report as-is. Even if you were to include several, many advertisers get limited value from this screen.</p>
<p><strong>Let me tell you the trick.</strong> Check off all your targeted locations, and now a new option appears for “Narrow by.” Click Narrow by–and you’ll be amazed at the specificity you can break your Google Ads geo data down. You can break this national data down to the state, county, city, or zip code. Furthermore, you can see data on unique areas like Congressional districts or Nielsen DMAs or areas of interest like Airports and Universities.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-narrow-location.webp" alt="narrow location in google ads location report" width="561" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76518" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-narrow-location.webp 561w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-narrow-location-480x513.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 561px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>2. Using the Google Ads distance report</h3>
<p>The Google Ads distance report is particularly useful to advertisers who use radius targeting. If you’re unsure how large a radius your campaigns should target, the distance report will become your best tool. To access the <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2453994?hl=en#:~:text=Distance%20reports&amp;text=Your%20data%20will%20be%20organized,or%20content%20they'd%20viewed." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads distance report</a>, select the “Reports” icon in the top right corner of Google Ads. From there, select “Predefined reports (Dimensions)” &gt; “Locations” &gt; “Distance.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-distance-report.webp" alt="google ads location targeting - distance report" width="936" height="377" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76519" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-distance-report.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-distance-report-480x193.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The Google Ads distance report will show how your ads perform at different distances from your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/09/19/adwords-location-extensions-guide">Location Assets (formerly Location Extensions)</a>. You can customize the columns to include relevant metrics or further segment the data.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that this report shows cascading radii that grow in size as you get further from your business. Each row’s data includes the one above it–i.e., the data from “Within 5 miles” is also counted in the row for “Within 10 miles.”</p>
<p>To see how searchers behave within these ranges, you can easily export this data into Looker Studio or Excel for quick manipulation. Once exported, some simple subtraction can help you understand how people search and convert at different distances from your location. To know how your ads are performing between 1 and 5 miles away, subject the data in the “Within 1 mile” row of the location report from the data “Within 5 miles.” Repeat that process for further distances, and you’ll begin to see how far is “too far” for your local searchers.</p>

<h2>How to optimize your location performance with bid adjustments in Google Ads</h2>
<p>Now that you have more insight into how your ads perform in different areas, you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/07/google-ads-geotargeting">optimize your targeting</a>. Some easy wins might be to expand your reach by targeting neighboring regions or reducing wasted spend from areas that haven’t converted well for you. But don’t get hung up on the binaries of just targeting or excluding–you can use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/08/05/geotargeting-with-bid-modifiers">location bid adjustments </a>to bid more aggressively for areas near your business where you expect local users to be easier to convert and reduce your bids as a searcher is further away.</p>
<p>Using location bid adjustments, you can still reach audiences far away while prioritizing your spend and focus on a hyper-specific local market.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-optimization.webp" alt="google ads location targeting bid optimization" width="936" height="532" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76522" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-optimization.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/google-ads-location-targeting-optimization-480x273.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h1>Optimize your Google Ads location targeting with ease</h1>
<p>It can be intimidating for local businesses to choose where to target their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/learn/ppc101">PPC campaigns</a>. Google Ads offers advertisers a lot of choice, and it can often feel like you’re risking your limited budget by targeting an area too wide or too far from your backyard.</p>
<p>Luckily, savvy advertisers know how to find data hidden within these geographic reports and use it to find new opportunities to reach prospective customers and minimize your wasted ad spend.</p>
<p>Here are those five <a href="https://www.link-assistant.com/news/top-search-engines.html">mistakes</a> to avoid when it comes to Google Ads location targeting:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t make decisions with your gut!</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t target areas based on their demographic profile</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t over-rely on your CRM data for your customers’ locations</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Be cautious of radius targeting</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Revisit your targeting regularly</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lots of industries can struggle with PPC, but it can feel the hardest when you’re a small business trying to promote your professional services in a small market. Large brands can easily outspend you and dominate search results&#8211;so showing up and sticking out as a local expert can be a real challenge.</p>
<p>Luckily, Microsoft Advertising has an ad type called Professional Service Ads to help advertisers promote their expertise in their target markets. We&#8217;re going to cover everything you need to know about this ad type in this article.</p>

<h2>What are Professional Service Ads?</h2>
<p>Microsoft’s <a href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/post/march-2022/helping-better-connect-consumers-to-professionals?s_int=en-us-gct-web-src_msaweb-sub_blog-flx_professional" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Professional Service Ads</a> are designed to connect service providers to the searchers looking for their help. These ads appear on Bing when a user searches directly for a relevant professional, brand, or issue that they’re looking for help with. Unlike traditional search ads, Professional Service Ads will feature an image and professional details about the advertiser.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/professional-service-ads-example.jpg" alt="microsoft professional service ads example in serp" width="936" height="551" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75667" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/professional-service-ads-example.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/professional-service-ads-example-480x283.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>These new Professional Service Ads can show up atop the Bing SERP, within Bing Maps, and within the Bing Local Answer pack as well.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/professional-service-ads-placements.jpg" alt="microsoft professional service ads placements" width="936" height="554" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75668" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/professional-service-ads-placements.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/professional-service-ads-placements-480x284.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Professional Service Ads are designed with advertisers of all sizes in mind. Whether you’re running a one-man local practice, a regional branch, or a national brand, you can use Professional Service Ads to highlight the talent within your business and attract new customers from any market.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/professional-service-ads-use-cases.jpg" alt="best use cases for microsoft professional service ads " width="936" height="312" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75669" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/professional-service-ads-use-cases.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/professional-service-ads-use-cases-480x160.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Best of all, Microsoft’s Professional Service Ads can show alongside your existing search ads on the same SERP and compete in a different ad auction. This means these new Professional Service Ads could allow you to serve multiple ads on the same SERP and increase your visibility without increasing your current <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/06/bing-ads-performance-benchmarks">search ads’ CPC</a>.</p>
<p>Professional Service Ads don’t require keywords or text ads. Instead, advertisers can provide important details about their services and business directly to Microsoft <a href="https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/60134/1">via a unique feed.</a> This allows them to customize how their ads show, what job types they can help with, and contact information for interested prospective clients.</p>

<h2>What industries can use Professional Service Ads?</h2>
<p>Today, Microsoft Advertising supports Professional Service Ads for the following industries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insurance Services</li>
<li>Tax Services</li>
<li>Real Estate Services</li>
<li><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/home-services-search-advertising-benchmarks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Services</a></li>
<li>Doctor &amp; Clinic Ads</li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft is expected to roll out Professional Service Ads to more industries throughout the year and has announced that Lawyer &amp; Legal Service Ads as well as Financial Advisor Ads are on their future roadmap.</p>
<div id="differences"></div>
<h2>Google Local Service Ads (LSAs) vs. Microsoft Professional Service Ads: What&#8217;s the difference?</h2>
<p>Microsoft’s newest ad format may look very familiar to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/11/google-local-service-ads">Google’s Local Service Ads</a> to most searchers. They both appear at the top of the SERP and the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/02/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps">local map pack</a> for relevant local searches and feature a photo, reviews, and the location of nearby advertisers. However, advertisers will notice some major differences between Google’s Local Services ads and Microsoft’s Professional Service Ads.</p>
<h3>1. Professional Service Ads have a simpler setup than LSAs</h3>
<p>Google’s Local Service Ads are a powerful tool but can be painful to set up. Not only do you have to create your own Local Service Ads business profile outside of Google Ads, but depending on your industry, you may have to submit additional license and insurance information and your team may need to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-guarantee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete a series of background checks</a> from one of Google’s partners before your Local Service Ad ever shows.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/google-guarantee-promise-screenshot.jpg" alt="the google guarantee process is one difference between google local services ads and microsoft professional ads" width="936" height="431" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75670" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/google-guarantee-promise-screenshot.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/google-guarantee-promise-screenshot-480x221.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Microsoft’s Professional Services Ads are designed to be set up quickly and easily. You can create and manage these ads directly within your existing Microsoft Advertising account alongside your other search and audience campaigns. Professional Service Ads take data directly from a feed to serve and do not require a lengthy onboarding or <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/google-guarantee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">verification proces</a>s like Google’s LSAs.</p>
<h3>2. Professional Service Ads have more flexible management and optimization</h3>
<p>Google’s Local Service Ads have a lot of reach and advertisers can freely control and update important parts of their ads, such as their weekly budget or job type. But LSA advertisers lack some of the freedom to optimize or update their Local Service Ads like they would any other Google Ads campaign. Google <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/03/google-search-terms-report-changes">doesn’t show any search terms</a> from their Local Service Ads and doesn’t allow negative keywords either. Optimizations like bid adjustments or even daily budgets are also not available for Local Service Ads.</p>
<p>Creating a Google Local Services Ad offers limited room for differentiation. Local Services Ads allow advertisers to <a href="https://support.google.com/localservices/answer/7549347?visit_id=638179642389787244-659734732&amp;hl=en&amp;rd=1">highlight limited information</a> from a checklist of options within their business bio. Google also has very strict <a href="https://support.google.com/localservices/answer/9091766">policies for your photos and headshots</a> which can leave even the most unique business serving nearly identical Local Service Ads to their competitors.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s Professional Services ads offer similar levels of control and optimization as their other search campaigns–which include the ability to set and control daily budgets, bid adjustments, review search terms, and add negative keywords.</p>
<p>Additionally, the business data feeds used for Microsoft’s Professional Service Ads allow advertisers to provide much more customized details to optimize their ads for specific job types, highlight different messages, or test more dynamic images to show alongside their ads.</p>
<h3>3. Differences in pricing</h3>
<p>Google’s Local Service Ads are unique from the rest of their search ads. Instead of being charged per every click, advertisers are charged per each lead that comes directly from their LSAs.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s Professional Service Ads are priced per ad click, like most of their other campaigns.</p>
<div id="howto"></div>
<h2>How to get started with Microsoft Professional Service Ads</h2>
<p>To get started, you’ll first need to <a href="https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/60135/-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create a data feed for Microsoft’s Professional Service Ads</a>. For individual practitioners, this can be a simple spreadsheet that you upload once into Microsoft Advertising to get started. Larger organizations may need a more dynamic approach to creating and managing a feed as their team of professionals, services, and specialties continue to change.</p>
<p>This data feed is just a structured way to pass along details about your business to Microsoft so that it can better target your ad and make it easier for prospective clients to contact you. While it may seem overwhelmingly technical at first glance, most of the information within your feed is simple to provide, mundane, and trivial for most professionals.</p>
<h3>Create a Professional Service Ads feed</h3>
<ol>
<li>I recommend starting by downloading <a href="https://ui.ads.microsoft.com/campaign/vnext/feeds/dynamicdata?aid=141371798&amp;cid=251051268&amp;uid=98339929" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this template</a> from Microsoft. This includes all the required and optional attributes for these campaigns properly formatted and includes sample values for each attribute.</li>

</tbody>
</table>
<ol start="3">
<li>Provide as much relevant information on the optional attributes as possible. The more information you provide, the more detail that Microsoft has to optimize your Professional Service Ads targeting and trigger your ad for relevant searches.</li>
<li>Name your “target campaign(s)” and “target ad group(s).” These are required attributes that will need to match the name of the campaigns and ad groups you build later on. While most businesses may be able to run just one campaign with one ad group to launch their Professional Service Ads, if you ever want to structure your account to have multiple different campaigns or ad groups, you will need to update these attributes in your feed.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can update your feeds at any time to add new teammates, services, details, or adjust your account structure.</p>
<h3>Upload a Professional Services Ad feed</h3>
<p>Once you’ve prepped your data feeds, save them as a CSV, TSV, XLSX, or ZIP file and log in to your Microsoft Advertising account.</p>
<ol>
<li>From the top menu in Microsoft Advertising, select &#8220;Tools&#8221; &gt; &#8220;Business data.&#8221;<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/professional-service-ads-upload-data-feed.jpg" alt="microsoft professional service ads - add data feed" width="936" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75673" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/professional-service-ads-upload-data-feed.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/professional-service-ads-upload-data-feed-480x215.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></li>
<li>Here, from the left-hand menu, select “Dynamic Data Feeds.”</li>
<li>Click on the blue “Upload” drop-down and select “Professional Services.”<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/professional-service-ads-dynamic-data-feeds.jpg" alt="microsoft professional service ads - dynamic data feed" width="424" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75674" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/professional-service-ads-dynamic-data-feeds.jpg 424w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/professional-service-ads-dynamic-data-feeds-212x300.jpg 212w" sizes="(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px" /></li>
<li>Name your data feed and select the file to upload. At this time, you can preview your feed to troubleshoot any issues and then upload the feed to Microsoft Advertising.</li>
<li>(Optional) If you anticipate that you’ll be constantly updating this feed because your company has a large, dynamic team or because you will be making regular changes to your availability, you can schedule Microsoft to import a dynamic feed from a URL. Click on the recently uploaded feed and select “Schedules” to set a regular schedule for Microsoft to reimport this feed.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Create a Professional Service Ad campaign</h3>
<p>Once your Professional Service Feed is created and uploaded, creating a Professional Service campaign is very similar to your other Microsoft Advertising campaigns, with a few notable quirks.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/11/21/ppc-keyword-research-guide">search campaign</a> and name it <em>exactly</em> as you’ve named it within the “Target Campaign” attribute within your feed. If this doesn’t match that attribute exactly, it will not serve any Professional Service Ads.</li>
<li>Follow the usual steps to set your campaign’s budget, location targeting, and other campaign settings. You can add a disclaimer to your ad during this process. Do <strong>not</strong> enable <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/10/dynamic-search-ads">dynamic search ads</a>.</li>
<li>Create your ad group and name it exactly as you’ve named it within the “Target Ad Group” attribute within your feed. Again, if this doesn’t match exactly, it will not serve any Professional Service Ads.</li>
<li>You’ll need to create a “placeholder” keyword for this ad group. Professional Service Ads don’t use keywords to target their ads, but in order for the ad group to function, there needs to be an active keyword. I recommend creating a long-tailed exact-match keyword with no expected search volume to prevent this placeholder from serving ads.</li>
<li>You’ll also need to create a “placeholder” Responsive Search Ad for the ad group. Similarly, this Responsive Search Ad will never show, but its Final URL will be featured as the Display URL within your Professional Search Ads. The headlines and descriptions, however, will not be included.</li>
<li>Hit save and launch your new Professional Services Ads!</li>
</ol>
<div id="bestpractices"></div>
<h2>Professional Service Ads best practices</h2>
<p>Ready to get started with Professional Service Ads? Use these best practices to make sure your campaigns are successful.</p>
<h3><strong></strong>1. Run Professional Service Ads along with traditional search campaigns</h3>
<p>Professional Service Ads should be treated as a great compliment to your search ads, not as a replacement. By running both simultaneously, you can have multiple ads appear on the same SERP and draw more attention to your practice. Since Professional Service Ads compete in a separate ad auction from text ads, you shouldn’t expect your search ads to have any change in performance by running Professional Service Ads.</p>
<h3><strong></strong>2. Start with the right budget</h3>
<p>Microsoft recommends that national brands looking to promote their services across the entirety of the United States should start with between $100-500 daily budget for their Professional Service Ads. Local businesses need much less budget to target their market. Microsoft recommends that local businesses start with 20% of their current PPC budget on Professional Service Ads for the markets they target.</p>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Worried you&#8217;re wasting spend in Google Ads?

<h3><strong></strong>3. Pay attention to bidding</h3>
<p>Bidding is managed at the ad group level. To get started, Microsoft recommends using manual or enhanced <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/15/google-ads-benchmarks">CPC</a> bidding and setting the bid between $3-5 CPC. You can freely adjust this based on the performance of your ads.</p>
<h3><strong></strong>4. Review your search terms</h3>
<p>Unlike Google’s Local Search Ads, these Professional Service Ads will collect data on the search terms they triggered for as well as their associated costs and conversions. Without keywords in your Professional Service Ad campaigns, Microsoft may trigger your ads for some unexpected search terms, so plan to review your traffic regularly and add negative keywords as you see fit.</p>
<h3><strong></strong>5. Include audiences</h3>
<p>These Professional Service Ads allow you to refine your targeting with demographics and audiences, like your other search campaigns. You can use remarketing, in-market, custom audiences, or even <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/24/bing-ads-linkedin-profile-targeting">LinkedIn profile targeting</a> in Microsoft Advertising to target, exclude, or adjust your bids for more valuable prospects.</p>
<h2>Maximize Professional Service Ads performance</h2>
<p>This new ad type to Microsoft Advertising is an interesting one for many industries. There are certainly advantages to being an early adopter, too. <a href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/post/march-2022/helping-better-connect-consumers-to-professionals?s_int=en-us-gct-web-src_msaweb-sub_blog-flx_professional" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Microsoft</a>, Professional Service Ad campaigns on their network were already seeing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>60% higher conversion rate</strong>, when compared to traditional search ads on their network.</li>
<li><strong>67% lower CPA, </strong>when compared to traditional search ads on their network.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those results may sound fantastic on their own–but keep in most <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/11/06/bing-ads-performance-benchmarks">advertisers already see significantly lower CPC and CPA on Microsoft Advertising when compared to Google Ads</a>–so these new Professional Service Ads are even more powerful for advertisers to attract new clients.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Location Assets (formerly known as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/09/19/adwords-location-extensions-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Location Extensions</a>) have been a staple of any good local business’s Google Ads account for over a decade. Although their name has changed a few times since their introduction, they’ve always functioned the same and served the same value–simply link your Google Business Profile to Google Ads and your ads will begin to show your location to searchers nearby.</p>
<p>After decades of this simple but effective design, Google recently began automatically enhancing its location assets to <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2404182?utm_source=awfe&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20249167#merchant_photos&amp;zippy=%2Copt-out-of-using-merchant-photos-in-local-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">include an image of their local business</a> alongside their address and hours. This new feature is designed to help your ads stand out on the busy SERP, improve ad performance, and reinforce trust in your local business.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/location-assets-enhancements-example.jpg" alt="google ads location assets enhancements - example via google search" width="936" height="330" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75836" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/location-assets-enhancements-example.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/location-assets-enhancements-example-480x169.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://twitter.com/darcyburk/status/1674408251935318017/photo/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll walk through:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to feature your business&#8217;s images in your Google Ads location assets</li>
<li>Best practices for your business&#8217;s images in location assets</li>
<li>How to opt out of showing your images in location assets</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s get started.</p>
<h2>How to feature your business&#8217;s images in your Google Ads location assets</h2>
<p>To take advantage of this new feature, all advertisers need to do is maintain their Google Business Profile, have it linked to Google Ads, and have their location extensions active in their campaigns. Google will automatically highlight any of your Google Business Profile’s merchant photos.</p>
<p>Your Google Ads location <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-assets">assets</a> will only include images that you’ve uploaded directly to your GBP’s Merchant Photos–it will not pull any photos submitted to your GBP from past visitors or from reviews, so you’ll always set the right impression with your ads’ images.</p>
<h3>1. Create and manage your Google Business Profile’s merchant photos</h3>
<p>For your Google Ads’ location assets to feature your business’s images, you’ll first need to upload at least one merchant photo to your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/08/what-is-google-my-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Business Profile</a>. To upload merchant photos, first sign into your Google Business Profile and select “Add Photo.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/location-assets-enhancements-merchant-photo.jpg" alt="location assets google ads - where to manage images for merchant center" width="936" height="411" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75837" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/location-assets-enhancements-merchant-photo.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/location-assets-enhancements-merchant-photo-480x211.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>2. Upload your images</h3>
<p>You’ll then have three options for the type of photo to upload.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Logo: </strong>Your logo photo will help you keep your brand consistent and identifiable across Google. Your logo icon will appear alongside any posts from your profile or anytime you respond to a question or review.</li>
<li><strong>Cover photo: </strong>Your cover photo is the money shot – this photo is most likely to show up first in your Google Business Profile listing and will be used the most in your Google location assets images.</li>
<li><strong>Photo: </strong>These are supplementary photos that will show in your Google Business Profile listing. They’re often visible alongside your Cover photo, so it’s worth including at least several different and dynamic images of your business.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Remove outdated photos</h3>
<p>If your business photos are outdated or poor quality, you can also remove any old photos from your Google Business Profile. Just log into your Google Business Profile and select anywhere in the photos section. Navigate to the “By owner” section and select the photo you wish to remove. In the top right corner, you should be able to select a trash can “delete” icon to remove it from your profile.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/location-assets-enhancements-remove-google-business-image.jpg" alt="location assets enhancement - remove google business image from profile" width="936" height="572" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75844" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/location-assets-enhancements-remove-google-business-image.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/location-assets-enhancements-remove-google-business-image-480x293.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>

<h2>Best practices for Google Business Profile photos and Google Ads location assets</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/03/google-my-business-optimization">Optimizing your Google Business Profile</a> isn’t just important for your Google Ads location assets. Your Google Business Profile is likely the first thing searchers will see when they find you online, and it’s a huge part of Google’s own <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local SEO</a> ranking algorithm.</p>
<p>Spend the time to completely fill out your Google Business Profile and regularly update it to highlight to both Google and searchers alike that you’re an active, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-respond-to-google-reviews-with-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">responsive</a>, and trustworthy business.</p>
<h3>1. Prioritize a high-quality cover photo</h3>
<p>Your cover photo will usually be shown first and most prominently on the SERP, alongside your GBP, and now alongside your Google Ads. Ensure that your cover photo best represents the image of your brand and is accurate to your business. Use proper lighting, focus, and minimal alterations. Google recommends your cover photo to be at least 720 x 720 in size.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/location-assets-enhancements-example-plumbing.jpg" alt="location assets enhancements - example of ad with image as part of location asset" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75848" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/location-assets-enhancements-example-plumbing.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/location-assets-enhancements-example-plumbing-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>2. Include a variety of different photos</h3>
<p>Your cover photo may get the most attention, but it won’t always show alone. A prospective visitor is likely to browse several images online before visiting in person. Consider including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Several exterior images: </strong>To help customers recognize your business as they approach. Include different images to highlight how your storefront looks from different directions, parking and transit options, as well as how your business looks at night.</li>
<li><strong>Interior images: </strong>To highlight the atmosphere that customers should expect in your store. Highlight color product displays, seasonal areas, waiting rooms, common areas, and amenities that customers may want to see.</li>
<li><strong>Staff photos: </strong>To highlight your great team and present a more personal side of your business. Authentic photos that show your team working together earns trust in your business. Avoid including formal headshots.</li>
</ul>

<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'>Make sure your listings are up to par with LocaliQ&#8217;s <a href="https://localiq.com/free-business-listings-grader/?cid=Web_WS_InContentTextLink_Freemium_Listings&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free Business Listings Grader</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></div></div>
<h3>3. Create a Google Ads Logo asset</h3>
<p>Your Google Business Profile will highlight your logo alongside your posts and responses automatically. You also highlight that same logo alongside all your Google ads to reinforce your brand consistently on the SERP. Creating a logo asset is a simple and effective way to improve your ads performance, but you’ll need to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/13/google-advertiser-verification">verify your Google Ads account</a> before you can implement it.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/location-assets-enhancements-logo-asset.jpg" alt="location assets - google logo asset" width="701" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75838" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/location-assets-enhancements-logo-asset.jpg 701w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/location-assets-enhancements-logo-asset-480x411.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 701px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>4. Enhance your ads with image assets</h3>
<p>Your location assets and images from your Google Business Profile will automatically appear when a user is searching for you locally–but searchers outside of your area may not always see these assets.</p>
<p>Include <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/21/google-ads-image-extensions">image assets</a> in your Google Ads campaigns to provide more visual aspects to your search ads, whether or not a user is searching locally or not. Image assets are also more flexible and don’t need to be directly related to your physical location.</p>
<p>Use them to highlight images of more seasonal events, sales, products, and services that wouldn’t always be appropriate to be prominently displayed on your Google Business Profile.</p>
<h2>How to opt out of automatically including photos in your local Google Ads</h2>
<p>Some businesses won’t always have the most aesthetic Google Business Profile photos and may want to opt out of including photos of their location within Google Ads. Luckily for them, these new features for location assets can be turned off and allow advertisers to just show their location alongside their ad without any photos.</p>
<p>To opt out of automatically including photos in your local Google Ads, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Within Google Ads, select “Ads and Assets” from the left-hand bar, then select “Assets.”</li>
<li>Under the “Associations view,” select the 3-dot “More” icon. Then select “Account-level automated assets.”</li>
<li>From this view, select the three-dot “More” icon again. Now select the option “Advanced settings”</li>
<li>Under “Automatic locations,” there is a check box to “Grant Google Ads license to use merchant photos and other rich media from the linked Google Business Profiles in the advertising campaigns from this account.” Unselect this option and hit save. This will prevent Google from pulling any photos from your Google Business Profile to serve alongside your ads.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Show off your business images in location assets</h2>
<p>These new enhancements to location assets should be valuable for local advertisers and help their ads stick out from their competition on the SERP. As these features continue to roll out to more advertisers, now is a perfect time to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/optimize-google-my-business-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review your Google Business Profile</a> and ensure your business is prominently displayed in local searches.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Google recently announced that Discovery Ads will be replaced by Demand Gen campaigns. Get an understanding of what this means for your account along with tips to prepare for this change. </p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/22/demand-gen-campaigns">Google Ads Demand Gen Campaigns: What to Know About the Discovery Ads Upgrade</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in May, Google took the stage at <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/23/google-marketing-live" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Marketing Live 2023</a> to share its plans to change and improve Google Ads in the coming year. The event was huge—with over 20 announcements on how Google Ads would be enhancing its new search experiences, AI features, measurement, and ad creatives. But one announcement, in particular, stood out on its own—the introduction of a new campaign type called Demand Gen campaigns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-google-marketing-live.jpg" alt="google ads demand gen campaigns - google marketing live recording screenshot" width="986" height="518" class="aligncenter wp-image-75547 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-google-marketing-live.jpg 986w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-google-marketing-live-980x515.jpg 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-google-marketing-live-480x252.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 986px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Demand Gen campaigns were created to help businesses reach consumers outside of the text-heavy search engine results page on more visual and entertaining placements like YouTube, Discovery, and Gmail.</p>
<p>With over 3 billion monthly users on these Google-owned placements, we’ve seen that they’ve become a powerful place to influence potential new customers before they even begin to search. Google reports that <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/new-ai-powered-ads-to-drive-demand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">91%</a> of consumers have taken action after discovering a new brand on these properties.</p>
<p>After months of waiting, <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/13859703?sjid=18050058259286287018-NA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google recently announced</a> that its new Demand Gen campaigns would be available to advertisers in an open beta. One surprise though—Demand Gen campaigns would be replacing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/09/google-discovery-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Discovery Ads</a>, starting later this year.</p>
<h2>What are Google Ads Demand Gen campaigns?</h2>
<p>Unlike its flagship search ads, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/23/google-marketing-live#:~:text=3.%20Demand%20Gen%20campaigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demand Gen campaigns</a> are designed to reach users before they even think to actively search for a brand. Instead, Google Demand Gen campaigns are designed to reach new audiences and generate interest from users of Google’s more visual and entertaining properties. Google Demand Gen campaigns serve ads across the Google Discovery Feed, Gmail, and YouTube—including the YouTube feed, In-Stream, and Shorts within the same campaign.</p>
<p>This new Demand Gen campaign type feels like a natural expansion to <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/local-social-media-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social marketers </a>who use similar visual creative and audience targeting settings across popular platforms like <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/facebook-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook ads</a> or TikTok ads. However, Google already has released and had success with a similar type of campaign, called Discovery Ads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-placement.jpg" alt="google demand gen campaigns - placement examples" width="921" height="423" class="aligncenter wp-image-75557 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-placement.jpg 921w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-placement-480x220.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 921px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>What’s the difference between Google Ads Demand Gen Campaigns and Google Discovery Ads?</h2>
<p>Google’s new Demand Gen Ads are similar to its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/17/discovery-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discovery Ads</a>. Both campaigns reach new audiences across Gmail, YouTube, and the Google Discovery Feed. They also both serve visually impressive ads that swipe, look, and act like common social ad formats.</p>
<p>Since their introduction in mid-2020, many advertisers have used Google Discovery Ads as an inexpensive way to reach and convert a large audience with their existing social creative across these Google properties.</p>
<p>So, why is Google replacing its already successful Discovery Ads with new Demand Gen campaigns? Google Demand Gen campaigns offer a few major enhancements:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-versus-discovery-ads-chart.jpg" alt="google demand gen campaigns - comparison with discovery ads chart" width="900" height="498" class="aligncenter wp-image-75546 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-versus-discovery-ads-chart.jpg 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-versus-discovery-ads-chart-480x266.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/13859703?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<h3>1. Expanded reach on YouTube</h3>
<p>Google Discovery Ads currently reach users across the Discovery Feed, Gmail, and parts of YouTube, such as the Home Page and YouTube Feed. That’s impressive on its own—but Google Discovery Ads miss the biggest opportunity on YouTube: within its massive video content.</p>
<p>Demand Gen campaigns include all the reach of Google Discovery Ads as well as YouTube In-Stream and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-make-youtube-shorts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube Shorts</a>. This additional mix of both short-form and long-form video ad content will significantly increase the reach of these campaigns across YouTube.</p>
<h3>2. More video ad formats</h3>
<p>Within Google Discovery Ads, advertisers could feature either product images or custom image ads across Gmail, YouTube, and Discovery. But Demand Gen campaigns adding reach across YouTube video content means advertisers can now also include up to five videos within their campaigns, in addition to multiple <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/13704860" target="_blank" rel="noopener">images, headlines, descriptions, logos, and calls to action</a>.</p>
<p>These videos will be shown throughout current Google Discovery and YouTube formats. These video ad formats will show different assets and act differently across Google’s different properties and screen sizes, so be sure to include varying lengths and aspect ratios so that your videos can fit in natively across all the new video inventory.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-ad-buildout.jpg" alt="google ads demand gen campaign - ad buildout screen" width="900" height="424" class="aligncenter wp-image-75545 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-ad-buildout.jpg 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-demand-gen-campaigns-ad-buildout-480x226.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>3. New ad creative experiments and tools</h3>
<p>Many campaigns allow advertisers to preview how their different text, image, and video assets might look across different ad placements. But since Google’s new Demand Gen campaigns are designed to <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite30BestWaysToPromote.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Marketing_The30BestWaysToPromoteYourBusiness_Download">promote your business</a> across the most visual and immersive content in Google’s ecosystem, Google has introduced a new ad preview tool specifically for Demand Gen campaigns, which allows advertisers to freely preview how different creatives will look across different screens and placements.</p>
<p>Beyond just previewing how your assets will look before you launch your campaigns, advertisers can also create <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/13719071" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A/B experiments</a> to test different image and video creatives in their Demand Gen campaigns.

<h3>4. Additional bidding options</h3>
<p>Google’s Discovery campaigns were designed to help advertisers reach and convert new audiences. As such, they worked best with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/17/how-to-set-up-google-ads-enhanced-conversions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhanced conversion tracking</a> and only supported <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/06/broad-match-smart-bidding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smart-bidding</a> options such as &#8220;maximize conversions&#8221; or &#8220;maximize conversion value&#8221; that come with the ability to either set a target CPA or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/02/target-roas">ROAS</a> goal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Demand Gen offers the same smart-bidding options, but also allows advertisers to use “maximize clicks” as a bid strategy. This may be more appropriate for advertisers who might have <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/08/attribution-models" target="_blank" rel="noopener">longer or more complicated conversion paths</a>, aim to drive offline sales, or simply just <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/drive-more-traffic-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promote more traffic to their website</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/google-ads-pricing-automated-bidding-vs-smart-bidding-e1692728180344.png" alt="google ads pricing - automated bidding strategies" width="716" height="395" class="aligncenter wp-image-57765 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/google-ads-pricing-automated-bidding-vs-smart-bidding-e1692728180344.png 716w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/google-ads-pricing-automated-bidding-vs-smart-bidding-e1692728180344-480x270.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 716px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>5. More reporting options</h3>
<p>Demand Gen campaigns are designed to drive direct action and conversions—but they’re capable of more than just that. Advertisers have seen countless times that after they&#8217;ve launched ads to a new audience across Display, YouTube, or Social, they soon notice an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/13/cross-network-advertising-brand-search-lift" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase in searches and conversions from their brand campaigns</a>. Google’s Demand Gen campaigns offer more insight into this uplift with their Brand Lift, Search Lift, and Conversion Lift reports.</p>
<h3>6. New audience targeting</h3>
<p>Google Ads finally <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/12/13/google-sunsetting-similar-audiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sunset its popular Similar Audiences</a> targeting recently for all campaign types—but Demand Gen campaigns offer something very…similar.</p>
<p>Demand Gen campaigns will have access to a special <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/13541369" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lookalike audience segment</a>. Lookalike segments are audiences that share similar characteristics and behaviors as those from one of your existing first-party audience segments (such as a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/05/google-ads-remarketing-lists" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remarketing list</a> or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/11/02/adwords-customer-match-setup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer list</a>). Advertisers can refine these lookalike audiences to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Narrow: </strong>Reaching the <em>5%</em> of users in your target location that are most similar to your original seed list.</li>
<li><strong>Balanced:</strong> Reaching the <em>5%</em> of users in your target location that are most similar to your original seed list. Google defaults to a balanced lookalike segment unless it’s otherwise adjusted.</li>
<li><strong>Broad: </strong>Reaching the <em>10%</em> of users in your target location that are most similar to your original seed list.</li>
</ul>
<p>Google’s lookalike audiences should feel similar to other social advertising platforms&#8217; audiences, such as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/facebook-lookalike-audiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook’s lookalike audiences</a> which similarly allows advertisers to customize their reach based on how closely users resemble their original seed audience.</p>

<h1>When will Google begin to upgrade my Discovery Ads to Demand Gen Campaigns?</h1>
<p>If you’re excited to begin using Demand Gen campaigns—you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScNc6_ZRNjHaYVnZ-sJ5FxmWrAMagmO5FBj5JBQk-Zcdk2JIQ/viewform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sign up for early beta access here</a>. It may take Google a few weeks to process your submission and enable access within your account. Once enrolled in the beta, any active Discovery campaigns will automatically upgrade to Demand Gen campaigns. You won’t lose any historical data or learnings, but you will no longer be able to manage your Discovery Ads like you did before.</p>
<p>Google announced that in October 2023, all advertisers will have access to create new Demand Gen campaigns. Additionally, advertisers will have the option to upgrade their Discovery campaigns to Demand Gen campaigns.</p>
<p>Then in January 2024, all remaining Discovery campaigns will be automatically upgraded to Demand Gen campaigns. All Discovery campaigns are expected to be automatically upgraded to Demand Gen campaigns by the end of March 2024. During this transition, no action is required from the advertiser. Campaigns will continue to serve, and historical data and learnings will be preserved.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-demand-gen-campaign-timeline.jpg" alt="google ads demand gen campaign s- timeline of switch from discovery ads " width="770" height="458" class="aligncenter wp-image-75543 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-demand-gen-campaign-timeline.jpg 770w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-demand-gen-campaign-timeline-480x286.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 770px, 100vw" /></p>
<h1>Best practices for Google Demand Gen campaigns</h1>
<p>Here are some tips to prepare for the sunset of Discovery campaigns in favor of Demand Gen campaigns:</p>
<h3>1. Plan your migration early</h3>
<p>Google will upgrade any Discovery campaigns you have active, even if you don’t take any action. Although this isn’t likely to interrupt your ads from running or negatively impact your performance, you’re missing out on all the best features of Demand Gen campaigns by doing nothing.</p>
<p>Plan ahead and spend a few minutes upgrading your Discovery campaigns to take advantage of the extra reach across YouTube and upload new video formats to your campaigns. There’s a huge advantage for advertisers to get access to all this new reach at a discount before others make the migration in early 2024!</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/new-ai-powered-ads-to-drive-demand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here</a>, Google highlighted businesses that have participated in the beta version of Demand Generation campaigns early on:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-demand-generation-campaigns-testimonial.jpg" alt="google ads demand generation campaigns - beta testimonial" width="664" height="370" class="aligncenter wp-image-75559 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-demand-generation-campaigns-testimonial.jpg 664w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-demand-generation-campaigns-testimonial-480x267.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>2. Prepare and refresh your creatives</h3>
<p>Demand Gen campaigns will feature your ads in very visual, scrolling, immersive settings—like YouTube, Gmail, and Discover. Make sure you set the right impression by providing several <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/13704860" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contrasting images and videos.</a> Google recommends repurposing high-quality image and video creatives from your email and social campaigns to help your branding stick in these new placements.</p>
<p>For your new video assets, be sure to grab the attention of your audience within the first 5 seconds of the ad. Most users will skip your In-Stream ad or YouTube short within the first 5 seconds—so make sure that you include your solution, brand name, or problem statement early on to leave an impression.</p>
<h3>3. Build your audiences</h3>
<p>Google’s lookalike segments have a huge potential for these new Demand Gen campaigns, but they first require you to build the original seed audiences using your own first-party data—such as a remarketing audience or customer list. Remember, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/12/first-party-data">first-party data</a> is any information your organization owns:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/zero-first-second-third-party-data-e1692730268585.png" alt="zero, frist, second, third-party data" width="719" height="421" class="aligncenter wp-image-57202 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/zero-first-second-third-party-data-e1692730268585.png 719w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/zero-first-second-third-party-data-e1692730268585-480x270.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 719px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>An audience must have at least 1,000 unique matched users to be used for targeting or generating a lookalike audience, so smaller businesses may need to prepare in advance to build up those lists. For example, you may need to focus on increasing traffic to your website first so that you can collect enough data to create a list for a lookalike audience.</p>
<p>Lastly, note that (once your list is large enough to be eligible) lookalike audiences may take a few days to populate.</p>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'>Get ahead on building your Demand Gen audience lists! Use the <a href="https://localiq.com/website-grader/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LocaliQ website grader</a> to identify ways to improve your website and get more traffic fast.</div></div>
<h3>4. Revisit your conversion tracking</h3>
<p>Particularly after the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/07/07/google-analytics-4-event-tracking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent GA4 migration</a>, it’s wise to review that your conversion tracking is firing correctly and completely. Demand Gen campaigns are designed to target prospects who may be newer to your brand or solution and are likely more “mid-funnel” than your search campaigns.</p>
<p>With that in mind, Google recommends optimizing for “lightweight conversion events (such as ‘add to cart’) instead of necessarily larger events—like making a large purchase or filling out a complex form.&#8221; These smaller conversion actions help feed valuable signals to Google’s bidding and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/21/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheat-sheet">targeting systems</a> in these campaigns so that they can begin to learn and optimize faster.</p>
<h3>5. Budget for success</h3>
<p>Although Google Demand Gen campaigns can be created and run for as little as $1 a day, lower budgets can make optimizing your results a long, difficult process.</p>
<p>Google recommends that advertisers who are using its smart-bidding set a budget at least 15 times their target CPA to allow their Demand Gen campaign to grow and quickly optimize. So, while a lower budget may be effective, it will take longer to optimize toward your overall goals.</p>
<p>That said, advertisers with smaller <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/28/small-business-budget">marketing budgets</a> may benefit from using the maximize clicks bidding strategy to get started and collect lots of data quickly.</p>
<h2>Goodbye Discovery Ads, hello Demand Gen campaigns</h2>
<p>Google Demand Gen campaigns could be a powerful campaign type and complement your existing search and social campaigns. Just be sure to migrate early and take advantage of the new video ad inventory across YouTube, Discover, and Gmail. Additionally, if taking advantage of Demand Gen campaigns still seems like a daunting task, see how our solutions can help you make the most out of key campaign types and placements.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world changes fast—and there are few places that show that change as quickly as the Google SERP. Global events, celebrity gossip, and social trending topics can all dominate our search interests and quickly impact the performance of our PPC campaigns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-top-searches.jpg" alt="google ads automated rules - top searches 2022" width="809" height="364" class="aligncenter wp-image-75036 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-top-searches.jpg 809w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-top-searches-480x216.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 809px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Even the top searches from 2022 already feel outdated! </em></p>
<p>Although the SERP can shift at a minute’s notice, even the most dedicated PPC manager can’t monitor their campaigns 24/7. So how can you keep your ads up to date&#8211;even while you sleep?</p>
<p>Luckily, Google Ads allows PPC managers to use automated rules to monitor, change, and optimize their accounts in advance. With some proper planning and foresight, automatic rules can become a powerful tool in your tool belt.</p>

<h2><strong>What are Google Ads automated rules?</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2472779?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automated rules</a> allow advertisers to schedule changes to be made in their Google Ads account. The genius of automated rules is that they’re nearly infinitely flexible in scheduling changes made to your Google Ads account. You can use an automated rule to post one change or thousands–and can schedule them to run just one time or multiple times a day. You can use them to post big changes–such as pausing every campaign in your account, or the smallest changes–such as emailing you the results of your campaign when you return from vacation.</p>
<p>Microsoft Advertising has <a href="https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/51130/1-500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar automated rules</a> for their advertisers that can be used in conjunction with Google’s automated rules. Alternatively, advertisers can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/25/bing-ads-scheduled-imports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automate importing changes from their Google Ads accounts directly into Microsoft Advertising</a> to keep their campaigns up in sync with Google and up to date.</p>
<div id="how"></div>
<h2><strong>How do you create an automated rule in Google Ads?</strong></h2>
<p>You can create automated rules directly within Google Ads from the &#8220;Tools and settings&#8221; menu. Under &#8220;Bulk Actions,&#8221; select &#8220;Rules.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-navigation.jpg" alt="google ads automated rules - navigation menu in google ads" width="900" height="369" class="aligncenter wp-image-75028 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-navigation.jpg 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-navigation-480x197.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>From here, you can create an automated rule to update any element of your account–campaigns, ad groups, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/07/ppc-keyword-challenges">keywords</a>, ads, asset groups, audiences, demographic targets, or display placements.</p>
<p>Alternatively, when viewing any of these elements of your account, you can create an automated rule by selecting the three dots icon “More” at the far right. From there, select “Create an automated rule.” It will open up the framework to automate the element of your account you are viewing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-upload.jpg" alt="google ads automated rules - creating a rule " width="616" height="397" class="aligncenter wp-image-75025 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-upload.jpg 616w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-upload-480x309.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 616px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Every Google Ads automated rule has five main elements in its framework that you can set to automate your campaign to your fitting.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-setup.jpg" alt="google ads automated rules - setting up an automated rule in google ads screenshot" width="861" height="562" class="aligncenter wp-image-75026 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-setup.jpg 861w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-setup-480x313.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 861px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>1. Action: </strong>This is what you want Google to change in your account. Big or small–you call the shots. Use automated rules to perform actions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable</li>
<li>Pause</li>
<li>Change Budgets</li>
<li>Change Bids</li>
<li>Change Bid Adjustments</li>
<li>Change Final URLs</li>
<li>Change Labels</li>
<li>Send Email</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Apply to:</strong> Select where you want this action to take place. For instance, do you want it to apply to every campaign (ad, keyword, etc.) in your account? Or do you want to select certain campaigns (ads, keyword, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>3. Conditions: </strong>If you like, you can create additional conditions for Google to check before taking this action. These conditions can include any performance metrics (clicks, cost, conversions, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/cost-per-action">CPA</a>, etc) or attribute you can view in Google Ads.</p>
<p><strong>4. Frequency: </strong>This is how often you want Google to check this condition and potentially perform this action. You can have these automated rules run:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once, at a set time in the future</li>
<li>Hourly</li>
<li>Daily</li>
<li>Weekly</li>
<li>Monthly</li>
</ul>
<p>When setting your frequency, you also choose what time window you want Google to consider when evaluating your condition. For instance, if you want Google to review data from earlier that day, month, or year.</p>
<p><strong>5. Email results: </strong>Finally, you can optionally choose to have Google email you, your colleague, or your client. Google can send this email either every time it runs or any time it makes takes an action.</p>
<div id="tips"></div>
<h2><strong>Best practices with Google Ads automated rules</strong></h2>
<p>Letting Google automatically post changes in your account is a scary thought to many. Google Ads automated rules can morph from a helpful tool to an active saboteur with the wrong guidance, especially if you’re just getting started.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #333333; font-size: 22px;">1. Read your rules out loud first</strong></p>
<p>When creating your automated rule, the setup can feel and sound technical–because it is! Like everything in Google Ads, automated rules were written by programmers, not marketers. To make sure your rules are written correctly, be sure to read back what you’re telling Google to do first.</p>
<p>Use the sentence structure:</p>
<p><em>“</em>At <strong><em>[frequency]</em>, </strong>check to see if <strong><em>[conditions]</em></strong> are met using data from <strong><em>[date range in set in frequency]. </em></strong>If those conditions are met, then <em><strong>[perform action] </strong></em>in <strong><em>[apply to groups].</em></strong></p>
<p>See? Technical sounding sentence on its own. Applied to a real rule, this could read:</p>
<p>At <em><strong>3 p.m. every day, </strong></em>check to see if <em><strong>these campaigns have spent $5,000 </strong></em>so far <em><strong>this month</strong>. </em>If that’s the case, then <em><strong>pause </strong></em>these <em><strong>selected campaigns</strong>.</em></p>
<p><strong style="color: #333333; font-size: 22px;">2. Always preview results</strong></p>
<p>Before saving your rule, Google allows you to “preview” it in action. This allows Google to check the conditions you’ve set and show you what it would do if that rule ran right now. Google doesn’t post these changes, but it’s a good way to check to see how many changes your new rule could potentially post.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-preview.jpg" alt="google ads automated rules - rule preview screenshot" width="900" height="309" class="aligncenter wp-image-75027 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-preview.jpg 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-preview-480x165.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong style="color: #333333; font-size: 22px;">3. Be cautious of frequency</strong></p>
<p>One of the most common mistakes that I see advertisers making is having their rules run too frequently or using data from a different time period than their frequency. For instance, an automated rule that runs hourly using data from the day before will complete that action either 0 or 24 times, but never once. Your rule may be set to only raise your budget by $100, but this small mistake could raise it by $2,400 by the end of the day instead!</p>
<p><strong style="color: #333333; font-size: 22px;">4. Start off with small changes</strong></p>
<p>Fortune may favor the bold—but don’t automate your boldness! Small changes add up quickly and you don’t want a rogue automated rule to spend your annual budget over the weekend or change your campaigns beyond recognition without your eyes on it! Start off by having Google post smaller changes in the ballpark of 5% to 10% of a value every time it runs first. Once you see that the automated rules are set up, working properly, and contributing to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords-analytics">better performance</a>, then you can give them more power to make bigger changes.</p>

<h2><b>22 Google Ads automated rules every advertiser should know</b></h2>
<p>Automated rules have nearly unlimited potential to make<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/19/google-ads-for-small-businesses" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> managing your Google Ads</a> account easier. With proper planning, you can use them to launch your new campaigns on time, optimize your current ads, keep you informed of your performance, or set up a failsafe to pull in an emergency. Here are some common examples that I use frequently:</p>
<h3><strong>Google automated rules for making campaign management easier</strong></h3>
<p>Try these automated rules to make managing Google Ads easier.</p>
<h4><strong>1. Pausing your campaigns before a holiday</strong></h4>
<p>If you know that your business is going to be closed for a few days in advance, you can use this rule to pause your campaigns on time. It’s one less thing to worry about right before your time off.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule type: </strong>Campaign</li>
<li><strong>Action: </strong>Pause campaigns</li>
<li><strong>Apply to: </strong>All campaigns</li>
<li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Campaign status: All enabled</li>
<li><strong>Frequency: </strong>Once, at end of the business day the day before you close.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-pause-campaigns.jpg" alt="google ads automated rules - pause campaigns" width="683" height="650" class="aligncenter wp-image-75050 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-pause-campaigns.jpg 683w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-pause-campaigns-480x457.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 683px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4><strong>2. Enabling your campaigns after a holiday</strong></h4>
<ol start="2"></ol>
<p>Many of these rules have a “sister rule” that reverses them. Set this rule up alongside the rule to pause your campaigns and to make sure that they resume once your team is back to work.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule type: </strong>Campaign</li>
<li><strong>Action: </strong>Enable campaigns</li>
<li><strong>Apply to: </strong>Selected campaigns (all that you are currently running)</li>
<li><strong>Conditions: </strong>None</li>
<li><strong>Frequency: </strong>Once, at the beginning of the day your return from the holiday.</li>
</ul>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><p>If you&#8217;re changing your business&#8217;s operating hours during a holiday, be sure to update your local listings as well. The<a href="https://localiq.com/free-business-listings-grader/?cid=Web_WS_InContentTextLink_Freemium_Listings&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> LocaliQ Listings Grader</a> can help!</p></div></div>
<h4><strong>3. Enabling new ads for a sale or promotion</strong></h4>
<p>Want to make sure your new ads go live right in time for a sale or big event? This rule can save you from having to remember to update your ads on the big day. Consider adding labels to your ads for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/13/sales-promotion-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">different sales or promotions</a> to make automation easier. You may also want to schedule a similar rule to enable your usual ads again after a sale.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule type: </strong>Ads</li>
<li><strong>Action: </strong>Enable ads</li>
<li><strong>Apply to: </strong>All ads (or manually select individual ads)</li>
<li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Ad text includes [your ads’ special offer]</li>
<li><strong>Frequency: </strong>Once, at the time your promotion starts.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong></strong><strong>4. Pausing your ads after a sale</strong></h4>
<p>A sister to the previous rule, use this automated rule to pause your usual ads during the event and then pause your sale ads afterward.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule type: </strong>Ads</li>
<li><strong>Action: </strong>Pause ads</li>
<li><strong>Apply to: </strong>All ads (or manually select individual ads)</li>
<li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Ad text includes [your ads’ special offer]</li>
<li><strong>Frequency: </strong>Once, at the time conclusion of your promotion.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong></strong><strong>5. Run different ads at night</strong></h4>
<p>Offers like “24/7 availability” or “Open late” matter to people differently at night. Similarly, if your team doesn’t respond to requests after hours, a more modest call to action may help you guide searches to fill out a form during your off-hours.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule type: </strong>Ads</li>
<li><strong>Action: </strong>Enable ads</li>
<li><strong>Apply to: </strong>All ads (or manually select individual ads)</li>
<li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Ad text includes [your ads’ late-night messaging]</li>
<li><strong>Frequency: </strong>Daily, at 5 p.m.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like most other rules, couple this rule with three sister rules to pause your “daytime” ads daily at 5 p.m., resume your “daytime” ads at 9 a.m., and pause your “nighttime” ads at 9 a.m.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-closures.jpg" alt="google ads automated rules - ad on serp with timeframe screenshot" width="834" height="281" class="aligncenter wp-image-75029 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-closures.jpg 834w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-closures-480x162.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 834px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An example of a search ad that could benefit from this rule, since the business closes at 5 p.m.</em></p>
<h4><strong></strong><strong>6. Run different ads on the weekend</strong></h4>
<p>Similarly, if you have special rates on weekends or are available when your competitors are closed, those <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/24/google-ads-examples">messages</a> may resonate with your weekend searchers. Be sure to pair this rule with sister rules to pause these ads on Monday, resume your weekday ads on Monday, and pause your weekday ads on Friday.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule type: </strong>Ads</li>
<li><strong>Action: </strong>Enable ads</li>
<li><strong>Apply to: </strong>All ads (or manually select individual ads)</li>
<li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Ad text includes [your ads’ weekend messaging]</li>
<li><strong>Frequency: </strong>Weekly, Saturday at 12am.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong style="color: #333333; font-size: 18px;">7. Update your final URL</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve got a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/great-landing-pages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new landing page for your ads</a>, this rule can spare you from having a late-night session updating your keyword’s final URL.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule type: </strong>Ads</li>
<li><strong>Action: </strong>Change keyword final URLs</li>
<li><strong>Apply to: </strong>All ads (or manually select individual ads)</li>
<li><strong>Conditions: </strong>None</li>
<li><strong>Frequency: </strong>Once, at a set time</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s been proven that having more landing pages <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/15424/The-Key-to-More-Leads-Create-More-Targeted-Conversion-Opportunities-Data.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generates more leads</a>. So, this Google Ads automated rule can come in handy as you create landing pages optimized for specific<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/keyword-research-for-ppc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> PPC keywords</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landing-pages-vs-leads-generated-chart.jpg" alt="landing pages vs leads generated chart" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75047" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landing-pages-vs-leads-generated-chart.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landing-pages-vs-leads-generated-chart-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3><strong>Rules for making budget management easier</strong></h3>
<p>Try these Google Ads automated rules to simplify budget management.</p>
<h4><strong>8. Prevent your campaigns from overspending their daily budget</strong></h4>
<p>Google infamously can spend <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/05/adwords-daily-budget-changes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up to twice your campaign’s daily budget</a> on any given day. This is a trick to take back control of your campaigns and limit Google’s ability to spend more than a set amount each day.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule type: </strong>Campaigns</li>
<li><strong>Action: </strong>Pause campaign</li>
<li><strong>Apply to: </strong>Select campaigns</li>
<li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Spend &gt; $[your daily budget]</li>
<li><strong>Frequency: </strong>Hourly, using data from the same day.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-pause-campaign-spend.jpg" alt="google ads automated rules - campaign spend example" width="900" height="410" class="aligncenter wp-image-75052 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-pause-campaign-spend.jpg 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-pause-campaign-spend-480x219.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4><strong></strong><strong>9. Enabling your campaigns after spending their budget the previous day</strong></h4>
<p>The sister rule to the previous, this will enable the campaigns you paused the previous day.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule type: </strong>Campaigns</li>
<li><strong>Action: </strong>Enable campaign</li>
<li><strong>Apply to: </strong>Select campaigns</li>
<li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Spend &gt; $[your daily budget]</li>
<li><strong>Frequency: </strong>Daily at 12am, using data from the previous day.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>10. Keeping your monthly budget constant every month</strong></h4>
<ol start="10"></ol>
<p>It’s a silly thing, but marketers know that their set monthly budget doesn’t divide evenly into a daily budget when the months have 28, 30, or 31 days. Manually recalculating budgets every month is a pain and many of us have other priorities on the first day of the month. 10 rules here can save you a year of math.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule type: </strong>Campaigns</li>
<li><strong>Action: </strong>Change budgets</li>
</ul>
<p>Create a different rule for each date, to run once at 12 a.m. on that date and adjust the budget in kind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feb 1 – Increase daily budgets by 10.7%</li>
<li>Mar 1 – Decrease daily budgets by 9.7%</li>
<li>Apr 1– Increase daily budgets by 3.3%</li>
<li>May 1– Decrease daily budgets by 3.2%</li>
<li>June 1– Increase daily budgets by 3.3%</li>
<li>July 1– Decrease daily budgets by 3.2%</li>
<li>Sept 1– Increase daily budgets by 3.3%</li>
<li>Oct 1– Decrease daily budgets by 3.2%</li>
<li>Nov 1– Increase daily budgets by 3.3%</li>
<li>Dec 1– Decrease daily budgets by 3.2%</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>11. Set a weekly budget for your campaigns</strong></h4>
<ol start="11"></ol>
<p>Have a special budget for the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/16/inclusive-holiday-marketing-ideas">holiday week</a>? Or just prefer to manage your campaigns with a weekly budget? This rule has you covered.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule type: </strong>Campaigns</li>
<li><strong>Action: </strong>Pause campaign</li>
<li><strong>Apply to: </strong>Select campaigns</li>
<li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Spend &gt; $[your weekly budget]</li>
<li><strong>Frequency: </strong>Hourly, using data from this week.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong></strong><strong>12. Set a monthly budget for your campaigns</strong></h4>
<p>You can set a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/26/google-ads-monthly-spend-limit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">max spending limit</a> for your entire account within Google Ads, but if you want to control a set monthly budget for some of your campaigns, you can manage that as well with this rule.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule type: </strong>Campaigns</li>
<li><strong>Action: </strong>Pause campaign</li>
<li><strong>Apply to: </strong>Select campaigns</li>
<li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Spend &gt; $[your monthly budget]</li>
<li><strong>Frequency: </strong>Hourly, using data from this month.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-monthly-spend-limit-example.jpg" alt="google ads automated rules - monthly spend limit screenshot" width="900" height="317" class="aligncenter wp-image-75032 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-monthly-spend-limit-example.jpg 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-monthly-spend-limit-example-480x169.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An example of setting a monthly spend limit for your entire account. However, Google Ads automated rules can make this setting possible at the campaign level. </em></p>
<h4><strong></strong><strong>13. Adjust your budget for the weekend</strong></h4>
<p>Depending on your audience, search traffic might peak or drag on the weekend. You can use <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/07/30/ad-scheduling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dayparting to adjust your bids or ad schedule</a> for the weekends, but you can also adjust your budgets throughout the week to make sure that you can afford more traffic when your best customers are searching for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule type: </strong>Campaigns</li>
<li><strong>Action: </strong>Change budgets</li>
<li><strong>Apply to: </strong>Select campaigns</li>
<li><strong>Conditions: </strong>None</li>
<li><strong>Frequency: </strong>Weekly, on Saturdays at 12am.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, create a sister rule to this to reverse this change on Mondays at 12 a.m.</p>
<h3><strong>Google Ads automated rules for managing campaign performance</strong></h3>
<p>Performance in Google Ads can vary from advertiser to advertiser–what’s “good” for a lawyer, might be awful for an ecommerce business. With that in mind, consider your own account performance when creating specific conditions for these rules.</p>
<h4><strong></strong><strong>14. Increase bids if your keywords aren’t showing</strong></h4>
<p>Keywords that don’t show are hard to optimize for. This rule will catch any keywords that aren’t showing because their bid is too low.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule type: </strong>Keywords</li>
<li><strong>Action: </strong>Raise bids to first page CPC</li>
<li><strong>Apply to: </strong>All keywords</li>
<li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Keyword status reason contains any below first-page bid.</li>
<li><strong>Frequency: </strong>Daily</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong></strong><strong>15. Increase budget if performance is good</strong></h4>
<p>Search traffic might spike unexpectedly–and this rule can help give your campaigns more <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing budget </a>fuel if they’re performing well. This can be particularly great to implement on big sales events or holidays.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule type: </strong>Campaigns</li>
<li><strong>Action: </strong>Increase budget by 5%</li>
<li><strong>Apply to: </strong>Select campaigns</li>
<li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Conversions &gt; 5 and CPA (or ROAS) is hitting your goals</li>
<li><strong>Frequency: </strong>Daily at 10 a.m., 12 p.m., 3 p.m., and 6 p.m.; using data from that day</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-budget-increase.jpg" alt="google ads automated rules - budget increase" width="506" height="566" class="aligncenter wp-image-75053 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-budget-increase.jpg 506w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-ads-automated-rules-budget-increase-480x537.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 506px, 100vw" /></p>
<h4><strong></strong><strong>16. Increase bids when performance is good</strong></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/10/15/smart-bidding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smart bidding</a> can automatically adjust your keyword bids in your account to optimize towards a specific goal, but if you prefer a little bit more control with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/17/google-ads-bid-management">manual CPC bidding</a>, you can still use automated rules.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule type: </strong>Keywords</li>
<li><strong>Action: </strong>Increase bids by 5%</li>
<li><strong>Apply to: </strong>All keywords</li>
<li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Conversions &gt; 5 and CPA (or ROAS) is hitting your goals</li>
<li><strong>Frequency: </strong>Weekly, using data from the previous week.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong></strong><strong>17. Pause campaigns or decrease budgets if performance is poor</strong></h4>
<p>Not all press is good press for your<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/10/google-ads-account-structure" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> PPC campaigns</a>. You never know when you’re about to be on the receiving end of a lot of poor-quality searches. Treat this rule as your guardrail to prevent a bad day from getting worse.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule type: </strong>Campaign</li>
<li><strong>Action: </strong>Pause campaign or decrease budget</li>
<li><strong>Apply to: </strong>Select campaigns</li>
<li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Spend &gt; [70% of your budget] and CPA (or ROAS) is very bad</li>
<li><strong>Frequency: </strong>Daily at 12 p.m., 3 p.m., and 6 p.m., using data from that day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bear in mind that it may take a few hours for Google to attribute <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/17/how-to-set-up-google-ads-enhanced-conversions">conversions</a> to your campaigns—so set your benchmarks for “very bad” results low here. You’ll also very likely want to have Google email you anytime this rule runs so that you can bring your attention to what caused such a poor-performing day.</p>
<h4><strong></strong><strong>18. Decrease bids if performance is poor</strong></h4>
<p>Light bid adjustments can keep your keywords optimized and reduce wasted spend without you even signing into Google Ads.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule type: </strong>Keywords</li>
<li><strong>Action: </strong>Decrease bids by 5%</li>
<li><strong>Apply to: </strong>All keywords</li>
<li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Conversions &gt; 5 and CPA (or ROAS) is 20% or more away from your goal.</li>
<li><strong>Frequency: </strong>Weekly, using data from the previous week.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-researched keywords</a> may not lead to the results you hoped for.

<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/20/ppc-campaign-testing-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ad testing</a> is a vital part of managing your Google Ads campaigns. This rule can help determine the loser of your ad tests and pause poor performing ad in an ad group</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule type: </strong>Ads</li>
<li><strong>Action: </strong>Pause ad</li>
<li><strong>Apply to:</strong> Ads in selected campaigns (consider only search campaigns, for instance)</li>
<li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Ad Impressions &gt; 1000, Ad CTR &lt; .5%, and Ad Group CTR &gt; 1%</li>
<li><strong>Frequency: </strong>Monthly, using data from the previous month.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Rules for monitoring your campaign activity</strong></h3>
<p>These Google Ads automated rules allow Google to help you keep an eye on campaign activity.</p>
<h4><strong></strong><strong>21. Receive an email if your campaigns aren’t spending their budget.</strong></h4>
<p>If your campaigns aren’t on track to spend their monthly budget, this rule can alert you and let you fix anything before the end of the month.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule type: </strong>Campaign</li>
<li><strong>Action: </strong>Send email</li>
<li><strong>Apply to:</strong> All campaigns</li>
<li><strong>Conditions: </strong>Spend &lt; [33% of monthly budget]</li>
<li><strong>Frequency: </strong>Monthly on the 15th, using data from the current month</li>

<h4><strong></strong><strong>22. Receive an email if your team isn’t active in your account.</strong></h4>
<p>If you trust a teammate or agency to manage your accounts, it can be frustrating to discover that they aren’t actively touching anything. Without having to check their work, this little rule will alert you if a week goes by without any activity. Some accounts may not require daily or even weekly changes to stay healthy–but this rule can help you keep your trust in your trusted partners.</p>

With a little bit of planning, you can automate several manual tasks to take place—letting you focus on other priorities during your busiest periods or even letting you relax during your break. But remember, Google Ads automated rules are as powerful as you make them—be cautious about how many and how frequently your rules will post changes and check on them frequently until you have them fine-tuned in your account.</p>
