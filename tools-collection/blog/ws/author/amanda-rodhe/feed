										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On average, YouTubers upload <a href="https://blog.youtube/press/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20 million</a> videos each day, while Instagram users place <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-happens-in-an-internet-minute/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">66,000 visuals</a> on that platform every minute.</p>
<p>A vast majority of that content slips by with little fanfare. But every once in a while, something breaks through the barrage of vacation photos and dance clips to go absolutely viral. You know some of them well: the mannequin challenge, sea shanties, “This Barbie is…”</p>
<p>Cultural moments like these hit the algorithm just right, ricochet across the globe, and leave people rushing to get in on the trend.</p>
<p>Brands can tap into these events—a tactic called trendjacking— to capture the attention of new people and expand their circle of influence at an incredible scale. But not all viral trends are created equal. Some can damage your brand just as quickly.</p>
<p>Let’s dig into the phenomenon of trendjacking, how to leverage it for business growth, and when it’s best to proceed with caution.</p>

<h2>What is trendjacking?</h2>
<p>Trendjacking is the act of capitalizing on a viral cultural moment. And the practice can take several forms. If your brand…</p>
<ul>
<li>Reshares a trending meme (Think: “One does not simply…”)</li>
<li>Taps your team to recreate a viral dance or performance challenge (Think: Gangnam Style)</li>
<li>Participates in a challenge for charity (Think: the Ice Bucket Challenge)</li>
<li>Creates its own version of a trending GPT image (Think: the Studio Ghibli image trend)</li>
<li>Shares <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/fall-content-ideas">content</a> related to a trending phrase (Think: “Very demure, very mindful”)</li>
</ul>
<p>…or otherwise creates content that is based on an “of the moment” internet craze, congratulations, you’re trendjacking.</p>

<p>You may also try your hand at trendjacking’s close cousin, newsjacking.</p>
<p>While trendjacking trades in cultural cachet, newsjacking is the art of engaging with a viral news moment. Of course, there’s a bit of a gray area between the two tactics. For example, commenting on the Sydney Sweeney “good jeans/genes” ad campaign is a bit of both. But the crucial component in either practice is the timeliness of the content and commentary.</p>

<h2>Is trendjacking right for your business?</h2>
<p>On the internet, attention is currency. So, finding creative ways to draw attention to your brand can pay dividends. That’s why many brands want to work trendjacking into their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-media-strategy">social media strategy</a>.</p>
<p>Done right, trendjacking can help you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get greater reach without creating your own virality: </strong>You ride the wave of a broader cultural moment.</li>
<li><strong>Prove your cultural <em>bona fides</em>: </strong>Businesses in trend-based industries (fashion, beauty, wellness, etc.) get bonus points for cultural fluency. Engaging with a viral fad signals you know what’s up.</li>
<li><strong>Show off your personality: </strong>Tap into a trend that has a cheeky link to your brand, and you prove your wit. Few things <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/23/how-brand-your-business">make a brand more attractive</a> than a good sense of humor.</li>
<li><strong>Drive traffic:</strong> If your contribution to the trend takes off, you boost traffic to your social pages and website. Hello, new group of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/hot-leads-vs-cold-leads">leads to nurture</a>!</li>
<li><strong>Build </strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness"><strong>brand awareness</strong></a>: Even if those new followers aren’t ready to buy, it’s never bad to have more eyeballs on your brand. They might buy from you in six months, or their friends might want to buy today.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8 trendjacking dos and don’ts (with examples)</h2>
<p>Just because trendjacking can produce wins for your brand doesn’t mean it’s always the right choice.</p>
<p>Some trends are too risqué for a brand to take a chance on. Others simply aren’t the right fit for <em>your</em> brand. And some businesses aren’t positioned to move quickly enough to make the most of a viral moment.</p>
<p>If you’ve sat on the sidelines before or you’ve gotten involved without much success, these dos and don’ts can help you assess future trendjacking opportunities and leverage them more effectively.</p>
<h3>Trendjacking dos</h3>
<p>Want to get better at identifying worthy trendjacking moments and capitalizing on the ones with real promise? Start here.</p>
<h4>1. Do target trends relevant to your industry</h4>
<p>When you see a trend and think you might want to participate, start by asking yourself, “Does this make sense with my brand’s focus?” If the answer is yes, you can proceed to further evaluation. If the answer is no, save yourself some time and stop right here.</p>
<p>Not sure what this looks like in practice? Let’s explore the question for some hypothetical brands using the <a href="https://time.com/5929245/sea-shanty-tiktok-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sea shanty trend</a> as an example.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-shanty.webp" alt="Trendjacking - sea shanty video still." width="365" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94883 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-shanty.webp 365w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-shanty-183x300.webp 183w" sizes="(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgsurPg9Ckw" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>In early 2021, COVID was still restricting our lives significantly. Perhaps because being trapped at home for 11 months straight felt a little like taking a long journey across the ocean, a 19th-century sea shanty went completely <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/14/tiktok-trend-discovery">viral on TikTok</a>. What started as duets on the original video soon blossomed into sea shanty versions of contemporary songs. (Smash Mouth’s All Star <a href="https://x.com/JennaGuillaume/status/1349241560936812544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1349241560936812544%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F5929245%2Fsea-shanty-tiktok-2021%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as a sea shanty</a>? Yes, that really happened.)</p>
<p>Imagine you’re leading marketing for your business at this time. You see the sea shanty trend taking off and think to yourself, “Should we get in on this?”</p>
<p><em>Scenario 1: </em>You run a local CPA firm. Your brand has nothing to do with the ocean. You do not need to get involved in the sea shanty trend.</p>
<p><em>Scenario 2: </em>You operate a restaurant with seafood on the menu. Sure, you can consider this trend. (This example was inspired by Arby’s, which found success creating <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@arbys/video/6920243667865226501?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a sea shanty TikTok</a> about its fish sandwich.)</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-wendys-2.webp" alt="Trendjacking - Arby's video still." width="508" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94884 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-wendys-2.webp 508w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-wendys-2-480x567.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 508px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@arbys/video/6920243667865226501?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h4>2. Do ask if this trend matters to your target audience</h4>
<p>Once you’ve assessed a trend’s relevance for your industry, go a little deeper. Will your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a> care if you post something about it?</p>
<p>Think about your audience’s demographics, psychographics, and general demeanor. Will they get the reference? And if they understand it, will they care that you’re engaging with it?</p>
<p>To continue with the sea shanty example, Arby’s passed this test, too. Its target audience, according to <a href="https://www.qsrweb.com/articles/arbys-redefines-target-audience-after-year-long-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview</a> with its VP of brand and corporate communications, is younger consumers (aged 18-34) who “love to have fun.”</p>
<p>An irreverent, purposefully cringe TikTok video? That’s a perfect fit for this audience.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="👋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Free resource!</strong> <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteTargetAudience.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_TargetAudineceGuide_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links">How to Find Your Target Audience in 6 Steps</a></p>
<h4>3. Do use related hashtags</h4>
<p>Trendjacking is all about capitalizing on a viral moment to expand your reach. Adding relevant <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">hashtags</a> to your content can boost your distribution and position your brand alongside fellow trendjackers.</p>
<p>On its fish sandwich video, Arby’s added some strategic hashtags employed on other trending sea shanty videos.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-wendys-1.webp" alt="Trendjacking -Arby's video with hashtags." width="587" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-94885 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-wendys-1.webp 587w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-wendys-1-480x491.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 587px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@arbys/video/6920243667865226501?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h4>4. Do be creative</h4>
<p>A viral trend goes stale quickly because it is, by definition, repetitive. There are only so many sea shanty videos a TikToker can watch before their eyes glaze over.</p>
<p>That’s why creativity is essential for brands trying trendjacking. What unique spin can you put on the trend, and how can it help your content stand out from the others?</p>
<p>This is also an opportunity to show off your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">brand’s personality</a>. Don’t be afraid to take a creative risk within the framework of the trend.</p>
<h3>Trendjacking don’ts</h3>
<p>If you’ve tried trendjacking in the past with little success, these don’ts might be holding you back. Avoid these common mistakes to get further with your viral-inspired content.</p>
<h4>5. Don’t chase bad trends</h4>
<p>Some trends aren’t a good fit for your brand. But other trends aren’t a good fit for <em>any</em> brand. Avoid these types of trends at all costs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mean or offensive trends: </strong>Consumers don’t like brands that punch down or are unnecessarily crass. If getting in on the trend means being petty or gross, don’t do it. <em>*The exception here is brands with an edgy voice. Adult Swim, you can participate!</em></li>
<li><strong>Confusing trends: </strong>If your marketing team doesn’t understand the trend, don’t do it. That means the trend is either: 1) Inscrutable to everyone (in which case, why bother?), or 2) Potentially hazardous. You may be missing a nefarious meaning that resonates on some dark side of the web.</li>
<li><strong>Hollow trends: </strong>This one can be hard to gauge—who’d have thought we’d all still know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannequin_Challenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the mannequin challenge</a> nearly a decade later? But if a trend feels particularly vapid or fleeting, take a pass.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-digiorno.webp" alt="Trendjacking -DiGiornos Tweet." width="937" height="335" class="aligncenter wp-image-94886 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-digiorno.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-digiorno-480x172.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.prnewsonline.com/whyistayed-twitter-campaign-backfires-on-digiornos-pizza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>DiGiorno</em></a><em> had to eat its words after jumping on the wrong viral trend.</em></p>
<h4>6. Don’t trendjack too often</h4>
<p>Chasing every last trend is exhausting for your team. You have limited bandwidth, so think carefully before leaping at a trendjacking opportunity.</p>
<p>Not only that, if your brand participates too regularly in viral moments, you become a one-trick pony. Give your team the breathing room to create meaningful content and your audience the space to be surprised and delighted when you <em>do</em> engage in a trend.</p>
<h4>7. Don’t take forever to post</h4>
<p>Viral trends move fast. A new meme, GIF, or challenge may only last a week or so before it reaches peak saturation and completely sputters out. If you think of trendjacking as existing on a bell curve, you want to get your content out before the peak.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-graph.webp" alt="Trendjacking - Bell curve of popularity." width="937" height="530" class="aligncenter wp-image-94887 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-graph.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trendjacking-wordstream-graph-480x272.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If your internal approval process means it will take weeks to get your trendjacking content published, sit this one out.</p>
<p>And if you work in a highly regulated industry where compliance and legal often need to opine on your marketing output, create a fast-track approval process for trend-related posts in advance. Then, when the right trend comes along, you’ve already created a pathway for your team to get content out quickly.</p>
<h4>8. Don’t assume success</h4>
<p>As you try trendjacking, always keep track of your content’s results. Which trendjacking posts move the needle for your brand in meaningful ways (reshares, new follows, great consumer feedback, media mentions), and which fall flat?</p>
<p>As you continue to play with trendjacking, you’ll see patterns emerge. Identifying the elements of a trending moment that resonate with your audience can help you further refine your trendjacking strategy and drive greater social media success.</p>
<h2>Try trendjacking for a big boost in brand awareness</h2>
<p>When done successfully, trendjacking is a proven tactic for gaining a ton of attention, especially on social media.</p>
<p>As you think through your first trend hijacking adventure, remember these dos and don’ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do target trends relevant to your industry</li>
<li>Do ask if this trend matters to your target audience</li>
<li>Do use relatable hashtags</li>
<li>Do be creative</li>
<li>Don’t chase bad trends</li>
<li>Don’t trendjack too often</li>
<li>Don’t take forever to post</li>
<li>Don’t assume success</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you start a small business, you often have to step outside your comfort zone. You know your core business inside and out. But launching a brand requires you to take on other tasks, like marketing, that may feel foreign and, frankly, intimidating.</p>
<p>Creating a small business logo is one of the earliest and most crucial marketing decisions you’ll make. And for those small business owners who aren’t designers by trade, there are two ways to approach the task.</p>
<p>One is to hire a graphic designer. These professionals understand the ins and outs of color, fonts, proportion, and other design theories that help them effortlessly create a clean, effective logo. Other business owners opt to go it alone, relying on design tools to help them craft their logo.</p>
<p>Regardless of the path you choose, this guide can help. You’ll get a primer on logo design—what it is, why it matters, and basic design principles and tools to inform your process.</p>

<h2>Why create a small business logo?</h2>
<p>Humans are wired to process visual information. Our brains process images <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6125597/#CR12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60,000</a> times faster than text, and 90% of information transmitted to the brain is visual.</p>
<p>If you want your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/10/brand-awareness">brand to become instantly recognizable to your audience</a>, you need a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-logo-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">logo</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/black-star-coffee-logo-on-cup.webp" alt="black star coffee logo on coffee cup" width="900" height="544" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93617" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/black-star-coffee-logo-on-cup.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/black-star-coffee-logo-on-cup-480x290.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>When you see a black coffee cup on the streets near <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CXbHIdMod-Z/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MTFsaThkcXI2OXprdw==" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this cafe</a>, you know immediately it came from Black Star.</em></p>
<p>As your logo becomes more familiar to your audience, it becomes like a familiar face in a crowd—an instantly recognizable presence, and a source of comfort whenever they see it.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever sighed with relief when, hours into a road trip, you spot golden arches in the distance and know a Big Mac is in your future, then you’ve felt this firsthand.</p>
<p>Here are some more stats that speak to the importance of a small business logo:</p>
<ul>
<li>People need to see something at least <a href="https://www.b2bmarketing.net/en/resources/blog/marketing-rule-7-and-why-its-still-relevant-b2b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven times</a> before recalling it. Having a logo to include in all corners of your business will help your customers recall you later.</li>

<h2>Elements of a great small business logo</h2>
<p>Of course, a small business logo is more than a randomly selected image. It’s a carefully designed icon that clearly represents your brand.</p>
<p>Successful small business logos should:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Include your business name in a legible font. </strong>While huge, established brands may get away with an icon-based logo (the Nike swoosh, the Apple apple), a smaller brand should incorporate its name.</li>
<li><strong>Be memorable. </strong>Consumers have a hard time remembering logos that are bland or overly complicated.</li>
<li><strong>Be relevant.</strong> Another thing that can make your logo hard to remember? It’s not clearly connected to your business. Make sure your design has a discernible tie-in to your work.</li>
<li><strong>Be simple. </strong>Your logo must be legible and recognizable from near or far.</li>
<li><strong>Incorporate your brand colors and fonts. </strong>If you’ve already established colors and fonts for your business, use them in your logo. This is how you set a consistent <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-create-a-brand-identity/">brand identity</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Be timeless. </strong>You’re building a business with longevity; you want your logo to go the distance with you. Designing something that’s too “of the moment” will lead your logo to become stale or outdated.</li>
</ul>

<div id="how-to-create-a-small-business-logo"></div>
<h2>Steps to create a small business logo</h2>
<p>Feeling amped to create your own logo, or ready to hire a pro to tackle the project for you? Either way, these steps can guide the process.</p>
<p>Learn the basics about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/brand-perception">representing your brand visually</a>, so you can have more informed conversations with your professional graphic designer or apply them yourself.</p>
<div id="know-your-brand-identity"></div>
<h3>1. Know your brand identity</h3>
<p>In order to represent your brand visually, you must know how to articulate your brand identity.</p>
<p>Defining it starts with answering two simple questions: “What do we do, and why do we do it?”</p>
<p>This question will lead you to your brand’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/02/how-to-write-a-business-mission-statement" rel="noopener">mission statement</a>, which encompasses how, what, and why you do your work. This can include tangible and intangible benefits for your customers.</p>
<p>For example, a test prep business might literally help students perform better on their SATs. But it also helps them feel more confident on test day. And when that confidence contributes to higher scores, they gain access to more opportunities in higher education.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/foley-prep-logo-example.webp" alt="foley prep logo small business example" width="900" height="280" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93618" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/foley-prep-logo-example.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/foley-prep-logo-example-480x149.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://foleyprep.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This</a> colorful logo makes test prep look exciting—like an opportunity to expand one’s mind.</em></p>
<p>Your brand’s mission will help you home in on other elements of your identity. If your test prep company wants to inspire confidence in its students, then your identity might be that of an enthusiastic coach or an encouraging older sibling.</p>
<p>Finally, consider your brand identity in contrast with your competitors. How does the work you do (and the way you do it) stand out from what they do?</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Need help articulating what makes your business special?</strong> Get the guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLValuePropositionGuide.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_ValuePropositionGuide_Download">How to Create a Unique Value Proposition From the Ground Up</a></p>
<div id="look-to-other-brands-for-inspiration"></div>
<h3>2. Look to other brands for inspiration</h3>
<p>Once you have a handle on your brand identity, you can look outward. How do brands you admire represent <em>their </em>identities visually through their logos?</p>
<p>There’s plenty of inspiration to pull from multinational brands with instantly recognizable logos. How does a well-designed logo convey feelings or values through design?</p>
<p>For example, the Nike swoosh is an abstract shape. But it mimics a checkmark and implies upward motion. It is simple and bold, which conveys grace and confidence. These are all attributes that help an athlete shine on the court or field, which ties directly into Nike’s mission of empowering athletes to “Just do it.”</p>
<p>You can also consider logos from smaller brands you admire. Looking to your peers can help you identify themes that resonate with your audience, or you may spot a visual white space your logo can fill.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/two-sparrows-homestead-logo-example.webp" alt="small business logo - two sparrows homestead" width="900" height="417" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93619" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/two-sparrows-homestead-logo-example.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/two-sparrows-homestead-logo-example-480x222.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/TwoSparrowsHomestead/about/?_rdr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This</a> logo’s old-fashioned, hand-crafted feel leans into the business’s identity as a “suburban farmhouse.”</em></p>
<p>As an example, if you’re opening a gift shop in a seaside town, how many of your competitors have a blue logo with ocean-related imagery? If you opt to take a different visual path, you stand out immediately from your peers.</p>
<div id="start-aligning-your-brand-with-design-elements"></div>
<h3>3. Start aligning your brand with design elements</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve defined what your brand represents, how can you use visual elements to convey that message?</p>
<p>Return to your brand identity discussions. As you think about what your brand represents and what you want your customers to feel, how does that translate into your brand’s visual identity?</p>
<p>A <a href="https://localiq.com/industries/professional-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">law firm</a> might want its clients to feel safe, confident, and heard. That might mean it wants its visuals to convey trustworthiness and authority?</p>
<p>How can you use design elements like font, color, and graphics to evoke those feelings?</p>
<p>Let’s start with fonts. While there are thousands of individual fonts, they can be broken down into a handful of high-level categories, each of which has its own aesthetic vibe.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/log-fonts-and-meanings.webp" alt="logo fonts and their meanings chart" width="900" height="617" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93621" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/log-fonts-and-meanings.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/log-fonts-and-meanings-480x329.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Next, consider color. Different shades, hues, tints, and tones all have the power to awaken specific feelings in viewers. A pastel pink feels gentle and soothing, while a neon pink feels electric and energetic.</p>
<p>Understanding the psychology of color (and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/12/color-psychology-marketing">how to use it</a> in your logo) can help you spark immediate emotional resonance in anyone who sees it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/color-psychology-emotional-triggers.webp" alt="color psychology and emotional triggers" width="723" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93620" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/color-psychology-emotional-triggers.webp 723w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/color-psychology-emotional-triggers-480x531.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 723px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.conversioner.com/blog/color-psychology" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Last up are graphics. Do you want your logo to include an icon, drawing, or image? When considering your options, think again about how the image style ties into your brand identity.</p>
<p>A cartoon might feel whimsical and playful, while an icon can convey a more serious tone. You can also experiment with different degrees of representation in your image.</p>
<p>For example, a yoga studio might opt for a line drawing of a yogi sitting in the lotus position. Or if they wanted to be slightly less representational, they might select an icon of a lotus flower.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/posies-logo-example.webp" alt="small business logo example - posies" width="310" height="452" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93622" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/posies-logo-example.webp 310w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/posies-logo-example-206x300.webp 206w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px" /></p>

<h3>4. Understand logo types</h3>
<p>Your end goal is to bring these parts together to create a unified logo. And to do that, you must understand the types of logos out there</p>
<p>Many brands ‌create several versions of their logo, so knowing your options from the start will help you decide which logo variations to create for your small business.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/types-of-logos.webp" alt="types of logos with examples" width="900" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93604" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/types-of-logos.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/types-of-logos-480x427.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="combine-elements-and-create-options"></div>
<h3>5. Combine elements and create options</h3>
<p>Once you’ve decided on a general direction for your logo, you can begin experimenting with colors, fonts, and graphic elements. Or, ask your professional graphic designer to work their magic!</p>
<p>This part can be tricky for those without a professional background in design, but graphic design tools with AI features can help.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canva</a> now invites users to describe an idea with words and uses AI to present options that suit the brief. The tool allows for back-and-forth, so you can ask Canva to refine its initial output until you’re happy with the results.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/canva-logo-builder-ai-example.webp" alt="canva logo builder ai example" width="900" height="628" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93623" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/canva-logo-builder-ai-example.webp 900w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/canva-logo-builder-ai-example-480x335.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A conversation with Canva AI, asking it to create potential logos for a fictitious residential construction firm.</em></p>
<div id="pick-a-design-and-create-a-set-of-logos"></div>
<h3>6. Pick a design and create a set of logos</h3>
<p>Most brands will design several variations of their logos for different applications. While the full logo might look great on direct mailers you send to your neighbors, you might opt to use the symbol alone as the profile photo on your Instagram page.</p>
<p>To see how brands use different configurations of their logos, take a well-known brand like Nike.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the logo is just the symbol. Other times, the swoosh appears below the brand name. And in other instances, the swoosh is paired with the famous Nike tagline, “Just do it.”</p>
<p>Eventually, you’ll spell out all potential configurations and rules for using your logo in <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-brand-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your brand kit</a>.</p>
<div id="small-business-logo-templates"></div>
<h2>Small business logo templates</h2>
<p>Canva has premade logo templates you can personalize, or you can use it as inspiration for your mood board. <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAE4XV7hvzw/30ATPA8S6Pa23qBxyjAcEw/view?utm_content=DAE4XV7hvzw&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=sharebutton&amp;mode=preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here are some small business logo templates</a> we love to help you get started.</p>

<h2>Designing a small business logo that tells a story</h2>
<p>In the end, what matters more than the details is the larger story your small business logo tells.</p>
<p>Do viewers instantly understand what you do? Does your logo make them feel something? Do long-time followers of your brand recognize it from across the room?</p>
<p>These are the true hallmarks of a great small business logo.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Content marketing encompasses a wide range of tactics. Your website and blog are content marketing. So is your social media presence. Your YouTube videos are content marketing, too.</p>

<h2>What is interactive content?</h2>
<p>Interactive content is anything that invites direct engagement from readers or viewers. It’s not about passively reading or watching. Instead, interactive content invites your audience to, well, interact!</p>
<p>Some brands shy away from interactive content because it can take more time to create. Unlike a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/27/blog-post-ideas">blog post</a>, which is pretty straightforward and can often be drafted and posted by your internal team, interactive content might require more support. For example, a custom quiz may need the assistance of a writer, designer, and web developer.</p>
<p>However, as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/06/content-marketing-tools">online tools</a> grow more sophisticated, there are drag-and-drop options that empower your team to create simple but effective interactive content.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-warby-parker.webp" alt="Interactive content - Warby Parker quiz." width="771" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92129 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-warby-parker.webp 771w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-warby-parker-480x374.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 771px, 100vw" /></p>

<h2>Benefits of interactive content</h2>
<p>We’re all looking to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-differentiate-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make our content stand out</a>, especially when AI makes it easy to create a dozen blog posts with a few prompts. Interactive content fits the bill perfectly. In fact, using interactive content can help:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increase engagement:</strong> By nature, content like quizzes and polls encourages active participation, making it more engaging than other types of content.</li>
<li><strong>Generate attention and leads: </strong>Interactive content generates up to <a href="https://outgrow.co/blog/statistics-interactive-content">five times</a> more views than its static counterparts and enjoys double the conversion rate.</li>
<li><strong>Boost virality: </strong>People love to brag about high scores and tell their friends what kind of sandwich bread they are, so interactive content motivates a lot of social sharing.</li>
<li><strong>Lift brand retention:</strong> Immersive experiences stick with us, and when someone benefits from your interactive content, they’re more likely to remember your brand longer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interactive content is also a great source of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/customer-data">customer data</a>. A simple poll asking what color you should include in your next product launch is extremely valuable consumer data.</p>

<p>You understand the potential of interactive content, but perhaps you’re not sure where to start. You’ve come to the right place. Read on for a list of interactive content types to try, plus see real-world examples of different tactics in action.</p>
<h3>1. Quizzes</h3>
<p>If you were online in the aughts and 2010s, you likely remember the grip that BuzzFeed quizzes had on the culture.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/05/27/marketing-quiz">Online quizzes</a> are intriguing because they put the quiz taker at the center of the experience. A BuzzFeed-style quiz invites a user to discover something unique about themselves. Who doesn’t want to learn which Golden Girls character they are? This style of quiz encourages sharing—once you discover you’re a Dorothy, you want to tell your friends and see who’s the Blanche in your group!</p>
<p>Alternatively, online quizzes that test your knowledge are engaging because they allow the taker to aim for a high score and feel smart. These trivia-based quizzes often share how you stack up against others.</p>
<p>Finally, quizzes can serve as a sales tool. For example, DTC makeup brand Il Makiage uses its POWERMATCH quiz to help buyers find the right foundation shade—something that might otherwise be a hurdle for an online-only business.</p>
<p>The quiz makes it easy for prospects to identify their ideal shade and make a purchase they’ll be pleased with.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-makup.webp" alt="Interactive content - Quiz from Maikage." width="937" height="341" class="aligncenter wp-image-92130 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-makup.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-makup-480x175.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>

<div id="games"></div>
<h3>2. Games</h3>
<p>Like quizzes, games can be similarly attractive and addictive. As an example, The New York Times boasts over <a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/new-york-times-games-advertising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 million</a> daily players of its word and logic games.</p>
<p>If games can create that kind of draw for a newspaper, they can do the same for you. And while games certainly require more development than, say, a simple survey or quiz, the investment can be worthwhile.</p>
<div id="calculators"></div>
<h3>3. Calculators</h3>
<p>Online calculators can be an incredible educational tool for your audience. This particular type of interactive content is great for brands that sell expensive or complex offerings. Customers might need additional education about the financial implications of making a purchase decision.</p>
<p>A classic example is a bank offering a mortgage calculator. Deciding to buy a home is one of the biggest financial decisions a person will make in their lifetime, so a calculator that helps them visualize the full cost implications of that decision can go a long way toward assuaging concerns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-calculator.webp" alt="Interactive content - Home cost calculator." width="630" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92131 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-calculator.webp 630w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-calculator-480x457.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 630px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.suffolkcu.org/learn/financial-literacy/financial-calculators/mortgage-calculators/mortgage-calculator" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Suffolk Credit Union</em></a><em> uses its mortgage calculator to help prospective homebuyers understand monthly costs.</em></p>
<p>Calculators can also work for B2B brands that sell a high-cost business solution. Typically, numerous decision-makers weigh in on a B2B buying decision, and the leaders will often want to know the costs and benefits of making a big purchase.</p>
<p>If you can create a calculator that accurately represents the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/12/20/content-marketing-roi">ROI</a> of purchasing your solution, you give B2B buyers greater assurance that your offering is worth the cost.</p>
<div id="polls"></div>
<h3>4. Polls</h3>
<p>Comments sections, thumbs up, ratings—people love sharing their opinions online. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/04/instagram-story-ads-polls">Creating a poll</a> is a form of interactive content that gives your audience another chance to make their voice heard.</p>
<p>Polls can be used just for fun to drive engagement, or they can help you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/10/best-online-survey-tools">gather customer insights</a> and guide real business decisions.</p>
<p>For example, a DTC mattress brand might post an informal poll in its social media stories asking followers to share whether they’re a side sleeper, back sleeper, or stomach sleeper. The subsequent stories could then show the best mattress for each sleep position.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a business might use a poll to crowdsource information about a new product launch. As an example, a local restaurant looking to add entertainment to its evening schedule might ask its audience whether they’d prefer a trivia night, comedy show, or live music.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Every piece of interactive content needs a great call to action! </strong>Get ideas to create your own in <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download">The 42 Best Call to Action Phrases Ever (&amp; Why They Work)</a>.</p>
<div id="surveys"></div>
<h3>5. Surveys</h3>
<p>Surveys are another way for businesses to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/12/first-party-data">gather vital information</a> from their audience. Surveys tend to be used for an explicit business purpose, like gathering feedback on a recent buying experience.</p>
<p>But a well-designed survey can encourage readers to complete it, even if it’s ultimately for your benefit. Fortunately, there are plenty of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/10/best-online-survey-tools">free online survey tools</a> that can help any business launch an engaging survey.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-media.webp" alt="Interactive content - Media survey." width="305" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92132 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-media.webp 305w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-media-153x300.webp 153w" sizes="(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/thejournal-survey-a5abec57" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Journal</em></a><em> podcast wanted to collect feedback on a potential upcoming live event, and it created a survey to ask its audience what they’d like to see there.</em></p>
<p>Surveys are a great way to open the door to deeper conversations with your audience. At the end of a survey, you can invite the respondents to share contact information and indicate that they’d be open to more discussion. Even if you don’t connect directly, showing that you care about their thoughts makes your audience feel more seen and heard.</p>
<div id="assessments"></div>
<h3>6. Assessments</h3>
<p>Assessments fall somewhere between quizzes and surveys in the world of interactive content. While a quiz tends to be more lighthearted, an assessment is a tool with a bit more weight.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-quiz.webp" alt="Interactive content - online assessment." width="826" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92133 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-quiz.webp 826w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-quiz-480x349.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 826px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://view.flodesk.com/pages/5fc7b185f10e2d0d8e955631" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Therapist and author Nedra Glover Tawwab</em></a><em> has several assessments available on her website. </em></p>
<p>Service businesses might use assessments to help prospective customers determine if they have an issue the business can solve. For example, a physical therapy office might create an assessment for athletes who are trying to decide if their injury requires professional help to heal. Or, a tutoring business might offer an assessment to help parents evaluate whether or not their children could benefit from some academic support outside the classroom.</p>
<div id="image-sliders"></div>
<h3>7. Image sliders</h3>
<p>Before-and-after images have long been a powerful marketing tool for showcasing certain products and services. If you’ve ever watched an infomercial, you’ve probably seen this technique used to demonstrate the power of the product being sold.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-slider.webp" alt="Interactive content - Image slider of a bathroom remod." width="599" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-92134 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-slider.webp 599w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-slider-480x481.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 599px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.will-myers.com/products/p/before-/-after-image-slider" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>This example</em></a><em> from a home renovation shows how the contractor transformed a dark and outdated bathroom on the right into a bright, modern, functional space.</em></p>
<p>Online, you can create interactive image sliders that align before-and-after photos, allowing viewers to slide between the two. As they do, they’ll see the impact of the business’s product or service.</p>
<p>This interactive content tactic can be applied in a variety of industries, from dental practices showcasing the results of a teeth whitening session to landscapers demonstrating the transformation of a scruffy backyard into a perfectly pruned oasis.</p>
<div id="maps"></div>
<h3>8. Maps</h3>
<p>When you think of digital maps, you likely envision the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/02/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps">Google Maps</a> interface. But businesses can create interactive maps as part of their content marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Of course, these maps can be used to show your business’s physical footprint if yours is a multi-location operation. But interactive maps can serve other purposes, too.</p>
<p>For example, a travel brand that hosts safaris in Tanzania might create an interactive map that shows where in the national parks you might expect to see different types of wildlife. Or, a retail brand might create a map of its store, allowing customers to virtually browse and navigate the space.</p>
<div id="multimedia-long-form-content"></div>
<h3>9. Multimedia long-form content</h3>
<p>Long gone are the days when a static PDF is your only option for presenting an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/how-to-write-an-ebook">ebook</a>, whitepaper, or other type of long-form content to your readers.</p>
<p>Today, it’s possible to create interactive, multi-page documents with embedded videos, moving text, clickable images, and headers that open a pop-up with additional information, among other features.</p>
<p>By making your long-form content more dynamic, you encourage more active reading and less skimming. Slowing your readers down and engaging them throughout the paper helps showcase the full value of your long-form content.</p>
<div id="interactive-video"></div>
<h3>10. Interactive video</h3>
<p>Video is already a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/09/15/video-content-marketing">hugely impactful channel</a>—HubSpot named short-form video the top content format, delivering <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high ROI</a> in 2025.</p>
<p>By adding interactive elements to an already high-engagement channel, you can potentially strengthen its effectiveness. Interactive videos allow viewers to click on elements, see more details, and delve further into the topic.</p>
<p>As an example, a car dealership could create an interactive video showing off the latest model to hit its lot. For each new feature shown in the video, the dealership could add clickable pop-up text that gives even more information on the benefits and specs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-zoo-1024x585.webp" alt="Interactive content - Video from the Edinburgh Zoo." width="1024" height="585" class="aligncenter wp-image-92135 size-large" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-zoo-1024x585.webp 1024w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-zoo-980x559.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-zoo-480x274.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://vimeo.com/blog/post/3-creators-using-vimeo-interactive-to-make-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>This interactive video</em></a><em> from the Edinburgh Zoo invites viewers to choose their own adventure (would you like to see the sun bears or penguins first?) and to click to learn more about each animal along the way. </em></p>
<div id="interactive-social-content"></div>
<h3>11. Interactive social content</h3>
<p>Social media platforms know the power of interactive content, and that’s why many have incorporated interactive features for users to harness.</p>
<p>On Instagram and TikTok, you can add poll or quiz stickers to your Stories or videos. On LinkedIn, you can create and run a poll.</p>
<p>Including interactive content regularly on your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/social-media-calendar-template">social media content calendar</a> keeps your audience engaged. It reinforces that your business’s social media page is a place for dialogue with you, and positions you as an approachable, friendly brand.</p>
<div id="augmented-reality"></div>
<h3>12. Augmented reality</h3>
<p>Augmented reality (AR) won’t be right for every business, but there are certain industries where the technology is a natural fit.</p>
<p>Essentially, AR inserts a computer-generated image into a real physical space. On mobile devices, users can point their camera at the environment they’re in, and AR can add a digital image to the real world shown on the screen.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-AR.png.webp" alt="Interactive content - AR of a room showing a chair." width="937" height="527" class="alignnone wp-image-92136 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-AR.png.webp 937w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/interactive-content-wordstream-AR.png-480x270.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.ikea.com/global/en/newsroom/innovation/ikea-launches-ikea-place-a-new-app-that-allows-people-to-virtually-place-furniture-in-their-home-170912/?assetId=0-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Many furniture companies use AR tools to allow consumers to virtually try pieces in their homes before buying. In the example above from the IKEA app, you can see how users hold their camera phones up to the area where they want to see the furniture and then virtually place the couch, chair, or rug in their existing space.</p>
<p>Augmented reality is great for retailers who want to give their customers an opportunity to virtually try their products before they buy.</p>
<h2>Using interactive content to build deeper connections with your audience</h2>
<p>Interactive content, by its very nature, encourages your audience to engage more meaningfully with your brand. It creates space for two-way conversation in a way that static content simply can’t. And opening the door to dialogue helps establish your brand as a place your audience can go for advice and answers.</p>
<p>Even businesses with a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/stretch-your-marketing-budget">limited marketing budget</a> can take advantage of existing tools to start releasing interactive content. From social media polls to free survey tools, there are simple, low-cost ways to begin leveraging the power of interactive content today.</p>

<h2>What to include in your Instagram captions for summer</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/instagram-algorithm">Instagram</a> is a visual platform first. It’s where you <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-media-image-sizes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">share photos and videos with your audience</a>. You can even go live and provide real-time video updates. But alongside this visual content, there is space to caption your work.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/summer-instagram-caption.webp" alt="summer instagram captions - example fun summer instagram caption" width="793" height="480" class="aligncenter wp-image-91463 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/summer-instagram-caption.webp 793w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/summer-instagram-caption-480x291.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 793px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Cloudless skies, big smiles, and a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C9VJ2PruUNm/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caption</a> that leans into those summer holiday vibes.</em></p>
<p>As on all social platforms, take advantage of all the features — an empty or underutilized caption is a missed opportunity!</p>
<p>When crafting your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/summer-instagram-captions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">summer Instagram captions</a> (or, really, any Instagram captions), these tips can help you appeal to readers and even boost your reach and engagement.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f5d3.png" alt="🗓" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Download our free <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteMonthlySocialMediaCalendarTemplate.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Template_MonthlySocialMediaCalendar_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2025 social media calendar</a> for more caption, hashtag, and post ideas to last you all year long!</strong></p>
<h3>Summer Instagram caption do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts</h3>
<p>Let’s start with some “dos:”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DO </strong>use hashtags. Research has found that posts with <a href="https://mention.com/en/blog/instagram-hashtags-engagement/">11 or more</a> hashtags see the highest engagement on Instagram.</li>
<li><strong>DO</strong> watch your caption length. Captions with fewer than <a href="https://www.socialinsider.io/blog/instagram-caption-length/">30 words</a> typically perform best.</li>
<li><strong>DO</strong> try emojis. These little characters can add some visual interest to your caption. Including one or two lends your post levity and whimsy. Don’t overdo it, though. A caption that treats emojis as hieroglyphs can be hard to understand.</li>
<li><strong>DO</strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/05/best-call-to-action-phrases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> include a CTA</a>, where appropriate. Not all of your Instagram content needs to drive audience action. But when a post aims to achieve a specific marketing goal (e.g., “We want to encourage more sign-ups for our upcoming event”), then include a CTA that asks your audience to take action (e.g., “Follow the link in bio to register!”).</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/summer-instagram-caption-example.webp" alt="summer instagram captions - example of a good summer instagram caption" width="816" height="563" class="aligncenter wp-image-91461 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/summer-instagram-caption-example.webp 816w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/summer-instagram-caption-example-480x331.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 816px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C93Sa7ttlCz/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This</a> short caption sets a scene and has readers envisioning a day-to-evening look for summer.</em></p>
<p>Just as important are the “don’ts:”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DON’T</strong> be inauthentic. Stay true to your brand voice. Don’t adopt a cooler or younger persona just because you’re on a social platform.</li>
<li><strong>DON’T</strong> forget about your audience. Social media is a place for you to<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/27/brand-messaging" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> build your brand</a>, increase awareness, and establish yourself as a trustworthy presence in your industry. You can only do those things if you keep your audience — their needs and pain points — in mind as you draft your content.</li>
<li><strong>DON’T</strong> skew to sales-focused messaging. Because social media is a “<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/sales-funnel-template/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top of the funnel</a>” channel, it’s not a place for the hard sell. If you have a specific goal in mind (e.g, promoting an upcoming sale), then you can include more overt sales language. But mostly, Instagram is a place to build awareness and interest.</li>
</ul>

<h2>On-page and technical SEO statistics</h2>
<p>Google is notoriously tight-lipped about how, exactly, it <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-algorithm-documents-leak">ranks sites in search</a>. But we’ve long known that technical elements like page load time and mobile friendliness play a role. These statistics shed some light on just how much (or how little) certain <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/06/on-page-seo">on-page</a> and technical elements really impact SEO.</p>
<ul>
<li>An analysis of more than 2,300 websites found that Google rewrote over <a href="https://zyppy.com/seo/title-tags/google-title-rewrite-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">61%</a> of all meta titles. This often happens to address concerns with length (too long or too short), keyword repetition, and missing brand names.</li>
<li>Google also rewrites meta descriptions; a survey of 192,656 web pages found Google rewrote nearly <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/meta-description-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">63%</a> of them.</li>
<li>Google is more likely to rewrite meta-descriptions for long-tail keywords (<a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/meta-description-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">65%</a>) than for broad, high-volume keywords (60%).</li>
<li>A technical SEO campaign, where an agency focuses on technical fixes and optimization, can result in a <a href="https://firstpagesage.com/reports/seo-roi-statistics-fc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">117%</a> ROI.</li>
<li>URLs with words that are similar to the page’s keywords see a <a href="https://backlinko.com/google-ctr-stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">45%</a> higher click-through rate than URLs that contain no keywords.</li>

<p>As part of this <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-marketing-trends-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broader marketing trend</a>, businesses are seeing outsized results partnering with what the industry calls nano- or micro-influencers. While there’s no universal definition for these terms, typically they refer to influencers with a follower count in the thousands or tens of thousands.</p>
<p>These smaller influencers deliver big for the brands they work with. In a survey of marketing specialists from Influencer Intelligence, <a href="https://www.influencerintelligence.com/blog/TT1/new-report-the-rise-of-nano-influencers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">69%</a> reported that nano-influencers had boosted engagement with their brand.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, you can see why deploying a holiday influencer marketing campaign might be a smart move for your business. Let’s explore how to find a place for influencer marketing in your broader strategy.</p>

<h2>Holiday influencer marketing tips</h2>
<p>Before you dive in to holiday influencer marketing, here are the steps you need to take to make it a hit.</p>
<h3>Start with a holiday marketing plan</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/performance-max-holiday-strategies">holidays</a> are a critical time for businesses of all stripes to focus on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/17/holiday-marketing-ideas">marketing</a>. Consumer-facing brands often see their biggest revenue-generating months during the holiday season while B2Bs are closing deals with clients who wish to spend the rest of their annual budget and lock in vendors for the next year.</p>
<p>That’s why implementing a coordinated marketing effort during this time is crucial. And like any <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-create-a-small-business-marketing-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good marketing plan</a>, your approach to the holiday season should begin with SMART goals.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/smart-goals-acronym.webp" alt="smart goals acronym" width="460" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-80522" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/smart-goals-acronym.webp 460w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/smart-goals-acronym-231x300.webp 231w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<p>By defining clear, measurable objectives, you can then work backward to identify the tactics (and associated budget) to get you there. As you consider the tactics at your disposal, you can then sketch out how holiday influencer marketing might slot into your bigger plan.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/26a1.png" alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><strong> Free guide download &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLPPC101.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_PPC101_Download">PPC 101: Complete Guide to Google Ads</a></p>
<h3>Set your influencer marketing KPIs</h3>
<p>While your broad <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/holiday-promotions-and-marketing-campaign-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holiday marketing plan</a> will have its own defined goals, so too should each tactic within the larger strategy.</p>
<p>The key performance indicators, or KPIs, for each tactic should roll up into your larger strategic goals. So, how do you define what success looks like for your influencer marketing efforts, specifically, and how does that contribute to your big picture?</p>
<p>With influencer marketing, there are <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several metrics</a> that can help you assess the success of a campaign. You can easily measure statistics like views, impressions, and follower growth rate, all of which help you understand a campaign’s performance.</p>
<p>To take things a step further, look to create opportunities for clear attribution. For example, many brands provide their influencer partners with a branded promo code or URL. Then, when any sale comes in via that URL or code, the business knows it came through the influencer.</p>
<h3>Find the right influencers</h3>
<p>Once you’ve defined your own expectations for your influencer campaign, you have the clarity to go out and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/influencer-outreach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find the ideal person</a> (or people) to partner with.</p>
<p>The best part about <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/03/21/social-media-influencers">working with influencers</a> is that they’ve cultivated an audience for themselves. Most nano- and micro-influencers have a well-defined niche.</p>
<p>BookTok influencers speak to readers, while personal finance influencers help followers make smarter money moves. And, of course, there are the fashion, beauty, and wellness influencers sharing trending clothes, makeup tips, and fitness or nutrition advice.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holiday-influencer-marketing-beauty-influencer.webp" alt="holiday influencer marketing example from beauty influencer" width="719" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87075" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holiday-influencer-marketing-beauty-influencer.webp 719w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holiday-influencer-marketing-beauty-influencer-480x400.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 719px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C0KRjYTOj1M/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Finding the right influencers for your brand starts with defining your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a>. Put yourself in the mindset of your brand’s ideal customer: Which influencers would you follow? And which of these influencers is a natural fit for your business?</p>
<p>Depending on your business model, you might also want to consider geography. If you need an influencer who can create content in person at your store or restaurant, you’ll need someone local.</p>
<p>If heading out into the wilds of social media to find someone seems overwhelming, you might ask other small business owners for recommendations. Or, consider turning to a platform that helps connect brands with the best influencers for their audience and campaign goals.</p>
<h3>Pitch the influencers you like</h3>
<p>Once you’ve created a shortlist of potential influencers, it’s time to reach out with your pitch. Start by introducing your company, sharing what you appreciate about the influencer’s personal brand, and explaining why you think you’d be the right fit to work together.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holiday-influencer-marketing-example-merricksart.webp" alt="example of holiday influencer partnership with target" width="718" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87076" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holiday-influencer-marketing-example-merricksart.webp 718w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holiday-influencer-marketing-example-merricksart-480x400.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 718px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBaPI_qM4D9/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Be specific about your needs. Share high-level details about the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/local-social-media-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">type of social media campaign</a> you wish to run, the number and type of deliverables you’ll need, and the budget for your project.</p>
<p>You may not hear from every influencer you contact—many popular personalities receive multiple pitches a day. That’s why it’s important to create a shortlist rather than setting your sights on only one person.</p>
<h3>Provide your influencer marketing brief</h3>
<p>Once you’ve found the right influencer for your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-holiday-strategies">holiday campaign</a>, it’s time to get into <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/13/content-creation">content creation</a>. Another great thing about working with influencers is that they generate the actual content—one less thing for you to manage!</p>
<p>While influencers know their own audiences and are pros at creating posts and videos that resonate, you should still provide them with a little guidance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holiday-influencer-marketing-jcathell.webp" alt="holiday influencer marketing example with j cathell" width="719" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87077" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holiday-influencer-marketing-jcathell.webp 719w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holiday-influencer-marketing-jcathell-480x401.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 719px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C01zfwhrGCs/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Your influencer marketing brief should share the basics with your influencer partner:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are your campaign goals?</li>
<li>What KPIs will you track, and what targets do you hope to hit?</li>
<li>Are there any specific talking points you want them to cover in the post?</li>
<li>Is there a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">branded hashtag</a>, promo code, custom URL, or anything else they should include?</li>
<li>Do you have expectations around content review? Many brands want to review and approve influencer content before it goes live—share how you’d like to manage that process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, you want to strike the right balance between ensuring your desired <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/28/christmas-holiday-greetings-wishes">holiday message</a> gets out there and giving your influencer creative license to do what they do best: namely, create great content.</p>

<h2>Holiday influencer marketing ideas: Campaign types to try</h2>
<p>If you’re not sure how to deploy influencer marketing as part of your broader <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/10/17/holiday-marketing-ideas">holiday marketing</a> efforts, we’ve got some suggestions to spark ideas.</p>
<p>These campaign types are popular in the influencer marketing space and are a great way to spread the word about your brand.</p>
<h3>Product giveaways</h3>
<p>Many brands choose to partner with an influencer to give away some of their products to the influencer’s followers.</p>
<p>This tactic introduces your brand to a whole new audience quickly. People who don’t know you might be hesitant to pay for your product right away, but they’re far more likely to give you a chance if you’re offering a freebie.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holiday-influencer-marketing-example-mokosh.webp" alt="holiday influencer marketing example from Mokosh" width="889" height="565" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87078" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holiday-influencer-marketing-example-mokosh.webp 889w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holiday-influencer-marketing-example-mokosh-480x305.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 889px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Organic skincare brand <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CznIXA8PQ9f/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mokosh</a> partnered with wellness influencer Amy Crawford to give away some of its new products.</em></p>
<p>Consider giving away your hero product or a sample-sized set of products that are most representative of your brand. You want to put your best foot forward in a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/giveaway-ideas">product giveaway</a> to a new audience. Offering items that will dazzle is sure to generate positive attention on the influencer’s page.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Looking for more ways to promote your business?</strong> Download now &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite30BestWaysToPromote.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Marketing_The30BestWaysToPromoteYourBusiness_Download">30+ Ways to Promote Your Business (On Any Budget!)</a></p>
<h3>Discount codes</h3>
<p>Another popular influencer marketing tactic is the discount code. Provide your influencer partner with a specific discount or promotional code, which their followers can enter at checkout on your website.</p>
<p>This allows you to offer something tailored to this influencer’s audience, whether it’s a special discount or a free gift included with anything their followers buy.</p>
<p>It also gives your team the opportunity to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/08/attribution-models">attribute sales</a> to your influencer marketing campaign. When new customers enter an influencer’s promo code on your site, you’ll know it was the influencer’s content that brought them to you.</p>
<h3>Live selling</h3>
<p>If you’ve ever watched QVC or HSN, you’re familiar with the concept of live selling. A host showcases a set of items one by one and invites viewers to purchase the products.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holiday-influencer-marketing-campaign-example-lizzo.webp" alt="holiday influencer marketing example from lizzo" width="718" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87079" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holiday-influencer-marketing-campaign-example-lizzo.webp 718w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holiday-influencer-marketing-campaign-example-lizzo-480x400.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 718px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>In a similar vein of selling, pop superstar Lizzo often hops onto her Instagram to try on products from her clothing brand, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBMGt2wvwKz/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yitty</a>.</em></p>
<p>Today, brands and influencers have reimagined this approach for the digital era with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-selling">live selling</a> on social media. By going live on Instagram or TikTok, brands show off products in real-time, engage with prospective buyers, and direct viewers to the brand’s website to buy.</p>
<p>You can undertake this approach on your own via your brand’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">social channel</a>, or you may tap an influencer to go live with you. This is a more involved influencer tactic and might be best for influencers who have a proven track record with your business.</p>
<h3>Brand-influencer collaboration</h3>
<p>To tap into the popularity of your brand and your influencer partner&#8217;s following, consider launching a collaboration for the holidays.</p>
<p>Brand-influencer collaborations are a more advanced type of influencer partnership, so this is another tactic that might be best for an influencer you already know, like, and trust.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holiday-influencer-marketing-brand-partnership-example.webp" alt="holiday influencer marketing brand partnership example" width="719" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87080" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holiday-influencer-marketing-brand-partnership-example.webp 719w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/holiday-influencer-marketing-brand-partnership-example-480x400.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 719px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cqqb1tKs50_/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>These collaborations can be fruitful for you and the influencer you work with. They can be the basis of a longer-term partnership if initial sales are successful and you choose to continue (or even expand) your collaboration.</p>
<h3>In-person event</h3>
<p>If your broader holiday marketing plans involve hosting a live event, inviting an influencer to promote it and attend on the day is another tactic to try.</p>
<p>Here, it’s essential to select an influencer who you know has sway with your target audience. You want their presence at your event to entice your followers to actually show up.</p>
<p>This is also a more involved influencer campaign. It requires the influencer to promote the event in advance and engage your audience at the event. What does that in-person appearance look like? Are they simply attending and mingling with guests, or will they have a more formal role? Perhaps they take selfies with fans or sign their book or product.</p>
<h3>Unboxing</h3>
<p>Unboxing videos are wildly popular in the influencer arena. In them, an influencer walks through the entire process of opening a shipment from a brand, complete with narration of their inner monologue throughout.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/unboxing-holiday-influencer-marketing-example.webp" alt="holiday influencer marketing example of unboxing video" width="720" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-87081" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/unboxing-holiday-influencer-marketing-example.webp 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/unboxing-holiday-influencer-marketing-example-480x399.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBTqv43u3Eh/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>If you’d like your influencer partner to create an unboxing video, plan to send them some goodies you’d like to sell during this holiday season. This might include limited-edition holiday products or existing items you’d like to sell more of.</p>
<div id="holiday-influencer-marketing-wrap-up"></div>
<h2>Make your holiday influencer marketing holly jolly</h2>
<p>Avoid bah-humbug holiday influencer marketing by starting with a solid plan. Define your goals and identify the tactics that can help you achieve them—one of which may be influencer marketing.</p>
<p>Then, do your research to find the influencers that align with your brand, and reach out with a solid pitch to catch their attention. If they agree to work with you, provide a brief that gives them the information they need but leaves room for their creativity to shine through.</p>
<p>When you do all that, you create an opportunity to launch a successful influencer marketing campaign that delights your audience, introduces your brand to new people, and contributes to your overall marketing goals.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a recap of the best holiday influencer marketing <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/best-marketing-campaigns-of-2024">campaigns</a> to try:</p>

In 2023, consumers spent an estimated <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/newsroom/articles/shop-small/us-consumers-report-an-estimated--17-billion-spending-at-small-b.html">$17 billion</a> on Small Business Saturday.</p>

<h2>17 Small Business Saturday marketing ideas anyone can take advantage of</h2>
<p>No matter your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/niche-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">niche market</a> or preferred promotion channels, these<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-saturday-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Small Business Saturday marketing ideas</a> are sure to be a hit.</p>
<div id="small-business-saturday-sale"></div>
<h3>1. Run a sale or promotion</h3>
<p>This is a classic holiday marketing tactic for a reason: it works. Shoppers not only save up for the events each year, but they browse various retailers for the best deals. In fact, <a href="https://www.tidio.com/blog/black-friday-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">87%</a> of people plan on shopping between Black Friday and Cyber Monday—and Small Business Saturday is a part of this timeframe.</p>
<p>While consumers may assess their willingness to buy from large businesses purely on economics, they often give <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2025-marketing-planning">small businesses</a> a little leeway. Even if you can’t offer the steepest discount, consumers may factor in the sense of satisfaction they get in supporting a local shop.</p>
<p>Your sale or promotion can take several forms. Some popular Small Business Saturday ideas include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Doorbuster or early bird deals:</strong> Offer a special discount to those enthusiastic souls who are waiting outside your door when you open on Saturday morning.</li>
<li><strong>BOGO:</strong> The “buy one, get one” structure is a classic for brands, especially those in retail.</li>
<li><strong>Deals by category:</strong> Cut prices on specific categories of merchandise or service offerings.</li>
<li><strong>Bundle deals: </strong>Offer discounts when customers buy complementary products or services together (wine and cheese, shoes and socks, sheets and duvet cover—you get the idea).</li>
</ul>

<div id="local-events"></div>
<h3>2. Participate in local events</h3>
<p>Many cities and towns use Small Business Saturday as an opportunity to celebrate their region’s brands and encourage neighbors and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/increase-foot-traffic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visitors</a> alike to stimulate the local economy.</p>
<p>If yours is a city that’s hosting an event, be sure to get involved! And if you’re not sure what’s happening in your area, reach out to your local Chamber of Commerce. They may plan something you can take part in.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-social-post.webp" alt="small business saturday marketing - example social post" width="840" height="467" class="aligncenter wp-image-86200 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-social-post.webp 840w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-social-post-480x267.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 840px, 100vw" /></p>

<div id="small-business-saturday-events"></div>
<h3>3. Create your own Small Business Saturday event</h3>
<p>If your town isn’t doing something, why not take the initiative and host a Small Business Saturday event yourself?</p>
<p>Perhaps plan an in-store event designed to draw people to your brick-and-mortar location. Be sure to take your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target customer</a> into account when you create your event.</p>
<p>For example, a local bakery that caters to young families might offer a holiday cookie decorating class for kids. Meanwhile, the sophisticated florist down the street might invite adults to stop by for a holiday centerpiece design demonstration.</p>
<p>Allow your imagination to run wild as you flesh out this Small Business Saturday marketing idea. Whatever event you dream up, promote it in advance with fliers, on social media, and via your email list.</p>
<div id="small-business-saturday-partnership"></div>
<h3>4. Partner with other small business owners</h3>
<p>Don’t feel up to hosting an event on your own? Consider partnering with other local business owners to co-create a Small Business Saturday celebration.</p>
<p>You might all spearhead a larger event, creating a directory of participating small businesses. Go in on advertising together in advance, and offer incentives to customers who stop by multiple stores in your collective.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-partnership.webp" alt="small business saturday marketing ideas - ways to partner with other businesses example for small business saturday" width="657" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-86198 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-partnership.webp 657w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-partnership-480x438.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 657px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://hawaiidoggiebakery.org/2019/11/small-business-saturday-in-manoa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can pair up with just one or two other small businesses to host a smaller event. Look for natural crossover in your audience to create an event that will appeal to the customers you have in common.</p>
<p>For example, a local cafe might team up with the bookshop down the street and host a “coffee and a book” event. The coffee shop sets up an espresso machine at the bookstore, and visitors can grab a latte and curl up with a great read on the store’s shelves.</p>
<div id="small-business-saturday-map"></div>
<h3>5. Get listed on the American Express Small Business Saturday map</h3>
<p>As the founder of the event, American Express undertakes some Small Business Saturday marketing of its own. It hosts the <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/benefits/shop-small/#smallbusinessowners" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shop Small</a> map each year, and while it looks very similar to a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/02/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Maps</a> or <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/yelp-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yelp listing</a>, it’s special because it only features small businesses.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-map.webp" alt="small business saturday marketing ideas - american express map" width="844" height="384" class="aligncenter wp-image-86203 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-map.webp 844w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-map-480x218.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 844px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/benefits/shop-small/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>This is your opportunity to stand out in a space that’s free of multinational competitors! Take a few minutes to create your profile, or, if you already have one, confirm that your information is up to date.</p>
<div id="small-business-saturday-social-media-post"></div>
<h3>6. Share your Small Business Saturday plans on social media</h3>
<p>Organic social media is the perfect vehicle for sharing your Small Business Saturday plans. Whether it’s an event, sale, giveaway, or all of the above, posting about it on social media for Small Business Saturday gets the word out to your followers.</p>
<p>Remember to plan and post in advance to build anticipation. Tease sale items or hint at your big Small Business Saturday surprises to catch your audience’s attention. Some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media platforms</a>, like Instagram, even have features that help you generate excitement. Consider using the countdown sticker in your Stories leading up to the big day.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-social-media.webp" alt="small business saturday - marketing social media post example" width="785" height="479" class="aligncenter wp-image-86199 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-social-media.webp 785w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-social-media-480x293.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 785px, 100vw" /></p>

<p>Finally, don’t forget to use relevant hashtags! This can help people outside your follower count discover your business. <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-use-hashtags-with-hashtag-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Add hashtags</a> related to the broader event (#ShopSmall and #SmallBusinessSaturday are two big ones). Then, include some hashtags related to your city or town to get your posts in front of a local audience.</p>

<div id="small-business-saturday-giveaway"></div>
<h3>7. Start a social media giveaway or contest</h3>
<p>There’s no denying it: People love a social media <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/giveaway-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">giveaway</a>! You can build an online contest around just about any event, and Small Business Saturday is no exception.</p>
<p>Contests and giveaways can get the word out about your plans for Small Business Saturday, all while helping to build up your follower count. Often, businesses ask entrants to follow their accounts as part of entering the contest. If you run yours ahead of Small Business Saturday, you have a wider audience to market to in the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving.</p>
<div id="social-ads"></div>
<h3>8. Try social media ads</h3>
<p>While you’re logged into your social accounts, consider <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/18/social-media-advertising" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running some social media ads</a> before Small Business Saturday to get your message out to an even wider audience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-sale.webp" alt="small business saturday marketing - sale example" width="769" height="470" class="aligncenter wp-image-86201 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-sale.webp 769w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-sale-480x293.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 769px, 100vw" /></p>

<p>You may choose to create an entire ad campaign or simply boost existing organic posts to broaden their reach. How you opt to advertise will depend on your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing budget</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/15/marketing-objectives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">objectives</a>.</p>
<p>If you design a full campaign, be sure to focus on setting the right audience within the social platform. You can target based on geography, age, gender, and other demographics to get your ads seen by the people who are most likely to shop with you on Small Business Saturday.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4ca.png" alt="📊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />See how much it might cost you to run Facebook Ads for Small Business Saturday</strong> in our free, exclusive <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/facebook-benchmarks?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_FBAdsBenchmarks2024_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Advertising Benchmarks Report</a>!</p>

<h3>9. Tap a local influencer for support</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/digital-marketing/influencer-marketing-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Influencer marketing</a> is a wildly effective tactic that’s sometimes overlooked by small businesses.</p>
<p>Some hear the phrase and assume it’s only for big brands with mega budgets, but an ever-expanding pool of micro-influencers—those with thousands, rather than millions, of followers—are making influencer marketing a viable tactic for small brands.</p>
<p>To find the right micro-influencer to promote your Small Business Saturday efforts, look for someone who’s a trusted source for your ideal audience. A gym might partner with a popular wellness influencer, while a clothing boutique might tap a fashion influencer.</p>
<p>And when you work with a micro-influencer, you’re likely to see stronger results than you would with a big name. Influencers with fewer than 15,000 followers typically see a <a href="https://www.upfluence.com/influencer-marketing/influencer-engagement-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3.86%</a> engagement rate on Instagram, while mega influencers with 1 million or more followers see much lower engagement; the average rate is 1.21%.</p>
<div id="online-communities"></div>
<h3>10. Talk your business up in local online communities</h3>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/brand-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Your brand&#8217;s community</a> doesn’t only exist in the real world anymore. Today, it’s easy to connect with neighbors across a wide range of online forums and gathering places.

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Community-focused message boards are a go-to spot for neighbors seeking local recommendations. </em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hartford/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Often, these forums become a place where local business owners can market themselves, and where community members shout out businesses they love to neighbors in search of a recommendation.</p>
<p>Join these forums and make your presence known in the digital town square. If group mods allow business owners to promote their work, create a post inviting everyone to stop by your store on Small Business Saturday.</p>

<h3>11. Create an email marketing campaign</h3>
<p>Email marketing can play an essential role in building anticipation for your Small Business Saturday plans with your existing audience.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/01/email-marketing-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Email marketing</a> is at its best when it’s built as a multi-message campaign, rather than a single email. The average open rate across industries hovers around <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/guides/email-marketing-benchmarks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">21%</a>, which means it might take <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/01/automated-email-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than one email</a> to get your readers to open and click.</p>
<p>Your email marketing campaign should serve two main purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Repeat your Small Business Saturday message so everyone gets it, even if they’re not diligently reading every one of your emails.</li>
<li>Create a growing sense of excitement as the day draws nearer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Start with a teaser message, sharing that something big is coming this Small Business Saturday. Then, use each subsequent email to reveal a little bit more about your plan. You might even offer a special discount or deal that’s just for your loyal email subscribers.</p>

<div id="ppc"></div>
<h3>12. Add a Small Business Saturday-specific campaign into your PPC rotation</h3>
<p>If you’re already running <a href="https://localiq.com/products/search-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search ads</a>, consider launching a new campaign specifically for your Small Business Saturday marketing efforts.</p>
<p>The key to effective <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/local-ppc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local PPC campaigns</a> is finding the perfect marriage between message and audience. Focus on your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/keyword-prioritization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keyword strategy</a>, and consider targeting some <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/keyword-research-for-ppc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PPC keywords</a> that will help you stand out in local, relevant searches. You might also focus on terms related to Small Business Saturday, holiday shopping, or other timely phrases.</p>
<p>Then, invest in creating attention-getting headlines and body copy to help your search ads stand out on the crowded results page. And, of course, create a customized landing page for your Small Business Saturday campaign. That way, when readers click through, they find information about your plans for the big day.</p>

<div id="local-ads"></div>
<h3>13. Advertise in local publications</h3>
<p>Amex founded Small Business Saturday to encourage neighborhood engagement with local brands. Given the spirit of the day, your local publication is the perfect place to share your Small Business Saturday plans.</p>
<p>Whether your local publication is a citywide newspaper or neighborhood pamphlet, take out some advertising space on its pages. In doing so, you’ll know that your message is being seen by the most relevant, most local audience around.</p>
<div id="local-media"></div>
<h3>14. Drum up local media attention</h3>
<p>In addition to buying ad space in local papers, you might also pitch local journalists with Small Business Saturday story ideas.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-local-media.webp" alt="small business saturday marketing ideas - small business local media coverage example" width="787" height="433" class="aligncenter wp-image-86204 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-local-media.webp 787w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/small-business-saturday-marketing-local-media-480x264.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 787px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://citylifestyle.com/articles/free-ways-to-support-local-businesses-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>If you’re doing something unique for Small Business Saturday, you can approach a local publication to see if they’re interested in covering it. Or, if you’re partnering with several local businesses, the story you can collectively pitch is one of collaboration and a celebration of shopping small.</p>
<div id="direct-mail"></div>
<h3>15. Give direct mail a try</h3>
<p>Just as with local media coverage, direct mail is a tactic that allows you to connect with a local audience and foster a true sense of community.</p>
<p>A direct mailer with a discount is never a bad idea. Send the coupon right to your neighbors’ doors, and it just may kindle a desire to support local businesses and shop small—with you.</p>
<p>And as an added bonus for your Small Business Saturday marketing efforts: Direct mail makes it super easy to measure ROI. Each person who walks up to your register with a coupon in hand represents a sale that’s directly attributable to your campaign.</p>
<div id="google-business-profile"></div>
<h3>16. Update your Google Business Profile with Small Business Saturday marketing specifics</h3>
<p>You likely already have a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/10/create-google-my-business-account" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Business Profile</a>, but is it <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/optimize-google-my-business-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fully optimized</a>?</p>

<div id="referrals"></div>
<h3>17. Encourage people to come back</h3>
<p>If someone showed up to shop on Small Business Saturday, maybe they deserve a little extra love. Create a deal or promo code they can use in the future as a thank you for shopping small this holiday season.</p>
<p>That generosity is in keeping with the seasonal spirit. Plus, a coupon code or offer for the future nudges these shoppers to return to you again after the holidays are through.</p>
<h2>Big ideas to power your Small Business Saturday marketing</h2>
<p>Small Business Saturday is an opportunity to kick the holiday season off right—with big sales numbers and lots of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/10/04/customer-experience-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happy customers</a>.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cost per lead (CPL) is a significant metric in digital advertising. For pay-per-click (PPC) and social media campaigns, businesses monitor CPL to understand whether their marketing efforts (and associated costs) are worth it.</p>
<p>The more expensive it is to acquire a lead, the less gross profit you’ll expect to see in the long run, as lead acquisition costs eat into your earnings. Marketers and advertisers want to find the sweet spot between investing in getting the word out about their company and ensuring those efforts are as efficient as possible in converting new prospects into leads.</p>
<p>So, we put together this complete cost-per-lead guide to help with that. We&#8217;ll walk through how you can calculate and lower your cost per lead in a flash.</p>

<h2>How do you calculate cost per lead?</h2>
<p>To identify the best ways to lower CPL, it first helps to understand how it’s calculated. The cost-per-lead formula is pretty simple.</p>
<p>Total cost / total number of conversions = CPL</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/how-to-calculate-cost-per-lead.webp" alt="cost per lead formula" width="935" height="392" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85496" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/how-to-calculate-cost-per-lead.webp 935w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/how-to-calculate-cost-per-lead-480x201.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 935px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>So, if you want to lower your CPL, you have two options: aim to generate more conversions while holding your spending steady or decrease your spending while maintaining your number of conversions.</p>

<div id="how-to-lower-cost-per-lead"></div>
<h2>How to lower cost per lead: 7 tips</h2>
<p>Here are seven ways to lower your cost per lead over time.</p>
<h3>1. Take stock of your current performance metrics</h3>
<p>The first step in finding ways to lower CPL is learning where you stand today. Crunch the numbers for each marketing or advertising campaign you have underway. This will allow you to identify any weak spots quickly. Is there a particular campaign that’s quite costly but not generating many leads? It might be time to forgo that pursuit.</p>
<p>On the flip side, you can ferret out opportunities for improvement. If you have a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/09/free-and-low-budget-marketing-ideas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low-cost marketing tactic</a> that generates quite a few leads already, can you optimize it further to attract even more leads?</p>
<p>During this process, you might wonder if your CPL is good. It’s a fair question! Any CPL greater than the cost of your product or service is too high. It can also be helpful to measure yourself against competitors by checking out <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/search-advertising-benchmarks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPL benchmarks</a> by industry.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-cost-per-click-2024-scaled.webp" alt="google ads average cost per click 2024 chart" width="2259" height="2560" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82730" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-cost-per-click-2024-scaled.webp 2259w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-cost-per-click-2024-1280x1451.webp 1280w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-cost-per-click-2024-980x1111.webp 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-ads-cost-per-click-2024-480x544.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 2259px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Once you’ve analyzed your campaigns and identified the ones with a noteworthy CPL—good or bad—you may wish to dig into that specific <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/26/marketing-channels" rel="noopener">marketing channel</a> even further.</p>
<p>You can look at things like CPL across devices (desktop versus mobile) or consider the parts that make up a particular advertising campaign. For example, if a PPC ad has a very poor CPL but a very high click-through rate, that&#8217;s usually an indication of a low <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/landing-page-best-practices/" rel="noopener">conversion rate on the landing page</a>. It’s worth digging into what’s causing your prospects to leave that page without converting.</p>
<h3>2. Rethink your targeting strategy</h3>
<p>When you run digital ads, a considerable portion of the work behind the scenes is setting your targeting strategy. For search engine marketing, you target certain keywords, while social media platforms allow you to target based on users’ demographic information.</p>
<p>Either way, your targeting strategy can make or break your success. Go too narrow or specific, and you severely limit the number of people who can see your ads. Plus, it can drive up the cost of your ads. But go too broad, and your ads will be served to many people who won’t find your message relevant.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/negative-keyword-examples.webp" alt="negative keyword examples in google ads" width="664" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85497" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/negative-keyword-examples.webp 664w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/negative-keyword-examples-480x434.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Google offers<a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2453972?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> examples</a> of negative keywords. </em></p>
<p>You want to find somewhere in the middle that’s just right. With PPC ads, that might mean adding <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2453972?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative keywords</a>, which excludes specific search terms from your campaign and helps you target only the most relevant audience.</p>
<p>For social media ads (like those on Meta), it’s about starting broad and refining as you learn more about what’s working. You may even consider creating lookalike audiences, which target Meta users who share attributes with your current customers.</p>
<h3>3. Try A/B testing</h3>
<p>To <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ab-testing-examples" rel="noopener">A/B test</a> an ad, you run two similar versions of the same concept with a tweak in one area. For example, you might try two headlines on an ad to see which performs better.</p>
<p>This can help you hone in on the messaging that best resonates with your audience, which can drive down cost per lead as you learn to run more efficient, effective ad campaigns.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/lower-cost-per-lead-a-b-test-checklist.webp" alt="checklist of what to include in a/b testing hypothesis" width="935" height="523" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85498" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/lower-cost-per-lead-a-b-test-checklist.webp 935w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/lower-cost-per-lead-a-b-test-checklist-480x268.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 935px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Some digital advertising platforms even help you automate the process. For example, Google’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/responsive-search-ads" rel="noopener">responsive search ads</a> invite you to input up to 15 headlines and four descriptions for each ad. Google then uses AI to serve up different combinations of your headline and description text to see what performs best.</p>
<p>Similarly, Meta has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1738164643098669?id=445653312788501" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an A/B testing feature</a> that allows you to run different permutations of your ad based on an identified hypothesis.</p>
<p>Take advantage of these built-in tools to test different advertising approaches and find the one that gets you the highest response rate among your target audience.</p>
<h3>4. Align keywords with copy</h3>
<p>This one of our seven ways to lower CPL is just as helpful for paid marketing tactics as for organic ones. Whether you’re running PPC ads or drafting your title tags and meta descriptions, <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/website-copywriting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aligning your copy</a> with your audience&#8217;s search terms is wise.</p>
<p>The example below exemplifies this approach. These furniture companies, ranking in organic spots one through four on the Google results page, don’t use their brand name or location in the title tag. Instead, they all include some variation of the search term “small space furniture brand.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead-example-serp.webp" alt="example of ad with keywords and copy aligned" width="774" height="555" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85499" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead-example-serp.webp 774w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead-example-serp-480x344.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 774px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>These brands might not be as familiar to searchers, so instead of competing on name recognition, they lead with their value propositions: “You live in a small space and need furniture that will fit it? You can see from our title tag that we’re your retailer.”</p>
<p>When your online presence can draw searchers in with a promise that you offer the solution they need, that’s how you could lower your cost per lead. It increases the likelihood that leads will click through and make a purchase.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f50e.png" alt="🔎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Want help finding the right keywords?</strong> Use our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool">Free Keyword Tool</a>!</p>
<h3>5. Strengthen your landing page</h3>
<p>Each ad that you run should drive to a dedicated landing page. You’ve worked to tailor your ad language to suit the keywords you’re targeting perfectly, and your prospect has clicked on your link as a result of that hard work. If they land on your homepage without finding further mention of what they came here for, they can quickly get lost, confused, or distracted.</p>
<p>Instead, hook them in with a customized landing page that continues to address their specific need.</p>
<p>Let’s say you run an ad to promote an upcoming conference you’re hosting. The landing page should drive to a page about that event, with a click-to-action (CTA) to register.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead-keyword-serp.webp" alt="ad example leading to landing page" width="788" height="609" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85500" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead-keyword-serp.webp 788w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead-keyword-serp-480x371.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 788px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/lower-cost-per-lead-cta.webp" alt="landing page associated with ad" width="739" height="434" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85501" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/lower-cost-per-lead-cta.webp 739w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/lower-cost-per-lead-cta-480x282.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 739px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>In<a href="https://vtmerch.com/collections/vault-2024?tw_source=google&amp;tw_adid=705817767517&amp;tw_campaign=21474775600&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw_ZC2BhAQEiwAXSgClm1m6VlYsBZuU_0ZKCHU39PYJYYmWA_ptZs5lc9xswAt4fRPFqgf3hoC4DEQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> this example</a>, the top sponsored result for the search term “conferences for investment professionals” drove to a customized landing page where the CTA invites visitors to “secure [their] seats.” </em></p>
<h3>6. Incorporate a lead capture form</h3>
<p>Once a prospect has made it all the way to your landing page, giving them a clear path to convert is another favorite way to lower CPL.</p>
<p>On a landing page, that means including a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/lead-generation-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lead capture form</a>. This is where you invite your prospects to enter their contact information. There are several CTAs you can try to get you there. The one that works for you will depend on your business, but you might try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Join our newsletter</li>
<li>Register for our event</li>
<li>Download our whitepaper or report</li>
<li>Schedule a call</li>
<li>Book a demo</li>
</ul>
<p>You get the idea. This CTA gives your prospect a reason to want to stay in touch and opens the door for you to continue to connect with them until they’re ready to make a purchase.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Download our free guide to the <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">42 best call-to-action phrases</a> ever</strong> to get ideas for how to attract more low-cost leads!</p>
<h3>7. Make the most of remarketing</h3>
<p>Remarketing allows brands to stay in front of prospects who have visited their website. Maybe you didn’t convert them the first time, but remaining in their field of vision gives you a second chance.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever had a display ad for a product you just viewed follow you across every site you visit for the next few weeks, you’ve experienced remarketing. And if you’ve ever clicked on those ads, you know why they work.</p>
<p>It often takes time for a consumer to get to know, like, and trust a brand. That’s why <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/e-commerce-report-shows-returning-customers-are-more-valuable-than-new-ones-2016-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly half</a> of all transactions on a website come from returning visitors.</p>
<p>If you follow a new prospect around for a few weeks with your remarketing ads, they may eventually come around. And the numbers on remarketing bear that out: studies show a conversion rate that’s over <a href="https://www.i-com.net/blog/remarketing-what-its-all-about-and-does-it-really-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">292%</a> higher for retargeted users than it is for new faces.</p>

<h2>Try these tactics to lower your cost per lead and save on spend</h2>
<p>There’s no wrong answer here! Working systematically through the list and measuring each technique’s impact on your CPL can help you spot the ones most likely to drive desired results.</p>
<p>As your CPL drops, you can also return to the most effective tactics and look for further opportunities to refine your approach. The best thing about digital marketing is that there’s always room to improve, and you get real-time feedback to help guide your decision-making process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The social media landscape is vast, and what people say out there about your brand can have implications for your business.</p>
<p>Understandably, companies want to manage their brand’s reputation online. A social media policy can give your team helpful guidance to reduce the risk of them doing something online that could damage their personal or professional brand or paint your business in a negative light.</p>

<h2>What is a social media policy?</h2>
<p>A social media policy is a document written by your organization to provide guidance to employees about their actions and behaviors online.</p>
<p>The policy is not only applicable to people posting on behalf of your brand. In fact, there should be an additional,<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/social-media-branding-guidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> separate guide</a> for social media managers and anyone else with the passwords to your business’s social accounts. Your social media policy will speak to your entire team so that no one makes a mistake that could damage your<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-reputation-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> brand’s reputation</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, anyone who works for your business represents your brand, and how they behave online can impact the public’s perception of your business.</p>

<h2>Why do I need a social media policy?</h2>
<p>Bad online etiquette and actions can reflect poorly on the individual and the business they work for, so it’s in everyone’s best interest to lay some ground rules (think about doing the same for how your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-policy">team uses AI</a>).</p>
<p>A social media policy can help your business:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid potential crises:</strong> From bad PR to the inadvertent release of privileged information, a rogue employee on social exposes your business to all sorts of risks.</li>
<li><strong>Create brand advocates: </strong>When you give your team clear guidelines about your business’s social media policies, they may feel more comfortable posting positive things about your brand, knowing it’s allowed and encouraged.</li>
<li><strong>Facilitate brand cohesion: </strong>Clear written policies help create consistency in your brand’s portrayal online across channels. A social media policy can work in conjunction with your <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/small-business-brand-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand kit</a> and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/01/09/social-media-marketing-strategies">social media marketing</a> guide to help you keep everything consistent.</li>

<h2>What to include in a social media policy</h2>
<p>Now that you see its value, let’s talk about what to include in your social media policy.</p>
<h3>Clear language outlining expectations</h3>
<p>Any great policy makes it easy for people to understand what the document is asking of them. To ensure your social media policy effectively communicates your expectations, answer the six journalistic questions: who, what, when, where, why, and how.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Who does this policy apply to?</strong> Does it apply to your entire team or only to certain members? Do the guidelines differ by role?</li>
<li><strong>What are the specifics of the policy? </strong>Clearly spell out your expectations for behaviors and the consequences for acting outside of them.</li>
<li><strong>When does this policy apply?</strong> It’s worth noting that you can’t tell your employees they must post something specific on their own social media accounts. It’s technically their personal property. However, you can call out certain behaviors that your company won’t tolerate (i.e., sharing nonpublic company information, posting hate speech, getting into public fights with customers).</li>
<li><strong>Where does your social media policy apply?</strong> Call out a list of the included social media channels and highlight any that may be specifically excluded.</li>
<li><strong>Why do you have a social media policy?</strong> If people don’t know why the policy exists, they might not feel compelled to follow it. Discuss why the policy is mutually beneficial in gaining team buy-in.</li>
<li><strong>How does the policy work?</strong> Are there specific steps your employees should take before engaging with your brand online (i.e., should they connect with your marketing team before posting certain things about your business)? What tools or outreach channels should they use to discuss policy questions or clarifications with their manager or HR?</li>
</ul>
<h3>A delineation of expectations based on relevant factors</h3>
<p>Your social media policy may not be universally applicable. Your CEO, whose LinkedIn profile lists her as the company&#8217;s leader, should be held to a different standard than the private Instagram of a cashier.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/social-media-policy-wordstream-founder-post.jpg" alt="social media policy - LinkedIn post from a company founder." width="502" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-84838 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/social-media-policy-wordstream-founder-post.jpg 502w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/social-media-policy-wordstream-founder-post-480x574.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 502px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You wouldn’t expect a frontline worker to post like a </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anastasia-volkova1_climateweek-activity-7208483826191265792-IKWg?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Co-founder</em></a><em>, and your social media policy should reflect that.</em></p>
<p>In your social media policy document, you’ll want to clarify expectations based on relevant factors, which may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The employee’s role: </strong>You may have different expectations for people in leadership roles versus more junior employees.</li>
<li><strong>The social platform:</strong> Guidelines may vary for platforms where someone is a “private citizen” (i.e., a personal<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/23/tiktok-marketing"> TikTok</a> account) versus one where they are explicitly connected to your brand (i.e., a<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/05/linkedin-advertising"> LinkedIn</a> that lists their role at your company).</li>
<li><strong>The content of the post:</strong> Someone posting a photo of their dog on Instagram? It&#8217;s probably not something an employer should comment on. An employee posting a tirade about their manager on TikTok and tagging your company in it? It is a poor reflection of your brand and something you have a vested interest in preventing.</li>
<li><strong>The employee’s association with the company:</strong> Is the content an employee shared their own opinion, or are they being asked to post as an official spokesperson for the business? Asking employees to clarify the capacity in which they’re posting may be something you include in your social media policy.</li>
<li><strong>Specific regulatory guidelines: </strong>If you work in a highly regulated industry (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/03/10/healthcare-marketing">healthcare</a>, finance, gaming, etc.), the agency that regulates your sector may have specific parameters about what you can and cannot do on social media. Include relevant regulatory guidance in your social media policy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sample dos and dont’s</h3>
<p>It’s one thing to read a policy&#8217;s legalese; it’s quite another to see examples of compliance or violation. Providing employees with hypothetical examples of what is and isn’t allowed can help them better understand the policy in action.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/social-media-policy-wordstream-musk.jpg" alt="social media policy - Tweet from Elon Musk." width="858" height="433" class="aligncenter wp-image-84839 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/social-media-policy-wordstream-musk.jpg 858w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/social-media-policy-wordstream-musk-480x242.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 858px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Sharing examples of improper social media posts, like this one that landed </em><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2018-219" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Elon Musk in hot water</em></a><em>, can help employees understand your social media policy.</em></p>
<p>Of course, you don’t only need to share worst-case-scenario don’ts. You can also provide helpful guidance on social media specifics, like picking a great headshot or listing your role and responsibilities on LinkedIn. These dos not only paint your company in a good light; they also help your team look approachable and professional.</p>
<div id="social-media-policy-examples-we-love"></div>
<h2>Social media policy examples we love</h2>
<p>Are you starting to think about what your social media policy might look like in action? Take a look at these real-life examples for inspiration as you begin to draft your own.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting: We are marketing people, not legal experts. Before distributing any formal employee policy, get input from relevant professionals, like your HR leader and attorney, to ensure you’re not <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/publications/youraba/2019/december-2019/does-your-social-media-policy-violate-labor-law-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">violating labor law</a> or otherwise overstepping your bounds.</p>
<h3>Massachusetts General Hospital</h3>
<p>Mass General Hospital (MGH) is one of the most respected medical institutions in the country, so reputation management is important to the brand. Plus, its employees have access to sensitive information about patients’ health diagnoses and treatment plans, which they’re obligated to keep confidential.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/notices/socialmediapolicy-employees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MGH social media policy</a> uses clear language and provides concrete guidance to help employees draw lines between their personal and professional lives online.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/social-media-policy-wordstream-mass-general.jpg" alt="social media policy - policy screenshot from Mass Gen Hospital." width="884" height="533" class="aligncenter wp-image-84840 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/social-media-policy-wordstream-mass-general.jpg 884w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/social-media-policy-wordstream-mass-general-480x289.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 884px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/notices/socialmediapolicy-employees" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>It also doesn’t talk down to anyone; it shows trust in employees’ judgment by providing reminders of internet best practices without getting too mired in the details. This is the perfect tone for an environment where most employees are professionals with the intelligence and common sense to make it through nursing or medical school.</p>
<h3>Tufts University</h3>
<p><a href="https://communications.tufts.edu/policies-guidelines/smpersonaluseguidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tuft’s social media policy</a> is short and sweet, which is considerate of colleagues’ time.</p>
<p>It acknowledges the reality of our world and doesn’t try to implement draconian limits on when employees can check social at work. It does ask that employees be reasonable about their social media usage while in the office, and it says that anything done on social media from a Tufts device may be monitored. That’s a fair way to address the topic.</p>
<p>As an institution of higher learning, it also calls out employees’ right to academic freedom.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/social-media-policy-wordstream-acedemic-freedom.jpg" alt="social media policy - Image from Tuft's documentation." width="537" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-84841 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/social-media-policy-wordstream-acedemic-freedom.jpg 537w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/social-media-policy-wordstream-acedemic-freedom-480x536.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 537px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://opseu.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/academic-freedom-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>The policy asks that employees draw a clear line between their personal work and what they do for the University. For example, if a professor runs a Substack on their own time, they should note that the thoughts and opinions expressed within it are their own.</p>
<p>They also link out to other related policies at the end of the document so employees can easily find other information they might need.</p>
<h3>Information Commissioner’s Office</h3>
<p>This<a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/policies-and-procedures/4021371/social-media-use-policy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> policy from the Information Commissioner’s Office</a> (ICO) is a bit longer and more explicit. As a government institution in the UK, it makes sense that it would take a formal approach.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/social-media-policy-wordstream-ico.jpg" alt="social media policy - image from ICO's policiy. " width="494" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-84842 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/social-media-policy-wordstream-ico.jpg 494w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/social-media-policy-wordstream-ico-480x583.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 494px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/policies-and-procedures/4021371/social-media-use-policy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>What we like about this social media policy is the inclusion of clear consequences for breaching the guidance set forth in the document. It also has a specific section to help those who post to social media on behalf of the ICO or are contacted by the media for comments as representatives of the organization.</p>
<p>Finally, the document closes with some frequently asked questions. This section helps clarify some of the policy’s dos and don’ts, making it easier for employees to understand what’s expected of them.</p>
<h3>The New York Times</h3>
<p>The<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/editorial-standards/social-media-guidelines.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> New York Times’ social media policy</a> seeks to ensure its team maintains the highest level of journalistic ethics when posting online. The policy recognizes that there is a fuzzy line between public personas and private lives, especially for public figures in the media.</p>
<p>While journalists are entitled to their own feelings in private, anything they post online (even if it’s as a private citizen in a closed or anonymous online community) is likely to be interpreted as either factual reporting or representative of the Times’ opinion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/social-media-policy-wordstream-NYT.jpg" alt="social media policy - NYT policy screenshot." width="490" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-84843 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/social-media-policy-wordstream-NYT.jpg 490w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/social-media-policy-wordstream-NYT-480x588.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 490px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/editorial-standards/social-media-guidelines.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>This policy is especially focused on maintaining a non-partisan presence. Since the Times touts its impartiality as a brand differentiator, asking journalists to protect that neutrality is of the utmost importance.</p>
<p>It’s also nice that the Times consulted with a team of its journalists to devise its policy. Getting their input helps legitimize the guidelines with other colleagues at the paper.</p>
<h2>Drafting a reasonable, effective social media policy for your organization</h2>
<p>Sharing your company’s expectations for employees’ social media conduct can help all parties avoid pitfalls. It keeps your team and brand looking professional, and it might even inspire your team to confidently advocate for your business, knowing when and how to speak publicly about your company.</p>
<p>Remember, this is a document you should draft and discuss with your HR and legal experts. And keep it handy when you audit your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-media-audit">social media accounts</a>. It’s also something to consider asking your employees about. When you work with a team to create a fair policy, it’s all the more likely to generate the results you want.</p>

<h2>What is a SWOT analysis?</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/12/20/swot-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SWOT analysis</a> is a system for evaluating where your company stands in the market. It encourages you to look within and at the broader landscape to understand your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.</p>

<p>The strengths and weaknesses columns ask you to consider the realities within your business. It looks at what you do and how you do it. This is where you evaluate factors like your products, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">value proposition</a>, team, and resources.</p>
<p>Opportunities and threats look outside the walls of your company. This is where you think about your customers, competitors, sector or industry, and even the broader world.</p>

<h3>Why undertake a SWOT analysis?</h3>
<p>A SWOT analysis helps you visualize where your business stands. When you know what you’re doing well, where you can improve, and how outside factors are acting on your business, you can identify strategies to move forward.</p>
<p>Understanding how your business is doing is always a smart idea, so periodic SWOT analyses are a great call. And they’re vital if you’re about to approach a new initiative or undergo a significant change. Consider undertaking a SWOT analysis when you are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting your annual business or<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/09/free-and-low-budget-marketing-ideas" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> marketing strategy</a></li>
<li>Making significant leadership or organizational changes</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Launching a new product or service</a></li>
<li>Facing disruption in your industry</li>
<li>Expanding into adjacent markets (either with new products or into new geographies)</li>
</ul>
