										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A visitor lands on one of your landing pages. They scroll through, shrug their shoulders, and click away.</p>
<p>“WHAT!?” you ask yourself. “How could this happen? I’ve spent hours optimizing that page, they read the whole thing, and still&#8230;no conversion.”</p>
<p>Sound familiar? Marketers everywhere work tirelessly to optimize their landing pages, <a href="/blog/ws/2014/03/17/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate">hoping for high conversion rates</a>. They employ <a href="/blog/ws/2014/03/27/ab-tests">A/B tests</a>, switch up button colors, and play with page length. But are they paying enough attention to what’s actually written on the page?</p>
<p>Great landing page copywriting leads to conversions. The words on the screen let you have a conversation with your web visitor. You better be a smooth talker to convince them you’re up to snuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a copywriter, I care about writing <a href="/blog/ws/2016/06/10/high-converting-landing-pages">landing pages that convert</a>. I’m obsessive about figuring out what makes people click. Today, I’m sharing <strong>6 landing page copywriting principles that can be used to increase conversions</strong>.</p>
<h2>1. Say goodbye to landing page copy bloat</h2>
<p>When writing an essay for a college course, students want to make their work as long as possible, desperate to hit a page or word count. But when it comes to effective landing page copywriting, concision is key, because your prospects are busy (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/16/copywriting-formulas">see the 4 C&#8217;s copywriting formula</a>).</p>
<p>Being concise means making your point quickly, without extra words that don’t add anything. Here are some examples that show how being concise can lead to better, clearer messaging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="894980f7-d690-4cc9-98d3-971db8127cbd" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>The most common problems I see that contribute to landing page bloat are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Too many adverbs (obviously, actually, quickly, easily)</li>
<li>Use of the passive voice (<em>Passive: </em>The price of the paper clips has been lowered by 20%. <em>Active: </em>The paper clip price is now 20% lower)</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/572/02/">redundant pairs</a> (Instead of writing “Each and every customer will be happy,” write “Every customer will be happy.”)</li>
<li>Too many determiners and modifiers (Instead of writing “Any way that you approach this will yield results,” write “Any approach will yield results.”</li>
<li>Lack of editing. You should delete all words that give more detail than necessary or explain something that’s obvious.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Don’t be afraid to go long-form</h2>
<p>When it comes to copywriting for landing pages, you don’t want bloated copy. The page should be clear and easy to read, written to someone reading at a 6th grade level. Still, <strong>you need to make sure a customer’s questions are answered</strong>.</p>
<p>Many of the most successful landing pages are lengthy, detailing everything a customer needs to know. Longer landing pages tend to be more comprehensive, which leads to more opportunities for links, and a greater likelihood of ranking in search. Sherice Jacob, in <a href="http://unbounce.com/conversion-rate-optimization/long-vs-short-conversion-marketing/">an article for Unbounce</a>, reported that Conversion Rate Experts increased sales by 52% after implementing a much longer page.</p>
<p>When I worked at Grasshopper, I helped refine our <a href="http://grasshopper.com/800numbers/">800 numbers landing page,</a> which now ranks #1 for the query. The page is 1671 words long, and allows someone to scroll through to find answers to their most pressing questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="cba6203c-d759-4235-9e6f-03ff03ba9e2d" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/example-of-long-form-landing-page-copywriting.png" alt="long form landing page copy" width="432" height="2500" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>WordStream has also found through testing that long landing pages with more information below the fold convert better than short landing pages for some offers, such as the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">AdWords Grader</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-tip:</strong> Your company is unique, so it’s important to test different landing page variants to see what works best for each offer. Try testing a very lengthy page versus a short one.</p>
<h2>3. Provide social proof on your landing page</h2>
<p>Providing proof that customers trust you is essential. If you want landing page visitors to convert, you should include <a href="/blog/ws/2015/05/05/customer-testimonials">customer testimonials</a> in your landing page copy.</p>
<p>Think of your landing page like a home. When you have a guest come over, you want them to feel welcome. A landing page functions the same way. When a customer comes to your landing page, you want to usher them in and make them trust you. You want to show that you know what you’re doing, and that customers are successful because of you.</p>
<p><a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/">QuickBooks</a> does an excellent job of sharing customer stories on their small business accounting landing page. Rather than including written testimonials from customers, they show videos of three customers explaining what they get out using the software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="77f93093-eaa9-44c1-b0ac-3ec413d20450" data-langcode="en">

</div>
<h2>4. Perfect your unique selling proposition</h2>
<p>Customers buy your product for a reason, and not because they’re in love with your brand and want to support you. <strong>They buy products that can enhance their everyday life</strong>.</p>
<p>You need to position your customer as the hero of your landing page, and show what they’ll get out of choosing you over the competition. How to do this? Refine your <a href="/blog/ws/2014/04/07/unique-selling-proposition">unique value proposition.</a></p>
<p>Your value proposition is a phrase or short sentence that’s often used as a headline or sub-header on a landing page. Usually, a value proposition explains what makes your business different from everyone else in your market.</p>
<p>When you’re writing one, you have to explain how your business solves your ideal customer’s problem. The best place to start is by looking at the websites of other brand’s, especially those you like. Here are a few <a href="/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">examples of compelling value propositions</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://campaignmonitor.com/"><strong>Campaign Monitor </strong></a>&#8212; Campaign Monitor makes it radically easy to create, send and measure the impact of your email marketing campaigns.</li>
<li><a href="/"><strong>WordStream </strong></a>&#8212; Online Advertising Made Easy.</li>

</article>
</div>
<h2>5. Use the same words as your customers</h2>
<p>One of the biggest problems in marketing today is that we tend to write for our cronies, not for our customers. We’re happy to drop terms like inbound marketing and KPIs, without considering if our audience knows what we mean. Behind our computer screens, it’s easy to forget what our customers are actually like.</p>
<p>When writing landing pages, ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s driving my reader to explore this product?</li>
<li>What are their hopes and dreams?</li>
<li>Why do they do the job that they do?</li>
<li>Will they have to convince their boss of the value?</li>
<li>What are their biggest questions going to be?</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to writing copy for landing pages, you have to talk directly to your customers, and use words that will resonate with them. Imagine as though you’re writing to one ideal customer, not to a sea of potential people. This will allow you to be more specific, more targeted, and ultimately more successful.</p>
<p>Often, the best copy comes directly from the mouth of a customer who is able to articulate exactly how the product benefits them. Aside from surveys and interviews, you can find examples of words your ideal customers would use on online forums, review sites, blog comments, and social media.call</p>

</div>
<h2>6. A/B test your copy</h2>
<p>Writing is a creative process, but it’s impossible to know what will lead to the highest conversion rate for your particular landing pages. That’s why it’s essential to A/B test your copy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="26c53068-47e2-47c3-afdb-a861f41dfb71" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>Every business is different, so while you can start with best practices, there aren’t hard and fast rules on what will work. It’s more important to test out different variants, especially when it comes to headlines, length of the landing page, and color schemes, to see how it affects conversions.</p>
<p>Brad Shorr, Director of Content &amp; Social Media for Straight North, has found that <a href="/blog/ws/2012/09/25/a-b-testing">small changes in wording</a> can dramatically increase conversions.</p>
<p>Brad A/B tested these <a href="/blog/ws/2014/10/20/call-to-action-examples">calls to action</a>:</p>
<p>A. Get $10 off the first purchase. Book online now!</p>
<p>B. Get an additional $10 off. Book online now.</p>
<p>He was surprised to find that the <strong>CTR <em>doubled</em> with option B</strong>.</p>

<h2>Good copywriting conquers all</h2>
<p>There’s a lot of so-so writing on the internet, but there’s also a lot of compelling, <a href="/blog/ws/2015/04/08/persuasive-landing-pages">persuasive writing</a> that makes you want to act. If you’re writing copy for a landing page, the most important principle is to be concise and clear.</p>
<p>If a customer can quickly understand what you’re offering, they’ll be able to assess whether it’s right for them. Ultimately, good copy can help you convert more qualified prospects who can become customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m constantly on Facebook, scrolling through my feed reading the news and looking at pics of cute Pomeranians. I’m not alone—the social media platform averages <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">2.91 billion monthly active users</a>. It&#8217;s also the top channel used by marketers worldwide.<br />
<img decoding="async" style="text-align: center;" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/most-popular-social-media-platforms-marketers-2022.png" alt="most popular social media platforms in 2022 for marketing" width="720" height="518" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63015" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/most-popular-social-media-platforms-marketers-2022.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/most-popular-social-media-platforms-marketers-2022-480x345.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /><br />
All these users spell out huge potential for marketers, and Facebook has emerged as one of the best advertising platforms for both B2B and B2C businesses. In the past few years, <a href="/blog/ws/2016/06/21/facebook-ad-tool">as organic reach on Facebook has declined</a>, savvy marketers have been <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/03/how-to-advertise-on-facebook">advertising on Facebook</a> to get results.</p>
<p>There’s a lot that has to come together to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/13/facebook-advertising-tips">make a Facebook ad successful</a>—you need the right targeting, a great image or video, and compelling copy. <strong>Today, I’m focusing on why writing matters in Facebook ads, as well as some strategies on how you can write great Facebook ads that actually convert.</strong></p>
<h2>Why Facebook Advertising Works So Well</h2>
<p>There are tons of users on Facebook, but sending an ad out into the void doesn’t result in tons of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/22/facebook-sales-funnel">conversions</a>. The key to <a href="/facebook-advertising">Facebook’s advertising</a> is targeting. <strong>Facebook has the best ad targeting of any site. </strong></p>
<p>This targeting allows you to get <a href="/blog/ws/2015/10/20/facebook-audience">super specific about what audience your ad reaches</a>. If you sell garden hoses, you can reach people who are interested in vegetable gardens and home improvement. If you sell a <a href="/blog/ws/2016/06/15/adwords-for-saas-startups">software-as-a-service (SaaS) tool</a>, you can target those who’ve visited a landing page on your website.</p>
<p>Here are some of the ways you can target your ads on Facebook:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Custom audiences</strong> – allows you to target existing customers or leads</li>
<li><strong>Location</strong> – allows you to target by location (city, state, country)</li>
<li><strong>Gender </strong>– allows you to target by gender (male or female)</li>
<li><strong>Interests </strong>– allows you to target by interest (such as fitness, entrepreneurship, fashion, literature)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Behaviors </strong>– allows you to target by past behavior, such as someone visiting your website</li>
<li><strong>Connections –</strong> allows you to target by people who already like your page, or who have connections that do</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>All of Facebook&#8217;s Ad Targeting Options [Infographic via WordStream]</em></p>
<h2>The Two Types of Facebook Ads</h2>
<p>There are two <a href="/blog/ws/2016/07/13/facebook-ad-types-cheatsheet">types of Facebook ads</a> that marketers can use:</p>
<p><strong>1. Sponsored Posts</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/15/facebook-sponsored-posts">Facebook Sponsored</a> posts appear directly in the Facebook Newsfeed. Users see the ads as they are scrolling, and the feature as prominently as posts from close friends. Here’s an example of a Sponsored post from <a href="https://www.farmhill.com/">Farm Hill:</a></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-facebook-ads-sponsored-post-example.png" alt="best sponsored facebook ads" width="496" height="472" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>Facebook Sponsored Post from Farm Hill</em></p>
<p><strong>2. The Right-Hand Column Ad</strong></p>
<p>The right-hand column ad appears—you guessed it!—in the right column of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/15/facebook-dynamic-creative">Facebook</a> feed. These ads are smaller, but they can’t be scrolled past like sponsored posts in the News Feed. Marketers often use right-hand column ads for retargeting purposes. Here’s an example of a right-hand column ad from West Elm:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-facebook-ads-west-elm-example1.png" alt="effective facebook ads" width="305" height="260" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>West Elm right-hand column ad</em></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Sponsored posts include a fair amount of copy, so I’ll be focusing on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/15/copywriting-tips">copywriting tips</a> for these posts, although the tips can be applied to right-hand column ads as well.</p>

<h2>But Does Copywriting for Facebook Ads Really Matter?</h2>
<p><strong>Yes!</strong> When you envision a Facebook ad, you might think of a large image. Images are important in <a href="https://localiq.com/products/social-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Ads</a>, but copywriting is also essential.</p>
<p>If you’re <a href="/blog/ws/2015/09/14/facebook-advertising-cost">spending money on a Facebook ad</a>, you want to make sure it does its job.

<p>So here&#8217;s how to do it: Use these principles to write the <a href="/blog/ws/2017/06/06/best-ads">best ads</a> you can.</p>
<h2>9 Strategies for Writing Your Best Facebook Ads</h2>
<p>Here are our tips for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/26/how-to-optimize-facebook-ads">optimizing your Facebook ads</a> with great copy.</p>
<h3>1. Use Facebook Targeting to Narrow Your Audience, then Write to It</h3>
<p>When it comes to selling online, it’s tempting to write like you’re on stage at a conference. But if you want to be effective, you must write as though you’re writing to one person—and one person alone.</p>
<p>This person, your target, is the one you need to woo and persuade. Just as though you were an in-person salesperson, you need to focus all your attention on this person and their needs.</p>
<p>On your website, you have to write copy that speaks to all potential customers, and you probably have a few different personas. On Facebook, however, you can narrowly target your audience. What does it look like to implement this <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/10/facebook-advertising-tips-for-small-business">Facebook Ad tip</a>? Here&#8217;s an example. You can target your ads to <strong>women</strong> who are <strong>over 30 </strong>that <strong>live in the U.S.</strong> and are <strong>interested in fitness and wellness. </strong>Then you can write targeted ads that speak to that very specific audience.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/facebook-ad-targeting-for-best-facebook-ads.png" alt="facebook ad targeting help" width="550" height="300" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>Facebook Audience Definition</em></p>
<h3>2. Write Different Facebook Ads for Different People</h3>
<p>This goes along with the idea of targeting. Your customers turn to you for a variety of reasons, so why would you use one blanket ad? Facebook’s strength is its ability to target, so don’t treat your ad like a billboard.</p>
<p>For example, imagine you’re a clothing retailer. You sell men’s and women’s apparel, as well as shoes, accessories, activewear, underwear, and even bath and body products. Many customers will be interested in some of what you have to offer, but many will be most interested in one area. Simply put, women will be interested in what you have for women.</p>
<p>I love this video ad from Old Navy promoting its activewear. The ad is targeted to those who’ve listed fitness as an interest. In this way, Old Navy reaches the right audience with its ad.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/old-navy-best-facebook-ad-example.png" alt="the best facebook ads guide" width="487" height="456" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>Old Navy&#8217;s &#8220;Get moving in style&#8221; Facebook video ad</em></p>
<h3>3. Ensure Your Facebook Ad Copy Goes with Your Visual</h3>
<p>Many smaller businesses—and even larger ones, especially in the B2B space—don’t have a ton of visuals on hand. When it comes time to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-run-facebook-ads/">run a Facebook ad</a>, there’s a scramble to make sure an image gets attached.</p>
<p>This can result in an image that doesn’t go together with the copy, which presents a jarring experience for a Facebook user. If the copy and the image don’t line up, they’ll wonder what the ad is actually advertising. They’ll be unlikely to click, and your ad will be wasted.</p>
<p>Starbucks stitched together three images to create a great visual for its “World’s Largest #StarbucksDate” campaign. The copy mentions “french press caffe Verona &amp; a chocolate brownie,” which are then visualized in the photos. In this way, Starbucks reminds its audience what they’ll get by coming into the coffee shop, resulting in an effective Facebook ad.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-facebook-ad-images.png" alt="facebook image ads" width="445" height="441" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>Starbucks&#8217; &#8220;#StarbucksDate&#8221; Facebook ad campaign</em></p>
<p>If you’re struggling to create images for Facebook ads, you can use image tools like <a href="https://www.bannersnack.com/">Bannersnack</a>, <a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a>, <a href="https://www.picmonkey.com/">PicMonkey</a>, and <a href="https://pablo.buffer.com/">Pablo by Buffer</a> to create your own.</p>
<h3>4. Stay Focused with One Call to Action</h3>
<p>The best Facebook ads have a clear goal. Are you trying to increase brand awareness, get a lead, or sell a product? No matter what, your ad should have a <a href="/blog/ws/2016/03/07/call-to-action-marketing">clear call-to-action</a>. Without it, Facebook users will see your ad, but they’ll have no idea where to click, or what to do.</p>
<p>Society6 sells iPhone cases, and they show off their products in their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/27/facebook-ads-for-entrepreneurs">Facebook ads</a>. But the ad is a lot more than an image of a lovely iPhone case—it has a <a href="/blog/ws/2015/02/20/call-to-action-buttons">call-to-action button</a> (“Shop Now”) encouraging users to come to the Society6 website to browse, shop, and ultimately buy.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-facebook-ad-calls-to-action.png" alt="best facebook cta's" width="498" height="478" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>Society6 Facebook ad, with one call to action </em></p>
<p>Speaking of calls to action, did you know that &#8220;Call now&#8221; is also an option? <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/17/facebook-click-to-call-ads">Learn more about click-to-call ads on Facebook here</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Keep it Short and Lead with Value</h3>
<p>You’re paying for an ad, so it can be tempting to cram in as much as possible. You have to explain your product to people, after all. However, to really <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/21/how-to-compete-in-facebook-ads">compete in Facebook ads</a>, you need to keep it short, and lead with value.</p>
<p>What does someone get out of using your product? How will it help them? These are the areas you should focus on in your copy, and you should get these points across in a clear, concise manner.</p>
<p>For example, TaskRabbit helps people hire others to complete personal tasks, but the value is that users can get everything done when they’re busy and overwhelmed. In the following ad, TaskRabbit shares its value with the copy: “Getting everything done is easier than you think,” “Hire a tasker instead,” and “We’ve got chores covered.” Just three sentences completely explain the value of the service.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-facebook-ads-lead-with-value1.png" alt="facebook advertising examples" width="490" height="435" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>TaskRabbit&#8217;s &#8220;Hire a Tasker&#8221; Facebook ad, with lead value</em></p>
<h3>6. Use Simple Language that’s Easy to Understand</h3>
<p>Copywriting is not high literature. Maybe you were a poet in college, but flowery language will muddle your message. It’s time to cut the verbosity.</p>
<p>Your number one priority should be <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/06/10/facebook-post-engagement">writing a Facebook ad</a> that’s easy to understand—for anyone, even a 5th grader. When someone sees your ad, they should immediately know:</p>
<ul>
<li>What you’re offering</li>
<li><a href="/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples">How it benefits them</a></li>
<li>What to do next</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s why I love this sponsored post from SoFi, which helps people refinance their student loans. The copy in this Facebook ad is refreshingly simple: <strong>Pay off loans faster. </strong>SoFi explains what it offers (refinancing of loans), the benefits (paying off loans faster), and what to do next (apply now).</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-facebook-ads-simple-language.png" alt="best facebook ads tips" width="492" height="479" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>SoFi&#8217;s &#8220;Pay off loans faster&#8221; Facebook ad, with simple language</em></p>
<h3>7. Be Upfront About the Numbers</h3>
<p>If you’re selling a physical product, people want to know how much it costs. If you’re running a sale, people want to know what percentage they’re going to get off. A copywriting strategy that works? Lead with the numbers.</p>
<p>For example, Ball Honda, a car dealership in San Diego, sponsors <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/08/01/facebook-stories-ads">Facebook ads</a> that drive home the nuts and bolts of how much it costs to get a car. They share the deal people can get if they lease a CRV, and give a date for when the promotion ends. They don’t show the ad to everyone in San Diego—they target those who have come to their website already.</p>
<p>The ad isn’t particularly sexy, but it’s helpful, and it effectively reminds people to come to their dealership when they’re ready to buy a car.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-facebook-ads-use-numbers.png" alt="great facebook ad copywriting" width="493" height="478" /></div>
<p class="text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em>Ball Honda Facebook ad, with upfront numbers</em></p>
<h3>8. Get Some Perspective</h3>
<p>You’re working to market your brand every day, so it can be tough to step back and make sure the copy for your<a href="/blog/ws/2017/09/26/how-to-create-facebook-ads"> Facebook ad</a> resonates. Scroll through your own Facebook feed and take a look at the ads. Which ones make you want to click? Which ones do you simply scroll past?</p>
<p>It’s a good idea to get some perspective from someone besides yourself. You can hire a freelance writer or editor to write the ad for you, or help you brainstorm. You can also bounce the ad off a few coworkers, especially ones outside the marketing department, to see if they think it’s effective. Friends and family—people outside the business—can help as well.</p>
<h3>9. Test your Ad Copy</h3>
<p>The only way you can <a href="/blog/ws/2016/10/27/facebook-ad-copy-tests">improve your Facebook ad copy</a> is if you run tests. Facebook makes it easy to spend a small amount of money to try things out. In the end, the only way you can ensure your copywriting works is through experience.</p>
<p>Try running two different ads—each with the same image, but different copy—to see which resonates most with your audience. Which version gets the most likes, comments, and conversions?</p>
<p>For example,<a href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/split-test-facebook-page-posts-ads/"> Post Planner posted the same ad,</a> but changed up the copy. In one ad, they asked a question. In the second ad, they made a statement. It’s a subtle copy change, but it can spell out big changes in results.</p>
