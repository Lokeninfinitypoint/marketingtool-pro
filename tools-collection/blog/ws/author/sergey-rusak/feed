										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Running a successful business inevitably brings negative online reviews. No matter how amazing your products or services, how well-trained your employees, or how excellent your customer service, there will always be situations when someone is dissatisfied with their interaction with your business or finds that your product or service doesn&#8217;t meet their needs and expectations.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean you have zero control over the situation! So how can you manage your online reviews to limit the negative impact on your business? In this article, we’ll discuss and analyze how online reviews can affect your click-through rates (CTR) and other key metrics, plus how they influence prospects and customers in sometimes surprising ways.</p>

<h2>9 reasons why reviews impact revenue, sales, and business reputation</h2>
<p>Online reviews can impact your business&#8217;s online reputation, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-referral-traffic">traffic</a>, and sales. Here are a few ways that happens.</p>
<div id="reviews-appear-in-search-results"></div>
<h3>1. Reviews and star ratings appear in search results and maps&#8230;</h3>
<p>When people search for businesses, products, or services on search engines or map pages, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/local-citations">review sites</a> not only appear in search results but also as featured snippets where review counts and star ratings are visible and highlighted even before users click on the result.</p>
<p>Google displays reviews and star ratings in both search results and local pack results for businesses listed on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/10/create-google-my-business-account">Google Business Profile</a> (formerly Google My Business) or Google Maps.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-business-listings-for-roofer.webp" alt="google business listings for roofers" width="858" height="414" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84526" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-business-listings-for-roofer.webp 858w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/google-business-listings-for-roofer-480x232.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 858px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Additionally, Google includes a &#8220;Reviews from the web&#8221; section in various business results and key phrases, aggregating reviews from relevant networks. In regular search results, when displaying a business profile from a review network, star ratings, and review counts are also presented.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/reviews-from-the-web-on-google.webp" alt="reviews from the web on google" width="742" height="593" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86598" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/reviews-from-the-web-on-google.webp 742w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/reviews-from-the-web-on-google-480x384.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 742px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>On Bing local and maps results, review information and star ratings may be sourced directly from partner networks such as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-reviews">Facebook</a>, OpenTable, TripAdvisor, or others depending on the search query.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/what-is-duckduckgo">DuckDuckGo</a>, a private search engine, exclusively partners with Yelp to display business results, including reviews, for users.</p>

<div id="reviews-appear-across-the-web"></div>
<h3>2. &#8230;And almost everywhere else on the web</h3>
<p>Multiple websites collect online reviews, each serving different purposes and attracting distinct types of audiences and review readers. For instance, individuals planning a vacation often visit travel-specific sites to see experiences and photos shared by previous travelers. On the other hand, job seekers read reviews on job sites posted by current and former employees.</p>
<p>Here are some of the different types of review websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business directories,</strong> such as Google Business Profile (Google Maps), Trustpilot, and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-claim-a-business-on-yelp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yelp</a>, list businesses and allow customers to rate them and leave reviews. Find out the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/01/business-directory-listings">top business listing sites</a> here.</li>
<li><strong>Retail websites </strong>like Amazon, eBay, Walmart, and other ecommerce sites allow customers to review products they purchased and share their interactions with businesses.</li>
<li><strong>Travel review and booking networks</strong> like TripAdvisor, Expedia, Booking.com, Airbnb, and others enable travelers to review hotels, hosts, restaurants, and other travel-related services.</li>
<li><strong>Job networks and review sites,</strong> such as Glassdoor or Indeed, enable current and former employees, as well as job applicants, to review their employers, salaries, and benefits, share insights into the interview process, and office culture, and discuss their overall experiences.</li>
<li><strong>Social media networks</strong> like Facebook allow users to leave feedback, comments, and reviews on business pages.</li>
<li><strong>Online complaint sites</strong> like RipOff Report or Better Business Bureau (BBB) provide platforms for customers to express dissatisfaction with products or services they have purchased.</li>
<li><strong>Niche review websites</strong> like Capterra or G2 cater specifically to software buyers, and platforms such as <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/angi-business-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angi</a> and DealerRater focus on local services and the car buying experience, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/angi-reviews.webp" alt="example of reviews on angi" width="850" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86599" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/angi-reviews.webp 850w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/angi-reviews-480x338.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 850px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="positive-reviews-drive-clicks"></div>
<h3>3. Positive reviews are engaging and drive clicks</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/research/review-search-click-through-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research from BrightLocal</a> shows that businesses with positive 3 to 5-star reviews receive 25% more clicks from local pack results. Additionally, 82% of consumers read online reviews before making a purchase, spending an average of 14 minutes on review sites before making a decision. Positive reviews can also <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/03/organic-traffic">improve traffic to your site</a> and boost revenue.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Looking for more ways to drive people to your site?</strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website</a></p>
<div id="negative-reviews-can-decrease-traffic"></div>
<h3>4. Negative reviews can lead to a decline in traffic</h3>
<p>At the same time, negative reviews can be highly damaging. For example, a well-publicized<a href="https://www.landers.com.au/legal-insights-news/defamatory-google-reviews-plastic-surgeon-awarded-damages-for-untrue-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> lawsuit in Australia revealed</a> that a plastic surgeon experienced a 23% drop in online traffic after a fake, damaging review was posted on Google Maps.</p>
<div id="unhappy-customers-more-likely-to-review"></div>
<h3>5. Unhappy customers are more likely to leave reviews</h3>
<p>According to findings from Inc.com, when customers are unhappy, there&#8217;s a 91% chance they won&#8217;t do any business with that company again. Moreover, they are 10 to 15 times more likely to share their negative experience with others, often by posting bad reviews on online platforms about the product or service quality.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-review-example.webp" alt="example of review from competitor" width="878" height="497" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83701" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-review-example.webp 878w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/competitive-insights-review-example-480x272.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 878px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>At the same time, only 1 out of 10 happy customers typically <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">leave a positive review</a>, indicating that many people may not remember positive experiences that long because when they are buying, they expect good service from businesses. Negative experiences tend to be more impactful and remembered longer.</p>
<div id="positive-reviews-help-zero-click-searches"></div>
<h3>6. Positive reviews can help with zero-click searches</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/zero-click-searches">Zero-click search</a> is when users search for something on a search engine like Google but do not click any links in the results. <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-search-zero-click-study-2024-443869" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nearly 60%</a> of searches result in no clicks. There are several reasons behind this phenomenon, such as people using search engines for spell checking or relying on widgets and highlighted information to quickly find answers to basic questions like &#8220;How old is Brad Pitt?&#8221; or &#8220;What day of the week is Christmas this year?&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/example-of-zero-click-search-result.webp" alt="example of zero-click search result" width="886" height="587" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86600" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/example-of-zero-click-search-result.webp 886w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/example-of-zero-click-search-result-480x318.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 886px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Similarly, in business-related, local, product, and service searches, many users conduct research on companies and look for things like phone numbers, addresses, or feedback.</p>
<p>It results in zero-click when they look up business information including star ratings and reviews directly in the search snippets. That’s why the appearance of positive reviews can be as important as the company’s website itself in the decision-making process.</p>
<div id="better-reviews-correlate-better-results"></div>
<h3>7. Better online reviews have a direct correlation with higher CTRs, traffic, and sales</h3>
<p>Positive online reviews and good star ratings can drive increased traffic and sales to a website in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Firstly, higher star ratings in search engine snippets enhance the chances of users clicking through to gather more information and conduct further research on the product or service, possibly leading to a purchase. At the same time, negative star ratings can deter users from clicking on a company website, and as proof, research by BrightLocal shows that a <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/research/review-search-click-through-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25%</a> improvement in <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-a-good-click-through-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click-through rates</a> can be achieved with favorable reviews on Google results. As mentioned earlier, bad reviews can significantly impact <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-a-good-click-through-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click-through rate</a>, just like with the plastic surgeon who saw a 23% drop in online traffic after a single bad review that appeared on top of Google results.</li>
<li>Secondly, reviews <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/limited-time-offers/">influence traffic</a> and sales by influencing Google&#8217;s prioritization of businesses with better local presence and positive reviews in Google Maps. Based on<a href="https://firstpagesage.com/reports/google-click-through-rates-ctrs-by-ranking-position/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> findings by FirstPageSage</a>, achieving the top position in Google&#8217;s Local Pack results can lead to a 17% CTR.</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-customer-reviews.jpg" alt="increase conversion rates - example of customer reviews on product landing page to help drive conversion rates up" width="700" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75898" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-customer-reviews.jpg 700w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/increase-conversion-rates-customer-reviews-480x410.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You&#8217;re probably going to click on results for a business with reviews like this over one with a lower star rating or no reviews.</em></p>
<div id="fake-reviews-impact-traffic-reputation"></div>
<h3>8. Fake reviews can impact online traffic and reputation</h3>
<p>Another unfortunate thing that can impact online reputation and sales is fake reviews. Fake negative reviews present a big challenge for businesses and are enabled by the anonymity of online platforms. It is estimated that <a href="https://retaintrust.com/fake-reviews-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 23%</a> of online reviews are fake, and &#8220;bad actors&#8221; like competitors, scammers, or disgruntled employees can post false or defamatory information about a business.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/brand-loyalty-wordstream-Review.webp" alt="Brand loyalty - Review on Google." width="833" height="359" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86146" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/brand-loyalty-wordstream-Review.webp 833w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/brand-loyalty-wordstream-Review-480x207.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 833px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This not only leads to decreased star ratings but can also cause a significant drop in traffic, directly impacting sales. Addressing this issue can be expensive, requiring businesses to allocate resources towards damage control, increase marketing efforts to recover lost revenue, and in some cases seek legal advice.</p>
<div id="leverage-positive-reviews-in-ppc"></div>
<h3>9. Positive reviews can enhance PPC and social campaigns</h3>
<p>One effective strategy for promoting positive reviews and ratings to improve CTR for your ads is to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/18/google-shopping-reviews">integrate them into your PPC campaigns</a>. For example, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/21/how-to-run-google-ads">Google Ads</a> allows you to add positive reviews as ad copy extensions. Google collaborates with<a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2375474?hl=en#Supported_review_partners" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> supported review partners</a> to integrate and highlight these reviews under advertisers&#8217; search or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/07/20/google-shopping-ab-testing">shopping ads</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/reviews-in-ppc-campaigns.webp" alt="reviews in ppc campaigns example" width="880" height="543" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86601" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/reviews-in-ppc-campaigns.webp 880w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/reviews-in-ppc-campaigns-480x296.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 880px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Star ratings from the stores are integrated and appear in the shopping ads.</em></p>
<p>Additionally, you can share positive reviews on social media platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, X, and others. Promoting these reviews through sponsored campaigns targeted at your desired audience can further enhance your brand&#8217;s reputation and reach.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4b0.png" alt="💰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Worried you&#8217;re wasting spend in Google Ads?</strong> Find out with a free, instant audit &gt;&gt; <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Google Ads Performance Grader</a></p>
<h2>Positive online reviews are a must</h2>
<p>Given the direct correlation between positive online reviews, click-through rates, and their impact on sales, businesses should prioritize monitoring and managing their <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/online-presence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online presence</a>. This includes actively monitoring reviews and ratings,<a href="https://retaintrust.com/how-to-remove-negative-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> flagging and reporting fake or rule-violating reviews</a>, and replying promptly to reviews to show customer service and commitment to future customers.</p>
<p>While some businesses are proactive in managing their online reputation, others may lack the knowledge and resources, especially when dealing with multiple review sites each with its own methods for<a href="https://localiq.com/products/listings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> managing business profiles</a>, flagging, reporting, replying, and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-delete-a-google-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removing reviews</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Many B2B and SaaS companies use acount-based marketing, or ABM, as their strategy for winning enterprise-level clients. Not a lot of these marketers use Google Ads in their ABM strategies—and that's a huge missed opportunity. Here's how you can use Google Ads for better account-based marketing.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/30/account-based-marketing-and-google-ads">How to Use Google Ads for Account-Based Marketing</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN">Over the last few years, account-based marketing (ABM) has become a big buzzword in the digital marketing industry. A lot of B2B and SaaS companies—especially those going after the large and enterprise-level accounts—invest heavily in ABM platforms that allow them to target potential prospects with custom messages and content through various marketing channels. </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/account-based-marketing-and-google-ads.jpg" alt="account-based marketing image" width="706" height="517" /></div>
<p><span lang="EN">However, some marketers don’t consider making Google advertising a part of their ABM mix. How so? With account-based marketing, advertisers want to serve unique ads and messages to specific companies or decision-makers. With Google Ads, you can’t control who searches and clicks the links or follows the banners. Even with Google’s various audience-based and geographic targeting options, it is still impossible to narrow down the targeting to very specific Google users. Therefore, ad networks such as LinkedIn, Facebook, programmatic networks, or demand-side platforms (DSPs) look more appealing for ABM strategy because they can target and deliver ads to specific people or by industry, company, and job title. </span></p>
<p>The truth is, <strong>not including Google Ads in your account-based marketing strategy is a huge missed opportunity</strong>.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">Account-based marketing is a complex marketing operation that requires you to choose the target accounts, use predictive analytics, select paid advertising platforms, serve highly customized ads linked to personalized content, and track the activities in the lead/sale funnels. Buying an ABM platform or building an <a href="https://retaintrust.com/account-based-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ABM strategy in-house</a> is a big investment. Without web traffic, your ABM strategy is like a luxury car with no gas. That’s where Google Ads come in. Google advertising—with its options including search, display, video, and remarketing ads—can be the top source to drive traffic to your site and get your ABM process brewing. </span></p>
<h2>Fueling an ABM strategy with Google search</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">When you’re going after large organizations and specifically trying to influence the decision-makers and end-users for your products and services, it can be really tricky, since there are often hundreds and even thousands of people with similar job titles in each company. Many of those people will end up on your site after performing a Google search. A click and visit to your site from a Google search ad can reveal a lot of information about the visitor, including what they originally searched for. Based on this intelligence, ABM platforms can move the account down the funnel, adjust the future strategy, and signal sales and marketing teams to make appropriate actions. </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/account-based-marketing-and-google-ads-SERP.jpg" alt="SERP example" width="761" height="600" /></div>
<p>How using Google search traffic for ABM helps move the needle</p>
<p><span lang="EN">As mentioned, web traffic is the fuel that keeps your account-based marketing engine running. Most ABM platforms have the ability to track commercial IPs and give information about what companies come to your site and how they interact with your content. For those who can’t afford the pricey ABM platforms and build one in-house, there are standalone reverse-IP tracking tools like <a href="https://www.leadforensics.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LeadForensics</a> and <a href="https://uplandsoftware.com/leadlander/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LeadLander</a>. Once a company on your target list clicks a Google search ad, you can see the query, pages visited, content interactions, conversions, and the location of the office/branch. As a marketer, you can then move to the next step of lead nurturing. This also generates sales enablement for successful closure. </span></p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em><span lang="EN">LeadForensics is tracking the source of each visitor that comes from the same organization.</span></em></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Here are a few examples of how different PPC campaign options can generate various click types for your ABM strategy:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">The click came from a general keyword: </span></strong>When someone from a company you’re targeting comes to your site after searching for a general keyword, for instance &#8220;PPC management software,&#8221; it means that they are &#8220;in-market&#8221;; they are researching the product and perhaps looking at different vendors. Your ABM strategy can help to influence those accounts, educate them more about your offerings, and craft the strategy to move them down the funnel.</li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">The search query contains giveaway words like companies, best, affordable, what is, scam, advise, or review: </span></strong><span lang="EN">Based on the giveaway words in the query, your ABM campaign can be adjusted to address those questions or concerns. The sales team can follow up and build the talk-track for closure.</span></li>
<li><strong><span lang="EN">The click came from your branded or competitor terms: </span></strong><span lang="EN">Branded terms in the query mean that the potential customer is in the buying cycle and researching different vendors. You can act accordingly to keep momentum if your brand name was searched or, if it wasn’t your company’s name, build the strategy to win over the competitor. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2>3 more ways to use Google Ads with your ABM strategy</h2>
<p>Google search is a powerful tool for your ABM strategy, but it’s not the only way use your PPC advertising to boost your account-based marketing strategy. Here are three more ways to use Google Ads in your ABM strategy.</p>
<h3>1. Adjust your Google Display &amp; YouTube ads with an ABM</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Just like Google Search, banner and video ads can generate traffic that comes from the companies on your ABM list. I highly recommend vertical banner campaigns that help to narrow down the ad appearance in front of professionals who work in a specific industry. </span></p>

</div>
</article>
</div>
<h3>2. Remarket on Google for ABM</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Remarketing is Google’s best offering that can stay in line with account-based marketing in general. People who already visited a site are being served with personalized ads and can then interact with specific content you’re choosing. </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/account-based-marketing-and-google-ads-remarketing.jpg" alt="remarking display ad example" width="829" height="328" /></div>
<p><span lang="EN">In order for Google to serve your remarketing ads, the remarketing list must have at least 100 people who visited your site within a 30-day period. It can be enough to target each company on your ABM list individually if you are going after the largest enterprise-level accounts. </span></p>
<h3>3. Discover new targets for account-based marketing with Google Ads</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">The ABM software and reverse IP-tracking tools have the ability to “unmask” the companies that are visiting your site. By using those tools, you can find a lot of organization that came from Google Ads but not on your ABM account list. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">For example, if you are trying to sell to the food and beverage industry, you might set up an ABM campaign choosing the biggest names like Kroger or Trader Joes. But along the way, while researching who clicked your Google ads, you might discover a massive company that invests zero in branding and runs small convenience stores all across the country.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/account-based-marketing-and-google-ads-convenience-store.jpg" alt="convenience store image" width="840" height="561" /></div>
<h2>ABM and PPC are both better together</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Lastly, ABM platforms can help to optimize your Google campaigns, as well. Instead of looking on conversions or Google Analytics, your account-based marketing can reveal what is really working to engage, educate, influence, and sell. Perhaps you want to pause a campaign that hasn&#8217;t created a single conversion? Before you do that, check with your ABM software first—if that PPC campaign was the first touch point of your biggest deal, you might want to reconsider. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Many B2B companies noticed a big performance dip in their AdWords accounts this February. Here's why you saw fewer leads from PPC last month.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/03/03/february-ppc-performance-dip">Why Was February Such a Hard Month for B2B Businesses?</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever wondered why your well-managed account can suddenly have a bad week or even a bad month for no apparent reason?</p>
<p>You check all the <a href="/marketing-performance-metrics">metrics</a> to discover that it’s not just a drop in one place that needs to be fixed, but the entire account has a small decrease in each campaign and ad group. Well, <strong>this February was one of those slow months for many B2B clients who target the United States</strong>. Those people who live in Florida or California might wonder what happened in February.</p>
<p>If you are in a B2B industry, you rely on people who work in the office Monday through Friday, from 9 to 5. But what if the month gives you less business days? What if more people stay at home or got to the office late due to the weather?</p>
<p>February was a great example of the “perfect storm,” which affected many B2B companies, and this could be seen in their <a href="/blog/ws/2014/02/06/adwords-metrics">PPC account metrics</a>.</p>
<h2>Calendar Calamities</h2>
<p>February is a unique month because it has just 28 days, but this year, in 2015, it was even more unique because the month started on a weekend and ended on a weekend. So, we had less than three full working weeks, plus the President’s Day and Martin Luther King Day holidays resulted in February only having 18 business days. That led to fewer opportunities to generate and convert leads.</p>
<p>Here is a graph that compares January and February for one of our B2B clients. It’s easy to see how many more business days January (blue line) had compared to February:</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="302888b2-764b-4521-8f5d-eb535a5bcfac" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<h2>Weather Woes</h2>
<p>Those lucky folks who live in warmer states may not realize that, in the first couple of weeks of February, more than 20 states were affected by record-breaking snow storms.</p>
<p>The entire Northeastern region was paralyzed by the weather. The Northeast has a population of more than 50 million, who share one of the highest GDP per capita in the country, many of whom ended up sitting at home or shoveling our their cars.</p>
<p>Even Alabama, Tennessee, South Carolina, and Georgia got between 5-7 inches of snow, and it was a big deal for them. In addition, the weather created a ripple effect to employees who weren’t affected, because some of them work for or with the decision makers in New York, Washington D.C., or Boston.</p>
<p>Here is the data for our B2B clients showing the difference in conversions for February 2015 (100 inches of snow in some areas) and 2014 (no major snow storms).</p>
<h3>Biggest losers:</h3>

</article>
</div>
<p>My advice? Relax and stay warm, because most of the conversions will come back to fill this gap in demand. I personally manage several B2B accounts, and most of my clients had much better weeks as the frozen states began to thaw. I highly recommend to check your geographic performance.</p>
<h3>How to See a Geographic Report in AdWords by State</h3>
<p>To view Geographic reports by state in AdWords, go to All Campaigns &gt; Dimensions &gt; View: Geographic (in the drop down).</p>
<p>At first, you’ll see a report that contains a lot of data with different small locations. Click the drop down Columns &gt; Customize Columns. Then, remove all the geographic columns except the region. The region column splits your data by state.</p>

</div>
<p>To compare the data with the previous month or last year, click the date range and activate the “Compare” option:</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Take a look at your text ads and tell me if they are designed to sell. Do you have a well-written ad description, a strong offer and a compelling call to action? Many PPC managers create their text ads to match the title with the query and bring people to the right landing page. And that’s a great starting point, but is it enough?</p>
<p>In many instances when we look at ads, we see the same generic or simple text written in the ad descriptions. Over the last few years we’ve changed the ad descriptions for hundreds of ads and we’ve seen a <a href="/blog/ws/2014/02/11/average-click-through-rate">dramatic improvement in click-through rates</a>, even when the ads were at the bottom of the search results.</p>
<p>When people search for a product or a service, they can see up to three ads at the top and eight ads at the side, together with the organic results and snippets such as maps, videos, or shopping results. The ad description could attract the visitor, but only if it’s well written. In fact, I use different strategies to capture people’s eyes and attention. No one will notice your ad if it says “We Provide Great Customer Support” or “Call Us for Help Now” because everybody writes the same boring descriptions and no one would ever say “don’t call me” or “we offer lousy service.”</p>
<p>Let’s search for a random query and see who wins and who loses in the ad description department. I searched for “shoes on sale”:</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bad-sears-shoes-ad-description-1.jpg" width="224" height="72" /></div>
<p>Seriously Sears? I would buy this ad description if the Macy’s ad said “Shop at Macy’s for <strong>No</strong> Savings on Shoes.” And what up with “Buy Online and Save Today!” anyway? This is the kind of “bold” statement that probably stopped working back in 1998.</p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/zappos-shoes-ad-description-1.jpg" width="444" height="140" /></div>
<p>With all respect to Zappos, I can tell that they use the same generic ad descriptions because comma separated “occasions” would never add any value <strong>or</strong> increase sales.</p>
<p><strong>And here is the winner: </strong></p>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shoedazzle-shoe-ad-description-1.jpg" width="302" height="106" /></div>
<p>Shoe Dazzle created an ad with the price, discount, and dollar, percentage and plus signs. The ad serves its main purpose – to sell! I would add an exclamation point and stronger call to action, but still, great job!</p>
<h2>How to Write a Killer Ad Description for a Text Ad: Dos &amp; Don’ts</h2>
<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/seinfeld-big-juicy-van-ad-description-1.jpg" width="488" height="356" /></div>
<p>Remember in the old days when we paid Yellow Pages to make an ad bolder, bigger, stronger, juicier? Yellow Pages used to provide the data on how many more calls you would get if you made your ad stand out. Well, today you can enhance your ad on Google at no cost. There are many ways to make your description more noticeable, but first, here are some no-no’s!</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid generic ad descriptions i.e. “We Are the Top Service Provider”</li>
<li>Avoid annoying corporate jargon like “Streamline Your Business With Us”</li>
<li>Avoid unnecessary keyword insertions “Sale on Discount Furniture on Sale”</li>
<li>Avoid lazy descriptions like “In Stock Now at Example.com”</li>
</ul>
<p>Now here are some tips for what you <em>should</em> do when writing Google Ads (AdWords) text ad descriptions.</p>
<p><strong>Use $ and % signs to show the offer and capture attention.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Save Now Up To 25% Off Shoes!</li>
<li>Get Instant $25 Discount on Shoes!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No discounts? People still like numbers.</strong></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Don't make these four common mistakes when transferring your Google AdWords account to the Bing Ads PPC platform.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/02/14/transfer-google-adwords-account-to-bing-ads">4 Common Mistakes Advertisers Make When Transferring AdWords Accounts to Bing</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com">WordStream</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you the one who transferred an entire Google AdWords account into <a href="/blog/ws/2012/09/12/bing-ads-facts">Bing Ads</a>? But do you actually manage your new Bing account? It’s now easy to copy an account from Google to Bing, but that doesn’t mean that your account will be performing the same in the Bing sponsored results.</p>
<p>Bing Ads is a completely different system with its own set of rules, and it is doesn’t matter how thoroughly you work inside your Google AdWords account – that won’t necessarily help you in Bing.</p>
<p>As a Paid Search Specialist at WordStream, I work with many accounts and I hear all the time: “Do your work on AdWords and we’ll move it to Bing when you’re all done.” Yes, that is easy but it is not the right approach to utilize the different networks. When I actually log in to Bing accounts I can see multiple mistakes which need to be improved ASAP.</p>
<h2>Mistake #1: Screwing Up the Settings</h2>
<p>Firstly, when you transfer an entire account you need to <strong>pay close attention to all your settings</strong>. Some features like <a href="/blog/ws/2013/02/11/adwords-geotargeting-advanced-location-options">geo targeting</a>, custom shapes, and audiences would be not applicable to Bing’s advertising platform. Your settings could be missed if Bing doesn’t recognize some of the AdWords features. Your ads might be shown to the entire population <a href="/blog/ws/2013/02/06/google-adwords-enhanced-campaigns">on every possible device</a> in the United States or globally.</p>
<h2>Mistake #2: Ignoring Your Bing Search Query Report</h2>
<p>Secondly, <strong>check your Bing query report</strong> to avoid displaying for unrelated terms in Bing search. Your Bing and Google search queries could be completely different, especially when you target <a href="/blog/ws/2011/03/31/adwords-matching-options-guide">broad, modified broad, or phrase match types</a>. Google AdWords is more advanced when it comes to matching advertiser’s targeted keywords, ad text, and <a href="/blog/ws/2013/02/07/clean-simple-landing-page-tips">the landing page</a>. In most cases Google can detect when the advertiser bids on a holiday trip to Washington DC and not a book about George Washington. Bing Ads is not so advanced yet when it comes to matching queries to the right ad or landing page and some search traffic from Bing could be completely irrelevant to your business.</p>
<p>For example, we began to manage a client who sells lights and glow sticks for night clubs and partygoers. The client transferred his well-optimized <a href="/blog/ws/2012/07/25/wordstream-now-cross-platform">AdWords account to Bing</a> and left it on “autopilot.” Later on, the client logged in to Google Analytics and found a high bounce rate from Bing, indicating that people who came from a Bing search were unexcited and left the website right away.</p>

<p>We evaluated the Bing account and discovered that <strong>99.9% of the traffic, everything except the branded terms, was unrelated</strong>. For example: the keyword “micro lights” brought hundreds of queries from people who searched for the Micromax smartphone, and the term “led lights” brought all different queries from people who were looking to repair their car’s headlights. It uncovers the fact that Bing does not match to landing page content and is less restrictive when it comes to broad match.</p>
<p>To check your search queries in Bing, go to the Reports tab, choose the “Search Query” Report Type, specific your Date Range, then click “Run.”</p>

<h2>Mistake #3: Copying Mobile/Display Campaigns to Bing</h2>
<p>Thirdly, I don’t recommend transferring your AdWords mobile and display campaigns to Bing because it can cause multiple mistakes and interruptions. They don’t work the same way on both platforms.</p>
<h2>Mistake #4: Too Little Time Spent Optimizing Bing Ads</h2>
<p>Besides working on your settings and queries, I also recommend doing a full evaluation of your Bing account on a monthly or quarterly basis. Microsoft is working to improve the Bing Ads system and the inside changes could involuntarily affect your account performance. By working on multiple Bing accounts, I have noticed that it is impossible to expect consistent performance from Bing.</p>
<p>In addition, I recommend using WordStream software which allows you to <a href="//www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/07/25/bing-ads-scheduled-imports">manage AdWords and Bing Ads accounts</a> on the same screen inside the same software platform. Our software can simultaneously apply negative keywords and make other improvements across both accounts.</p>
