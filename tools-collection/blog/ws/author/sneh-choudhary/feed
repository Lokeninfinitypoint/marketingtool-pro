<h2>What is conversion rate optimization?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/03/improve-conversion-rates">Conversion rate optimization</a> (CRO) is a data-driven approach to increasing the percentage of website visitors that take any desired action on a webpage (like making a purchase or booking an appointment).</p>
<p>The process involves understanding how users interact with a site, identifying barriers to conversion, and then developing hypotheses to overcome these barriers, which are tested for effectiveness.</p>
<div id="why-is-conversion-rate-optimization-important"></div>
<h2>Why is conversion rate optimization important?</h2>
<p>It’s important to recognize that <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/02/conversion-rate-statistics">CRO</a> is not another buzzword—it&#8217;s a pivotal <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/12/05/best-online-marketing-strategies">growth strategy</a> that can make or break a business.</p>
<h3>Maximizes marketing spend</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/winter-content-ideas">Conversion rate optimization</a> ensures that the traffic you drive to your website through various marketing efforts isn&#8217;t wasted. By honing the effectiveness of your site, you&#8217;re getting more value from the same number of visitors, which in turn improves your ROI on marketing spend.</p>
<h3>Increases customer lifetime value</h3>
<p>CRO doesn&#8217;t just work to convert one-time buyers; it optimizes the user experience to foster repeat customers, increasing the lifetime value of each customer and reducing the constant need for new acquisition.</p>
<h3>Lowers customer acquisition costs</h3>
<p>By improving conversion rates, you effectively lower the cost of acquiring new customers. Instead of casting wider nets, you&#8217;re making the net you have more efficient at catching and retaining fish.</p>
<h3>Improves user experience</h3>
<p>A core component of CRO is making your site as user-friendly as possible, which naturally enhances the overall user experience. Happy users are more likely to convert, recommend your site, and return in the future.</p>
<h3>Encourages data-driven decisions</h3>
<p>CRO is grounded in analytics and user feedback, promoting a culture of making informed, data-driven decisions rather than relying on intuition or incomplete information.</p>
<h3>Boosts revenue</h3>
<p>Ultimately, the importance of CRO comes down to the bottom line—it directly boosts revenue. By turning more visitors into customers and doing so more efficiently, businesses can see a significant impact on their financial performance.</p>

<h2>19 critical conversion rate optimization stats for 2025</h2>
<p>These CRO stats expose the effects that industry, strategy, and devices have on conversion rates.</p>
<h3>1. The average Google Ads conversion rate is 7.04%</h3>
<p>In our yearly <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/15/google-ads-benchmarks">Google Ads benchmarks</a> report, we analyzed over 17,000 campaigns and found an average conversion rate of 7.04%.</p>
<p>The bad news? That represented a 10% decline from the previous year.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-YoY.webp" alt="conversion rate optimization - Year over year change of conversion rates" width="780" height="564" class="aligncenter wp-image-80066 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-YoY.webp 780w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-YoY-480x347.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 780px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><b><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></b> Improve your search ad campaigns with our 100% free <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader">Google Ads Grader</a></p>
<h3>2. Apparel and fashion jewelry have the lowest conversion rate</h3>
<p>After breaking our data down by industry, we saw those businesses selling jewelry and apparel had the hardest time converting visitors to customers. Physicians and surgeons, on the other hand, converted over 13% of their visitors.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-benchmarks-industry.webp" alt="conversion rate optimization - Conversion rate by industry" width="655" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-80067 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-benchmarks-industry.webp 655w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-benchmarks-industry-480x440.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 655px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>3. A good conversion rate for ecommerce is 4.8%</h3>
<p>Results from a survey by <a href="https://lp.littledata.io/average/ecommerce-conversion-rate-(all-devices)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LittleData</a> gave us a clear picture of what good looks like for ecommerce businesses. A <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/08/19/conversion-rate-benchmarks">conversion rate</a> above 3.2% means you&#8217;re acing it, comfortably sitting in the top 20% of digital storefronts. And if your numbers are soaring at 4.8% or higher? You&#8217;re the headline act, dominating the scene and turning browsers into buyers like you&#8217;ve got a magic wand for sales.</p>
<p>But if your site&#8217;s conversion rate dips below 0.2%, it&#8217;s like being the DJ who can&#8217;t get the crowd moving. You&#8217;re in the bottom 20%, and it&#8217;s a clear signal to remix your strategy. But remember, if you&#8217;re already a high-flier over 3.2%, pushing for more might hit the point of diminishing returns, where the effort might not quite match the reward.</p>
<h3>4. In-stock notifications are the top conversion boosters for B2B businesses</h3>
<p><strong> </strong>In B2B ecommerce, the ultimate conversion strategy is all about the timely nudge—specifically, alerting customers when a product is back in stock, as hailed by <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1388280/ugc-impacts-conversion-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">67%</a> of surveyed pros.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-instock.webp" alt="conversion rate optimization - Statista chart on conversion rates" width="808" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-80068 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-instock.webp 808w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-instock-480x356.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 808px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1413335/effective-conversion-strategies-b2b-e-commerce-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>This proactive approach is a sales revival tactic, effectively wooing customers back for a satisfying return purchase. Complementing this with razor-sharp site analytics and on-point onsite searches means rolling out the red carpet straight to checkout.</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s not forget the crowd-pleasers: <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">personalized</a> product suggestions, tempting promotions, and the persuasive power of ratings and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/16/get-more-google-reviews">reviews</a> act like the supportive best friends of conversion, turning browsers into buyers by making them feel like the VIPs of your online storefront.</p>
<h3>5. User-generated content is a conversion catalyst</h3>
<p>Analysis of 1,200 websites showed a solid <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1388280/ugc-impacts-conversion-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3.2%</a> conversion rate with the presence of UGC, and that rate jumped by an additional 3.8% when visitors encountered and scrolled through UGC.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-indicator.webp" alt="conversion rate optimization - chart showing indicators of high conversion rate" width="936" height="569" class="aligncenter wp-image-80069 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-indicator.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-indicator-480x292.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1388280/ugc-impacts-conversion-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>The real kicker came when users engaged with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/13/ugc-instagram">UGC</a> (not just viewed it). Doing so doubled their likelihood of making a purchase, catapulting conversion rates by an impressive 102%.</p>
<p>This data underscores a clear message: active interaction with customer reviews, photos, and videos turns shoppers into buyers, making UGC a vital key to unlocking e-commerce success.</p>
<h3>6. Mobile vs. desktop conversion rates: Which converts better?</h3>
<p>Device type significantly influences conversion rates, with desktops hitting a high note at 5.06% while mobile trails at 2.49%, according to <a href="https://marketing.dynamicyield.com/benchmarks/device-usage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dynamic Yield&#8217;s data</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-monthly-cr.webp" alt="conversion rate optimization - monthly conversion rate" width="792" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-80070 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-monthly-cr.webp 792w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-monthly-cr-480x364.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 792px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://marketing.dynamicyield.com/benchmarks/device-usage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>But don&#8217;t be fooled; mobile&#8217;s might isn&#8217;t in conversion percentages but in sheer traffic volume, commanding around 65% compared to desktop&#8217;s 32%.</p>
<p>This stark contrast underscores a critical strategy point: neglecting <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/google-mobile-advertising">mobile optimization</a> could be costly, risking not just immediate sales but long-term customer allegiance in a market increasingly dominated by mobile browsing. Prioritizing a seamless mobile experience is essential, ensuring you capture the full spectrum of the shopping audience.</p>
<h3>7. Automated SMS campaigns can boost conversion by 21%</h3>
<p>Getting in touch with customers where they hang out is becoming quite the trend, especially through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/09/sms-marketing">SMS</a>, Facebook Messenger, and WhatsApp. Think about it—everyone&#8217;s glued to their phones these days, right? So it makes perfect sense to drop your ads, promos, and those sweet, sweet discounts straight into their messaging apps. It&#8217;s like delivering your pitch into their hands—literally.</p>
<p>The timing couldn&#8217;t be better because when your message pings at the right moment, you&#8217;re much more likely to catch their attention. And here&#8217;s a juicy tidbit: hook up those automated marketing campaigns to SMS, and you could see conversions inflate by <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/hubfs/2023%20State%20of%20Marketing%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">21%</a>.</p>
<h3>8. Conversion rate is the 4th most important metric to marketers</h3>
<p>Nearly a third of marketing pros, 29% to be precise, cast their vote for conversion rate as an indicator of marketing success. (P.S. conversion rate is not <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/07/05/conversion-rate-metric">the most important CRO metric</a>.)</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-content.webp" alt="conversion rate optimization -graph of success indicators for content marketing" width="750" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-80071 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-content.webp 750w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-content-480x384.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.hubspot.com/hubfs/2023%20State%20of%20Marketing%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a significant show of hands, underscoring that while it may not be grabbing the gold medal, conversion rate is still stepping onto the podium as a crucial measure to watch.</p>
<h3>9. The majority of websites maintain a sub-40% bounce rate</h3>
<p>When it comes to keeping visitors hooked, it seems like two-thirds of websites are sticking the landing, boasting an average bounce rate below the <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/web-traffic-analytics-report">40%</a> mark.</p>
<p>On the flip side, only a small fraction, about 11%, find themselves on the higher end of the spectrum, with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/07/reduce-bounce-rate">bounce rates</a> soaring over 60%. This stat highlights that most sites are good at enticing visitors to stick around and explore more than just the landing page.</p>
<h3>10. CRO software market will grow to $5 billion by 2025</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/conversion-rate">conversion rate</a> optimization (CRO) software scene is exploding! From 2019&#8217;s cool USD 3.01 billion, we&#8217;re cruising to a hefty <a href="https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/product/conversion-rate-optimisation-cro-software-market/index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$5.07 billion </a>by 2025.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-market-size.webp" alt="conversion rate optimization - graph of conversion software market size" width="936" height="437" class="aligncenter wp-image-80072 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-market-size.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-market-size-480x224.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/product/conversion-rate-optimisation-cro-software-market/index" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Why? Businesses know CRO tools help boost online sales and keep customers hooked. It&#8217;s not just about looking good online; it&#8217;s about making every visit count, and that&#8217;s where CRO comes in.</p>
<p>Now, sure, these tools come with a price tag, and not everyone knows their way around data analytics. But that&#8217;s just a hurdle, not a stop sign. Companies are tripping over themselves to pour money into the latest <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/15/ai-marketing">AI</a> and machine learning to get ahead in the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/website-conversion">website optimization game</a>, which is the golden ticket in CRO right now.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f916.png" alt="🤖" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Learning artificial intelligence can make your marketing more efficient and effective with this free <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteAIinMarketingGuide.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_AIMarketing_Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI in Marketing</a> handbook.</p>
<h3>11. Generative AI boosts optimization for 55% of marketers</h3>
<p>Marketers are tuning into the frequency of generative AI. Already, 32% are harnessing the power of GenAI, with another 43% lining up to tap into its potential.</p>
<p>The standout feature they&#8217;re all excited about? A hefty 55% leap in the ability to experiment and optimize at the drop of a hat. This is about turning campaigns around at lightning speed and dialing up content personalization to impressive levels.</p>
<p>But diving into <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-copywriting-tools">artificial intelligence</a> isn&#8217;t without its <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/28/ai-for-marketing">challenges</a>. Finding a clear <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/05/generative-ai-in-digital-marketing">strategy to unlock AI&#8217;s capabilities</a> is still a work in progress for many. The message is clear: it&#8217;s optimization gold if you&#8217;ve got the map to find it.</p>
<h3>12. B2B websites with 1 second load time have 5x more conversions</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.portent.com/blog/analytics/research-site-speed-hurting-everyones-revenue.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Portent&#8217;s research</a> highlights a straightforward but powerful insight. Faster load times equal better conversion rates.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-page-speed.webp" alt="conversion rate optimization - graph showing time to load effect on CR" width="936" height="476" class="aligncenter wp-image-80073 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-page-speed.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-page-speed-480x244.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.portent.com/blog/analytics/research-site-speed-hurting-everyones-revenue.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Stagnancy in improvement is notable, with 82% of sites loading in five seconds or less. That’s unchanged since 2019.</p>
<p>The real eye-opener is the direct correlation between speed and conversions. If your site loads in a brisk one second, your conversion rates could triple compared to a five-second load time. Even more impressive, that same one-second page load can mean conversion rates five times higher than those of a 10-second loader. It&#8217;s clear that when it comes to clinching leads, every second shaved off your load time can make a substantial difference.</p>
<h3>13. B2C sites with 1 second load time see a 2.5x higher conversion</h3>
<p>Similar to B2B sites, recent findings by Portent reveal a crucial link between site speed and sales conversions for B2C websites, too.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-sessions-1.webp" alt="conversion rate optimization - graph showing time to load effect" width="936" height="488" class="aligncenter wp-image-80075 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-sessions-1.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-sessions-1-480x250.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.portent.com/blog/analytics/research-site-speed-hurting-everyones-revenue.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s good news: site speed is on the up, with 86% of pages now loading in under five seconds—a notable increase from 81% back in 2019.</p>
<p>Here’s why that matters. If your pages load in just one second, you&#8217;re looking at ecommerce conversion rates that are a whopping 2.5 times higher than if your site takes a more leisurely five seconds to load.</p>
<p>Bottom line? When it comes to B2C ecommerce, faster is better, and every second really does count.</p>
<h3>14. Product reviews greatly affect conversion rates</h3>
<p>Products flaunting just five reviews are <a href="https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/how-online-reviews-influence-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">270%</a> more likely to be purchased than those with none. Talk about a skyrocket in consumer confidence!</p>
<p>It seems the heftier the price, the heftier the influence of reviews. For more budget-friendly items, showing off reviews can pump up conversion rates by a solid 190%. But for those big-ticket items? A dramatic 380% boost. The graph paints a clear picture: reviews can nearly double conversion rates for low-priced goods and nearly quadruple them for the expensive stuff.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-high-price.webp" alt="conversion rate optimization - graph comparing high and low priced items and conversion rate" width="609" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-80077 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-high-price.webp 609w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-high-price-480x473.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 609px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/how-online-reviews-influence-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Yet, when it comes to star ratings, perfection can raise eyebrows. Shoppers are most likely to hit the buy button for products rated between 4 and 4.7 stars. Hit that pristine 5-star mark, and shoppers start to get skeptical, wondering if it&#8217;s too good to be true.</p>
<h3>15. Personalized CTAs convert 202% better than standard ones</h3>
<p>Personalized <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/20/call-to-action-buttons">call-to-action buttons</a> (CTAs) aren&#8217;t just effective, they&#8217;re like striking conversion oil. <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/personalized-calls-to-action-convert-better-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HubSpot&#8217;s deep dive</a> into over 330,000 CTAs over six months unearthed a sparkling stat: Personalized CTAs have a conversion rate that&#8217;s 202% better than your run-of-the-mill, one-size-fits-all CTAs.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just small potatoes, it&#8217;s a full-on feast of potential. Why? Because personalized CTAs are like having a secret handshake with each customer, offering them something that clicks with their unique journey and interests.</p>
<h3>16. Videos convert more with mid-roll CTAs and clear email asks</h3>
<p>While conventional wisdom placed CTAs and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/10/22/lead-capture-form">lead capture forms</a> at the beginning or end of videos, <a href="https://wistia.com/about/state-of-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data from Wistia</a> consistently shows that mid-roll placements are the conversion sweet spots.</p>
<p>Despite a decrease in their usage, lead capture forms have seen a doubling in conversion rates—hinting at untapped potential, especially when the forms include the term &#8220;email&#8221; in their copy.</p>
<p>Plus, while allowing viewers to skip giving out their email might seem counterintuitive, it’s proving effective. But the real conversion heroes? The fully gated <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/13/explainer-videos">videos</a>—those that require an email before proceeding—see the highest conversion rates, suggesting that viewers are more willing than ever to exchange their contact information for valuable content.</p>
<h3>17. CTA button color isn&#8217;t the conversion hero</h3>
<p>Think a splash of red or a dash of blue on your CTA button is a game-changer for conversions? Not quite. It&#8217;s less about the hue and more about how the button pops against the page, grabbing attention and guiding users to click.</p>
<p>Take a cue from Bing, who dialed up their revenue by <a href="https://www.shockmarketer.com/call-to-action-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$80 million</a> just by picking the perfect blue—a blue not too different from Google&#8217;s, tapping into users&#8217; web-wired brains that equate blue with links.</p>
<h3>18. Entertainment, games, and travel lead the pack on Apple’s App Store</h3>
<p>In the search ad scene in Apple&#8217;s App Store, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1412216/apple-app-store-ads-conversion-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">travel and entertainment apps</a> were playing to win.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-apps2.webp" alt="conversion rate optimization - graph showing entertainment apps get good conversion" width="674" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-80078 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-apps2.webp 674w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-apps2-480x427.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 674px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1412216/apple-app-store-ads-conversion-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>In the search ad scene in Apple&#8217;s App Store during the latter half of 2022, games and entertainment apps were playing to win.</p>
<p>A staggering 69% of users who spotted an ad for a travel app couldn&#8217;t resist tapping on it. That&#8217;s like two out of every three people deciding to check out the app after seeing an ad.</p>
<p>But hold your horses, because entertainment apps were the ones stealing the spotlight. They hit an eye-popping 79.69% conversion rate, meaning nearly 8 out of 10 people were swiping at those ads like there&#8217;s no tomorrow.</p>
<h3>19. Events and navigation apps had the highest conversion rate in the Google Play Store</h3>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s jump into the Google Play Store&#8217;s world, focusing on the US market. Here, the overall download conversion rate for Android apps was sitting at a comfy <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1405963/gp-store-app-conversion-by-category/">31%</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-apps1.webp" alt="conversion rate optimization - app conversion rates in the Google play store" width="936" height="578" class="aligncenter wp-image-80079 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-apps1.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/conversion-rate-optimization-statistics-wordstream-apps1-480x296.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1405963/gp-store-app-conversion-by-category/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s jump into the Google Play Store&#8217;s world for the first half of 2023, focusing on the US market. Here, the overall download conversion rate for Android apps was sitting at a comfy 31.3%.</p>
<p>But check this out. Events apps, alongside maps and navigation, were crushing it with an approximate 84% conversion rate. Imagine that—almost every time someone came across one of these apps, they just had to download it. It&#8217;s like these categories had the secret sauce that made nearly everyone hit &#8216;install.&#8217;</p>
<p>On the flip side, card and word gaming apps were hanging out at the other end of the spectrum, struggling to turn those ad views into downloads. It’s a classic case of &#8216;not all apps are created equal&#8217; when convincing users to take the plunge.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Use these conversion rate optimization statistics to guide your strategy this year</h2>
<p>In 2025, it will be all about getting creative to convert more business.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re looking for ways to boost customer loyalty, lower marketing expenses, and tap into innovative ideas right from your own customers, a brand community might be right for you.</p>
<p>For example, Sephora&#8217;s Beauty Insider Community has attracted over 5 million members and generated more than 2.7 million user-generated posts since 2017. This members-only platform offers makeup and skincare enthusiasts a forum to find inspiration and get non-sponsored recommendations.</p>
<p>By creating a brand community, your business can encourage engagement, offer support, and promote word-of-mouth marketing to grow your business. In this guide, we&#8217;ll cover everything you need to know to build an effective brand community&#8211;along with some examples to inspire you.</p>

<h2>What is a brand community?</h2>
<p>A brand community is a group of people who engage with a brand beyond simply buying its products. Like at Sephora, brand communities often interact with each other, creating an organic space to share inspiration, recommendations, and experiences that increase the group’s affinity for the brand.</p>

<h2>Why does building a brand community matter?</h2>
<p>Brand communities aren’t just a marketing exercise, though. They are a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/18/best-marketing-strategies">marketing strategy</a> that aligns with the goals of your business, fostering efficient growth in a variety of ways (and improving your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/brand-perception">brand perception</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/a-better-way-to-build-a-brand-the-community-flywheel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data from McKinsey</a>, for example, revealed that brands that succeed at building communities perform well across different metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 75% of content about the brand is user-generated.</li>
<li>The influencer engagement rate— i.e. the percentage of viewers who like, share or comment on the content—is more than 2%.</li>
<li>Over 4% of online traffic gets converted to sales.</li>
<li>Posts related to the brand that are shared by the brand or a consumer go viral at least 2x/year</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some more benefits of a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/facebook-ads-brand-suitability-controls">brand</a> community to consider.</p>
<h3>Increases customer loyalty and sales</h3>
<p>A sense of belonging and connection with a brand often leads to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/11/10/customer-loyalty">increased loyalty</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-affinity.webp" alt="Brand community -venn diagram of brand affinity " width="936" height="490" class="aligncenter wp-image-78742 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-affinity.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-affinity-480x251.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>

<p>When customers feel they&#8217;re part of a community, they&#8217;re more likely to continue supporting the brand and advocate for it. Plus, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">loyal community members</a> are more likely to make repeat purchases and can play a crucial role in driving new customer acquisitions through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/06/referral-marketing">referrals</a>.</p>
<h3>Promotes authentic engagement</h3>
<p>A brand community encourages organic interactions between customers. These <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/07/customer-engagement-strategy">engagements</a> provide genuine insights and create a deeper emotional connection between the brand and its customers.</p>
<h3>Creates a valuable feedback loop</h3>
<p>Brand communities provide businesses with direct access to consumers&#8217; thoughts and feelings. This <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/24/customer-feedback">customer feedback</a> is invaluable for product improvements, innovation, and understanding market needs.</p>

</a></em></p>
<h3>Helps with crisis management</h3>
<p>A solid brand community can act as a support network should any <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/02/social-media-crisis-management">issues or crises arise</a>. The company can communicate with its most loyal customers, offering understanding and feedback, helping them navigate turbulent times.</p>
<h3>Lowers the cost of marketing</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/26/word-of-mouth-marketing">Word-of-mouth</a> and organic sharing within the community can significantly reduce the need for traditional marketing expenses. Community members become micro brand ambassadors, often promoting products and services without direct incentive. Plus, <a href="https://www.marketingcharts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">28%</a><a href="https://www.marketingcharts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> of</a><a href="https://www.marketingcharts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://www.marketingcharts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> customers</a> prefer finding out about new brands and products through word of mouth.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.marketingcharts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></p>
<h3>Acts as an outlet for new ideas and improvements</h3>
<p>Engaged community members often offer fresh ideas, perspectives, and solutions that can lead to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/20/product-positioning">product or service improvements</a> or even entirely new offerings.</p>
<div id="how-do-you-build-a-brand-community"></div>
<h2>How to build a brand community</h2>
<p>Building a brand community is more than just setting up a platform. It&#8217;s about fostering relationships, offering value, and continually engaging with your audience. A thriving brand community requires methodical planning, incremental improvements, and consistently putting customers first.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-presence.webp" alt="Brand community - graphic showing how communities work." width="868" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-78745 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-presence.webp 868w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-presence-480x332.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 868px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/a-better-way-to-build-a-brand-the-community-flywheel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>1. Ensure strategic alignment</h3>
<p>Ensure your brand community aligns with your business goals and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/12/21/customer-perceived-value">customer satisfaction</a> criteria.</p>
<p>A brand community shouldn&#8217;t just be an afterthought or a siloed initiative. For it to genuinely succeed, ensure you have a clear understanding of your end goals, whether they&#8217;re bolstering <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/11/10/customer-loyalty">brand loyalty</a>, gathering user feedback, or driving organic word-of-mouth marketing. The community should reflect the brand&#8217;s core values and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/02/how-to-write-a-business-mission-statement">mission</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Dedicate ample resources</h3>
<p>Effective community management demands resources—both in terms of time and personnel.</p>
<p>Whether you embed it as part of your marketing department or hire dedicated community managers, ensure clear accountability and responsibility. Choose individuals aligned with your brand values because they will actively shape brand perceptions and handle <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/24/customer-feedback">feedback</a>.</p>
<p>This example from HubSpot shows how to do community management the right way.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-hubspot.webp" alt="Brand community - community post on Hubspot" width="559" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-78746 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-hubspot.webp 559w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-hubspot-480x515.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 559px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/great-community-management-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>3. Choose the right platform</h3>
<p>Your choice of platform can significantly influence the community&#8217;s trajectory.</p>
<p>While third-party platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or Reddit can be excellent due to their vast user base, there&#8217;s a growing trend and clear advantages to hosting communities directly on brand websites.</p>
<p>This example of a post on EA’s subreddit shows how quickly it can go downhill when communities are hosted on other platforms. This comment became the <a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/react-most-downvoted-comment-of-reddit-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most downvoted comment</a> in Reddit history.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-locked.webp" alt="Brand community - discussion in ES Sport's subreddit" width="909" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-78748 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-locked.webp 909w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-locked-480x317.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 909px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/reddit-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>Direct integration offers more control, better access to user data, and can drive further engagement with other parts of your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/12/31/basic-website">website</a>.</p>
<h3>4. Leverage your website</h3>
<p>Hosting your community on your site makes it easier to collect first-party data, ensures consistent branding, and potentially increases time spent on your site. This integration can lead to better customer insights and improve <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/conversion-rate#:~:text=Make%20sure%20your%20headline%20clearly,that%20entices%20people%20to%20act">conversion rates</a>.</p>
<p>Take a look at this example of Lululemon’s brand community hosted on its website.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-lululemon.webp" alt="Brand community - lululemon's brand community" width="936" height="555" class="aligncenter wp-image-78750 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-lululemon.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-lululemon-480x285.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://shop.lululemon.com/community" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<h3>5. Create a cross-channel experience</h3>
<p>A brand community isn&#8217;t limited to its primary platform. If your community thrives on your website, snippets of vibrant discussions, testimonials, or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/28/user-generated-content">user-generated content</a> can be highlighted on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/01/09/social-media-marketing-strategies">social media platforms</a>, creating a web of interconnected touchpoints that reinforce the brand&#8217;s messaging and values.</p>
<h3>6. Adopt a customer-centric approach</h3>
<p>The heart of any brand community is its members.</p>
<p>Their needs, desires, and feedback should be at the forefront. A successful brand community should provide a platform for users to voice their opinions and make <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/01/06/cater-to-your-customers">customers feel valued and heard</a>. Exclusivity, in terms of offers or information, can make community members feel like VIPs, fostering stronger brand allegiance.</p>
<h3>7. Act on customer feedback</h3>
<p>Open channels of communication mean customer feedback will flow abundantly. And what truly matters is the brand&#8217;s responsiveness and adaptability. Demonstrating that you value and act upon user feedback can turn casual users into brand evangelists, creating organic promoters within the community.</p>
<h3>8. Empower active participation</h3>
<p>Communities thrive on engaged participants.</p>
<p>Allow users to have a say in product development or other brand initiatives. This tactic will help you source fresh ideas and give users a stake in your brand&#8217;s journey, deepening their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotional connection</a>.</p>
<h3>9. Create tailored experiences</h3>
<p>Understanding the distinct makeup and preferences of your brand community can allow for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">hyper-personalized experiences</a>. For instance, a fashion brand’s community can offer its members the opportunity to create their own designs, shop from exclusive designer lines based on their likes, and watch behind-the-scenes <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/08/03/video-marketing-ideas">videos</a> for upcoming collections.</p>
<p>While Uniqlo doesn’t have a “community,” it offers a unique look at new designer collections to fashion-conscious consumers.</p>

<h3>10. Engage with members consistently</h3>
<p>Engagement goes beyond mere content updates. Hosting live Q&amp;A sessions, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/13/ugc-instagram">featuring user-generated content</a>, or spotlighting community members can generate buzz. Offering tangible benefits, such as discounts or early access to sales, can also bolster active participation.</p>
<h3>11. Extend engagement to the real world</h3>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget the power of real-world interactions. Workshops, meet-ups, or exclusive brand events can solidify the sense of community, making members feel even more valued.</p>
<p>Joining the IKEA Family gives members access to both free and paid offline workshops and events that they can attend with their entire family.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-Ikea.webp" alt="Brand community - IKEA community web page" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-78753 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-Ikea.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-Ikea-480x308.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>

<h3>12. Make it extremely accessible</h3>
<p>Your community should be easily accessible. If hosted on your site, clear signposting from the homepage, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/06/01/product-pages">product pages</a>, or during the checkout process can direct more traffic, ensuring users know the community exists and its benefits.</p>
<h3>13. Run cross-promotion campaigns</h3>
<p>Employ branded <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">hashtags</a> or initiate challenges that blur the lines between different platforms. This <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/22/cross-channel-marketing">cross-channel approach</a> not only maintains consistent brand messaging but also exposes a broader audience to your brand community, roping in potential new members.</p>

<h2>The best examples of brand communities in action</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/a-better-way-to-build-a-brand-the-community-flywheel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McKinsey’s research</a> found that brands that succeed at building brand communities employ five key strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand their communities</li>
<li>Craft engaging brand narratives</li>
<li>Highlight flagship products</li>
<li>Foster discussions across platforms</li>
<li>Simplify the buying process.</li>
</ul>
<p>These strategies collectively promote the creation of a self-sustaining community flywheel. Here are stellar brand community examples that epitomize this phenomenon in action:</p>
<h3>LEGO Ideas</h3>
<p><a href="https://ideas.lego.com/howitworks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LEGO Ideas</a> is a platform where fans can share their creations, enter challenges, and showcase their proposals for new LEGO sets. The most popular designs, determined by community votes, may get produced by LEGO.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-lego.webp" alt="Brand community - Lego online community" width="936" height="492" class="aligncenter wp-image-78756 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-lego.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-lego-480x252.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ideas.lego.com/howitworks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The community provides a direct line for fans to be involved in product development, fostering a sense of ownership and collaboration.</p>
<h3>GoPro</h3>
<p><a href="https://gopro.com/en/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoPro’s</a> online community is centered around two concepts:creating user-generated content and offering community-led customer support.</p>
<p>User-generated content routinely gets shared on GoPro’s official Instagram handle with the hashtag #shotongopro.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-gopro1.webp" alt="Brand community - Screenshot of GoPro's social media page" width="702" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-78757 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-gopro1.webp 702w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-gopro1-480x410.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 702px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CwnFgO7rqrV/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>The brand encourages users to submit photos and videos to win cash prizes. GoPro subscribers get double the reward, encouraging more users to join the inner circle.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-GoPro2.webp" alt="Brand community - GoPro's discussion board" width="669" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-78758 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-GoPro2.webp 669w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-GoPro2-480x430.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 669px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://community.gopro.com/s/gopro-labs?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Both of these strategies have helped GoPro become the go-to choice for adventurers and travel influencers.</p>
<h3>Peloton</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-peleton.webp" alt="Brand community - Woman riding a peleton bike" width="886" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-78761 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-peleton.webp 886w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brand-community-wordstream-example-peleton-480x325.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 886px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://medium.com/swlh/peloton-proves-the-value-of-building-community-169a4d969aee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peloton</a>, technically a fitness business, wants to be known as a health and wellness brand amongst its audience. The brand’s meteoric growth during the pandemic can be largely attributed to its loyal user base sharing their personal experiences with the brand.</p>
<p>Peloton’s Chief Marketing Officer Dara Treseder shared their approach to brand building with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/07/how-peloton-builds-a-community-around-health-and-wellness.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>:</p>
<p>“&#8230;for us, that intentional cultivation of community is really focused on finding where there are organic sparks of connection within our member base, and then kind of pouring fuel on that &#8230; shining a spotlight on those things.”</p>
<p>The company also uses its famous team of instructors to frequently connect with members across social <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">media platforms</a>.</p>
<h2>Transitioning to a &#8216;brand community-at-the-core&#8217; model</h2>
<p>By positioning your brand community at the heart of business operations and weaving it seamlessly into the customer support framework, you can enhance user experience. Use intelligent search tools to ensure that community-driven insights are easily accessible, often preempting the need for customer support channels.</p>
<p>But beyond these strategies, the key lies in genuine, wholehearted commitment. Remember these steps to build a brand community that your most important customers want to be a part of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure strategic alignment</li>
<li>Dedicate ample resource</li>
<li>Choose the right platform</li>
<li>Leverage your website</li>
<li>Create a cross-channel experience</li>
<li>Adopt a customer-centric approach</li>
<li>Act on customer feedback</li>
<li>Empower active participation</li>
<li>Create tailored experiences</li>
<li>Engage with members consistently</li>
<li>Extend engagement to the real world</li>
<li>Make it extremely accessible</li>
<li>Run cross-promotion campaigns</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/The-2023-State-of-Social-Media.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">96%</a> of business leaders agree that companies that want to be successful must continue to invest in social media. So the question here isn’t really <em>if</em> you should have a strong social game but <em>which</em> platforms give you the most bang for your buck?</p>
<p>And that’s where the whole TikTok vs. YouTube debate stems from—both platforms can help businesses connect with audiences, drive purchases, and build a sense of community through video.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-vs-youtube.webp" alt="tiktok vs youtube logos" width="936" height="553" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77151" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-vs-youtube.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-vs-youtube-480x284.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>But what’s unique about both platforms is they’re also used as search engines by users. In fact, <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo/meet-search-engines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube is the second-largest search engine</a>. And for Gen Z, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/16/technology/gen-z-tiktok-search-engine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok is Google</a>.</p>
<p>Whether you create tailored content for these platforms to grow organically, partner with influencers, or run ads to drive sales, both YouTube and TikTok have a lot to offer.</p>

<h2>TikTok vs. YouTube: Background</h2>
<p>YouTube and TikTok are titans in the realm of video-sharing platforms.</p>
<p>Originating in 2005, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/03/how-to-advertise-on-youtube">YouTube</a>, now under Google&#8217;s umbrella since its 2006 acquisition, has firmly established itself as a platform for diverse content, from vlogs to tutorials, and allows users to upload, comment on, and share videos.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-thumbnail-example.webp" alt="tiktok vs youtube - example of youtube thumbnail" width="936" height="552" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77135" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-thumbnail-example.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-thumbnail-example-480x283.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB0TlsnkY6E&amp;ab_channel=ThinkMedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>On the flip side, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/20/how-often-to-post-on-tiktok">TikTok</a>, a relatively newer sensation, has taken the world by storm with its short, engaging clips and virality potential. Just take a look at how <a href="https://drinkolipop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olipop</a>, an alternative to regular soda, <a href="https://adage.com/article/digital-marketing-ad-tech-news/how-viral-tiktok-soda-brand-olipop-built-its-influencer-marketing-strategy/2462031" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used influencer marketing to take over TikTok</a>:</p>

<p>Both platforms offer unique advantages for businesses, but the choice between them hinges on your <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a> and content strategy.</p>

</ul>
<div id="pros-of-youtube"></div>
<h2>Pros of YouTube</h2>
<p>YouTube stands as a digital titan in the realm of video content, paving ways for content businesses to diversify, engage, and monetize their work. But in this grand platform arena, how does YouTube compare with the rising star, TikTok?</p>
<h3>A wide range of content types</h3>
<p>Both YouTube and TikTok offer an expansive array of content types, catering to different audience preferences.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://databox.com/popular-youtube-video-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey from Databox</a> shows the 15 most popular video types include education videos, explainer videos, product demos, and product reviews.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-channel-content-types.webp" alt="types of content shared on youtube" width="936" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77138" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-channel-content-types.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-channel-content-types-480x241.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://databox.com/popular-youtube-video-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>On TikTok, dance videos and quick tutorials reign supreme, capturing the essence of fleeting moments and trends. Meanwhile, YouTube offers a broader spectrum, from casual vlogs to professional business workshops.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/youtube-seo">breadth of content on YouTube</a> is staggering—whether it&#8217;s an intricate cooking tutorial, a comedic skit, or an in-depth tech review, the platform has it all. This diversity speaks to the versatility it provides to businesses, ensuring that there&#8217;s something for every viewer.</p>
<h3>Long-form content possibilities</h3>
<p>YouTube has long been the sanctuary for brands looking to dive deep. Its platform effortlessly accommodates 30-minute intense workouts, 2-hour in-depth podcasts, and everything in between.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpV63fceRgY&amp;ab_channel=YouTubeAdvertisers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cassey Ho</a>, through her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIJwWYOfsCfz6PjxbONYXSg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blogilates</a> channel, exemplifies this perfectly. For Cassey, her videos provide not just a 20- to 30-minute exercise session but also a chance to forge deeper connections.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-blogilates-channel.webp" alt="youtube pros - blogilates channel youtube thumbnail example" width="936" height="550" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77139" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-blogilates-channel.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-blogilates-channel-480x282.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIJwWYOfsCfz6PjxbONYXSg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>But recognizing the emerging trend of bite-sized content, YouTube also introduced <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-make-youtube-shorts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube Shorts</a>, a feature allowing users to craft 15-60 second videos like TikTok.</p>
<h3>Established and popular platform</h3>
<p>As veterans in the digital space, both YouTube and TikTok have cemented their places as popular platforms. YouTube boasts over <a href="https://www.demandsage.com/youtube-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2.7 billion</a> active monthly users, an impressive figure that underscores its dominance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-monthly-active-users.webp" alt="monthly active users on youtube" width="936" height="516" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77140" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-monthly-active-users.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-monthly-active-users-480x265.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.demandsage.com/youtube-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>TikTok, though newer, has quickly amassed more than <a href="https://www.demandsage.com/tiktok-user-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.1 billion</a> monthly active users, driven by its captivating, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/28/user-generated-content">user-generated content</a>. Features like an easy user interface, a wide variety of content, and personalized recommendations have contributed to the monumental success of both platforms.</p>
<h3>Target audience options</h3>
<p>Understanding and catering to the right audience is crucial for content success. YouTube, with its vast expanse, appeals to a broad audience, from curious kids and trend-following teens to information-seeking adults and seniors.</p>
<p>The introduction of YouTube Shorts further solidifies its appeal to the younger crowd. In contrast, TikTok predominantly resonates with the younger generation, offering businesses a concentrated demographic to target.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1287137/youtube-global-users-age-gender-distribution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Statista</a>, the 18-24 (15%) and 25-34 (20.7%) age ranges account for most of YouTube’s demographic.</p>

<h3>High user engagement rates</h3>
<p>Engagement is the currency of the digital realm.</p>
<p>Both TikTok and YouTube have cultivated ecosystems where user engagement rates soar. Engaging content not only retains viewers but positively influences algorithm rankings and content recommendations. (Check out these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/10/youtube-seo-tips">Simple YouTube SEO Tips to Rank Your Videos Higher in Search</a>)</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-algorithm">TikTok&#8217;s algorithm</a> thrives on virality, ensuring users are constantly engaged with trending videos, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/15/youtube-algorithm">YouTube&#8217;s algorithm</a> focuses on user behavior, pushing content that aligns with individual preferences.</p>
<h3>Ability to monetize content</h3>
<p>YouTube offers a well-defined path to monetization, with options ranging from ad revenue to affiliate marketing and brand promotions. And a <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-154/marketing-strategies/video/youtube-challenges-tv-advertising-roi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study from Google</a> showed that YouTube beat TV in ad ROI in 77% of studies.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-pros-higher-roi-than-tv.webp" alt="youtube benefits - higher roi than tv" width="936" height="490" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77142" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-pros-higher-roi-than-tv.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/youtube-pros-higher-roi-than-tv-480x251.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>TikTok, while not offering direct monetization options akin to YouTube&#8217;s AdSense, still presents opportunities. Popular brands on TikTok can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/22/tiktok-ads">drive sales through ads</a>, brand partnerships, and influencer marketing endeavors.</p>
<div id="pros-of-tiktok"></div>
<h2>Pros of TikTok</h2>
<p>TikTok predominantly captivates the younger demographic with its snappy content and virality-driven features. From offering a buffet of bite-sized videos to being the epicenter of trending challenges, TikTok has reshaped how content is created and consumed.</p>
<p>Here’s a dive into what makes TikTok a standout platform.</p>
<h3>Bite-sized content possibilities</h3>
<p>TikTok and YouTube both offer avenues for bite-sized content, with TikTok specifically sculpted around short-form videos. This bite-sized format is what helped <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en/inspiration/prism-plus-sg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PRISM+</a>, a Singaporean electronics brand, leverage TikTok to engage Gen Z tech enthusiasts. Their TikTok strategy resulted in over 16.5K followers and a 58.6% sales boost during their 12.12 Sale in 2022.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.warriorforum.com/social-media/1471828-study-tiktok-dominating-short-form-content.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Their TikTok Shop venture and interactive live streams also contributed to significant growth and a plan to expand to markets like Malaysia.</p>
<h3>Ideal platform for viral trends</h3>
<p>TikTok stands as a colossal hub for viral trends and challenges. Its algorithm, coupled with fierce user engagement, fosters an environment where content can achieve virality overnight.</p>
<p>From trending dances to quirky challenges, TikTok has become synonymous with internet trends that have transcended to other platforms like YouTube and Instagram.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-pros-shopping-options.webp" alt="tiktok trend report homepage" width="936" height="364" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77144" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-pros-shopping-options.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-pros-shopping-options-480x187.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>

<p><a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/trends/hub/pc/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok’s Creative Center</a> explains new trends and publishes trends reports for businesses who want to better navigate the platform.</p>
<h3>TikTok shopping options</h3>
<p>TikTok Shop offers a personalized commerce platform where sellers can authentically engage with communities and creators to drive meaningful shopping experiences. Brands can seamlessly blend entertainment and commerce, gain trust via TikTok creators showcasing their products, and benefit from in-app touchpoints like LIVE shopping and shoppable videos.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-pros-shopping-ads-options.webp" alt="tiktok vs youtube - tiktok pros - shopping ads examples" width="936" height="524" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77145" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-pros-shopping-ads-options.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-pros-shopping-ads-options-480x269.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://shop.tiktok.com/business/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>The platform offers frictionless checkout, scalable support tools, and partnership opportunities, leading to tangible sales results as evidenced by case studies of multiple sellers experiencing significant growth. Importantly, according to TikTok, <a href="https://shop.tiktok.com/business/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70%</a> of TikTok users discover new brands on the platform, and 3 in 4 users are inclined to make a purchase.</p>
<h3>Highly engaged user base</h3>
<p>Both TikTok and YouTube boast a deeply engaged user base, each with unique demographic leanings.</p>
<p>But while YouTube recently introduced &#8220;YouTube Shorts&#8221; to cater to short-form content preference, it cannot compete with TikTok. Compared to YouTube Shorts, which has an average engagement rate of about 3.80%, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/16/tiktok-vs-instagram-reels-ads">Reels</a>, with an average engagement of <a href="https://www.socialinsider.io/blog/tiktok-vs-reels-vs-shorts/#1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4.36%</a>, TikTok boasts a notably higher engagement level.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-vs-reels.webp" alt="tiktok vs instagram reels engagement rate" width="484" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77146" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-vs-reels.webp 484w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiktok-vs-reels-480x594.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 484px, 100vw" /></p>

<div id="how-to-choose-between-tiktok-vs-youtube"></div>
<h2>How to choose between TikTok vs. YouTube</h2>
<p>YouTube, with its vast expanse of diverse audiences, offers brands unparalleled reach. Meanwhile, TikTok&#8217;s virality potential can catapult a brand into overnight fame. Advertising on these platforms is not just an option; it&#8217;s a strategic imperative.</p>
<p>The best option isn’t TikTok vs. YouTube but rather TikTok and YouTube. You can create content on YouTube that can be repurposed for both TikTok and YouTube Shorts. And you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/tiktok-ads-bidding">run ads</a> on both platforms to reach the widest audience for your business.</p>
<p>It’s a win-win!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The “TikTok made me buy it” era is over.</p>
<p>Well, not quite, but it isn’t the only platform where users sincerely engage with sponsored content—Spotify is a close second (and may be gunning for the top place).</p>
<p>The second volume of <a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/sonic-science/vol-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sonic Science</a>, a biometric study that reveals the impact of digital audio and ad engagement, found that Spotify listeners remember the brands they hear about on podcasts or while streaming music.</p>
<p>And ad recall isn’t the only metric that’s through the roof.</p>
<p>1 in 5 study participants reported looking up a brand or product after hearing about it in a Spotify ad, and 30% said they’re likely to make a purchase—nothing but great news for advertisers looking to get into audio advertising.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-homepage-example.jpg" alt="spotify advertising example on homepage - desktop and mobile" width="817" height="524" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73575" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-homepage-example.jpg 817w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-homepage-example-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 817px, 100vw" /></p>

<p>But planning is more important than execution in the long run. So before you jet off to create your first Spotify ad, here’s (almost) everything you need to know about how Spotify advertising works, if it’s worth investing in, and how to create some sonic serendipity.</p>

<h2>What is Spotify advertising?</h2>
<p>Spotify advertising includes running audio ads (accompanied by a branded video or image) between songs, podcasts, and playlists, typically within the free version of Spotify.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-main-placement-example.jpg" alt="spotify advertising main placement example " width="328" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73576" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-main-placement-example.jpg 328w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-main-placement-example-165x300.jpg 165w" sizes="(max-width: 328px) 100vw, 328px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<h3>Other Spotify ad types</h3>
<p>Aside from the typical Spotify ads mentioned above, there are a few custom options available for Spotify advertising. These vary in costs and cannot be run as part of the self-serve ad platform (we&#8217;ll get more into that later).</p>
<h4>Sponsored Playlist</h4>
<p>With <a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/ad-experiences/sponsored-playlist-ad-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sponsored Playlists</a>, you can run your ads when people listen to Spotify’s most popular owned and operated playlists. Spotify’s streaming intelligence can help you better <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">understand your target audience</a> and identify the best playlists that align with your brand.</p>

<p>When listeners first open the Spotify app or return to it, they’re greeted with the <a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/ad-experiences/display-ads-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overlay</a>—an ad engineered for viewability that ensures significant brand impact.

<h2>Is Spotify good for advertising?</h2>
<p>Short answer: Heck yes, it is!</p>
<p>Digital audio is a sound investment (get it?). And with the recent surge in demand for both podcasts and music (thanks to the numerous lockdowns and quarantines), advertisers have been flocking to the medium.</p>
<p>And Spotify is sitting pretty at the top with the largest <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/amo/advertising/audio-advertising/digital-audio-advertising/worldwide#key-players" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market share</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-market-share.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - market share for different audio advertising channels" width="800" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73582" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-market-share.jpg 800w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-market-share-480x359.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/amo/advertising/audio-advertising/digital-audio-advertising/worldwide#key-players" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Spotify offers a deeply personalized and interactive user experience, making it far more engaging, emotionally arousing, and memorable when compared to other mediums like digital video, social media, and TV.</p>
<p>Here are some reasons Spotify advertising works.</p>
<h3>People pay attention to Spotify ads</h3>
<p>In a digital world where user attention is becoming a scarce commodity, Spotify is one of the best places to find an engaged and attentive audience.</p>
<p>Dentsu International’s research project, <a href="https://www.dentsu.com/uk/en/our-latest-thinking/unlocking-the-new-currency-of-attention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Attention Economy</a>, can confirm that. Compared to the platform average, Spotify’s audio ads and video ads drove +14% and +155% “<a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/news-and-insights/dentsu-research-attention-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greater attentive seconds</a>” respectively.</p>
<p>Attention isn’t just a nice-to-have metric—it can boost ad recall and purchase intent. And the data from the Sonic Science study has already established how Spotify ads positively impact those metrics.</p>
<h3>That attention and engagement lasts all day, every day</h3>
<p><a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/sonic-science/vol-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">63%</a> of Spotify listeners stated that Spotify is an integral part of their day.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that global audiences listen to <a href="https://www.ifpi.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Engaging-with-Music-2022_full-report-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20 hours</a> of music every week, and <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/the-podcast-industry-report-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 in 5 people</a> tune into podcasts, and that number is rapidly growing (here’s looking at you true crime fans!)</p>
<p>And Spotify isn’t white noise—listeners choose audio over screens when they either can’t or don’t want to engage with TV, games, or movies.</p>
<p>Whether folks are cooking up a storm or tackling an important work task, they engage with the audio. That means advertisers have unparalleled access to a leaned-in audience throughout the day as opposed to other channels that serve as distractions for a limited amount of time.</p>
<h3>Ad-supported subscriber base is growing</h3>
<p>In Q1 2023, Spotify hit <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/813787/spotify-ad-supported-monthly-active-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">317 million</a> ad-supported monthly active users—a sharp increase from 295 million last year. With the streaming platform constantly adding new users to its ad-supported subscriber base, the audience of engaged listeners continues to grow.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-subscriber-growth.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - subscriber growth" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73583" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-subscriber-growth.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-subscriber-growth-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/813787/spotify-ad-supported-monthly-active-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<h3>You have the chance to connect with younger listeners</h3>
<p>Spotify’s recently launched “<a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-04-13/spotifys-new-publishing-tool-makes-it-easy-to-turn-broadcasts-into-podcasts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Broadcast-to-Podcast</a>” publishing tool makes it easy for radio broadcasters to turn existing content into on-demand podcasts. That means publishers can reach the <a href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/weekly-insights-11-30-22-am-fm-over-the-air-vs-streaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newer generations turning to digital radio</a> and advertisers can target more audiences on and off Spotify.</p>
<h3>Spotify offers more than digital audio</h3>
<p>Digital audio ads are great—we just established that. But capturing attention requires a multi-format play. And that’s perhaps one of the reasons why Spotify’s leading the pack in Dentsu’s Attention Economy study.</p>
<p>Spotify’s research has shown that combining audio and video ads has a significant brand impact. In fact, multiformat campaigns have a 90% increase in ad recall and more than double (<a href="https://www.nielsen.com/news-center/2018/nielsens-relationship-spotify-continues-grow-brand-effect-measurement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2.2X</a>) brand awareness.</p>
<h3>Spotify is constantly expanding its product offering</h3>
<p>From new dynamic ad formats to new ways to track ad performance, Spotify is constantly developing its offering for global advertisers.</p>
<p>For instance, the platform launched <a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/ad-experiences/podcast-ads-specs/">CTA cards for podcasts</a> in the US, increasing the number of places where listeners can click on them during and after an audio ad. This feature has boosted traffic to advertiser-specified URLs.</p>
<h3>Sonic branding might be the next big thing</h3>
<p>Although used <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/2022-03/power-of-you-ipsos.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 10%</a> of the time, brand assets that use sonic brand cues are more effective than other music or roping in celebrities.</p>

<p>Think about the tu-dum sound you hear when you load Netflix—that’s a great example of what a solid sonic identity can do for a brand. When that 3 second long sound didn’t work for theaters, they had Hans Zimmer create an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366371/netflix-sound-hans-zimmer-theaters-tadum-twenty-thousand-hertz-podcast-sound-design">extended version</a>.</p>

<p>While traditional jingles may be losing their appeal, there’s no denying that they worked.</p>
<p>And with brands trying to create a consistent <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/what-is-multichannel-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-channel presence</a> across social media, TV, streaming, and radio, sonic branding might be the new jingle.</p>

<h2>How to advertise on Spotify</h2>
<p>With Spotify Ad Studio, you can create an audio or a video (horizontal or vertical) ad.</p>
<p>Here’s how to use the self-serve ad manager, Spotify Ad Studio, to create an audio or video ad.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Create an account (if you have one already, skip this step)</h3>
<p>Make a <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free Spotify account</a>. Use Google, Facebook, or your email to sign up.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-create-account.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - create account homepage" width="497" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73584" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-create-account.jpg 497w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-create-account-480x579.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 497px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Once you’ve logged in, you will be able to access the <a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ad Studio</a>, which will allow you to create individual ads or complex campaigns that involve ad sets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-ad-studio-campaigns.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - campaigns page" width="936" height="549" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73585" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-ad-studio-campaigns.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-ad-studio-campaigns-480x282.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Step 2: Add campaign details</h3>
<p>Name your campaign and tell Spotify what you’re advertising.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-new-campaign.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - create campaign name" width="936" height="556" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73586" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-new-campaign.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-new-campaign-480x285.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Fill in the ad set name and declare an ad category (the ad category helps Spotify deliver relevant ads to listeners).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-ad-set-details.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - enter ad set details" width="936" height="534" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73587" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-ad-set-details.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-ad-set-details-480x274.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Step 3: Set your target audience</h3>
<p>Select the right location(s). You can choose specific regions or countries.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-audiences.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - specify audience" width="936" height="548" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73588" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-audiences.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-audiences-480x281.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you’re running a nationwide campaign, you can also add postal codes in bulk (up to 1,000 locations) by typing or copying and pasting them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-add-postal-codes.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - batch enter postal codes" width="520" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73589" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-add-postal-codes.jpg 520w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-add-postal-codes-480x554.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 520px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Choose the age group(s) and gender(s) you want to target.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-age-gender.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - choose age and gender of audience" width="936" height="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73590" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-age-gender.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-age-gender-480x256.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Narrow down the interests and behaviors of your audience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-interests-behaviors.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - include interests and behaviors" width="936" height="580" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73591" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-interests-behaviors.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-interests-behaviors-480x297.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>If you select no additional targeting, you will be able to reach the broadest audience. Selecting one of the other options will help you serve your ad to a more relevant segment. For instance, if you choose contextual playlists, your ad will only be played during specific activities when listeners play a themed playlist.</p>
<p>Next, choose the language you want to target.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-language.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - choose language for ads" width="936" height="274" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73592" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-language.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-language-480x141.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Select the platform(s) where you want to serve your ad.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-platforms.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - choose platform for ads" width="936" height="241" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73593" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-platforms.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-platforms-480x124.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Step 4: Choose the format and placement of the ad</h3>
<p>You have three formats to choose from: audio, horizontal, and vertical video. While Spotify recommends you choose the automatic placement, i.e., your ad will run across music and podcasts, you can opt to place your ad in music streams only.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-format-placement.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - specify format and placement of ad" width="936" height="465" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73594" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-format-placement.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-format-placement-480x238.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You also have control over whether you want to exclude your ads from playing during certain podcast episodes that may not align with your brand. Similarly, you can add topics that make sense for your brand values and offer <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">personalized experiences</a> to listeners.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-podcast-episode-topics.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - choose any podcast content controls" width="602" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73595" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-podcast-episode-topics.jpg 602w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-podcast-episode-topics-480x477.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 602px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Step 5: Create the ad schedule and set the budget</h3>
<p>You can choose to run the ad indefinitely or select a start and end date and time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-schedule-ad.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - schedule ad " width="936" height="417" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73596" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-schedule-ad.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-schedule-ad-480x214.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The minimum average daily budget is $15 and the minimum lifetime budget is $250. You can enter a custom amount. Based on the audience, Spotify can predict whether you’ll spend some or all of your budget.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-budget.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - choose budget" width="853" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73597" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-budget.jpg 853w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-budget-480x337.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 853px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Step 6: Choose a delivery objective<strong> </strong></h3>
<p>You can select one of three delivery goals for Spotify to prioritize: impressions, reach, or clicks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-objective.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - choose objective for ad" width="635" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73598" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-objective.jpg 635w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-objective-480x453.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 635px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You also get to set the frequency cap (how frequently the ad will appear per day, per week, and per month) and the bid cap.</p>
<p>Spotify offers recommendations for the bid amount based on similar audiences.</p>
<h3>Step 7: Create your ad</h3>
<p>Fill in the ad details like ad name, advertiser name, and tagline, and choose the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/13/call-to-action-examples">CTA</a>. Set the destination URL and tracking URL (optional).</p>
<p>You can see an example of what the ad preview looks like at this stage:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-ad-details.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - create your add" width="603" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73599" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-ad-details.jpg 603w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-ad-details-480x478.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 603px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Add a companion image that’ll appear while the ad plays and your logo (optional). These images should be in JPG or PNG format and at least 640 x 640 pixels.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-image-logo.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - add image and logo" width="739" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73600" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-image-logo.jpg 739w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-image-logo-480x390.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 739px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Here’s what the preview looks like when those images are uploaded:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-ad-preview.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - ad preview example" width="320" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73601" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-ad-preview.jpg 320w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-ad-preview-160x300.jpg 160w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></p>
<p>Since we chose audio as the ad format, we’ll show you the options you have:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-add-audio.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - add audio for ad" width="604" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73602" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-add-audio.jpg 604w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-add-audio-480x476.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 604px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The first option is pretty straightforward. You can upload your audio or choose one from the library.</p>
<p>But the “Create Audio” option is a game-changer for businesses. You don’t even need a script or an in-house voice actor. Spotify can write one for you and produce your ad in 2-4 business days.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-creative-brief.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - creative brief" width="321" height="599" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73603" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-creative-brief.jpg 321w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-creative-brief-161x300.jpg 161w" sizes="(max-width: 321px) 100vw, 321px" /></p>
<p>If you choose video as the ad format, you also get the option to enable viewability tracking thanks to third-party vendors along with the optional tracking URL.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-viewability-tracking.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - viewability tracking" width="936" height="491" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73604" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-viewability-tracking.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-viewability-tracking-480x252.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>You can use drag and drop the video to upload the content&#8211;no hidden bells and whistles there.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-upload-video.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - upload video ad" width="936" height="346" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73605" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-upload-video.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-upload-video-480x177.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Step 8: Add your business address and payment information</h3>
<p>Once you add this information, you can then submit your ad for approval.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-add-payment.jpg" alt="spotify advertising - how to run spotify ads - add business info and payment info" width="936" height="514" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73606" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-add-payment.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-setup-add-payment-480x264.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<div id="tips"></div>
<h2>Tips to tune into success with Spotify advertising</h2>
<p>Due to “the carryover effect,” Spotify listeners are just as engaged while listening to ads as they were while streaming music or binging on podcasts. <a href="https://storage.pardot.com/52662/1677552207ZGvhSQfc/Sonic_Science_US.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60%</a> of the ad engagement is carried over from what listeners consumed before.</p>
<p>In short, you’ve got a highly receptive audience that’s willing to engage with your ad. Apart from the usual advice&#8211;mention your brand, include a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/05/best-call-to-action-phrases">strong CTA</a>, and stay on message&#8211;here are some data-backed best practices you may want to use.</p>
<h3>Mix audio, video, and display</h3>
<p>Your best bet at holding your audience’s attention and making it count is to combine different ad formats for your Spotify advertising campaigns.</p>

<p><a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/news-and-insights/dentsu-research-attention-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dentsu’s study</a> has proven that Spotify’s ability to run ads in different formats yields those benchmark-breaking metrics.</p>
<h3>Don’t skimp on the ad creative</h3>
<p>Strong ad creative is the biggest lever you can pull when it comes to making an engaged audience convert. Dentsu’s data showed that a poor creative can cause a <a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/news-and-insights/dentsu-research-attention-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">17%</a> decline in ad recall.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-IN/ad-experiences/sponsored-sessions-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Spotify allows you to create compelling ads with free built-in creative tools like background music and 3D audio (AKA the surround sound effect) and deliver them in an engaging format like Homepage Takeover or Overlay.</p>
<h3>Let the genre guide you</h3>
<p>Since audio ads have a 55-70 word range, you have to be economical with your choice of words. You don’t want to sound rushed or breathless, so edit with a heavy hand.</p>
<p>Knowing your audience well can help with that. If you’re going to serve ads to sports fans, you might want to play up the energy and sprinkle in some sports metaphors. But if the goal is to get in front of an audience that prioritizes wellness, you want to adopt a calm, soothing tone. 73% of the Sonic Science study participants were willing to listen to an ad if the tone fits their current activity.</p>
<h3>Write for real people’s ears</h3>
<p>Your priority is to connect with real listeners. Remember not to let rigid brand guidelines eliminate the human element from your script.</p>
<p>Use contractions, colloquialisms, and hang up the grammarian hat for a while. Infuse the script with your personality, a little bit of humor, and bring that main character energy.</p>

<h2>Spotify advertising costs: How much do you have to invest?</h2>
<p>Now that you understand how to run Spotify ads, let’s talk about how much they’re going to cost you.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-ad-spending-audio-channels.jpg" alt="spotify advertising ad spending on audio channels" width="936" height="527" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73609" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-ad-spending-audio-channels.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spotify-advertising-ad-spending-audio-channels-480x270.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/amo/advertising/audio-advertising/digital-audio-advertising/united-states#ad-spending" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<p>While you can get started with the minimum daily budget is $15 and a lifetime minimum budget of $250 in the self-serve Ad Studio, here’s how the pricing works for all the models:</p>
<h3>Self-serve</h3>
<ul>
<li>Minimum lifetime spend: $250</li>
<li>Free access to background music, voice actors, and professional audio mixing.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s an auction for audio and video ads that are served while listeners stream music. If there’s more competition for your audience, you might have to place a more aggressive bid to effectively spend your budget.</p>
<p>Podcast ads, on the other hand, have fixed prices and aren’t part of the ad auction.</p>
<p>You can watch how the ad auction works <a href="https://youtu.be/oPzLoHn_h8w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Automated</h3>
<p>If you’re working with a DSP (demand-side platform), you can access Spotify inventory through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Private Marketplaces (PMPs) which have an auction-based model that allows for dynamic bidding, or…</li>
<li>Programmatic Guaranteed (PG) buys that have a fixed rate that you can discuss with a Spotify rep prior to launch.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Direct</h3>
<p>If you’re looking to create customized experiences, mix up the ad formats, or want a guaranteed inventory, you can speak to the Spotify team to set rates and campaign parameters. The pricing is based on the format, audience, and any add-ons you choose.</p>

<li>Ad played to X% (25%, 75%, or 100%)</li>
