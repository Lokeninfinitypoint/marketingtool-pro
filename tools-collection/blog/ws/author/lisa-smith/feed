<h2>14 local marketing trends and tactics for 2024</h2>
<p>“Local marketing in 2024 no longer means placing an ad in a local paper—although that can have its place,” said Magee Clegg, CEO of <a href="https://cleartailmarketing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cleartail Marketing</a>.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s more about focusing on strategies that emphasize long-term customer relationships, utilizing professional platforms and proactively managing your online reputation.”</p>
<p>Here are some <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/advertising-techniques">tactics</a>, trends, and ideas to help you build the most successful local marketing strategy for 2024.</p>
<div id="local-seo-optimization"></div>
<h3>1. Optimize your online presence for local SEO</h3>
<p>This isn’t necessarily a trend as Google Business Profiles have been around for 10 years (this year!), but it’s extremely important for any <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/15/local-marketing-ideas">local marketing</a> strategy. You still need to master the basics. This means <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/06/03/google-my-business-optimization">optimizing your Google Business Profile</a>, Apple Maps, and other local directories for local—and hyper-local—SEO.</p>
<p>“Ensuring your business appears in local search results, particularly your Google Business listing, can significantly increase visibility,” said Deepak Shukla, founder of SEO agency <a href="https://pearllemon.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pearl Lemon</a>. “In the post-pandemic era, where <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/online-presence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online presence</a> has become even more critical, this strategy is essential for attracting local customers.”</p>
<p><a href="https://localiq.com/blog/local-search-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Optimization tactics for local search include</a> the addition of hours, offerings, and reviews, which help <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/11/increase-conversion-rates">convert searchers</a> into customers, said Dan Dillon CEO of <a href="https://www.cleanitsupply.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CleanItSupply.com</a>.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/google-business-profile-example-dentist-boston.jpg" alt="example of an optimized google business profile from a dentist in boston" width="920" height="492" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71139" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/google-business-profile-example-dentist-boston.jpg 920w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/google-business-profile-example-dentist-boston-480x257.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 920px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This also helps businesses establish themselves as authoritative and build local trust, added Dmytro Sokhach, founder of digital marketing agency <a href="https://admixglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Admix Global</a>.</p>
<p>As “near me” searches remain popular—more than 60% of mobile searches have local intent, by some estimates—Ken Fortney, CEO of SEO firm <a href="https://www.thatlocalpack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">That Local Pack</a>, pointed to one New York restaurant, which saw a 270% increase in revenue in a single year by adopting an enhanced <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local SEO</a> strategy that included Google Business optimization, as well as customer reviews (more on that later) and location-specific menus.</p>
<p>“Consumers are increasingly turning to local search to fulfill their immediate needs, and local SEO is key in attracting these ready-to-convert customers,” Fortney said.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4cd.png" alt="📍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Are your listings optimized for local search? </strong>Find out with our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/free-business-listings-grader?cid=Web_WS_InContentTextLink_Freemium_Listings&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent"><strong>Free Business Listings Grader</strong></a><strong>!</strong></p>
<div id="voice-search-optimization"></div>
<h3>2. Don’t forget voice search optimization</h3>
<p>In addition to local SEO basics, businesses should also integrate natural language processing to capitalize on voice queries.</p>
<p>“This involves utilizing conversational, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/long-tail-keywords">long-tail keywords</a> in content optimization, leading to a broader range of search visibility and potential customer attraction,” Fortney said.</p>
<p>For example, instead of targeting &#8220;Italian restaurants,&#8221; businesses could use &#8220;family-friendly Italian restaurant in Boston.&#8221;</p>
<p>“This hyper-personalization targets the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/niche-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">niche audience</a> directly and increases conversion probability,” added Gianluca Ferruggia, general manager of B2B marketplace <a href="https://www.designrush.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DesignRush</a>.</p>
<p>And don’t forget <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/15/what-is-schema-markup">Schema markup</a>.</p>
<p>“Optimizing for local pack rankings with precise location-based keywords and building <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/localize-google-ads">localized</a> links from directory listings and community websites is key,” said Lyn Collanto, marketing specialist at SEO agency <a href="https://kbaweb.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KBA Web</a>. “As mobile and voice search continue to rise, enhancing on-site elements like click-to-call and direction links will also be impactful.”</p>
<div id="local-influencers"></div>
<h3>3. Tap into local influencers</h3>
<p>While the benefits of using influencers to connect with consumers is widely documented, collaborating with local influencers, which may have smaller audiences, can be a big boon to local marketing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/content-creators-influencer.png" alt="content creator - screenshot of an influencer's post" width="640" height="429" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75863" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/content-creators-influencer.png 640w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/content-creators-influencer-480x322.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 640px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>“Including local micro-influencers in marketing campaigns can yield positive results,” Ferruggia said. “Their niche, dedicated following helps generate trustworthy <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/26/word-of-mouth-marketing">word-of-mouth</a> in the respective community.”</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Looking for more ways to drive people to your site?

<div id="local-events"></div>
<h3>4. Host, sponsor, or attend local events</h3>
<p>In addition to local influencers, local events are a good strategy to think about.</p>
<p>Examples include hosting workshops or classes, such as a cake decorating tutorial at a bakery.</p>
<p>“These events attract potential customers and create a memorable experience associated with your brand,” said Randy VanderVaate, CEO of <a href="http://www.funeralfunds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Funeral Funds of America</a>.</p>
<p>“By partnering with local influencers and businesses and hosting or sponsoring local events, a company can effectively tap into the local audience,” Shukla said. “These strategies not only enhance community engagement but also foster a sense of solidarity and support, which is particularly valuable in the current times where there&#8217;s a strong desire for community connection.”</p>
<p>In fact, Dillon believes community partnerships will grow in importance as these events help foster trust and authenticity.</p>
<p>Geoff Cudd, founder of review site <a href="https://ddiy.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Don&#8217;t Do It Yourself</a>, agreed businesses that engage in local events, sponsor local teams or partner with other local businesses can see a boost in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/06/online-reputation-management">reputation</a> and loyalty.</p>
<p>“This approach not only increases brand visibility but also builds a strong local network,” he added.</p>
<p>That could even include a cross-promotional offer with another local business.</p>
<p>“Brands that engage in local community initiatives or partner with other local businesses to create combined offerings may witness higher customer loyalty and differentiate themselves in the bustling marketplace,” said Pavel Naydenov, head of marketing at software platform <a href="https://businessmap.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Businessmap</a>.</p>
<p>Per his figures, Oleg Segal, CEO of discount site <a href="https://deala.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DealA</a>, said he has seen a 45% increase in these local partnerships in recent months.</p>
<div id="reviews-and-online-reputation"></div>
<h3>5. Prioritize reviews</h3>
<p>Along the way, encourage customers to leave <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">online reviews</a> on platforms like Google and Yelp. A solid presence here can contribute to a successful local <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-strategy-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing strategy</a>.</p>
<p>That’s in part because local sentiment and word-of-mouth lives online now. And so it’s important to <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-respond-to-google-reviews-with-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">address both positive and negative reviews</a> instead of trying to bury the latter.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/google-review-response-example.webp" alt="example of negative google review response" width="936" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81267" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/google-review-response-example.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/google-review-response-example-480x231.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>“Actively listening, engaging positively, and addressing negative reviews is critical to maintaining community trust and loyalty,” said Iurii Nemtcev, CEO of <a href="https://biglab.ae/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Lab Digital Agency</a>.</p>
<div id="social-media-communities"></div>
<h3>6. Engage with social media communities</h3>
<p>In addition to advertising on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/social-media-strategy">social media</a>, local businesses can use these platforms to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/19/brand-community">drive community engagement</a>.</p>
<p>“Social media platforms are increasingly becoming local hubs,” Shukla said. “Engaging with the community by promoting local events, participating in local discussions, and showcasing community involvement can build a loyal local following.”</p>
<div id="linkedin"></div>
<h3>7. Don’t underestimate the power of LinkedIn</h3>
<p>While <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">social platforms</a> like Facebook and Instagram remain popular among local marketers—<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/facebook-ads-for-small-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and for good reasons</a>—Clegg called LinkedIn “a potent platform for local businesses looking to expand their reach.”</p>
<p>That’s in part because <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/25/optimize-linkedin-ads">LinkedIn</a> outreach can deliver enhanced results when combined with emails. For one client, Clegg added 400 emails per month and scheduled 40 qualified sales calls per month as a result of implementing this tactic.</p>
<div id="hyper-local-advertising"></div>
<h3>8. Run hyper-local advertising</h3>
<p>Beyond engaging communities on social media, tap into the power of these platforms to target your ads to local consumers.</p>
<p>“Platforms like Facebook and Instagram offer <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/13/facebook-ad-targeting-privacy-first-world">advanced targeting options</a> that allow businesses to reach potential customers in specific geographic areas,” Cudd said. “By creating localized content and ads, businesses can effectively engage with a community-focused audience.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/google-ads-for-real-estate-ab-test-example.webp" alt="google ads for real estate ab test example" width="936" height="567" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76253" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/google-ads-for-real-estate-ab-test-example.webp 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/google-ads-for-real-estate-ab-test-example-480x291.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An example of a localized ad vs. a generic ad for the same business.</em></p>
<p>The result is the personalized content consumers crave—and can reach potential customers with a high potential for engagement.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Want to learn about local ads on Google?

<div id="data-driven-hyper-local-targeting"></div>
<h3>9. Use data and analytics to create more powerful hyper-local targeting</h3>
<p>Hyper-local targeting will get a boost in 2024 thanks to more advanced data analytics.</p>
<p>“In 2024, the key is hyper-local targeting, using advanced data analytics to understand and engage with specific demographics within a community,” said Leena Sowambur, founder of Marcomms by Leena.</p>
<p>What’s more, the ability to combine <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/04/customer-segmentation-models">consumer data points</a>—such as shopping habits, online behavior and even political leanings—will fuel more personalized messaging.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re seeing an unprecedented emphasis on cross-sectional marketing,” she added. “This strategy allows for nuanced messaging that resonates deeply with diverse groups within a community.”</p>
<div id="video"></div>
<h3>10. Invest in video</h3>
<p>Local businesses that want to take their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-marketing-trends-2024">content marketing</a> efforts up a notch should consider video, which remains the format of choice across social media.</p>
<p>“This trend offers businesses new opportunities to creatively engage with their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audiences</a>, revolutionizing how they connect with viewers,” said Zain Bin Zameer, senior link-building expert at Technology Ally. “Whether through product demos, brand stories or educational tutorials, the impact of video content is set to reshape the marketing landscape for years to come.”</p>
<p>In addition, Dillon suggested small businesses experiment with formats like short-form or live videos to capitalize on platforms like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/12/14/tiktok-trend-discovery">TikTok</a> and Reels.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tiktok-trend-discovery-married-in-italy-trend.jpg" alt="tiktok trend discovery - example of business using tiktok trend" width="281" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-78535" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tiktok-trend-discovery-married-in-italy-trend.jpg 281w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tiktok-trend-discovery-married-in-italy-trend-141x300.jpg 141w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px" /></p>
<p>“These strategies will harness not only <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/digital-marketing-trends-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital trends</a> but also market shifts in consumer behavior and technological advancements,” he added.</p>
<div id="local-marketing-ai-tools"></div>
<h3>11. Use AI tools</h3>
<p>While the benefits of video content are well-documented, high-quality video isn’t always affordable.</p>
<p>However, thanks to the advent of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-tools-for-marketing-agency">AI tools</a>, we’re going to see further democratization of high-quality video content in 2024.</p>
<p>That’s according to Lucas Ochoa, CEO of <a href="https://www.runautomat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automat</a>, who said, “What used to be an expensive and exclusive process is becoming more accessible and affordable. This shift won&#8217;t just level the playing field for local businesses but will also usher in a fresh wave of creativity and personalization in marketing communications.”</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f916.png" alt="🤖" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Want to use AI the right way? <strong>Free download &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsiteAIinMarketingGuide.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_AIMarketing_Download">Emergency Guide to AI in Marketing</a></p>
<div id="diversified-local-content"></div>
<h3>12. Create diversified local content</h3>
<p>But geo-targeted content like emails and texts can also be powerful tools.</p>
<p>“Most importantly, producing consistent, high-quality local content tailored to the area and offering real value to nearby searchers is what can propel SEO success for local businesses in the ever-evolving local search landscape,” Collanto said. “Focusing initiatives around these types of local marketing strategies and trends will yield the best results.”</p>
<div id="learn-from-b2b-tactics"></div>
<h3>13. Learn from B2B tactics</h3>
<p>Even B2C brands will want to pay attention to this one.</p>
<p>As consumer behavior continues to go digital and data-driven marketing tactics proliferate, local advertisers have an opportunity to embrace <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/b2b-marketing-trends-2024">B2B marketing strategies</a> to expand their reach.</p>
<p>“The concept takes a bit of a pivot from traditional B2C strategies—it views every local customer as a potential business partner,” Clegg said. “In practice, we helped our clients build stronger relationships with local customers and offered them value beyond a single transaction, converting them into long-term advocates for the business.”</p>
<div id="personalize-content-and-promotions"></div>
<h3>14. Personalize and segment content and promotions</h3>
<p>Finally, brands that sell products online have an opportunity in what Sunny Zheng, senior manager at cosmetic brand <a href="https://www.tyoemcosmetic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tengyu</a>, called “personalized local ecommerce.”</p>
<p>By creating web pages with content and deals specifically for target regions via its Regional Specials project, Tengyu netted 2000 additional online sales in three months.</p>
<p>“It shows how much people appreciate content that feels personally relevant to them,” Zheng said.</p>

<h2>2024 digital marketing trends and predictions, according to the experts</h2>
<p>To best understand the most important digital marketing trends that will impact businesses and customers in 2024, we asked the experts to share how they predict marketing will evolve this year along with some tips to keep up.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f331.png" alt="🌱" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Download our <a href="https://marketing.localiq.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite7StepstoGrowthStrategy.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_GrowthStrategy_Download">free, editable growth strategy template</a> to walk through seven simple steps for creating the right plan to grow your business this year.</p>
<div id="more-personalized-marketing"></div>
<h3>1. Marketing will become even more personalized</h3>
<p>Among the digital marketing trends expected to accelerate in 2024 is the movement toward not just personalization, but hyper-personalization, thanks in part to new AI tools.</p>
<p>That runs the gamut from content to product recommendations and user experience.</p>
<p>“AI and machine learning…will be used not only to analyze consumer behavior but also to predict future trends and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/personalized-marketing" rel="noopener">personalize marketing</a> efforts dynamically,” said Michael Schmied, lead financial consultant at <a href="https://krediteschweiz.ch/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kredite Schweiz</a>. “Expect more sophisticated <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/05/generative-ai-in-digital-marketing" rel="noopener">AI-driven content creation tools</a>, customer service <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/chatbot-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chatbots</a>, and predictive analytics.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/marketing-channels-live-chat-example.png" alt="marketing channels - example of live chat" width="310" height="559" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73301" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/marketing-channels-live-chat-example.png 310w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/marketing-channels-live-chat-example-166x300.png 166w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px" /></p>
<p>This, said freelance SEO specialist <a href="https://ph.linkedin.com/in/linisseve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seve Paulo Linis</a>, will help businesses engage audiences more effectively.</p>
<p>“In 2024, digital marketing strategies are likely to leverage AI to generate content that is not just tailored to specific demographic segments but to individual user preferences and behaviors,” added Rachit Jawa, co-founder of <a href="http://www.miscgyan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MiscGyan</a>.</p>
<p>“This means content that adapts in real-time based on user interaction, providing a highly personalized experience that boosts engagement and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/11/increase-conversion-rates" rel="noopener">conversion rates</a>.”</p>
<div id="multimodal-ai-will-impact-search-results"></div>
<h3>2. Multimodal AI will change search results</h3>
<p>For his part, Mike Grehan, CEO of <a href="https://chelseadigital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chelsea Digital</a>, anticipates even more personalization in search engine results pages (SERPs).</p>
<p>That’s because not all the world’s information is currently on the World Wide Web—and search engines like Google can’t crawl a lot of information that is online. Because large language models base their results on crawled content, they, too, have been limited in their inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>However, moving forward, Grehan expects <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ai-marketing-trends-2024#:~:text=7.-,More%20use%20of%20multimodal%20AI,-Multimodal%20AI%20combines" rel="noopener">AI will open up multimodal sources of input</a> like digital assistants—and even images and videos—for even more personalized responses from search engines.</p>
<p>“It could be text, but could also be spoken word, a personalized video created in real-time, or maybe even just music,” Grehan said. “It all depends on the characteristics of the information needed and the most appropriate content experience to match it.”</p>
<p>In addition, he expects organic results to become less text-based and more visual—including the addition of augmented reality, which will enable what Grehan called “outside the browser experiences.”</p>

<div id="local-marketing-to-grow-in-importance"></div>
<h3>3. Local marketing will continue to grow in importance</h3>
<p>Alongside more personalized experiences, marketers anticipate <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/local-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more localized efforts</a> as well.</p>
<p>“Brands will focus on creating highly tailored experiences and content that resonate with specific local demographics,” Schmied said.</p>
<p>Md Tajuddin Sadique, CTO of Mediainfo7.com, agreed, calling it a “glocal approach” when brands tailor their messages to resonate with local communities while retaining a global brand identity.</p>
<p>“Think localized influencer partnerships, hyper-relevant <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/types-of-social-media-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media content</a>, and community-driven initiatives that address local needs,” he said.</p>
<p>“Imagine a global clothing brand collaborating with local designers to create culturally inspired collections or a fast food chain launching menu items unique to specific cities. This focus on hyper-local relevance will build deeper connections and cultivate brand loyalty beyond national borders.”</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This restaurant opened a Dallas Cowboys-themed location in the Dallas area to appeal to its local customers.</em></p>
<div id="businesses-launch-more-immersive-experiences"></div>
<h3>4. Businesses will launch more immersive experiences</h3>
<p>In a similar vein, expect to see more immersive experiences from brands in 2024.</p>
<p>That includes virtual environments like the metaverse for more interactive experiences, as well as more AR and VR in marketing campaigns for more immersive storytelling.</p>
<p>“Brace yourselves for a seamless merger of digital and physical realms,” said Neha Gharpande, digital marketing professional at <a href="https://aristasystems.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arista Systems</a>. “Augmented reality will play a pivotal role, allowing consumers to virtually experience products before making a purchase. Marketers will need to explore creative ways to leverage AR for immersive brand interactions.”</p>
<p>Jawa, too, anticipates a “surge in AR-driven campaigns.”</p>
<p>“This technology will not only enhance customer engagement but also provide more detailed data on customer interactions, which can be used to further refine marketing strategies,” he added.</p>
<div id="marketers-become-more-transparent"></div>
<h3>5. Marketers will have to become more transparent</h3>
<p>With 2024 bringing the long-awaited <a href="https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/blog/cookie-countdown-2023oct#:~:text=To%20facilitate%20testing%2C%20Chrome%20has,UK's%20Competition%20and%20Markets%20Authority." target="_blank" rel="noopener">end of third-party cookies</a>, consumer data and privacy will be top of mind as well—which means even more emphasis on first-party data collection and the continued growth of retail media platforms.</p>
<p>“With heightened concerns about data privacy, marketers will face increasing pressure to prioritize user data protection,” Gharpande said. “Adhering to stringent <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/22/customer-data-privacy" rel="noopener">data regulations</a> and implementing robust security measures will be imperative to foster trust with consumers.”</p>
<p>It may also include the addition of blockchain technology for additional transparency and security—particularly in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/programmatic-advertising">programmatic advertising</a> and to combat ad fraud, Schmied added.</p>
<p>In addition, Sadique expects to see more from the data detox movement, which asks brands to “prioritize trust through <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ethical data collection</a>, clear consent mechanisms, and user-centric personalization.”</p>
<p>“Imagine a world where targeted ads are based on preferences explicitly shared by users, rather than shadowy inferences from their browsing history,” he added. “This shift necessitates a creative approach to understanding audiences, leveraging declared interests, and opting in [to] data instead of hidden algorithms.”</p>
<div id="consumers-to-seek-value-oriented-businesses"></div>
<h3>6. Consumers will seek value-oriented businesses</h3>
<p>Another ongoing digital marketing trend expected to retain momentum is a focus on consumer values.</p>
<p>“As societal consciousness continues to grow, consumers will demand more transparency and ethical practices from brands,” Gharpande said. “Digital marketers will need to champion sustainability and authenticity, weaving these values into their campaigns to establish meaningful connections with conscious consumers.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/earth-day-campaign-example.jpg" alt="example of cause-based marketing campaign on instagram" width="664" height="440" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79429" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/earth-day-campaign-example.jpg 664w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/earth-day-campaign-example-480x318.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Schmied agreed, noting, “Digital marketing campaigns that highlight a brand’s commitment to sustainability and social responsibility will likely resonate more with audiences.”</p>
<div id="social-shopping-to-take-off"></div>
<h3>7. Social shopping will take off (even more!)</h3>
<p>Finally, it has taken some time for social commerce to take off in the US, but social media darling TikTok may finally have cracked the code.</p>
<p>According to Toccara Karizma, CEO of <a href="https://www.karizmamarketing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karizma Marketing</a>, TikTok social commerce sales hit $53.1 billion in 2023, which is up 34%.</p>
<p>“This growth highlights the platform&#8217;s potential as a lucrative <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/marketing-101" rel="noopener">digital marketing strategy</a> for ecommerce brands in 2024, especially when combined with influencer marketing,” she added.</p>
<p>In other words, brands that feature their products on TikTok Shop can work with micro-influencers to extend their reach.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shoppable-tiktok-ads-example.jpg" alt="shoppable tiktok ads example" width="664" height="419" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79427" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shoppable-tiktok-ads-example.jpg 664w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shoppable-tiktok-ads-example-480x303.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Gharpande agreed we’ll see social media platforms evolve into full-fledged shopping destinations in 2024.</p>
<p>“The integration of ecommerce features directly into social apps will redefine the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/25/social-shopping" rel="noopener">online shopping experience</a>,” she said. “Marketers should capitalize on these trends by creating seamless shopping journeys within social ecosystems.”</p>
<p>Sadique also expects to see conversational commerce grow thanks to platforms like Shopify and Instagram.</p>
<p>“Imagine browsing for a new outfit through WhatsApp messages or customizing your dream vacation via voice commands,” he said. “In 2024, expect brands to leverage conversational interfaces for frictionless transactions, personalized recommendations, and on-demand customer support.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a March 2023<a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-Age-of-AI-Has-Begun" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> blog post</a>, Microsoft founder Bill Gates described ChatGPT as “the most important advance in technology since the graphical user interface” more than 40 years prior.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/chatgpt-marketing-limitations.png" alt="how to use chatgpt for small business marketing - chatgpt limitations" width="720" height="431" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70681" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/chatgpt-marketing-limitations.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/chatgpt-marketing-limitations-480x287.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>He predicts vast changes in work, education, travel, healthcare, and communication as a result.</p>
<p>The rapid evolution is no less profound for marketers. In just a few short months, the AI-powered tool has found use cases for everything from PPC to SMS marketing and much, much more.</p>
<p>So what does the future hold for the teams tasked with creating the communications that sell our products and services? Will ChatGPT upend the entire marketing industry? Or will its lofty expectations return to earth, leaving it as another useful, but not world-beating, tool like programmatic advertising?</p>
<p>To get a little clarity among the buzz, we asked more than 20 experts for their insights into how ChatGPT will influence four areas of concern for marketers. Here’s what they told us.</p>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><h3>Table of contents</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="#marketing">How ChatGPT will impact marketing</a></li>
<li><a href="#small">How ChatGPT will impact small business marketing</a></li>

<li><a href="#search">How ChatGPT will impact Google Search</a></li>
</ul></div></div>
<div id="marketing"></div>
<h2>How ChatGPT will impact marketing</h2>
<p>Marketers who adopt ChatGPT will soon see sweeping changes in the words, data, and processes they use. Here are some of the most important ways experts predict ChatGPT will impact general marketing.</p>
<h3>Accelerate the content pipeline</h3>
<p>First up is content, which ChatGPT can quickly create to help marketers execute campaigns more efficiently.</p>
<p>This includes blog content, as well as <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/engaging-posts-on-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media posts</a> (although we caution against using it to write your blog content&#8211;more on that later).</p>
<p>“The best part? It won&#8217;t replace you, but rather work alongside you, sort of like a marketing assistant,” added Hayley Mollett, marketing coordinator at IT services firm<a href="https://better-it.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Better-IT</a>.</p>
<p>However, Tasos Banioras, digital marketing manager at digital marketing agency<a href="https://tab.gr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Tab.gr</a>, warned marketers must still apply critical thinking when evaluating <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/ai-content-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI-generated content</a> and ideas.</p>
<p>“Otherwise, every marketer will end up with the same or similar ideas,” he said.</p>
<p>Instead, marketers should think of ChatGPT as a supplementary tool for content creation. By using ChatGPT to source ideas and inspiration, marketers can make sure their content is helpful, unique, and human.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-impact-ideation.png" alt="" width="893" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-72999 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-impact-ideation.png 893w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-impact-ideation-480x323.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 893px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>Make data and analytics more useful</h3>
<p>Next, ChatGPT’s ability to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/01/07/content-marketing-analytics">analyze data and generate insights</a> will be incredibly useful for marketing teams.</p>
<p>“It can help identify trends, predict consumer behavior, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">personalize marketing messages</a> to a degree that was previously impossible,” said Kacper Rafalski, demand generation team leader at the digital consultancy<a href="http://netguru.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Netguru</a>.</p>
<p>Carlos Barros, director of marketing at POS vendor<a href="http://eposnow.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Epos Now</a>, agreed, noting ChatGPT may be able to provide even more insights about a brand’s products and services—while Chris Morris, founder of digital marketing agency<a href="http://www.shoosocialmedia.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Shoo Social Media</a>, pointed out it can analyze customer data like purchase history, browsing behavior, and demographics to generate personalized recommendations.</p>
<p>It’s also a useful market research tool.</p>
<p>“ChatGPT can analyze customer feedback and social media sentiment to help businesses gain insights into consumer behavior and market trends,” Morris added.</p>
<h3>Improve the customer  experience</h3>
<p>What’s more, Marc Hardgrove, CEO of SEO platform<a href="http://thehoth.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> The Hoth</a>, noted the <a href="https://www.wordstream.co">AI tool</a> allows marketers to create<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/chatbots" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> customized chatbots</a>, which will change the way brands communicate with customers. That includes the automation of brand responses to basic inquiries and requests.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ChatGPT-impact-NLP-diagram.jpg" alt="Diagram showing flow of information to and from marketing channels and AI" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-73000 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ChatGPT-impact-NLP-diagram.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ChatGPT-impact-NLP-diagram-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.wizeline.com/chatbots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Source</a></em></p>
<p>“With its ability to generate human-like responses, ChatGPT can help businesses engage with their customers in real-time, provide personalized recommendations, and offer a more seamless customer experience,” added Rahul Vij, CEO of digital marketing agency<a href="https://www.webspero.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> WebSpero Solutions</a>.</p>
<p>This could improve customer satisfaction and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/03/09/customer-retention-strategies">retention</a>, leading to increased sales, noted Dmytro Sokhach, founder of business development firm<a href="http://admixglobal.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Admix Global</a>.</p>
<h3>End repetitive tasks</h3>
<p>In a similar vein, ChatGPT can simplify additional routine tasks in sales and marketing—like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/09/17/local-lead-generation-strategies">lead generation</a> and nurturing—as well as <a href="https://localiq.com/products/social-media-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media management</a>.</p>
<p>This, noted Alexander Hollingsworth, SEO marketing associate at digital agency<a href="http://oyova.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Oyova</a>, “[frees] up time for marketers to focus on more strategic initiatives.”</p>
<div id="small"></div>
<h2>How ChatGPT will impact small business marketing</h2>
<p>For <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/03/06/how-to-use-chatgpt-for-small-business-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small businesses in particular</a>, ChatGPT will be a welcome tool as these brands generally have more limited resources.</p>
<p>In fact, Milosz Krasinski, managing director of web consulting firm<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/chilli-fruit-web-consulting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Chilli Fruit</a>, called it “a tool to help small business owners cut through the noise and stand out in a crowded digital space.”</p>
<p>Here are some specific ways experts predict ChatGPT will impact small business marketing.</p>
<h3>Grow through automation</h3>
<p>Similar to marketing overall, ChatGPT can help small businesses automate routine tasks so they can focus on marketing, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/20/product-positioning">product development</a>, and strategic planning.</p>
<p>“By using ChatGPT, SMBs can not only improve their operational efficiency but also enhance their customer experience and drive growth in their business,” Banioras said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chatgpt-impact-example-chatbot.png" alt="ChatGPT prompt asking for ChatGPT reply ideas " width="720" height="425" class="aligncenter wp-image-73001 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chatgpt-impact-example-chatbot.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chatgpt-impact-example-chatbot-480x283.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>No surprises here—this also includes customer service, which helps brands quickly answer questions and build relationships.</p>
<p>“ChatGPT can be particularly beneficial for small businesses as it can help them level the playing field with larger competitors by providing a high-quality customer experience at a lower cost,” Vij said. “By using ChatGPT, small businesses can simplify many of their customer service interactions, freeing up time and resources that can be used to focus on other areas of the business.”</p>
<h3>Learn about customers at scale</h3>
<p>ChatGPT can also analyze consumer data, which allows small businesses to better understand their customers.</p>
<p>“By knowing what content resonates with customers, small businesses can create more effective marketing strategies,” Krasinski added.</p>
<p>This can be helpful when identifying your target audience, personalizing your marketing messages, or looking for new marketing opportunities. But it shouldn’t be the only resource you rely on when it comes to learning about your customers. For now, ChatGPT doesn’t include information <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/openai-chatgpt-update/476116/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">past 2021</a>, so it could be missing a larger piece of the picture when it comes to recommendations or ideas.

<h2>How ChatGPT will impact content marketing</h2>
<p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/06/13/content-creation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content creation</a>, Michelle Burson, president of digital marketing agency<a href="http://marcomm.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> MarComm</a>, suggested likening ChatGPT to the printing press.</p>
<p>“Many believed it would put printers out of business, but it didn’t,” she said. “Rather, the printing press enabled printers to work faster, more efficiently and at a lower cost.”</p>
<p>With that in mind, here are some ways the experts anticipate ChatGPT will impact content marketing.</p>
<h3>Foster ideation</h3>
<p>While marketers may struggle to come up with ideas and keywords on their own—and therefore miss out on traffic and leads from resulting content—ChatGPT is a useful tool for <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/04/unique-blog-ideas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brainstorming new topics</a>, as well as gathering data.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chatgpt-impact-example-research.png" alt="ChatGPT prompt and response asking how Google auction works" width="720" height="818" class="aligncenter wp-image-73002 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chatgpt-impact-example-research.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chatgpt-impact-example-research-480x545.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In addition, ChatGPT can identify gaps in existing content, Rafalski added.</p>
<p>“Trawling through pages of information is time-consuming,” Mollett noted. “Typing in a subject, some key points and facts, and ChatGPT bringing up all the information needed is just genius.”</p>
<p>But again, it’s important to fact-check ChatGPT as the information is not going to be the most up-to-date. ChatGPT and other AI tools should be used as a starting point to build on.</p>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2734.png" alt="✴" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Use our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool" class="waffle-rich-text-link">Free Keyword Tool </a>to find high-value keywords for your account!</div></div>
<h3>Publish content faster</h3>
<p>ChatGPT can help marketers generate content ideas quickly and efficiently. This runs the gamut from <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing">social media updates</a> to product descriptions and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/monthly-email-newsletter-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email newsletters</a>—and all in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-impact-promotional-email.png" alt="ChatGPT prompt and response asking to write a promotional email" width="1046" height="1098" class="aligncenter wp-image-73003 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-impact-promotional-email.png 1046w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-impact-promotional-email-980x1029.png 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-impact-promotional-email-480x504.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1046px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>“ChatGPT&#8217;s consolidated responses and speed are a real advantage when it comes to creating helpful content in a more efficient way,” said Aissa Djalo of the creative agency<a href="http://tinygiantsco.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Tiny Giants</a>.</p>
<p>ChatGPT can also quickly create content tailored to specific audiences.</p>
<p>“By feeding ChatGPT with information about a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a> or customer segment, it can generate content that is more relevant and engaging to that specific group,” said Zaira Céspedes, SEO executive at the digital marketing agency<a href="https://ga.agency/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> GA Agency</a>.</p>
<p>And, by using ChatGPT for content, brands can maintain a more consistent<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/24/editorial-calendar"> publishing schedule</a>—and establish themselves as thought leaders, Morris added.</p>
<h3>Require the right prompts</h3>
<p>The key is using the<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/08/chatgpt-prompts"> right ChatGPT prompts</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chatgpt-impact-example-prompt.jpg" alt="chatGPT prompt example" width="936" height="329" class="aligncenter wp-image-73004 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chatgpt-impact-example-prompt.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chatgpt-impact-example-prompt-480x169.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>That’s according to V. Michael Santoro, founder of online branding firm<a href="http://brandvelocity.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Brand Velocity</a>, who said users must follow a process much like optimizing for search results.</p>
<p>“What&#8217;s important is to instruct ChatGPT to produce the content in the correct voice and writing style based on the brand and messaging,” he added. “Many new ChatGPT users just request this type of information with, for example, ‘Write a social media post about ____________.’ While the content may be accurate, it may not align with how you want your brand to be perceived in the marketplace.”</p>
<h3>Be aware of challenges</h3>
<p>Another important takeaway is to adopt ideas from ChatGPT—but not copy and paste them.</p>
<p>That’s because ChatGPT may provide the same information to other users, which could result in plagiarism or copyright issues, Santoro said.</p>
<p>In addition, users must always double-check ChatCPT-generated facts with reliable sources.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s important to note ChatGPT is still a machine learning model, so human oversight and editing are still crucial to ensure the generated content is accurate, appropriate, and consistent with a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">brand&#8217;s voice and values</a>,” Céspedes said.</p>
<p>Or, as Vladislav Podolyako, CEO of email platform<a href="http://folderly.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Folderly</a>, put it, there are no guarantees ChatGPT-generated answers do not include factual errors.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s not a problem when you ask what cake recipe tastes better,” he said. “But the issue becomes critical when one of the recipes contains rat poison instead of sugar.”</p>
<p>That means websites with proven information users can trust will be rewarded by search engines.</p>
<h3>Support human writers</h3>
<p>There’s also the issue of whether ChatGPT will eventually replace human writers.</p>
<p>For her part, Burson said ChatGPT can’t replace the human experience—or human capabilities.</p>
<p>The prevailing wisdom, however, seems to be to treat ChatGPT as a companion tool.</p>
<p>“While too much automation can weaken the human touch that attracts customers, cleverly incorporating it into an overall marketing strategy stands to pay dividends and distinguish brands from their competition,” said Jason Tan, founder of LinkedIn assistant<a href="http://engage-ai.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Engage AI</a>.</p>
<p>“Marketers have the exciting opportunity to unlock AI&#8217;s potential, but understanding what works best requires striking a balance between utilizing technology and allowing human ingenuity to take centerstage.”</p>
<div id="search"></div>
<h2>How ChatGPT will impact Google search</h2>
<p>Finally, expect to see big changes in both <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/19/google-search-generative-experience">how search engines rank content</a>—and how brands optimize for SERPs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chatgpt-impact-example-GSE.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Google's new Generative Search Experience" width="811" height="599" class="aligncenter wp-image-73005 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chatgpt-impact-example-GSE.jpg 811w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chatgpt-impact-example-GSE-480x355.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 811px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://blog.google/products/search/generative-ai-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></em></p>
<h3>Generative content may be penalized</h3>
<p>Marketers who use AI-generated content should be aware it may hurt their rankings as Google can detect this content—and penalize websites accordingly, said Tatevik Baghdasaryan, content marketer with AI firm<a href="https://www.friday.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> SuperAnnotate</a>.</p>
<p>Luke Glassford, marketing director of consulting firm<a href="http://gambitpartners.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Gambit Partners</a>, more or less agreed, noting ChatGPT will result in automated content produced on a massive scale.</p>
<p>“How well Google is able to identify and reward real content and discourage the use of AI content over the next year will likely shape the future of the web,” he added.</p>
<p>If the search giant is not able to stem the tide of AI content in SERPs, Glassford expects the quality of content on the Internet will continue to deteriorate.</p>
<h3>Expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness become paramount</h3>
<p>Instead of simply publishing AI-produced content, brands should focus on expert-level niche-specific content that builds trust and authority with Google.</p>
<p>“Google wants companies to build topical authority in order to rank content,” Santoro said. “Topical authority means producing an extensive amount of content to cover the <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/niche-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">niche</a> and achieve authority.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chatgpt-impact-Webmed-citation.jpg" alt="screeshot of a webmd article highlighting the technical reviewer" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-73006 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chatgpt-impact-Webmed-citation.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chatgpt-impact-Webmed-citation-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This can help brands boost their rankings. So will using ChatGPT as a data analysis tool to optimize content.</p>
<p>“ChatGPT can help businesses <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/05/seo-trends">optimize their content for search engines</a> and even generate meta descriptions and title tags,” Hollingsworth added.</p>
<p>Rajan Ad, CEO of research hub<a href="https://www.hoffnmazor.com/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Magical Media Studio</a>, noted <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/09/05/chatgpt-seo">adding ChatGPT to his SEO</a> strategy has helped boost rankings by 25%.</p>
<p>According to Vij, ChatGPT can also help optimization efforts by “providing natural and conversational responses that match users&#8217; search queries.”</p>
<p>Using responses from ChatGPT can open up opportunities for optimization when coupled with the expertise and authority of human writers.</p>
<h3>Ranking factors get reshuffled</h3>
<p>Podolyako noted Google uses the depth of topical coverage and the amount of content, entities, and interconnections as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/09/09/google-ranking-factors">ranking favor</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ChatGPT-impact-ranking-factors.jpg" alt="Pie chart showing common Google search ranking factors" width="936" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-73007 size-full" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ChatGPT-impact-ranking-factors.jpg 936w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ChatGPT-impact-ranking-factors-480x308.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>“However, the affordability of content will inevitably lead to an inflation of these factors as they will become so easy to manipulate,” he added. “This is why I believe Google will shift towards authority as a ranking factor.”</p>
<p>That means the quality and quantity of backlinks and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/04/12/local-citations">citations</a> will be much more important going forward.</p>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>

<h3>Improved understanding of user intent</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, ChatGPT can help brands and Google alike better understand a user’s <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/11/03/optimizing-images-for-commercial-intent-searches">intent behind each search</a>—and deliver more relevant results (or rank better for said queries).</p>
<p>“Google search algorithms are already using AI technologies to deliver more relevant and personalized search results,” said Gavin Duff, head of digital at digital agency the<a href="https://www.friday.ie/"> Friday Agency</a>. “ChatGPT and other AI technologies can potentially enhance the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/05/19/google-search-generative-experience">search experience</a> further by delivering more accurate and personalized results.”</p>
<h2>The expert take on ChatGPT in Marketing</h2>
<p>There’s too much unsettled dust to know the full impact AI tools like ChatGPT will have on marketing. But if you listen to the people immersed in the evolution, a few themes take shape:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automation is an immediate and important use case for ChatGPT.</li>
<li>ChatGPT has several uses in content creation, but always keep an eye on what it suggests.</li>
<li>Google is leveraging AI to improve the search experience but may penalize its use in content.</li>
<li>You can use ChatGPT to automate some of the customer experience, but don’t expect it to replace real human interactions.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In case you missed it, we covered some of <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/2023-digital-marketing-trends/">the top digital marketing trends of 2023</a>, which will include a mix of both familiar tactics and emerging technologies and strategies.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s blockchain, AR/VR, live streaming, short-form video, and more. Many of these trends have already made their debut in previous years but are picking up momentum and evolving in 2023. So in this post, we&#8217;re going to take a deeper dive into the patterns within these trends and how they will influence marketers throughout the year.</p>
<h2>2023 digital marketing trends &amp; predictions, according to experts</h2>
<p>To get a well-rounded perspective on how the 2023 digital marketing trends will impact consumers, marketers, and brands,  we came up with some key questions and interviewed marketers, advertisers, and business owners across verticals. They include:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#tiktok">How will social platforms adapt to TikTok?</a></li>

<li><a href="#supply">Will we get a handle on the supply chain?</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at what they said.<br />
<a id="tiktok"></a></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How will social platforms adapt to TikTok?</span></h2>
<p>Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, right?</p>
<h3>1. Some social platforms will imitate or partner with it</h3>
<p>Six-year-old TikTok is one of the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/11/most-popular-social-media-platforms">most popular social media platforms</a> in the world with more than one billion monthly active users. It’s especially popular with consumers born between 1997 and 2012, who are collectively known as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/09/gen-z-stats">Gen Z</a>.</p>
<p>As this generation grows in spending power, other social platforms are scrambling to keep up—and to stay relevant.</p>
<p>Their most likely tactic in 2023 is imitation.</p>
<p>For her part, Tetiana Sira, senior digital marketing executive at <a href="http://energycasino.com/">Energy Casino</a>, noted social media platforms have already responded by either copying TikTok outright, such as <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/16/tiktok-vs-instagram-reels-ads">Instagram with Reels</a>, or by implementing more vertical videos, like Pinterest and Twitter.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2023-digital-marketing-trends-pinterest-tiktok.png" alt="2023 digital marketing trends - pinterest becoming more tiktok-like" width="720" height="457" class="size-full wp-image-69693 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2023-digital-marketing-trends-pinterest-tiktok.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2023-digital-marketing-trends-pinterest-tiktok-480x305.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/pinterest-gets-more-tiktok-like-with-a-watch-tab-for-videos-announces-20m-in-creator-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>“There&#8217;s clearly a much higher effort put into video consumption and trying to make it as seamless as possible,” she said.</p>
<p>Shahnawaz Sadique, a blogger at <a href="https://commonstupidman.com/">CommonStupidMan.com</a>, however, noted social platforms may also partner with TikTok to gain access to its content and users—or even acquire TikTok or similar platforms outright.</p>
<p>But, according to Carly Campbell, a blogger at <a href="https://mommyonpurpose.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mommy On Purpose</a>, there’s more to TikTok’s success than just short-form videos. It also has an easy-to-navigate interface and “intense focus” on user-generated content. These elements have helped the platform stand out and allowed it to create an engaged community.</p>
<p>“To effectively challenge TikTok, other social platforms will need to mimic the same user experience that has made it so popular,” she added.</p>
<h3>2. Others will distinguish themselves</h3>
<p>That being said, there are several ways social platforms could also distinguish themselves from TikTok in 2023.</p>
<p>One is by focusing on other types of content, such as long-form videos or live streaming, Sadique said.</p>
<p>Another is investing in AI to improve video capabilities and generate more engaging content, added Jessica Shee, manager at <a href="https://iboysoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iBoysoft</a>.</p>
<p>Campbell pointed to Snapchat, which is focusing on messaging.</p>
<p>“Similarly, Facebook is focusing heavily on its gaming and group features, which can also be seen as a way to set itself apart,” she added.</p>
<p>What’s more, Averi Melcher, owner of <a href="http://averimelcher.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OSO Content</a>, said platforms may re-evaluate their creator monetization strategies to better compete with the TikTok Creator Fund, which compensates users who generate <em>at least 100,000 authentic video views monthly,</em> to encourage creators to stay on their platforms as well.</p>
<p>“We are seeing this with Instagram subscriptions, Facebook Reels, Pinterest&#8217;s beta program, and YouTube Shorts,” Melcher said. “If these platforms are able to incentivize and better reward creators, I think they will successfully gain back some market share.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/digital-marketing-trends-2023-instagram-subscriptions.png" alt="2023 digital marketing trends - instagram subscribe feature" width="230" height="458" class=" wp-image-69689 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/digital-marketing-trends-2023-instagram-subscriptions.png 450w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/digital-marketing-trends-2023-instagram-subscriptions-151x300.png 151w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://creators.instagram.com/earn-money/subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>In addition, Melcher said it’s possible social platforms may improve their creator campaign attribution models or even build out native communities to connect people with brands—and therefore better ways to monetize their content.<br />

<h3>3. The advantages will abound&#8230;</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/25/ai-content-generators">AI content generation</a> started to go mainstream in 2022—and it will play an important role in marketing in the year to come.</p>
<p>For starters, there’s potential for AI content generation as a <strong>brainstorming tool</strong> for marketers.</p>
<p>“At <a href="https://delightfulads.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delightful Ads</a>, we are already using it as a starting point for creating assets needed for our clients’ advertising campaigns—such as ad copy, headlines, hooks, graphics and even videos,” said digital ads strategist Jenn Martin. “AI offers new ideas and angles that we may not have thought of on our own.”</p>
<p>AI will also be increasingly used to create content tailored to specific audiences. That means taking data like demographics, past purchases, interests, and needs into account, added blog coach <a href="https://beccaklein.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Becca Klein</a>.</p>
<p>“[The resulting content] could include personalized emails or targeted ads that would be more tailored to the individual needs of their customers,” Campbell added. “As they become increasingly good at utilizing natural language processing, marketers will be able to develop more dynamic and engaging campaigns.”</p>

<p>As a result, <strong>relevance and effectiveness will also increase</strong>.</p>
<p>And, with better content, brands are better poised to win market share.</p>
<p>“With [the support of AI tools], content can be kept at a high standard over time and the brand&#8217;s reputation may be protected,” said Peter Drow, head of marketing at <a href="https://www.nccuttingtools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nccttingtools</a>. “Establishing a name for yourself in the marketplace is a surefire way to give yourself an edge over the competition.”</p>
<p>And, with quality content comes other advantages.</p>
<p>“AI content generation tools can help businesses to ensure the accuracy and consistency of their content, as the tools can be trained to adhere to specific guidelines and standards,” Sadique said.</p>
<p>In turn, this can yield<strong> improved<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/12/20/content-marketing-roi"> return on investment</a></strong> (ROI), Drow said.</p>
<p>This may also help increase revenue.</p>
<p>“Using AI-driven processes, businesses can crank out more and better blog and social media material,” Drow added. “Users&#8217; confidence in these methods can be bolstered through these outlets [as] customers are more likely to buy from reputable companies.”</p>
<p>What’s more, AI helps <strong>improve the speed of content creation</strong>, said Sugiya Oki, who runs reviews site <a href="https://werecommend.biz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We Recommend</a>.</p>
<p>“Inevitably, AI-powered writing tools will outpace their human competitors when it comes to speed,” Drow added. “To that end, they are a time-saver for businesses and content producers. This frees up valuable time that may be used for other important tasks, such as improving the quality of the content provided by AI.”</p>
<p>Sadique agreed.</p>
<p>“AI content generation tools can help businesses to create a high volume of content quickly and efficiently, potentially increasing productivity and allowing businesses to focus on other tasks,” he added.</p>
<p>“This can significantly impact a digital marketer&#8217;s ability to quickly and effectively create content, as they no longer have to manually research and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/09/how-to-write-a-blog-post">write blog articles</a>, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/06/26/product-descriptions">product descriptions</a>, web content, or other forms of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/04/marketing-collateral">written marketing material</a>,” Campbell said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, AI tools will <strong>increase competition on short-tail keywords with high volume</strong>. That’s according to James De Roche, managing partner at <a href="https://leadcometdigital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lead Comet</a>, who also noted, “While there can be initial anxiety around this for businesses, it will push content marketers to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/long-tail-keywords">pursue more relevant, long-tail keywords</a> with more conversion potential.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/digital-marketing-trends-2023-long-tail-keywords-graph.png" alt="2023 digital marketing trends - long tail keywords" width="720" height="544" class="size-full wp-image-69687 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/digital-marketing-trends-2023-long-tail-keywords-graph.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/digital-marketing-trends-2023-long-tail-keywords-graph-480x363.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>AI may even come to replace some of the services currently offered by search engines.</p>
<p>“This is likely to <strong>impact the way that companies approach the use of digital PR and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/10/link-building-secrets">link building</a></strong>,” said Phelan Gowing-Mikellides, business development manager at <a href="https://digitaltrails.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Trails</a>. “As a result, we are very likely to see a shift in the way that businesses approach their online presence and the strategies they use to reach and engage their target audiences, including changes to their backlink profiles [in 2023].”</p>
<p>AI may also automate the tasks performed by PR professionals.</p>
<p>“Think <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/04/how-to-write-a-press-release">writing and distributing press releases</a>, managing social media accounts or, at the very least, populating digital channels with high-quality, perfectly optimized AI-generated content,” he added. “This has the potential to displace many PR professionals, as AI is able to perform these tasks more quickly and efficiently than humans.”</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6d1.png" alt="🛑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Get updated <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/content-marketing-trends-2024">2024 content marketing trends</a> here!</p>
<h3>4. Human copywriters, don&#8217;t panic</h3>
<p>But human copywriters shouldn’t panic—they will still have a role to play.</p>
<p>That’s in part because the quality and effectiveness of the content AI produces are only as good as the inputs it receives.</p>
<p>“It still takes an experienced marketer/advertiser to determine not only what prompts to submit, but also what is useful in selecting and refining the finished product,” Martin said.</p>
<p>Oki agreed, noting AI doesn&#8217;t understand <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotions</a> and therefore can’t grasp <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/26/intent-marketing">search intent</a>.</p>
<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'>Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href="https://marketing.wordstream.com/WSLIQContentDLWebsite120WordsforMarketingWithEmotion.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_120WordsPhrases_Download" class="waffle-rich-text-link">The 120 Best Words &amp; Phrases for Marketing with Emotion</a><span> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f60c.png" alt="😌" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></div></div></span></span></p>
<p>“There&#8217;s still a lot of room for unique creativity that only the human brain can conquer, at least for now,” added Dmitry Sokhach, founder of <a href="https://admixglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Admix Global</a>.</p>
<p>That will help distinguish copywriter-generated content from “a massive increase in generic blog content,” as De Roche called it.</p>
<p>“[The latter] may address the query, but it will lack the advice needed to satisfy search intent,” he said. “To do that, you need expert insights and advice.”</p>
<p>This also ties into first-hand experience, niche expertise, and author authority, which we discuss in our<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/05/seo-trends"> 2023 SEO trends.</a></p>

<h3>What will DEI efforts focus on in 2023?</h3>
<p>In recent years, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/31/diversity-equity-inclusion-resources">diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)</a> has become an increasingly important business initiative. Here&#8217;s what experts see as being the key focal points this year.</p>
<h3>5. An emphasis on equity &amp; intersectionality</h3>
<p>In 2023, companies will continue to foster more equitable workplaces—with the key word being “equity.”</p>
<p>Eleanor Fletcher, CEO of <a href="https://www.thebestbrisbane.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Brisbane</a>, explained, “Equity in the workplace refers to the right to fair representation and equal progression chances for people with various backgrounds and experiences.”</p>
<p>Garit Boothe, CEO of <a href="https://digitalhoney.money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Honey</a>, noted this can include efforts to increase underrepresented groups, as well as to implement training and education programs and to promote diversity in leadership and decision-making roles.</p>
<p>“It is also possible that there will be a greater emphasis on intersectionality and addressing the specific needs and experiences of diverse individuals,” he added.</p>
<p>This is something we mentioned in our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/03/best-marketing-strategies">Best Marketing Strategies for Small Businesses 2023</a> post.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://twitter.com/Oojo_io/status/1616328898308104192" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<h3>6. More accountability through quantification</h3>
<p>We can also expect more focus on accountability as organizations set targets to regularly measure progress.</p>
<p>That’s according to Sadique, who also expects to see more data and analytics—such as tracking <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/28/diversity-in-marketing">diversity and inclusion</a> metrics and identifying areas for improvement—along with the continued growth of employee resource groups and increased focus on diversity in leadership.</p>
<p>Jeff Romero, founder of <a href="https://www.octivdigital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Octiv Digital</a>, agreed.</p>
<p>“This entails tracking and analyzing diversity and representation at all organizational levels, utilizing competency frameworks and other strategies to lessen bias in hiring and promoting employees, and coaching front-line managers on how to conduct team meetings and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/12/cross-functional-collaboration">collaborative</a> sessions to promote equal respect for all opinions,” he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, more companies will take steps to address DEI in campaigns that focus on underrepresented groups or specific social causes relevant to those groups.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2023-marketing-trends-dei.png" alt="2023 digital marketing trends - DEI campaign example" width="556" height="427" class=" wp-image-69694 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2023-marketing-trends-dei.png 556w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2023-marketing-trends-dei-480x369.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 556px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>“We can expect this trend of greater representation in digital marketing campaigns to continue into 2023,” said Tomasz Niezgoda, head of marketing at <a href="https://surferseo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Surfer</a>.</p>
<p>The same is true of content more broadly.</p>
<p>“Marketers are increasingly looking to create content that is inclusive and resonates with a broader range of audiences,” said David Ellis, founder of <a href="https://terangadigitalmarketing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teranga Digital Marketing</a>.<br />

<h2>Will PPC and automation make friends?</h2>
<p>We are all too familiar with Google&#8217;s push for automation. We asked experts where they see things heading, sentiment-wise.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Want <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-trends-2024">2024 Google Ads trends and predictions</a>? We&#8217;ve got you covered here!</p>
<h3>7. More positive attitudes toward automation</h3>
<p>In 2023, expect to see attitudes toward automation become more positive.</p>
<p>“There has always been a bit of an aversion to automation and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/15/ai-marketing">AI in marketing and PPC</a>—a lot of people thinking that it will take their jobs,” said Sean Nguyen, a director at <a href="https://www.internetadvisor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet Advisor</a>. “The reality of it is automation is there to assist us and help us refine our jobs. While it might take over some tasks, that actually helps us to become better at more complex tasks that aren’t tedious or repetitive.”</p>
<p>Shee agreed, noting automation can help with<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/09/18/best-keyword-research-tools"> keyword research</a>, ad testing, and analytics tracking.</p>
<p>This is especially true when it comes to Google Ads.</p>
<h3>8. Greater efficiency in Google Ads</h3>
<p>To that end, we can expect <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/01/04/google-ads-automation">Google Ads automation</a> to grow as advertisers optimize their campaigns and reach their target audiences more effectively. This automation technology includes bid optimization, as well as ad creation and testing.</p>
<p>The result is improved efficiency and effectiveness, Boothe said.</p>
<p>That is especially true since the release of Google Ads’ Performance Max campaigns in 2021.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-ads-performance-max-campaign-setup.png" alt="google ads performance max campaign setup" width="720" height="411" class="size-full wp-image-60276 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-ads-performance-max-campaign-setup.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-ads-performance-max-campaign-setup-480x274.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>“They learn how to identify where someone is on their path to purchase and show the right ad at the right time on the right Google channel to help a prospect move further along the customer journey,” Martin said. “And they even provide feedback on what is working and what inputs to test in the future that we hadn’t even considered.”</p>
<p>As they become more familiar with the benefits of automation, marketers will likely rely on it more to manage their Google Ads campaigns. However, Sadique warned, it does have limitations, such as the potential for errors and biases.

<p>“Businesses may adopt hybrid approaches that combine automation with manual management in order to get the best of both worlds,” he added.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-ads-automation.png" alt="google ads automation features" width="720" height="246" class="size-full wp-image-69374 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-ads-automation.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-ads-automation-480x164.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>

<p><a id="genz"></a></p>
<h2>How will the rise of Gen Z impact brand strategies?</h2>
<p>As Gen Z becomes more influential, marketers are adjusting their strategies to engage them. Here’s how:</p>
<h3>9. Greater influence on authenticity, transparency &amp; accessibility</h3>
<p>For starters, focus on authenticity and transparency.</p>
<p>“Brands will need to be genuine and transparent in their marketing efforts in order to appeal to this group,” Sadique said.</p>
<p>Fletcher agreed.</p>
<p>“Gen Z is drawn to marketing that is honest… they prioritize word-of-mouth advertising from friends and influencers and social evidence,” she added.</p>
<p>That means incorporating <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/13/ugc-instagram">user-generated content</a> featuring consumers who resemble them and being transparent about their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/28/green-marketing">environmental impact</a>, dedication to diversity, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/09/company-core-values">core values</a>.</p>
<p>“Gen Z is more diverse and socially conscious than previous generations, so brands will need to prioritize diversity and inclusion in their marketing efforts in order to appeal to this group,” Sadique said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2023-marketing-trends-gen-z-social-issues.png" alt="2023 marketing trends - gen z care about DEI" width="672" height="436" class=" wp-image-69695 aligncenter" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/08/09/gen-z-stats"><em>From our post on how to market to Gen Z.</em></a></p>
<p>Campbell agreed, noting this also includes <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/06/15/website-accessibility">accessibility</a>.</p>
<p>“Through storytelling and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/22/cause-based-marketing">cause marketing</a>, brands can develop narratives that align with the values and beliefs of Gen Z and that work to create an emotional connection with their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/05/11/target-audience">target audience</a>,” she added.</p>
<h3>10. Immersive experiences</h3>
<p>Gen Z also values experiential marketing and immersive experiences, which are key to engaging this cohort, along with omnichannel marketing.</p>
<p>“One of the main challenges for brands when it comes to engaging with Gen Z is understanding the various platforms and digital tools that this generation uses,” Campbell said. “Many Gen Zers have grown up with technology and are highly engaged on social media and digital networks. This means that for brands to capture their attention effectively, they must be present and active on the platforms their target audience uses.”</p>

<p><a id="privacy"></a></p>
<h2>What changes will we make in privacy?</h2>
<p>In addition to automation, privacy is the other unstoppable force that is carving out new paths in marketing each year. Let&#8217;s see what directions they&#8217;re headed in.</p>
<h3>11. More transparent data practices</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, privacy-friendly reporting dictates marketers must embrace a more transparent approach to data in which users give explicit consent—and, as <a href="https://www.homegrounds.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Grounds</a> CEO Alex Mastin noted, they must strike the right balance between personalization and privacy.</p>
<p>To do so, marketers must clearly communicate their <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/22/customer-data-privacy">privacy practices</a> to clients and stakeholders and be transparent about the data they are collecting and how it is being used.</p>
<p>They should also use consent management systems and provide clear opt-outs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2023-digital-marketing-trends-consent-management.png" alt="2023 digital marketing trends - consent management" width="720" height="317" class="size-full wp-image-69697 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2023-digital-marketing-trends-consent-management.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2023-digital-marketing-trends-consent-management-480x211.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>12. Greater adoption of privacy-friendly tracking technology</h3>
<p>“Additionally, they should invest in security tools that allow them to measure performance while still keeping customer data safe from misuse or attack by third parties,” Niezgoda said.</p>
<p>But, Sadique noted, marketers can implement privacy-friendly tracking methods, such as using anonymous identifiers or aggregated data, to track and report on key metrics without collecting personal data.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/27/google-topics-api">Google&#8217;s Topics API</a>, the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/06/facebook-conversions-api">Facebook Conversions API</a>, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/20/facebook-aggregated-event-measurement">Facebook&#8217;s Aggregated Event Measurement</a>, and Google Ads&#8217; Enhanced Conversions are all examples of privacy-friendly technology solutions you can embrace in 2023.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/digital-marketing-trends-2023-enhanced-conversions.png" alt="2023 digital marketing trends - privacy-friendly tracking" width="720" height="449" class="size-full wp-image-69698 aligncenter" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/digital-marketing-trends-2023-enhanced-conversions.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/digital-marketing-trends-2023-enhanced-conversions-480x299.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Boothe agreed, noting it may also involve working with third-party organizations that have expertise in privacy-compliant data management.</p>
<p>“Marketers will need to be proactive in finding solutions that balance the need for data with the importance of protecting consumers&#8217; privacy,” he added.<br />

<h2>Will we get a handle on the supply chain?</h2>
<p>Inflation and supply chain shortages were the biggest culprits behind <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/10/search-advertising-benchmarks">Google Ads cost per lead increasing in 2022</a>. Here&#8217;s what experts predict on the supply chain front.</p>
<h3>13. More businesses will adopt supply chain automation technology&#8230;</h3>
<p>To protect against the supply chain shortages that plagued the holiday season, businesses can diversify their sourcing, which includes working more with local suppliers, and/or strengthen ties with existing vendors.</p>
<p>They can also implement multi-modal transportation and invest in analytics for greater supply chain visibility and to better anticipate and manage risk.</p>

<p>“[Supply chain automation technology] can help to expedite the movement of goods, reduce delays in the supply chain and increase efficiency,” Campbell said. “Automation technologies such as robotics, machine learning, big data analysis and artificial intelligence can enable businesses to identify and respond to supply chain disruptions.”</p>
<h3>14. &#8230;and build prevention and contingency plans</h3>
<p>In addition, building up inventory levels, implementing contingency plans, and looking for opportunities to increase efficiency and reduce costs can help mitigate bottlenecks.</p>
<p>“Some businesses may also be considering shifts in their operations, such as moving production to different locations or adopting new technologies, in an effort to reduce their reliance on certain suppliers or markets,” Boothe added.</p>
<p>Inventory optimization, which identifies when and where shortages may occur, is another tactic.</p>
<p>“Additionally, businesses may also look to build more robust safety nets, such as insurance policies and emergency funds, to protect them from unexpected economic changes,” Shee said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just last week, we celebrated the 52nd anniversary of Earth Day, which helped give rise to the environmental movement more than half a century ago.</p>
<p>Now, of course, it’s far more common to see brands prioritize the environment than it was in 1970.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-infographic.jpg" alt="green marketing infographic" width="447" height="650" class="aligncenter wp-image-60678" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://blog.gwi.com/chart-of-the-week/lifting-the-lid-on-sustainable-packaging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>And this, of course, spurred the rise of green marketing. What exactly does that mean? Read on to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>What green (or sustainable) marketing is and why it&#8217;s important</li>
<li>Five of the most eco-friendly brands to give you inspiration</li>
<li>Eight ways to implement your own green marketing</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is green marketing?</h2>
<p>Sustainability marketing, or green marketing, is a practice that emphasizes the environmental benefits of a product or service, which also reflects a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/09/company-core-values">brand’s values.</a></p>
<p>“Overall, the objective is to advocate toward an end mission,” said digital marketing specialist <a href="https://matttutt.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Tutt</a>, who focuses on ethical, green, and sustainable businesses. “For example, it might be to reduce the use of fossil fuels or to pivot toward greener sources of energy.”</p>
<p>That means sustainability marketing is a big shift from traditional marketing, which focuses on revenue and profits.</p>
<p>But the definition of sustainability is shifting. <a href="https://shelhorowitz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shel Horowitz</a>, a green business profitability expert, noted that ultimately, brands should strive to move beyond sustainability to “regenerativity,” which he defined as taking steps to actively make the world better, such as “developing and marketing products and services that [target] hunger, poverty, racism, other kinds of othering, catastrophic climate change and even peace.”</p>
<p>In fact, one study shows that <a href="https://co-nxt.com/blog/new-consumer-research-food-and-sustainability-post-pandemic-shifts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly half</a> of consumers now consider the definition of sustainability to include social and economic factors.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-stats-sustainability-definition.png" alt="sustainability marketing definition" width="720" height="510" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60710" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-stats-sustainability-definition.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-stats-sustainability-definition-480x340.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /><a href="https://co-nxt.com/blog/new-consumer-research-food-and-sustainability-post-pandemic-shifts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em></em></a></p>
<h2>Why is green marketing important?</h2>
<p>Aside from the environmental benefits, sustainability marketing is important because it helps brands connect to increasingly environmentally and socially conscious consumers, said Roger Huang, head of growth operations at talent development platform <a href="http://springboard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Springboard</a>.</p>
<p>“Sustainability is a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/13/digital-marketing-trends-2022">vast 2022 macro trend</a> and marketing plays an important role,” added Matt Lally, founder of the consultancy <a href="https://mattyads.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MattyAds</a>. “Sustainability is high on the customer&#8217;s internal value system, which they embrace with higher brand loyalty and less price sensitivity.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/eco-friendly-brands-survey-on-consumers-sustainability.png" alt="chart showing importance of eco-friendliness to consumers" width="720" height="484" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60667" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/eco-friendly-brands-survey-on-consumers-sustainability.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/eco-friendly-brands-survey-on-consumers-sustainability-480x323.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/03/generation-z-sustainability-lifestyle-buying-decisions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just an opinion. Studies like the one above show that consumers in every generation consider sustainability a more important factor than the brand name of a product when making a purchase. Furthermore, Facebook found that posts containing sustainability-related hashtags received <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/insights/sustainability-trends-shape-consumers-decisions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4.2x</a> more interactions per post than other posts made by CPG brands, and 10.8x more engagement for posts with eco-friendly-related <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags">hashtags</a>.<a href="https://co-nxt.com/blog/new-consumer-research-food-and-sustainability-post-pandemic-shifts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em></em></a></p>
<h2>5 of the most eco-friendly brands to inspire you</h2>
<p>While there are many brand examples by now, a few stand out in their<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/22/cause-based-marketing"> cause-based marketing</a>:</p>
<h3>The Body Shop</h3>
<p>Scott McKinney, head of marketing at financial literacy site <a href="https://www.debtbombshell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Debt Bombshell</a>, pointed to cosmetics retailer The Body Shop, which <a href="https://www.thebodyshop.com/en-au/about-us/activism/faat/a/a00018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been advocating for the end of animal testing since 1989</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sustainability-marketing-body-shop-animal-testing.png" alt="sustainable brands - the body shop against animal testing" width="600" height="663" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60658" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sustainability-marketing-body-shop-animal-testing.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sustainability-marketing-body-shop-animal-testing-480x530.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Zaeem Chaudhary, architectural draftsman at engineering firm <a href="https://acdesignsolutions.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AC Design Solutions</a>, agreed, noting <a href="https://www.thebodyshop.com/en-us/about-us/activism/isolated-not-alone/a/a00020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">domestic violence</a> and <a href="https://www.thebodyshop.com/en-gb/about-us/activism/a/a00015" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HIV/AIDS</a> are two of many other causes the retailer has supported over the years.</p>
<h3>Ikea</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, furniture retailer Ikea <a href="https://about.ikea.com/en/sustainability/becoming-climate-positive/what-is-climate-positive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has committed to becoming climate positive by 2030</a>. That means Ikea will not just reach net-zero carbon emissions, but it will actually be removing additional carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p>
<p><a href="https://about.ikea.com/en/sustainability/becoming-climate-positive/what-is-climate-positive" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sustainability-marketing-ikea-climate-positive.png" alt="sustainability marketing - ikea" width="600" height="588" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60659" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sustainability-marketing-ikea-climate-positive.png 600w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sustainability-marketing-ikea-climate-positive-480x470.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<p>“They have launched a ‘sustainable living at home’ products range after investing heavily in wind turbines and solar panels throughout the world,” Tutt said. “By combining these two things, they can help to position themselves as having green energy and sustainability at the heart of their products.”</p>
<h3>Lego</h3>
<p>Likewise, toymaker Lego <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/sustainability/environment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wants to make all core products from sustainable materials by 2030</a>—and to make all packaging from renewable or recycled materials by 2025.</p>
<p>“This form of marketing gives the company a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/07/unique-selling-proposition">unique selling proposition</a> and customers are willing to walk with the company and hold it accountable until it achieves its sustainability goals,” said Doug Pierce, chief marketing adviser at analytics platform <a href="https://www.sigmacomputing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sigma Computing</a>. “Moreover, customers are willing to pay more for Lego products and will continue to remain loyal to the company because of this commitment to sustainability.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sustainability-marketing-lego.png" alt="sustainability marketing - legos sustainable materials page" width="720" height="362" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60660" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sustainability-marketing-lego.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sustainability-marketing-lego-480x241.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The brand also has a Replay program, which <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/sustainability/environment/replay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allows customers to donate used bricks</a> to children in need. This, noted Stephen Light, CMO of retailer <a href="https://www.nolahmattress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nolah Mattress</a>, has the added bonus of helping to reduce waste in landfills.</p>
<p>“When you consider their product is traditionally made of plastic, it’s incredibly smart to invest so much energy into the implementation of sustainable practices—they don’t ignore the potentially negative impact their product has had, they use it to define their fight to achieve better for the planet at large,” he added. “They provide goals and regular updates regarding sustainable materials and packaging, offering a level of transparency that’s crucial to strong sustainability marketing.”</p>
<h3>Patagonia</h3>
<p>Noting “it feels like sustainability is at the heart of everything they do,” Tutt pointed to outdoor apparel brand Patagonia as another example.</p>
<p>“They are working hard toward building a community of people who love and care deeply for the outdoors and not simply existing to sell garments,” he said. “Their social feeds are full of exciting, stunning wildlife and landscapes, images and videos of people out hiking and exploring—really putting the environment at the heart of what they do.”</p>
<p>One memorable example is the brand&#8217;s <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/stories/dont-buy-this-jacket-black-friday-and-the-new-york-times/story-18615.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Don’t Buy This Jacket campaign</a>, which brought attention to consumerism on Black Friday 2011.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.patagonia.com/stories/dont-buy-this-jacket-black-friday-and-the-new-york-times/story-18615.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/eco-friendly-brands-patagonia-dont-buy-this-jacket.jpeg" alt="eco-friendly sustainable brands - patagonia's don't buy this jacket campaign" width="652" height="1250" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60661" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/eco-friendly-brands-patagonia-dont-buy-this-jacket.jpeg 652w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/eco-friendly-brands-patagonia-dont-buy-this-jacket-480x920.jpeg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 652px, 100vw" /></a><a href="https://bettermarketing.pub/dont-buy-this-jacket-patagonia-s-daring-campaign-2b37e145046b" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>“Patagonia&#8217;s ethos is to build a product that will last, thus rejecting the fast fashion trends that plague our landfills,” Lally added.</p>
<h3>Starbucks</h3>
<p>Finally, coffee chain Starbucks recently announced its <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/business-food/starbucks-cup-sustainability/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plans</a> to encourage more customers to drink from reusable mugs by 2025.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/business-food/starbucks-cup-sustainability/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/most-sustainable-eco-friendly-brands-starbucks-cups.png" alt="most sustainable brands - starbucks announcement to eliminate single-use cups" width="720" height="216" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60662" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/most-sustainable-eco-friendly-brands-starbucks-cups.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/most-sustainable-eco-friendly-brands-starbucks-cups-480x144.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></a>That follows a long history of sustainable efforts.</p>
<p>“Since the early 2000s, the company has been promoting green and humane sourcing for their products,” said Christiaan Huynen, founder of design firm <a href="https://designbro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DesignBro</a>. “Moreover, the company also donates millions of dollars to other environmental programs and renewable energy developments. Starbucks also prioritizes sustainable practices in an attempt to decrease power and water waste.”</p>

<h2>How you can implement green marketing</h2>
<p>Feeling inspired? Here are six <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/earth-day-slogans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ways to integrate green marketing</a> into your own <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/01/18/best-marketing-strategies">marketing strategy</a>:</p>
<h3>Find the right sustainable initiative</h3>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to commit to something lofty like any of the big corporations above. “This may be as simple as giving one percent of your profits to charity or as complex as devoting your business model to a specific cause,” said Joe Davies, founder of digital marketing firm <a href="https://fatjoe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fatjoe</a>.</p>
<p>By looking for features that can be marketed as sustainable, brands can leverage the feel-good benefit of the product or service while also providing value, he added.</p>
<h3>Keep your efforts genuine</h3>
<p>Horowitz noted that these efforts have to be genuine or you run the risk of greenwashing. Greenwashing refers to using vague and misleading tactics to appear sustainable without actually being sustainable—all in the name of benefiting the business and not the environment.<a href="http://weforum.org/agenda/2022/03/generation-z-sustainability-lifestyle-buying-decisions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-definition-greenwashing.jpg" alt="green marketing - definition of greenwashing" width="372" height="609" class="aligncenter wp-image-60668" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blondegonerogue.com/blogs/fashion-sustainability/what-is-greenwashing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<h3>Adjust your messaging for the different levels of green</h3>
<p>“That&#8217;s only step one,” he said. “Step two is reaching out to not just the Deep Green [consumers] but also the Lazy Greens and even the Non-Greens—all of whom require different marketing hooks.”</p>
<h3>Implement eco-conscious design</h3>
<p>First, consider product design—such as how to make your products recyclable or reusable if they aren’t already. Starbucks cups are a good example but there are countless others, like Coolpaste below.</p>
<p>Davies recommends making products with less packaging while Jeff Mains, CEO of the consultancy <a href="http://championleadership.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Champion Leadership Group</a>, suggests seeking out environmentally conscious suppliers, manufacturers and partners.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-eco-product-design.jpeg" alt="examples of green marketing - eco-conscious design toothpaste" width="720" height="245" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60669" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-eco-product-design.jpeg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-eco-product-design-480x163.jpeg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/02/28/the-top-10-sustainable-product-designs-that-help-you-maintain-an-eco-friendly-and-green-lifestyle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<h3>Source sustainable materials</h3>
<p>Then, think about whether you can incorporate more sustainable materials, like bamboo, cork or hemp.</p>
<p>This, said David Wurst, CEO of digital marketing agency <a href="https://www.webcitz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Webcitz</a>, is one of the most prominent approaches to sustainable marketing.</p>
<p>“Shampoos with fewer hazardous components that dissolve more quickly in water, as well as reusable straws and water bottles, are among these items,” he added. “Companies can gain traction in the green market by providing consumers with alternative items that help them feel better about their influence on the environment.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-ethique.png" alt="green marketing example - ethique" width="720" height="183" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60672" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-ethique.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-ethique-480x122.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://ethique.com/products/heali-kiwi-shampoo-for-dandruff-or-scalp-problems?nosto=frontpage-nosto-1-fallback-nosto-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethique</a> is another example of a super-sustainable brand.</em></p>
<p>Another way to ensure your items are sourced sustainably is to ensure your suppliers are ethical and provide a living wage to their employees, said David Bitton, CMO of property management firm <a href="https://www.doorloop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DoorLoop</a>.</p>
<p>“Additionally, ensure that the materials used to make your products have a low environmental impact, do not contain any harmful substances and are biodegradable,” he added.<em></em></p>
<h3>Use plastic-free products and packaging</h3>
<p>Another way to do this is by going plastic-free.</p>
<p>“Today, billions of pounds of [plastic] can be found in the swirling convergences that make up over 40% of the world&#8217;s ocean surfaces,” Wurst said. “Thousands of seabirds, sea turtles, seals, and other marine creatures are killed each year after consuming or becoming entangled in plastic.”</p>
<p>If, for example, your packaging is single-use plastic, consider more environmentally friendly alternatives.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-zero-waste-packaging.png" alt="green marketing - plastic free packaging" width="720" height="339" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60673" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-zero-waste-packaging.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-zero-waste-packaging-480x226.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Brands like <a href="https://earthhero.com/product-category/shop-by-values/zero-waste-packaging/page/15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earth Hero</a> allow you to shop by specific value, like plastic-free packaging. </em></p>
<p>“We make an effort on sustainable packaging, reducing our use of plastics and other non-compostable packaging materials by replacing them with wood, wool and straw,” said Kathryn McDavid, CEO of ecommerce company <a href="https://editorspick.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Editor&#8217;s Pick</a>.</p>
<h3>Reduce your emissions</h3>
<p>Fulfillment is another business sector that can benefit from sustainable practices.</p>
<p>“Long-distance shipping can have a significant carbon footprint,” said Jason Ball, director of B2B agency <a href="https://consideredcontent.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Considered Content</a>. “Trucks and planes, among other modes of transportation, are among the major emitters of greenhouse gases.”</p>
<p>Instead, he said companies can ship in bulk to lessen their carbon impact or they can offer a green shipping option at checkout.</p>
<p>In addition, businesses can offset carbon emissions from the supply chain, Davies noted.</p>
<h3>Focus on renewable energy</h3>
<p>Beyond the products themselves, businesses can also implement eco-friendly energy practices, such as using solar, wind, hydropower or geothermal electricity.</p>
<p>“Access to renewable energy sources has improved in recent years and the market for harvesting renewable energy is likely to grow in the next decades as more countries invest in it,” said Jamie Opalchuk, CEO of hosting platform <a href="https://www.hostpapa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HostPapa</a>.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-most-eco-friendly-brands.png" alt="most eco friendly brands that use renewable energy" width="720" height="509" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60674" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-most-eco-friendly-brands.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/green-marketing-most-eco-friendly-brands-480x339.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranked-the-50-companies-that-use-the-highest-percentage-of-green-energy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></p>
<p>Dan Close, CEO of house-buying firm <a href="https://buyhousesinkentucky.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We Buy Houses in Kentucky</a>, agreed, noting renewable energy can reduce production costs while also helping the environment.</p>
<h3>Assume social responsibility</h3>
<p>Finally, corporate social responsibility (CSR) allows brands to better communicate how they’re affecting positive change to conscious consumers. That’s according to Chris Gadek, vice president of growth at outdoor advertising firm <a href="https://www.adquick.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdQuick</a>, who noted customers are often willing to pay more when a brand’s identity aligns with their beliefs.</p>
<p>“For this reason, businesses must embrace CSR in their brand ethos to have a competitive advantage,” he said. “However, promoting your business&#8217;s CSR initiatives without tooting your own horn can be tricky. But, through a well-crafted social media campaign, you can invite customers on your brand&#8217;s journey to effect positive change in the world.”</p>
<p>You can even go as far as getting a third-party certification, such as becoming a B Corp.</p>
<p>“Certified B Corp status is a recognizable certification that verifies your brand&#8217;s sustainability efforts and having a third party make the sustainability claims is more legitimate to consumers than the brand making the claims themselves because there&#8217;s less bias,” said Calloway Cook, president of supplement maker <a href="https://illuminatelabs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Illuminate Labs</a>.</p>
<h2>Get your green marketing strategy in gear</h2>
<p>To recap, here are eight ways to implement green marketing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick the right initiative</li>
<li>Keep your efforts genuine</li>
<li>Adjust your messaging to the different levels of &#8220;green&#8221; in your audience</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Depending on the industry you’re in, acquiring a new customer can be anywhere from <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five to 25</a> times as expensive as simply retaining your existing customers.</p>

<p>That really gets to the heart of why customer retention is so important for all businesses. In this post, we&#8217;re going to take a closer look at this effective marketing strategy, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>What customer retention is and why it&#8217;s important.</li>
<li>How to calculate customer retention rate.</li>
<li>13 customer retention strategies to earn loyalty and save money.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is customer retention?</h2>
<p>Customer retention is a brand’s ability to keep customers subscribed to or coming back for its products and services. That’s according to David Morneau, CEO of SEO firm <a href="https://www.breeeze.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Breeeze.co</a>, who noted it also prevents customers from switching to competitors.</p>
<h2>Why is customer retention important?</h2>
<p>Repeat customers help ensure a steady flow of income and keep a business stable, said Sherry Morgan, founder of pet site <a href="https://petsolino.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Petsolino</a>. And, in a perfect world, they also help grow a business through <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/06/26/word-of-mouth-marketing">positive word-of-mouth marketing</a>.</p>
<p>“Customer retention is one of the best ways to improve your profitability,” added consultant <a href="https://www.luisazhou.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luisa Zhou</a>. “Many studies and surveys point to the fact that it&#8217;s far cheaper to keep a customer than to constantly try to find new ones. That&#8217;s because marketing is costly and if you can <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/07/customer-engagement-strategy">engage an existing customer</a> so they spend more with you, your profitability increases.”</p>
<h2><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cusotmer-retention-strategies-statistics-new-vs-existing.png" alt="customer retention statistics" width="954" height="350" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58524" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cusotmer-retention-strategies-statistics-new-vs-existing.png 954w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cusotmer-retention-strategies-statistics-new-vs-existing-480x176.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 954px, 100vw" /></h2>
<h2>What is customer retention rate?</h2>
<p>Customer retention rate, or CRR, is a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/marketing-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing metric</a> that determines how many customers a company retains over a given time period.</p>
<p>“It is one of the most important indicators of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/11/10/customer-loyalty">consumer loyalty</a>,” said Jay Bats, developer of social media template firm <a href="https://contentbase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ContentBase</a>. “For example, if a company starts the year with ten clients and loses two by the end, it has an 80% customer retention rate.”</p>
<h2>How do you calculate customer retention rate?</h2>
<p>The most common formula for calculating customer retention rate is: CRR = ((E-N)/S) x 100.</p>
<p>According to Geoff Cudd, owner of car buying site <a href="https://www.findthebestcarprice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FindTheBestCarPrice.com</a>, E is the total number of clients you had at the end of a certain time period, N is the number of new clients you gained in this time period, and S is the number of clients you had at the start of this time period. The result is the percentage of clients who remained with you over that time.</p>

<h2>13 customer retention strategies that work</h2>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re a B2C business or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/04/client-retention-tips">agency looking to improve your customer retention rate</a>, here are 13 strategies from the experts that work.</p>
<h3>1. Provide a solid customer experience</h3>
<p>It all starts with a good customer experience.</p>
<p>“In today&#8217;s competitive market, exceeding expectations, exceeding customer needs and <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-demonstrate-value-to-your-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">establishing your worth</a> are critical components of success,” said Matt Weidle, business development manager of product comparison site <a href="https://buyersguide.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buyer&#8217;s Guide</a>. “It is critical your organization maintains customer satisfaction across all channels, including in-person and online encounters.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/customer-retention-strategies-example-chewy.png" alt="customer retention strategies - example of chewy" width="400" height="659" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58532" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/customer-retention-strategies-example-chewy.png 400w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/customer-retention-strategies-example-chewy-182x300.png 182w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>Take the case of Jeff Neal, founder of <a href="https://www.thecritterdepot.com/products/dubia-roaches-critter-depot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Critter Depot</a>, who ships live insects to pet stores, zoos, and reptile owners. Retaining customers is very important because of the inherent constraints of its audience size. That’s why Critter Depot ships orders quickly, for example.</p>
<p>“The biggest factor is providing good service,” he added. “Sometimes the crickets or roaches will perish in route. It is imperative that we reship a new order at no cost. That one transaction may be a losing proposition for us. However, the long-term potential of retaining that customer greatly salvages the loss on that one order.”</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;That one transaction may be a losing proposition for us. However, the long-term potential of retaining that customer greatly salvages the loss on that one order.&#8221; &#8211; Jeff Neal, Critter Depot</p></blockquote>
<h3>2. Under-promise &amp; overdeliver</h3>
<p>On a related note, it’s wise to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/07/15/ppc-agency-pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set customer expectations</a> early—and to always exceed them.</p>
<p>“Be conservative with your estimates in terms of what you&#8217;ll be able to deliver to your customers. Then, overdeliver on that promise,” Zhou said. “Always offer more value than your customer expects. That way, your services/products, no matter what your price point is, become a no-brainer for your customers.”</p>
<p>Ray Blakney, CEO of online language school, <a href="https://www.livelingua.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Live Lingua</a>, agreed even in a highly competitive market, customers are much more likely to return if they have an exceptional experience.</p>
<h3>3. Reward loyalty</h3>
<p>One of the other most obvious <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-retention-strategies-for-small-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer retention strategies</a> is to reward shoppers for their loyalty, such as through a <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-run-customer-loyalty-programs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loyalty program</a>.</p>
<p>Rewards can include discounts, gifts, exclusive events, sneak peeks, and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/customer-retention-strategies-loyalty-program.png" alt="customer retention strategies - rewards program example" width="720" height="457" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58526" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/customer-retention-strategies-loyalty-program.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/customer-retention-strategies-loyalty-program-480x305.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>“You have the freedom to be innovative in the kind of loyalty programs you establish and the incentives you provide,” said Dustin Porreca, SEO Manager of marketing agency <a href="https://www.elevatedemand.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elevate Demand</a>. “The bottom line is that you want to make your returning clients feel like VIPs every time they visit your establishment. Allow them to know that they are valued and demonstrate this value via your behaviors so that they will continue to have a reason to return.”</p>
<p>This, Joanne King, director of online music platform <a href="http://www.icmp-elevate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICMP</a>, said, also paves the way for brands to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/30/cross-selling-upselling">cross- and upsell</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Make your returning clients feel like VIPs every time they visit your establishment so that they will continue to have a reason to return.” -Dustin Porreca, Elevate Demand</p></blockquote>
<h3>4. Use your data to personalize the experience</h3>
<p>Another way to enhance customer retention is by <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/04/22/how-to-personalize-ecommerce-customer-journey">personalizing the shopping experience</a>. But to do this, you need data.</p>
<p>You can<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/02/17/customer-insights"> collect customer insights</a> through surveys, reviews, purchase behavior, and more, and then create profiles to execute these personalized experiences through deals or messaging.</p>
<p>Per Tyler Martin, business coach at <a href="https://thinktyler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ThinkTyler</a>, Customer Intelligence Platforms (CIPs) help businesses collect, analyze, and act on customer data to develop customized offerings.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/customer-retention-strategies-customer-survey-example.png" alt="customer retention strategies - customer survey example" width="720" height="411" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58527" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/customer-retention-strategies-customer-survey-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/customer-retention-strategies-customer-survey-example-480x274.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sightx.io/capabilities/survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>“The more information you have about your clients, the better you will be able to improve their experiences with your company,” added Jamie Opalchuk, CEO of web hosting platform <a href="https://www.hostpapa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HostPapa</a>. “When you know who your consumers are, what they need and what their pain points are, you&#8217;ll be in a better position to give them exactly what they need to win their loyalty and return for more transactions with your company.”</p>
<h3>5. Use live engagement tools</h3>
<p>An easy way to improve the customer experience—and therefore your customer retention rate—is to respond quickly to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/24/customer-feedback">customer feedback</a>, questions, and requests.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/customer-retention-strategies-response-times.png" alt="customer retention strategies - response times" width="640" height="372" class="aligncenter wp-image-58533" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/customer-retention-strategies-response-times.png 640w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/customer-retention-strategies-response-times-480x279.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 640px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.superoffice.com/blog/live-chat-software-benefits/"><em>Data source</em></a></p>
<p>Per David Wurst, CEO of marketing and development agency <a href="https://www.webcitz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Webcitz</a>, a long response time is one of the primary reasons customers complain of a poor experience.</p>
<p>“<strong>Implementing live chat</strong> can be one of the most effective customer retention strategies,” he said. “Customers are 59% more likely to buy if brands respond to their questions in under a minute.”</p>
<p>In addition, Morgan recommends <strong>sending automated texts or emails</strong> to let customers know the average time for a response.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/customer-retention-strategies-channels.jpeg" alt="customer retention strategies - channels used" width="525" height="434" class="aligncenter wp-image-58540" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/customer-retention-strategies-channels.jpeg 525w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/customer-retention-strategies-channels-480x397.jpeg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 525px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://99firms.com/blog/customer-retention-statistics/#gref" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>Or, Sep Niakan, managing broker of condo site <a href="http://condoblackbook.com/">Condoblackbook</a>, noted brands can implement live engagement tools, such as <strong>video chat</strong>, so customer care teams can provide solutions on the first contact.</p>
<p>“The live interaction technologies cut down on client touchpoints and provide efficient responses right away,” he said.</p>
<h3>6. Solicit feedback</h3>
<p>Instead of waiting for customers to come with questions, comments or concerns, you can proactively solicit their opinions via feedback mechanisms like customer surveys.</p>
<p>Rohan Kadam, founder of the blog <a href="https://bikingknowhow.com/">Biking Know How</a> recommends <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/11/10/best-online-survey-tools">online tools like SurveyMonkey</a> to ask clients about their most recent encounters with your company. “I have seen my retention grow from 3% to 27% since using SurveyMonkey,” Kadam noted.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/customer-retention-strategies-satisfaction-survey-template.png" alt="customer retention strategies - customer satisfaction survey template" width="428" height="340" class="aligncenter wp-image-58534" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>SurveyMonkey offers a <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/customer-satisfaction-survey-template/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey template</a> to help you get started.</em></p>
<p>Use these surveys to better understand what is and isn’t working in the customer experience.</p>
<p>“You will never be able to please every consumer on every issue, but surveys can help you find patterns that you may have overlooked,” said Matthew Paxton, founder of gaming server site <a href="https://hypernia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hypernia</a>. “A good survey should include both multiple-choice questions and free text answer fields to allow customers to express themselves more extensively if necessary.”</p>
<p>Then, use this feedback to improve your product, service, or experience, said Matt Post, co-founder of web development service <a href="https://wcagpros.com/">WCAG Pros</a>, which specializes in auditing and fixing websites to make them ADA compliant.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I have seen my retention grow from 3% to 27% since using SurveyMonkey.” -Rohan Kadam, Biking Know How <em></em></p></blockquote>
<h3>7. Listen online</h3>
<p>Another way to proactively enhance customer retention is through social listening.</p>
<p>“Set up and monitor Google alerts and social mentions of your brand in the digital space [and] conduct A/B tests and surveys … to determine pain points you need to address,” said Stacey Kane, business development lead at ecommerce site <a href="https://www.easymerchant.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EasyMerchant</a>.</p>
<h3>8. Monitor your retention data</h3>
<p>And, of course, customer retention KPIs can also help businesses proactively improve customer retention. Metrics to track here include site traffic, conversions, and abandoned cart rates—as well as your customer retention rate.</p>
<p>This latter metric measures how loyal customers are, which is especially important in an increasingly crowded market. <strong>An ideal range is 20 to 40%</strong>, said Jason Sherman, CEO of ecommerce platform <a href="https://www.taprm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TapRm</a>.</p>
<p>“You can improve your [repeat purchase rate] through customer retention strategies such as an <strong>optimized customer life cycle</strong>, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/brand-loyalty">loyalty programs</a>, <strong>retargeting ads</strong>, and <strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/03/17/shopping-cart-abandonment">cart abandonment emails</a></strong>,” he added. “This creates a better post-purchase experience that drives customer loyalty and increases repeat sales.”</p>
<p>Neal noted his <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/08/how-to-build-an-ecommerce-website">ecommerce website</a> uses <a href="https://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shopify</a>, which provides retention data like which consumers are returning and how many times those customers order.</p>

<p>“They calculate how many of our daily/monthly orders are completed from repeat customers, which helps us know that our retention rate is growing,” he added.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3>9. Pay attention to churn</h3>
<p>One specific metric to look out for is <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/05/12/customer-churn">churn rate</a>. That includes both performance-related measures, like a decrease in repeat sales or purchase frequency, as well as analyzing each touchpoint in the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/19/customer-journey-map-templates">customer journey</a>.</p>
<p>“Customer churn analysis assists stores in analyzing qualitative and quantitative signals from present clients [as well as possible new clients] in order to better understand how to keep them happy with what you&#8217;re doing—making it more likely that other consumers will follow suit,” said Rameez Usmani, CMO of <a href="https://webhostingadvices.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web Hosting Advices.com</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/customer-retention-strategies-churn-analysis.png" alt="customer retention strategies - churn analysis" width="720" height="397" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58541" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/customer-retention-strategies-churn-analysis.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/customer-retention-strategies-churn-analysis-480x265.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://baremetrics.com/blog/churn-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>Greg Gillman, chief revenue officer of performance marketing agency <a href="https://www.mutesix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MuteSix</a>, noted once you have this model in place, you’ll start to identify patterns that will help predict the probability of churn for each customer.</p>
<p>“But, don&#8217;t stop there,” he said. “When you discover where you’re lagging, adjust acquisition and retention strategies until you see a boost in <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/01/10/cac-vs-clv">customer lifetime value</a>.”</p>
<h3>10. Make onboarding easy &amp; enjoyable</h3>
<p>Part of a good customer experience also requires making the onboarding process as seamless as possible.</p>
<p>“We do this by using auto-login for our member&#8217;s area right after the purchase,” said Mark Webster, co-founder of website builder <a href="https://www.authorityhacker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Authority Hacker</a>. “Rather than making the customers search through emails and enter login details manually, they are redirected to the course page, which they can use straight away.”</p>
<p>Paxton agreed a good onboarding process can set you up for long-term success as it makes a good first impression.</p>
<p>“It should be individualized [to the greatest extent possible], hands-on and aimed at removing as much friction as possible,” he said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/customer-retention-strategies-onboarding-email.png" alt="customer retention strategies - onboarding email" width="458" height="1035" class="aligncenter wp-image-58538" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/categories/onboarding" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>A solid onboarding or <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/08/18/welcome-email">welcome email</a> can make all the difference.</p>
<h3>11. Be transparent</h3>
<p>Another way to enhance customer retention is through transparency. When brands are transparent with consumers, they feel more confident in making future purchases.</p>
<p>“When you do this, customers know what they need to know about the brand or the product itself. And this gives them a feeling that the brand does not conceal or hide something,” said Eddie Bye, founder of supplement site <a href="https://physioflexpro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Physio Flex Pro</a>. “Overall, it is a reliable and fair customer retention strategy both parties could benefit from.”</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Transparency is a reliable and fair customer retention strategy both parties can benefit from.” -Eddie Bye, Physio Flex Pro</p></blockquote>
<h3>12. Use customer relationship management tools</h3>
<p>The good news is you don’t have to juggle all of this alone—the right <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/09/crm-for-small-business">customer relationship management (CRM) platform</a> can help make the process of retaining customers a lot easier.</p>
<p>“It is critical to have a consistent and high-quality dialogue with your customers,” said Steve Scott, CTO of Excel tip site <a href="https://spreadsheetplanet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spreadsheet Planet</a>. “Implement a CRM system in your business that helps you to maintain an optimal record of your communications with each client and to leverage this information to your advantage.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/customer-retention-strategies-crm.png" alt="customer retention strategies - crm" width="480" height="266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58537" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/customer-retention-strategies-crm.png 480w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/customer-retention-strategies-crm-300x166.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>
<p>Vishesh Raisinghani, financial expert at personal finance site <a href="https://piggybank.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PiggyBank</a>, agreed a CRM system can better manage client interactions and help ensure <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/customer-communication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">effective communication</a> no matter what the channel.</p>
<p>“CRM is not just the application of technology, but is a strategy to learn more about customers&#8217; needs and behaviors in order to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/21/build-client-relationships">build stronger relationships</a> with them,” said Adam Ng, CEO of review site <a href="https://www.trustedmalaysia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trusted</a>. “The CRM strategy focuses on putting customer needs first and delivering a superior, more personalized customer experience. Remember one satisfied customer brings ten new customers with him whereas one dissatisfied customer takes away ten customers along with him.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“CRM is not just the application of technology, but a strategy to learn more about customers&#8217; needs and behaviors in order to develop stronger relationships with them.” -Adam Ng, Trusted</p></blockquote>
<h3>13. Automate where possible</h3>
<p>Another tool to help keep customers coming back is automation. Paxton pointed to automation systems that simplify entire workflows for marketing teams, which includes re-engaging clients.</p>
<p>“Rather than requiring your marketing team to track which customers have expired, a marketing automation solution that combines AI and machine learning can automatically recognize when customers lapse and re-engage them with individually relevant content,” he said.</p>
<p>King noted this not only saves time and resources, but “it also allows you to reach out to several clients at once while maintaining relevant and customized connections.”</p>
<h2>The 13 best customer retention strategies</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With each coming year, digital marketing gets more complicated. In addition to fundamentals like SEO, PPC, branding and UX, marketers now have to juggle emerging social channels and evolving regulations, along with content, automation and personalization, to name a few.</p>
<p>As we look ahead at what’s to come in the new year, we asked 30 marketers for the most important strategies they’re employing this year to extend reach, boost awareness and maximize revenue.</p>
<p>Here are the top 10 digital marketing trends of 2022 that it boiled down to.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/digital-marketing-trends-2022.png" alt="digital marketing trends 2022" width="1000" height="529" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55887" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/digital-marketing-trends-2022.png 1000w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/digital-marketing-trends-2022-980x518.png 980w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/digital-marketing-trends-2022-480x254.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1000px, 100vw" /></p>

<h2>2022 digital marketing trends to watch</h2>
<p>These first three trends are of a more emergent nature in that they may not be feasible for your business just yet, but they indicate the direction we&#8217;re headed in. So while you&#8217;re not going to create a $600,000 NFT gif, you should still keep an eye on them. Plus, the reasons behind these trends can help inform your approach with the strategies you&#8217;re using now.</p>
<h3>1. The metaverse</h3>
<p>So we’re not referring to Facebook [entirely] here. The metaverse refers to the virtual world of augmented reality, virtual reality, 3D holographic avatars, and video—and not just one-off experiences like with gaming, but a persistent environment where people work, play, and socialize.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/digital-marketing-trends-augmented-reality.jpg" alt="digital marketing trends - augmented reality ad example" width="720" height="452" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55538" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/digital-marketing-trends-augmented-reality.jpg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/digital-marketing-trends-augmented-reality-480x301.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.iboson.io/augmented-reality-in-marketing-advertisement" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>Per Patrick Casey, director of growth marketing at digital health brand <a href="http://felixforyou.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Felix Health</a>, there’s good reason the metaverse is generating so much buzz lately—and brands should be thinking about this virtual space as part of their 2022 marketing strategies.</p>
<p>That’s in part because it has the potential to offer an <strong>entirely new set of performance metrics.</strong></p>
<p>“Marketers will be able to experiment with how long virtual objects are held, how much space they take up in a user&#8217;s peripheral vision, and even where users are looking when experiencing an ad,” he said. “These insights have the potential to completely re-map what you know about your audience, providing invaluable direction going forward.”</p>
<p>Kent Lewis, president of digital marketing agency <a href="https://www.anvilmediainc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anvil Media</a>, agreed many brands will dabble with virtual worlds in 2022 and even though consumers “may be a few years from caring about the metaverse,” <strong>brands can still benefit from a first-mover advantage.</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-digital-marketing-trends-quote-about-metaverse.png" alt="2022 digital marketing trends - quote about metaverse" width="720" height="275" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55585" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-digital-marketing-trends-quote-about-metaverse.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-digital-marketing-trends-quote-about-metaverse-480x183.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>2. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</h3>
<p>Beyond figuring out where brands fit in the metaverse, they’ll also have to experiment more with blockchain technology to prepare for Web 3.0—the next evolution of the web, which will be more decentralized, added Zach Passarella, marketing director of nutraceutical brand <a href="https://smpnutra.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supplement Manufacturing Partners</a>.</p>
<p>“This preparation taken will pay off in the near future when the web turns into more of this type of realm after 2022,” he said.</p>
<p>One trending aspect of blockchain is non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Non-fungible means it can&#8217;t be exchanged for something of equal value, because it doesn&#8217;t have any equals. For example, the U.S. dollar is fungible. You can exchange a $100 bill for five $20 bills. But you can&#8217;t exchange your grandmother&#8217;s wedding ring—a non-fungible—for anything of equal value, because there&#8217;s an authenticity factor.</p>
<p>NFTs are the digital version of non-fungibles—uniquely created digital assets like an animation, graphic design, GIF, audio/video file, or meme—that exist on a blockchain.</p>
<p>With brands like Campbell’s, Charmin, and Coca-Cola issuing NFT collectibles last year, Jeff Mains, CEO of consulting firm <a href="http://championleadership.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Champion Leadership Group</a>, noted it’s a good time for other brands to figure out how they can<strong> tap into these digital assets so they aren’t left behind</strong>.<img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/digital-marketing-trends-nft-charmin.png" alt="2022 digital marketing trends - Charmin NFT" width="500" height="667" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55539" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/digital-marketing-trends-nft-charmin.png 500w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/digital-marketing-trends-nft-charmin-480x640.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In addition, as brands like Adidas start to partner with NFT collections like the Bored Ape Yacht Club, Faizan Fahim, marketing manager at cloud hosting platform <a href="https://breeze.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Breeze.io</a>, noted we can expect more partnerships—and even brands starting to sell or give away their own NFTs as a way to<a href="https://localiq.com/blog/brand-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong> build community among their customers</strong></a>.</p>
<h3>3. Cryptocurrency</h3>
<p>In a similar vein, we’ll continue to see the proliferation of cryptocurrencies in 2022 and savvy marketers will keep their eyes on this trend toward decentralized finance.</p>
<p>While still only used by a niche U.S. audience, accepting cryptocurrency now could help brands attract new customers—<strong>but only if the demographic is the right fit</strong>, said Andrea Chapman, marketing manager at cannabis site <a href="https://www.natureandbloom.com/">Nature and Bloom</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-marketing-trends-cryptocurrency-quote.png" alt="digital marketing trends 2022 - quote about cryptocurrency" width="720" height="281" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55586" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-marketing-trends-cryptocurrency-quote.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-marketing-trends-cryptocurrency-quote-480x187.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>“In relation to payments, for example, cryptocurrencies are driving massive changes in relation to the biggest processors like Visa, PayPal, and MasterCard,” added Shaun Heng, vice president of growth and operations at price-tracking site <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoinMarketCap</a>. “This has big implications on how products and services <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/07/customer-engagement-strategy">engage with their customers</a> and marketers will be eager to align themselves with the potential for increased demographic reach.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-digital-marketing-trends-blockchain.jpeg" alt="2022 digital marketing trends - cryptocurrency adoption timeline" width="720" height="494" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55540" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-digital-marketing-trends-blockchain.jpeg 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-digital-marketing-trends-blockchain-480x329.jpeg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>2022 digital marketing trends to continue</h2>
<p>These two trends should come as no surprise to you. You most likely already are doing something along these lines, and you should absolutely continue.</p>
<h3>4. Zero &amp; first-party data</h3>
<p>Marketers still have another year until Google phases out third-party cookies, which means 2022 will be the most important year for data and privacy yet.</p>
<p>“A lot of really good marketers still fail to realize that, in reality, your audience is owned by Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or any other social media network you use,” said Brian Snedvig, CEO <a href="https://jofibo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jofibo</a>, which helps job seekers create resumes and cover letters. “You don&#8217;t have control over them. That is why 2022 should be the year you begin to own your audience.”</p>
<p>That means brands must<strong> integrate data collection methods that prioritize consumer privacy.</strong></p>
<p>“Make sure your campaigns in 2022 assist you to create first-party data so you don&#8217;t have to rely on others&#8217; data as much,” said Dan Close, CEO of real estate business <a href="https://buyhousesinkentucky.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We Buy Houses in Kentucky</a>.</p>
<p>Options include<strong> email, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/25/email-newsletter-ideas">newsletters</a>, social media, and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/11/09/crm-for-small-business">CRM tools.</a></strong></p>
<p>Zero-party data, or data given directly by the consumer through <strong>online interactions like surveys</strong>, is also important, said Michelle Ebbin, founder of clothing brand <a href="https://www.jettproof.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jettproof</a>.</p>
<p>“While it will take more effort upfront, the data marketers are able to collect directly from their consumers can play a huge role in creating more personalized and tailored campaigns,” said Justin Smith, CEO of digital agency <a href="https://www.outerboxdesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OuterBox</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-digital-marketing-trends-data-justin-smith-quote.png" alt="digital marketing trends - quote by justin smith" width="720" height="284" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55589" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-digital-marketing-trends-data-justin-smith-quote.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-digital-marketing-trends-data-justin-smith-quote-480x189.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In addition, brands must ensure their agencies “<strong>have a clear plan in place for ad placement and measurement after the shift [away from third-party cookies]</strong>,” Close added.</p>
<p>Marketers can also experiment with Google’s Privacy Sandbox to find new ways to access consumer information without jeopardizing privacy, Ebbin said.</p>
<h3>5. Supply chain buffering</h3>
<p>The 2021 holidays may be over, but headlines continue to blare about supply chain bottlenecks and their negative impact on the customer experience. That’s why Chelsea Cohen, co-founder of Amazon inventory management platform <a href="https://www.sostocked.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoStocked</a>, recommends <strong>aligning marketing goals with stock capacity.</strong></p>
<p>In addition, brands will benefit from <strong>maintaining 30-day buffer stock.</strong></p>
<p>“Your buffer stock, or backup inventory, safeguards you from stocking out during unexpected upsells,” Cohen added. “It ensures that there’s always enough product available to meet shipping deadlines, so customers won’t have to wait extra time for their order while you restock.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/digital-marketing-trends-2022-supply-chain.png" alt="2022 digital marketing trends - quote about supply chain" width="720" height="261" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55590" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/digital-marketing-trends-2022-supply-chain.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/digital-marketing-trends-2022-supply-chain-480x174.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>2022 digital marketing trends to try</h2>
<p>These two trends are super doable, no matter your business size.</p>
<h3>6. Social commerce</h3>
<p>In 2021, retailers ranging from Walmart to Saks experimented with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/25/social-shopping">social commerce</a> on platforms like TikTok and Instagram. This, too, will continue in 2022 as brands seek to shorten the distance from discovery to conversion.</p>
<p>“It gives marketers a whole new way to get their items in front of potential customers,” said Steve Pogson, ecommerce strategy lead at ecommerce firm <a href="https://www.firstpier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FirstPier</a>.</p>
<p>But this <a href="https://localiq.com/blog/2022-digital-marketing-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 marketing trend</a> isn’t limited to big brands.</p>
<p>According to CEO Jena Joyce, clean skincare brand <a href="https://theplantmother.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plant Mother</a> saw a 100% increase in revenue and a 1280% increase in referral traffic after <strong>launching an Instagram shop</strong> in November 2021.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-digital-marketing-trends-instagram-shop-1.jpeg" alt="2022 digital marketing trends - instagram shops" width="400" height="711" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55541" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-digital-marketing-trends-instagram-shop-1.jpeg 400w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-digital-marketing-trends-instagram-shop-1-169x300.jpeg 169w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>“Being a new brand who <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/resources/how-to-compete-with-big-spenders-without-spending-more">can&#8217;t compete with large beauty companies with hefty advertising budgets</a>, Instagram shopping proved to be a profitable alternative to paid ads,” she said.</p>
<h3>&#8230;particularly, Shoppable livestreams</h3>
<p>Livestream commerce offers plenty of potential, too.</p>
<p>Rob Illidge, CEO of social media agency <a href="https://www.social-republic.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social Republic</a>, noted consumers spend three times longer watching <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/30/instagram-live">live videos</a> than pre-recorded visual content, which is in part why so many platforms are making a push into what he estimated to be a $70-billion space.</p>
<p>Livestreams have also gotten a boost from the pandemic by offering a safe alternative to in-store shopping.</p>
<p>Per Jeff Moriarty, marketing manager of <a href="https://www.tanzanitejewelrydesigns.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moriarty&#8217;s Gem Art</a>, the jewelry brand started doing shoppable Facebook and <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/04/27/youtube-live">YouTube live videos</a> in 2021 to allow viewers to see products, ask questions, and, of course, buy merchandise.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-live-example.png" alt="youtube live example" width="720" height="322" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53600" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-live-example.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/youtube-live-example-480x215.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>“We are now getting about 1500+ viewers watching our show each time,” he said. “Not only has it helped to stay connected with our customers via social media and YouTube, it has generated a ton of sales for our business.”</p>
<p>In fact, in November 2021 alone, Moriarty’s made $30,000 from its livestream show.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>7. Simple content</h3>
<p>While content marketing has long been a cornerstone of digital marketing, 2022 will be the year marketers embrace simplicity and clarity in content.</p>
<p>“The internet is now flooded with content,” said Hilda Wong, founder of content agency <a href="https://content.dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Content Dog</a>. “Your customers have a long list of content to choose from and yours needs to stand out to be noticed in the first place.”</p>
<p>How do brands accomplish this? Hint<strong>: They don’t need a lot of flowery prose.</strong></p>
<p>“You need to maintain clarity with your content,” she added. “It doesn’t have to be complicated. It needs to be understandable for the general public. Clear content will get you a more effective reach.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/digital-marketing-trends-2022-content-dog-quote.png" alt="digital marketing trends 2022 - quote about simple content" width="720" height="259" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55594" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/digital-marketing-trends-2022-content-dog-quote.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/digital-marketing-trends-2022-content-dog-quote-480x173.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Tim Clarke, director of sales and marketing at <a href="https://seoblog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEOBlog.com</a>, agreed brands should focus on<strong> providing meaningful experiences to users</strong>—and they want simple content.</p>
<p>“In 2022, everything will be algorithm-driven and brands should provide a user experience that customers want, or their content will be less relevant,” he said. “The amount of information on the internet is enormous and it’s becoming increasingly challenging to absorb all the data presented. So, to stand out from the crowd, delivering informative yet straightforward content will be a wise choice.”</p>
<h2>2022 marketing trends to hop on ASAP</h2>
<p>These are your non-negotiables.</p>
<h3>8. Sustainability &amp; DEI</h3>
<p>In recent years, brand values have become increasingly important to consumers and this, too, will continue in 2022.</p>
<p>Per Laurel Mintz, CEO of marketing agency <a href="http://www.elevatemybrand.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elevate My Brand</a>, this includes both being transparent about sustainability (<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/04/28/green-marketing">green marketing tips here</a>), as well as DEI efforts, within <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/09/23/how-brand-your-business">brand messaging</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-digital-marketing-trends-sustainability.png" alt="2022 digital marketing trends - google trends results for sustainable brands" width="720" height="379" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55544" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-digital-marketing-trends-sustainability.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-digital-marketing-trends-sustainability-480x253.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>“As a result, <strong><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/06/09/company-core-values">core values</a> will need to permeate all levels of a company</strong> in order to appear legitimate and show a real impact,” she said.</p>
<p>It could go as far as even <strong>partnering with a nonprofit.</strong> That’s according to David Bitton, CMO of rental management platform <a href="https://www.doorloop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DoorLoop</a>, who said brands can both increase their customer bases and make positive impacts by teaming with a relevant nonprofit.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s a win-win situation where you can make a significant contribution to humanitarian efforts while simultaneously improving your brand and reach,” he said. “However, <strong>merely expressing your support for specific NGOs would not suffice</strong>…<strong>consider affiliate marketing</strong>, giving a portion of your revenue or profit to the organization and corporate funding as part of your marketing strategy.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-marketing-trends-gmo-quote.png" alt="digital marketing trends 2022 - quote about brand values" width="720" height="266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55587" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-marketing-trends-gmo-quote.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-marketing-trends-gmo-quote-480x177.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Indeed, Talyah Regusters, assistant account manager at digital marketing firm <a href="https://www.marketinglmr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LMR Marketing,</a> pointed to <a href="https://about.google/stories/year-in-search-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s 2021 Year in Search report</a>, which showed interest in “how to conserve,” “impact of climate change,” and “sustainability” reached all-time highs.</p>
<p>“If your company or product can speak to any of these issues, 2022 is the time to proudly own it,” she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/retail/inclusion-diversity-retail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research shows</a> consumers are otherwise willing to vote with their wallets and switch to brands that do reflect their values. Or, as Kevin Froehlich, paid media manager at the agency <a href="http://rollwithduckpin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Duckpin</a>, put it, “<strong>What a company believes has become as important as what a company does</strong>.”</p>
<p>He pointed to Lego’s <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2021/november/donation-german-red-cross/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent donation to the German Red Cross</a> to help build kindergartens and a family aid center in a flood-stricken region of Germany. “It&#8217;s nice to know that all my unabashed spending on toys is helping to make part of the world a better place,” he added.</p>
<h3>9. Gender neutrality</h3>
<p>In 2021, we saw brands like Old Navy and Pacific Sunwear release gender-neutral clothing collections. This trend toward inclusivity is ongoing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-digital-marketing-trends-gender-neutral.png" alt="2022 digital marketing trends - gender neutral products" width="720" height="379" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55545" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-digital-marketing-trends-gender-neutral.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-digital-marketing-trends-gender-neutral-480x253.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In fact, Damien Buxton, managing director of web design firm <a href="https://midascreative.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Midas Creative</a>, expects to see more brands shy away from traditional gender roles in their marketing efforts to prevent alienating any customers.</p>
<p>“The dynamics of households and people have changed and continue to change,” he said. “Marketing will become more gender-neutral and less focused on pre-conceived ideas of what sex an individual is and what they should be seeing.”</p>
<p>Stewart McGrenary, director at mobile recycling comparison site <a href="https://freedom-mobiles.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freedom Mobiles</a>, agreed it is now vital “for brands to authentically reflect a range of backgrounds within their marketing messages” as the population diversifies more and more.</p>
<p>That’s in part because showing customers other individuals who look and live like they do helps consumers feel represented and therefore drawn to that brand, added Nathalie Walton, CEO of wellness app <a href="https://app.expectful.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Expectful</a>.</p>
<h3>10. Accessibility</h3>
<p>We can also expect to see more accessibility from brands, like department store JCPenney, which released an inclusive line of children’s clothing, including pieces for kids with disabilities, last year.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-digital-marketing-trends-jc-penny-adaptable-clothing.png" alt="2022 digital marketing trends - adaptable clothing line" width="720" height="309" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55592" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-digital-marketing-trends-jc-penny-adaptable-clothing.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-digital-marketing-trends-jc-penny-adaptable-clothing-480x206.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Consultant <a href="https://about.me/svetlanakouznetsova/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Svetlana Kouznetsova</a>, who works with businesses on improving their accessibility strategies, noted there are nearly two billion disabled people worldwide, who have $1.9 trillion in disposable income.</p>
<p>“If our needs are ignored, businesses will lose not only us, but also our family, friends, and colleagues that that make up another 3.4 billion potential customers,” she said. “Together we control $13 trillion.”</p>
<p>Carter Seuthe, CEO of <a href="https://www.mycreditsummit.com/payday-loan-consolidation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Credit Summit Payday Loan Consolidation</a>, agreed the push for accessibility “widens your audience and allows people who wouldn&#8217;t normally consider your products the chance to be exposed to them.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-digital-marketing-trends-accessibility-quote-1.png" alt="2022 digital marketing trends - quote about accessibility" width="720" height="279" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55588" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-digital-marketing-trends-accessibility-quote-1.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-digital-marketing-trends-accessibility-quote-1-480x186.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>2022 digital marketing trends [recap]</h2>
<p>Some of these trends will may be easier for your business to hop onto than others. In some cases, you can note them as general directions to keep an eye on—but remember, the sooner you can take action, the better. Your current year&#8217;s strategy should always have future years in mind!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As 2021 draws to a close, we’ll soon see compilations of the best (and worst) marketing campaigns of the year, which will likely include Geico’s Scoop There It Is ice cream, Nerf’s chief TikTok officer and, of course, Burger King&#8217;s “Women belong in the kitchen” tweet.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/scoop-there-it-is-ice-cream-geico.png" alt="geico's scoop there it is ice cream" class="aligncenter wp-image-53673" width="178" height="237" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/scoop-there-it-is-ice-cream-geico.png 400w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/scoop-there-it-is-ice-cream-geico-225x300.png 225w" sizes="(max-width: 178px) 100vw, 178px" /></p>
<p>These roundups are entertaining and have their takeaways, but from a small business standpoint, they&#8217;re not very useful.</p>
<p>So we sought out to come up with a more<strong> practical best-and-worst round-up for small businesses</strong>. No, you won&#8217;t see any new ice cream flavors in here, but you will find plenty of simple tactics that yielded very gratifying results—plus how you can apply them yourself.</p>
<h2>The best of small business PPC</h2>
<p>We asked 20 marketers from a variety of industries for their campaign highs and lows this year. Their answers, which follow, include a range of new and old tactics, as well as the lessons learned from each. Let&#8217;s start with PPC.</p>
<h3><span>1. Countdown ads</span></h3>
<p>Angela Blakenship, CEO of neighborhood comparison site <a href="https://bestneighborhood.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Best Neighborhood</a>, noted adding a countdown timer to Google Ads was “a unique PPC campaign strategy that worked really well for us.” These ads yielded <strong>higher click-through rates</strong> (CTR) compared to other active campaigns, along with a <strong>higher conversion rate.</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-ads-countdown-timer.png" alt="google ads countdown timer" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53597" width="720" height="230" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-ads-countdown-timer.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-ads-countdown-timer-480x153.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/07/15/ad-customizers-countdown-guide">We show you how to use countdown customizers in Google Ads here</a>. On a broader note, urgency is the tried-and-true element of any good marketing campaign. Check out our <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/05/how-to-increase-urgency">13 urgency-inducing tricks to drive sales,</a> which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Super-specific CTAs</li>
<li>Risk-averse payment language</li>
<li>Pre-suasion</li>
</ul>
<h3><span>2. Target CPA + location targeting</span></h3>
<p>Nick Thorsch, founder of <a href="http://share2seed.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Share2Seed.org</a>, a platform that encourages entrepreneurs to think sustainably, said he helped scale revenue for a storage container brand <strong>from $2 million to $10 million</strong> with a campaign that set out to push higher-margin metal containers and refrigerated containers via Google Shopping ads.</p>
<p>He set up unique product pages and pricing to match local markets and used the <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/12/19/google-ads-automated-bidding">target CPA</a> bidding strategy, which sought as many customers as possible at a target $100 per conversion.</p>
<p>Thorsch asked sales reps to report the click ID back to Google to measure offline sales. He then expanded to Bing with a similar strategy.</p>
<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>There are a few applications here.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, a local strategy is key to any business, even those with global reach, so make sure you know the ins and outs of <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/07/google-ads-geotargeting">Google Ads location targeting</a>.</li>
<li>Notice that Thorsch measured offline sales. In our recent Google Ads updates roundup, we cover Google&#8217;s new OCI helper tool (offline conversion import). <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/11/10/google-ads-updates">Check it out!</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-ads-oci-helper-tool-dashboard.png" alt="google ads oci helper tool timeline" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49589" width="720" height="119" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-ads-oci-helper-tool-dashboard.png 720w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/google-ads-oci-helper-tool-dashboard-480x79.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Thorsch was also smart to transfer this strategy over to Bing. We can&#8217;t stress enough the importance of a <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/10/15/multi-channel-marketing">multi-channel marketing strategy</a>. But do be sure to avoid these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/24/cross-channel-marketing-mistakes">cross-channel marketing mistakes</a>!</li>
</ul>
<h3><span>3. Promotion extensions</span></h3>
<p>Daniel Foley, marketing specialist at vaping site <a href="https://88vape.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">88Vape</a>, tried out promotion extensions on Google to grab visitors’ attention by highlighting exclusive deals under 88Vape’s ads. And while he wasn’t expecting much, within a few weeks,<strong> sales of promoted items increased as much as 60%.</strong></p>
<p>“The results were better than what I could have even imagined in my wildest dreams,” Foley said. “Because of these tremendous results, it is still running to this day.”</p>
<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve talked in the past about how <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/05/24/adwords-promotion-extension">promotion extensions can drive super-high CTR</a>.

<h2>The best of small business <span>video marketing</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/07/23/personalized-video-marketing">Video marketing</a> comes in many shapes and sizes. Find out how two businesses <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/07/29/promote-your-business-on-youtube">used YouTube to promote their business</a> and got better-than-expected results.</p>
<h3><span>4. YouTube live</span></h3>
<p>Jeff Moriarty, creative manager at jewelry retailer <a href="https://www.moregems.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moriarty&#8217;s Gem Art</a>, said the brand tried out a live show on YouTube this year, which resulted in more than <strong>1,500 viewers</strong> and $10,000 in sales. Now, the retailer hosts live streams once a month. Its Black Friday stream resulted in <strong>$30,000 in sales.</strong> They plan to continue this strategy in 2022.</p>
<p>The brand has a large following on YouTube and sought a solution to reach customers who were no longer will to shop at Moriarty’s brick-and-mortar location.</p>

<h3><span>5. Video targeting tools + influencers</span></h3>
<p>According to Paula Glynn<strong>,</strong> director of search marketing and digital strategy at digital marketing and web development agency <a href="https://pixelstorm.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pixelstorm</a>, her most successful PPC campaign was a YouTube campaign focused on products endorsed by celebrities. She used a video targeting tool to overlay ads on videos related to Pixelstorm’s partner celebrities. The result was an <strong>ROI of nearly 200%.</strong></p>
<p>“YouTube isn’t a platform where PPC shines the best, but it becomes a very efficient strategy through the use of targeting tools,” she added.</p>

<h2>The best of small business<span> SMS marketing</span></h2>
<p>Just one campaign in this category, but for the better. This is a tough act to follow!</p>
<h3><span>6. The Squid Game SMS campaign</span></h3>
<p>Vitamin and supplement retailer <a href="https://www.mysupplementstore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My Supplement Store</a> wanted to increase its SMS subscribers before the holidays, so it created a campaign that taps into the popularity of Squid Game, which was <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-squid-game-is-even-bigger-than-you-thought-2-billion-hours-big/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">streamed for nearly 1.7 billion hours in its first 28 days</a>. In each order placed by a customer who was not already an SMS subscriber, the brand included a business card that looked like the cards used in the Netflix show with a number to text.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/squid-game-marketing-example.png" alt="squid game marketing example" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53604" width="448" height="453" srcset="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/squid-game-marketing-example.png 448w, https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/squid-game-marketing-example-297x300.png 297w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px" /></p>
<p>Once they texted that number, “this then took them through the marble game where they could win a big discount or be eliminated,” said Marketing Director Brian Anderson.</p>
<p>The result was a <strong>20% increase in SMS subscribers.</strong> Anderson noted customers loved the creativity, “emailing us how much they enjoyed it.”</p>

<h2>The best of small business social media marketing</h2>
<p>Influencer marketing, Facebook groups, and Instagram giveaways are by no means groundbreaking strategies, but take a look at the approach these businesses took that helped them win big.</p>
<h3><span>7. Influencer marketing tools</span></h3>
<p>Darshan Somashekar, CEO of game site <a href="https://im-a-puzzle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>I’m a Puzzle</strong></a>, said he uses online tools to identify potential influencers who can create user-generated content (UGC). The brand gives away products in exchange for video reviews and testimonials. It also has a collaboration program in which influencers give access to their Facebook and/or Instagram pages to advertise their content.</p>
<p>I’m a Puzzle pays these influencers $100 per month with 5% rev share for all sales generated through their links. Somashekar said the result is <strong>site traffic and social media growth</strong>.</p>

<p>Daniel Veiga, founder of marketing firm<span> <a href="http://dannyveiga.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Danny Veiga Marketing</a></span>, runs a Facebook Group that now has nearly 60,000 members. It&#8217;s a public group (you just have to request to join), and he updates the page multiple times a day with posts and links to articles. It has grown into a supportive community in which members share tips with students about applying to and thriving in college.</p>

<p>Melanie Bedwell, ecommerce manager for DTC soda brand <a href="https://drinkolipop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olipop</a>, said the brand launched a giveaway on Instagram in partnership with reusable bag brand Stasher. Each offered $100 in prizes to followers of the brands who tagged friends in the post.</p>
<p>Bedwell noted the contest was “a great way to bring awareness to our two brands and engage our customer base.” It also helped the brand team up with a like-minded company that “shares the same values as we do.”</p>

<h2>The best of small business email marketing</h2>
<p>Email marketing has an <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/06/29/email-marketing-statistics">ROI of $42 for every $1 spent.</a> If you&#8217;re not iterating on your email strategy, you&#8217;re doing yourself a disservice. Consider these simple tactics that brought success to two small businesses this year.</p>
<h3><span>10. Email personalization</span></h3>
<p>Amy Wampler, marketing manager of HVAC service provider <a href="https://www.spartanmechanical.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spartan Mechanical</a>, conceded the company faced some financial constraints due to a dip in sales during the pandemic. That’s in part why they opted to try an email campaign.</p>
<p>“I was aware that cold, impersonal emails would just be ineffective. Therefore, we made an attractive, trendy template and personalized each email for every customer segment,” she said. “Not only was it attractive in our eyes, but our sales also increased substantially after cold emailing.”</p>
<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>Wampler said the lesson is to not write off older tactics, but rather modify them to meet existing needs. We completely agree with this, which is how we came up with these <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/02/ppc-strategies">creative PPC strategies</a> that follow the same principle.</p>
<p>And of course, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">personalization</a> is now a standard in marketing, but the ways to do it are always evolving. We have a few helpful resources for personalizing your emails:</p>

<p>Richard Lubicky, founder of search site <a href="https://realpeoplesearch.com/">RealPeopleSearch</a>, works with a children’s clothing brand that wanted to generate leads. He crafted email copy with “Expires Tomorrow” as the call to action at the end, along with a video. After a few hours, sales volume increased by 36% versus the prior month. The brand followed up with an offer extension, which <strong>boosted sales volume 42%.</strong></p>

<h3><span>12. Client conquesting</span></h3>
<p>Brett Downes, marketing manager of digital PR company <a href="https://harohelpers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haro Helpers</a>, noted a competitor has a habit of posting the URLs with client mentions on its website daily. He uses this to cross-reference the companies mentioned with the number of mentions to determine which brands are clients. He then reaches out directly to “offer them a better deal.” Per Downes, he has a 25%+ success rate when he is able to reach the decision maker. The cost outlay is $500 and <strong>ROI is $50,000</strong> so far.</p>

<h2>The best in small business content marketing</h2>
<p>Many of the ad, email, and social media strategies in this post could fall under this category, but we&#8217;ve reserved it for two content types: webinars and blog posts.</p>
<h3><span>15. Free webinar consultations</span></h3>
<p>Amazon sellers are always keen to learn more, which is why Ian Sells, CEO of coupon site <a href="https://rebatekey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RebateKey</a>, said he decided to start doing free talks on marketing, campaigns and the basics of growing a brand online.</p>
<p>While their goal was to provide value, the webinars also helped sellers see the potential value RebateKey could bring, which <strong>resulted in new leads.</strong></p>
<p>“It may seem counterintuitive to give out your knowledge when what you want is for them to come to you instead,” Sells said. “However, helping and providing value helps build trust and converts mere audiences into loyal customers.”</p>
<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>Those two statements above? That&#8217;s inbound marketing in a nutshell. That&#8217;s content marketing at its finest. Whether via blogs, videos, <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/05/webinar-marketing">webinars</a>, guides, and more, your goal should be to provide the useful, interesting, actionable information your target audience is seeking. If they are able to DIY with your tips and advice, then they&#8217;re not a good fit for your business anyway. If they can&#8217;t, or if they can but don&#8217;t have the time or resources, then you&#8217;ll their first choice because you&#8217;ve shown that you know your stuff and that you have their best interests at heart.</p>
<h3><span>16. Help a Reporter Out (HARO)</span></h3>
<p>Artur Prokopchyk, business development manager at software development and consulting firm <a href="https://codeinspiration.pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code Inspiration</a>, noted the brand has started focusing on research projects on topics like negative feedback culture.</p>

<h3>17. A social media ad mishap</h3>
<p>Emily Anderson<strong>, </strong>head of marketing of <a href="https://roihacks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ROI Hacks</a>, an education company that focuses on teaching social media marketing, said her worst campaign of the year was a TikTok ad campaign for an ecommerce client. The campaign was “quite successful” on Facebook, but “flopped completely” on TikTok.</p>
<p>Anderson admitted her mistake was forgetting that the products targeted older consumers who aren&#8217;t using TikTok  She also noted the creative was not customized for TikTok, so “the campaign was destined to fail from the get-go.”</p>
<h3>How to avoid it</h3>
<p>Just as great Facebook ad creative may not do well in display, or as great Google Ad copy may not perform as well on Bing, you can&#8217;t expect one post, caption, or offer to perform well across all social media channels. Each platform has a different feel, purpose, and audience mindset. Head to the LOCALiQ <a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab/local-social-media-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social Media Marketing Lab</a> to get a complete breakdown of each platform, their user demographics, and what to post on each.</p>

<h3>18. An Amazon ad oversight</h3>
<p>Angela Blakenship from earlier called her experiments with Amazon DSP a “significant failure.” The ad linked back to her company&#8217;s website—not Amazon. And so it yielded “quite a number of clicks,” but not conversions.</p>
<p>“We believe this happened because viewers were expecting to be led to Amazon and not our website,” she added.</p>
<h3>How to avoid it</h3>
<p>We often get so familiar with the campaigns we&#8217;re building that we forget to test them out from the shoes of our audience. In Angela&#8217;s case, running the ad <em>was</em> the test—so we wouldn&#8217;t call this a failure altogether. But if you&#8217;re going to try out a new ad network, poke around on that network to get a feel for what the ad experience is like there so you can align with expectations.</p>
<p>And when it comes to emails, website pages, and navigation menus, run your iterations by someone outside of your business if possible before going live.</p>
<h3>19. LinkedIn adsfor B2B (what?!)</h3>
<p>Because software development firm <a href="https://www.atiba.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atiba</a> is a B2B company, SEO specialist Jake Peterson said a paid social campaign on LinkedIn seemed most logical. However, Atiba didn’t generate any leads through LinkedIn.</p>
<p>The brand actually had better success on Facebook, which allows advertisers to target more specific audiences and refine even further later. That being said, Peterson noted an early Facebook campaign focused on web design, which is an easily understandable topic for even consumers who aren’t tech-savvy, did not generate any real leads. A second campaign on Atiba&#8217;s larger offerings with more broad messaging had better results.</p>
<h3>How to avoid this mistake</h3>
<p>No, the answer is not to stop <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/03/05/linkedin-advertising">advertising on LinkedIn</a>. But the takeaway is that when you have a cross-channel advertising strategy, you need to do your testing to see which types of offers work best on each channel. Perhaps Atiba&#8217;s broader ad worked better on Facebook not just because of the targeting abilities, but because it was more top-of-funnel.</p>

<h3>20. Automation backfiring</h3>
<p>After automating tasks like email and social, Abe Breuer, CEO of portable restroom brand <a href="https://www.viptogo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VIP To Go</a>, said he was able to devote more time and energy to connecting with consumers in an authentic manner. His business was therefore in a better position to meet customers’ unique demands, increasing the likelihood of those customers returning.</p>
<p>However, over the long term, Breuer noted VIP To Go made “a few basic blunders” that “negated the whole point of utilizing this in the first place.” That’s in part because VIP To Go sent out messages too frequently, resulting in unsubscribes.</p>
<h3>How to avoid this mistake</h3>
<p>Breuer said he learned nothing can replace human interaction. He also said<strong> automation should be used to save time, not to be lazy</strong>.  “The goal of automated marketing is to simplify your team&#8217;s routine communication chores,” he added. “It isn&#8217;t intended to be a complete consumer outreach and engagement tool.”</p>

<div class="column">
<div>
<p><span lang="EN">Broadway theaters in New York are scheduled to resume performances in September 2021—18 months after they shuttered in the early days of the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">It’s one of the clearest signs yet that a “new normal” is on the horizon.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Indeed, with about 110 million Americans fully vaccinated as of May 2021, other pandemic-era restrictions are starting to lift on public spaces like bars, restaurants, gyms, and stadiums across the country.</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="ec21e9b9-964c-4258-8ce4-7686ce9e3440" data-langcode="en">

<p><span lang="EN">Things really are starting to come alive this time around, and your business (and customers) should be too. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re <span lang="EN">covering seven ways to prepare for and leverage the positive changes to come, according to top digital marketing experts across a variety of industries.</span></span></p>
<h2>1. Return to out-of-home advertising and live events</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">One tactic is to return to <a href="/blog/ws/2020/02/26/out-of-home-advertising">out-of-home advertising</a> and live events, which have understandably been neglected in the last year. </span></p>
<p>For his part, Dan Cassidy, CEO of Shopify agency <a href="https://brand-hopper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brand Hopper Digital</a>, is advising ecommerce clients to prepare for a boost in demand for products in categories like apparel and beauty “that will help people feel good and look good as they reenter the public.”</p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Increase your investment in live events</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">“After being cooped up, people are ready to get out into the world and we predict that more people will be traveling, at live events and in public spaces than ever before,” said Krista Neher, CEO of digital marketing and social media training program<span lang="EN"> <a href="http://www.bootcampdigital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boot Camp Digital</a><span lang="EN">. “This is a great time to capitalize on this.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">In fact, she noted Boot Camp Digital plans to increase its investment in live events in order to have a bigger presence when they return.</span></p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e8f5f10a-f2cc-4cb7-8088-1cc8105269b0" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/inspiring-post-covid-marketing-ideas-live-events_2-1.png" alt="inspiring post-covid marketing ideas live event searches increasing" width="800" height="373" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<h3><span lang="EN">Get more out of sponsoring</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">“We expect attendance will be up. However, sponsorship and exhibitor rates aren&#8217;t changing,” Neher added. “This creates a golden opportunity—we can reach more people for the same rates as in the past.”</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Lars Skjold Iversen, search engine explorer at CMS platform<span lang="EN"> <a href="https://umbraco.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Umbraco</a><span lang="EN">, agreed, noting we all have Zoom fatigue by now and will likely opt for in-person events over <a href="/blog/ws/2016/05/03/marketing-webinars">webinars</a> if given the choice. That makes live events “a great place for us to be.”</span></span></span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Try a hybrid approach</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">For his part, <span lang="EN">Chad Burmeister, CEO of virtual assistant platform<span lang="EN"> <a href="https://www.scalex.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ScaleX.ai</a><span lang="EN">, likened Summer 2021 to “the Summer of Love 2.0,” which will “put business professionals back on airplanes … [and] marketers investing once again in trade shows.” However, his prediction is hybrid physical/virtual events will be the new normal.</span></span></span></span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Reclaim your brand presence</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">In a similar vein, industries that have struggled during the pandemic—events included, along with travel—should brace for comebacks.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Per Andrei Vasilescu, CEO of coupon site<span lang="EN"> <a href="http://www.dontpayfull.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DontPayFull</a><span lang="EN">, that means focusing on recall.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">“They have to re-establish their brand existence in the market,” he said. “Businesses must reclaim their <a href="/blog/ws/2021/02/01/brand-strategy">brand presence</a> in order to regain their consumers in 2021.”</span></p>
<h2>2. Adjust brand messaging to be more empathetic</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">After a challenging year in many respects, <a href="/blog/ws/2021/03/31/brand-personality-messaging">brand messaging</a> will likely shift in multiple ways to appeal to consumers as they cautiously reemerge from not only a pandemic, but a <a href="/blog/ws/2021/03/19/prepare-for-recession">recession</a>, and face an ongoing climate crisis and racial justice movement.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Naturally, there is no one-size-fits-all guidance here, but there are some overarching themes.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Celebrate the move forward but don’t forget the past</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">For starters, brands should be sensitive to “those financially, emotionally and physically <a href="/blog/ws/2020/03/13/covid-19-response">affected by the pandemic</a>,” said Devin Johnson, CEO of <a href="/blog/ws/2021/04/21/cost-effective-marketing-automation-tools-small-businesses">marketing automation</a> software company<span lang="EN"> <a href="https://kennected.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kennected</a><span lang="EN">.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Juan Pablo Sarmiento, CEO of content network<span lang="EN"> <a href="https://www.bypeople.com/">ByPeople.com</a><span lang="EN">, agreed brand messages must be “softened, more human and less machine-like.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">For Brand Hopper’s Cassidy, it’s striking a balance between “the realization the past year has been difficult for many and some experienced serious loss” and “excitement as we get back to a sense of normalcy.”</span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>Planet Fitness has incorporated safety and cleanliness into its brand messaging, even trademarking the term &#8220;Cardio Distancing.&#8221;</em></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Try nostalgia marketing</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Meanwhile, Chris Vaughn<span lang="EN">, <span lang="EN">CEO of<span lang="EN"> <a href="https://pacificconsolidated.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pacific Consolidated Holdings</a><span lang="EN">, a holding company focused on <a href="/blog/ws/2020/03/12/cannabis-marketing">cannabis</a> and other vice industries, <span lang="EN">expects more nostalgia as consumers crave “the simplicity of their youths.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">He added, “Consumers are more likely to develop brand loyalty for a company they feel <a href="/blog/ws/2021/05/03/emotional-marketing-copy">emotionally</a> connected to and nostalgia marketing harnesses the positive, optimistic associations between customer’s good old days and <a href="/blog/ws/2015/05/07/marketing-funnel">funnels</a> them into a brand.”</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Use scarcity tactics sparingly </span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">On the other side of the coin, Catie Fromknecht, digital marketing consultant at consumer behavior research firm <a href="https://www.clicksuasion.com/">Clicksuasion Labs</a><span lang="EN">, noted consumers are more likely to be susceptible to scarcity marketing tactics following a year of substantial losses—but this tactic should be used sparingly. </span></span></p>
<h2>3. Make your brand’s stances clear</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">In addition, brand messaging should adjust to reflect positioning on <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/12/21/how-brands-are-embracing-social-change">social responsibility</a>.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Align with new consumer ethics</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Citing figures from consulting firm Accenture, Arthur Iinuma, <span lang="EN">president of app development firm<span lang="EN"> <a href="https://www.isbx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISBX</a><span lang="EN">, <span lang="EN">noted <span lang="EN">COVID-19 has prompted a shift in consumer consciousness as 45% have adopted more sustainable habits and plan to continue to embrace these choices. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">“Brands must align with the new consumer sentiment and consider how they can promote a more <a href="/blog/ws/2017/09/20/ethical-marketing">ethical</a> model of consumerism,” he added.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Focus on diversity and inclusion.</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">“Many consumers now expect brands to show support in the fight against discrimination and other social issues [or they will] fall victim to the financial and moral consequences,” said <span lang="EN">Eden Cheng, co-founder of invoice platform<span lang="EN"> <a href="https://weinvoice.com/">WeInvoice</a><span lang="EN">.“</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">This has led to us making major commitments in our content marketing strategies that help emphasize our support in the fight against racial discrimination, as well as active participation in lending a hand to the local community through various social causes.”</span></p>

<h2>4. Keep pushing live and standard video</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Live video is a <a href="/blog/ws/2021/01/04/best-marketing-strategies-2021">digital strategy</a> that helped brands connect with consumers from afar during the pandemic—and marketers expect to continue using it after a fundamental shift in behavior during the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">That’s true for <span lang="EN">Derek Devore, founder of luxury real estate touring platform <a href="https://duvora.com/">Duvora</a><span lang="EN">, who said he saw a “massive” uptick in adoption in 2020 as customers used live video in their searches for homes.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">“Going forward, we are investing 90% of our efforts into live video,” he added. “This interaction and ability to reach luxury home buyers in any part of the world instantly has proven to be the best channel for us.”</span></p>

</article>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN">Meanwhile, standard video content remains a solid strategy, too—and that includes digital <a href="/blog/ws/2012/11/27/youtube-advertising">advertising on platforms like YouTube</a> as consumer <a href="/blog/ws/2017/03/08/video-marketing-statistics">appetite for video</a> remains.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Per <span lang="EN">figures from Dustin Porreca, SEO manager at B2B marketing agency <span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.elevatedemand.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elevate Demand</a><span lang="EN">, clients have seen an average 68% increase in video content consumption on YouTube since March 2020 (more <a href="/blog/ws/2021/06/17/post-pandemic-digital-marketing-statistics">post-covid stats here</a>).</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">“YouTube provides an opportunity to explain your products or services in detail and provide the authenticity users are looking for,” <span lang="EN">added John McGhee, owner of digital agency <a href="https://www.webconsuls.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Webconsuls</a><span lang="EN">.</span></span></span></p>
<h2>5. Keep investing in social</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Social media is another trend that isn’t going to go away—although the <a href="/blog/ws/2019/03/19/social-media-for-small-business">specific channels marketers use</a> may shift.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span lang="EN">Continue on your existing channels</span></strong></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Even when the world opens back up again, consumers will continue to use their favorite platforms, which Porreca said justifies continued investment.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">“In any marketing strategy, your goal is meeting your buyers where they&#8217;re going to be at any given time,” he said.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Consider TikTok or Clubhouse</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">In addition to YouTube and Facebook, which a recent study from <span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/04/07/social-media-use-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a><span lang="EN"> shows are the most popular platforms with U.S. consumers overall, brands would be wise to turn their attention to video-sharing platform <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/11/advertising-on-tiktok">TikTok</a>, which<span lang="EN"> reportedly saw usage climb <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/09/14/massive-tiktok-growth-up-75-this-year-now-33x-more-users-than-nearest-competitor/?sh=3fbacd044fe4">75%</a> in 2020,<span lang="EN"> as well as another up-and-comer, audio-based app Clubhouse.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="text-align-center"><span lang="EN"><a href="https://blog.shuttlerock.com/complete-guide-to-tiktok-video-ad-formats" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></span></p>
<p><em><span lang="EN">`</span></em><span lang="EN">“A little-known secret is you can get great results in some industries by <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/22/tiktok-ads">advertising on TikTok</a>,” said <span lang="EN">Dennis Consorte, small business consultant at review site <span lang="EN"><a href="http://digital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital.com</a><span lang="EN">. <span lang="EN">“There isn’t much competition, so ad costs are relatively low.”</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<h2>6. Take advantage of lower CPCs</h2>
<p><span lang="EN">Speaking of lower costs, while digital platforms remained an important avenue to reach home-bound consumers during the pandemic, Timothy Robinson, CEO of review site <span lang="EN"><a href="https://invpn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">InVPN</a><span lang="EN">, pointed to dropping <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/02/cpc-landing-page-optimization">CPC</a> prices in the coming months. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">This, he said, presents an opportunity to reach customers online at even lower costs—even if brands themselves have faced budget cuts.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">“Other advertisers are likely to go offline at this time, allowing companies to <a href="/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">capture more traffic</a> and conversions,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nealtaparia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neal Taparia</a>—entrepreneur, investor, and co-founder of <a href="https://spider-solitaire-challenge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spider Solitaire Challenge</a>—<span lang="EN">agreed, noting <a href="/blog/ws/2016/10/17/ppc-formulas">PPC advertising</a> is “<span lang="EN">a great way of maintaining additional presence online, as well as reminding your customers that your business is going strong.”</span></span></span></p>
<h2>7. Continue optimizing for local</h2>
<p><span lang="EN"><a href="https://localiq.com/local-marketing-lab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Local marketing</a> has arguably been <a href="/blog/ws/2020/05/08/seo-during-covid-19">more important in the last 12 months than ever before</a>—and that, too, will continue.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Assume continued #shoplocal support</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">Per Amy Dixon, digital marketing manager of digital agency<span lang="EN"> <a href="https://www.hydracreative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hydra Creative</a><span lang="EN">, this is because of “a huge positive change in attitudes towards local businesses” during the pandemic, which is expected to continue after lockdown. In the U.K. for example, <a href="https://startupsmagazine.co.uk/article-google-finds-we-are-economy-kindness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">38%</a> of consumers <span lang="EN">reportedly shopped more at small businesses in 2020<span lang="EN">—and 88% say they are more likely to shop locally moving forward.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN">Run online and offline campaigns</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN">As a result, marketers should continue to optimize for “near me” searches and <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/16/how-to-ask-for-reviews">solicit customer reviews</a>. But they should also consider local media like radio ads, which <span lang="EN">Sabrina Beaumont, CMO of house plan site<span lang="EN"> <a href="https://passionplans.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Passion Plans</a><span lang="EN">, said she intends to do to “hopefully allow us to gain some local goodwill” in the markets in which she operates.</span></span></span></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we compiled <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/01/07/best-marketing-strategies">our list of 2020 marketing tactics</a> at the end of 2019, no one had any idea what was really in store for the year to come. Now, we know 2021 will continue to see ripple effects from the pandemic and, even when it’s over, consumer behavior will never go back entirely to the way it was before.</p>
<p>This has profound implications for brands and marketers in 2021. On top of that, technology and regulatory changes will require preparation. We asked marketing experts how they plan to tackle 2021—here are the 18 topics they zeroed in on.</p>
<p><strong>End o&#8217;21 update!</strong> We asked 20 marketing experts what their best and worst campaigns were of 2021. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/12/13/best-worst-marketing-campaigns">Here&#8217;s what they shared.</a></p>
<h2>18 of the best ways to market your business in 2021</h2>
<p>The following list provides insights into many strategies you&#8217;ve already heard of, including SEO, customer retention, ecommerce, and video and influencer marketing. It also includes new strategies related to cookieless advertising and privacy changes, as well as new approaches to help you cater to the new COVID-weary and <a href="/blog/ws/2020/12/21/how-brands-are-embracing-social-change">social change</a>-conscious consumer of 2021. No matter the strategy, the idea is the same: to market personally and value your customers, but also efficiently so you can save time, scale up, and keep running your day-to-day.</p>
<h3>1. Optimize for Google’s next update</h3>
<p>With Google’s Page Experience Update <a href="https://searchengineland.com/the-google-page-experience-update-user-experience-to-become-a-google-ranking-factor-335252">coming in May 2021</a>, new metrics called <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/19/improve-core-web-vitals">Core Web Vitals</a>—which will measure site load time, interactivity and content stability—will start to impact overall search rankings.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="f18064a5-d61d-46c5-9182-f5f2aad66594" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>“Basically, anything that could annoy a user of the page may negatively impact the Core Web Vitals metrics and lead to a lower ranking in search results for that page,” said Mark Coster, owner of web design agency <a href="https://webdesignforbusinesses.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web Design for Businesses</a>.</p>
<p>That means brands will have to start <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/19/core-web-vitals-google-page-experience-update">optimizing for Core Web Vitals</a> by being more user-friendly than ever before.</p>

</article>
</div>
<p>“Pages and elements must load fast and not leave users waiting,” said Lee Savery, content executive at digital agency <a href="https://www.ricemedia.co.uk/">Ricemedia</a>. “The delay before a first input must be very short, allowing users to interact with pages as fast as possible. There mustn&#8217;t be any unexpected changes in layout while users load and scroll the page. Not addressing these elements could lead to your site dropping fast.”</p>
<h3>2. Prepare for the end of third-party cookies</h3>
<p>2021 will also be the year marketers prepare for two big changes to come in 2022: the end of third-party cookies and new <a href="/blog/ws/2014/10/08/online-privacy">privacy</a> regulations in California.</p>
<p>“We have to get comfortable with privacy-first data collection practices. That means focusing on list-building and developing one-to-one relationships with customers,” said Harry Maugans, CEO of consumer privacy service <a href="https://privacybee.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Bee</a>. “Make sure that your campaigns in 2021 help you build your first-party data so you rely less on Other People&#8217;s Data.”</p>
<p>The death of third-party cookies will change how digital ads are targeted and tracked, but Dave Toby, director of digital marketing agency <a href="https://pathfinderalliance.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pathfinder Alliance</a>, said there’s still “considerable confusion about how campaigns will be affected.”</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="bb5026e3-5f6b-47b1-b308-5f51d8ffe8c6" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>“The coming year will provide a final chance for marketers to educate themselves about the impact of the cookie-less future and to prepare for it,” he added. “The most important action involves improving access to, and effective use of, their valuable first-party data—and ensure agencies have a clear plan for placing and measuring campaigns after the change.”</p>
<p>In addition to getting comfortable with privacy-first data collection practices, brands will also have to build their own data collection infrastructure to comply with coming regulations in 2021.</p>
<p>“Fines in California start at $2,500 per occurrence, so it&#8217;s financially prudent to prepare in [advance],” Maugans noted.</p>

<h3><span lang="EN-GB">3. Foster first-party relationships</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">In 2021, having direct relationships with customers will be even more important as the online landscape becomes even more cluttered with <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/02/17/digital-marketing-skills">brands trying to reach digital consumers</a>. But it will also be important because one-to-one relationships mean brands can <a href="/blog/ws/2017/02/06/personalized-marketing">personalize content</a> for better experiences.</span></p>
<p>Houman Akhavan, CMO of <a href="https://www.carparts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CarParts.com</a>, said a first-party data strategy yielded “incredible results” in 2020, including “record conversions.”</p>
<p>“A critical part of this first-party data strategy has been using the correct customer data platform technology—one that is scalable to process millions of records of customer insights, including real-time signals that must be acted upon immediately before they go stale,” he said. “Thus far, leveraging our customer data platform has allowed us to generate over a quarter billion personalized one-to-one messages. We’ve seen our click-through rates increase by as much as 400% and our email revenue has doubled.”</p>

<h3>4. Focus on customer retention</h3>
<p>And for brands struggling to recover from the events of 2020, <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/13/marketing-agencies-retention-strategies-covid-19">focusing on existing customers</a> may be wise.</p>
<p>“In an <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/24/marketing-during-recession">uncertain economy</a>, most brands—especially niche retailers— should focus on existing customers,” said Jonathan Frey, CMO of electric bike retailer <a href="https://urbanbikesdirect.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Urban Bikes Direct</a>.</p>
<p>For his part, Jim Pendergast, SVP of commercial financing platform <a href="https://altline.sobanco.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AltLine</a>, expects to see B2C brands emphasize <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/07/10/mobile-marketing-strategies">mobile marketing</a> for customer retention.</p>
<p>“Think things like personalized push notifications on smartphones and loyalty incentives if you download mobile apps to shop or transact in directly,” he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keeping existing customers happy is cheaper than acquiring new ones because brands have bypassed the early stages of the customer journey and have more data to work with for personalized messaging,&#8221; Pendergast added.</p>
<p>What’s more, mobile interactions like <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/11/09/sms-marketing">SMS</a> (and even <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/21/promotional-email-examples">email</a>) are a direct link between brand and customer—and bypass third parties.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>What’s more, mobile interactions like SMS (and even email) are a direct link between brand and customer—and bypass third parties.</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>“The pandemic has been catastrophic for small firms…but this simply further heightens the need for small firms to own their audience and have a stellar brand reputation because those are the only things they can leverage against the tech giants,” said Jake Meador, director of content strategy at marketing tech company <a href="https://mobile-text-alerts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mobile Text Alerts</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Start selling on social</h3>
<p>Another burgeoning <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/02/22/digital-marketing-trends-2021">trend</a> with potentially far-reaching implications is <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/13/facebook-ecommerce-tips">social commerce</a>.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="58717a92-1777-416d-b590-f89af603be9c" data-langcode="en">

</div>
<p>In 2020, Facebook launched Shops for both <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/announcing-facebook-shops" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/introducing-shops-on-instagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a>, allowing users to shop directly on the platforms.</p>
<p>Bruce Biegel, senior managing partner of management consultancy <a href="https://www.winterberrygroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Winterberry Group</a>, expects to see more focus on social commerce in 2021, along with new marketplaces, to <a href="/blog/ws/2015/01/26/sales-cycle">shorten the customer journey</a> from search to conversion.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="13c67c89-f979-48b4-a72b-c3dc1744ab5c" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>“It brings a whole new opportunity for marketers to put their products in front of potential clients,” said Jeff Anning, founder of electric skateboard brand <a href="https://www.evolveskateboards.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evolve Skateboards</a>. “Retailers are working hard to reduce the friction from product to purchase, using in-app shopping on social media channels.”</p>
<p>That is why Evolve will be “heavily testing and trying to reduce drop-offs by selling directly from social media channels” in 2021, Anning added.</p>
<h3>6. Follow statements of purpose with action</h3>
<p>2020 was also a year in which consumers and brands alike took stances on <a href="/blog/ws/2020/11/12/black-owned-business-support">social justice</a> issues.</p>
<p>“After the murder of George Floyd and the global human rights outcry we saw in late May, companies and brands will need to continue their promise towards inclusion and cultural competency efforts,” said Tara Miremadi, digital brand manager at health and fitness marketing agency <a href="https://margauxagency.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Margaux Agency</a>. “Many statements were released, but the key for brands looking to solidify their relationship with consumers is how they follow through with continued action.</p>
<p>Kent Lewis, president of digital marketing agency <a href="https://www.anvilmediainc.com/">Anvil Media</a>, believes brands will do this in 2021 as they “appeal to enlightened consumers that care deeply about a company’s purpose and commitment to social and environmental sustainability.”</p>

<h3>7. Build trust</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/18/post-covid-19-customers">pandemic accelerated a trend</a> in which consumers are looking to spend money with brands that not only share their values, but brands they trust.</p>
<p>“As consumers have become even more selective of where they spend their money, they want to know the businesses they support have their best interests in mind,” said Colin Palfrey, CMO of espresso equipment retailer <a href="https://majestycoffee.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Majesty Coffee</a>. “Building trust doesn&#8217;t require a big budget. All you have to do is make a promise to your customers and keep it.”</p>
<p>Mark Wood, CEO of glass fence manufacturer <a href="https://nationalpoolfences.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Pool Fences</a>, agreed brands have to focus their messaging on giving consumers peace of mind—even after the vaccine.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="e8cb5e18-c253-4e8c-a369-eb67ead6cc6d" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>“The pandemic will have a profound and lasting impact on customer mindset and messaging that focuses solely on <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/29/how-to-promote-a-product">product or service</a> instead of compassion and trust will not fly,” Wood said. “Since our business already has a focus on safety,<strong> </strong>tweaking our message to be about cleanliness and peace of mind will be an ongoing strategy through 2021.”</p>
<h3>8. Grow communities</h3>
<p>In addition to demonstrating they are trustworthy, brands should foster communities of<a href="/blog/ws/2016/11/10/customer-loyalty"> loyal customers</a> in 2021.</p>
<p>“The notion of community building isn&#8217;t novel, but brands in 2021 need to understand that loyalty is coming back and brands that know what it is their customers want, as well as how to engage them through transparency and humility, is what will become the difference maker,” said SEO consultant Itamar Blauer.</p>
<p>Olga Petrik, CMO of Gmail CRM firm <a href="https://nethunt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NetHunt CRM</a>, agreed brands should invest more in loyalty and <a href="/blog/ws/2018/03/13/ecommerce-retention">retention</a> for 2021.</p>
<p>“Their existing customer base has come this far with them throughout the pandemic—it’s stable to some extent,” she said. “By switching from customer support to a customer success strategy, a business can ensure that customers receive maximum value from a product.</p>
<h3>9. Optimize for voice search</h3>
<p>We’ve seen <a href="/blog/ws/2018/02/15/voice-search-seo">voice search</a> in previous year-end predictions. However, 2021 may be the year it really takes off as consumers used their voice-enabled devices more while they were at home during the pandemic.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="cbbe39bb-5690-47de-afaf-0e3264fdf15c" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-voice-search-microphone-icon.jpg" alt="Google Voice Search microphone icon" width="696" height="280" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>“This in turn meant people were more willing to explore what their smart home devices could do and open a dialogue with them and begin to learn and rely on them,” said Polly Kay, senior marketing manager at window covering retailer <a href="https://www.englishblinds.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">English Blinds</a>.</p>
<p>As a result, brands should optimize for voice search by focusing on longer-tail keywords that reflect how consumers ask questions or make requests verbally to stay ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>“Much [like] Google introduced mobile-first ranking for SEO even in instances of user searches on desktop devices, so, too, is it highly likely that as the popularity of voice search queries increases, Google [will] place a heavier weighting on ranking and rewarding content that successfully meets the needs of voice searchers,” she added.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="c8435509-f9f8-4f55-bda8-f6678122da79" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>In fact, Shiv Gupta, CEO of digital media marketing agency <a href="https://www.incrementors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Incrementors</a>, said there’s a real opportunity for small businesses to capitalize on local search in voice.</p>
<p>“About 22% of users use voice search by Google to get details of local businesses,” he said.</p>
<h3>10. Lean into local SEO</h3>
<p>Speaking of which, <a href="/blog/ws/2018/10/12/local-seo">local SEO</a> is another marketing strategy to make a repeat appearance on this list. This time, it’s because brands can update their Google Business Profiles <a href="/blog/ws/2020/06/10/create-google-my-business-account">via their Google My Business Accounts</a> to include pandemic-friendly details like online appointments and curbside pickup and delivery, said Sarah Blocksidge, marketing manager at digital marketing agency <a href="https://www.sixthcitymarketing.com/">Sixth City Marketing</a>.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>“Since everyone will still want to stay in close proximity to home, but also support small local businesses, it is important to make sure your <a href="/blog/ws/2020/06/03/google-my-business-optimization">Google My Business account is optimized </a>and active,” Blocksidge added. “Having strong reviews is also a part of this, on sites like Yelp and [the like] because if a customer needs to hire someone for any type of service, they will want to read up on other people&#8217;s positive (or negative) experiences on how they are handling safety protocols and [the like].”</p>
<h3>11. Go casual in social videos</h3>
<p>The trend toward <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/10/social-media-video-marketing">social video</a> will undoubtedly continue in 2021.</p>
<p>Mark Hayes, head of marketing at video-based advice platform <a href="https://kintell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kintell</a>, noted TikTok has over 500 million users and is available in more than 150 global markets. It has also spurred copycats like Instagram’s Reels, which <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-instagram-reels-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched in August 2020</a>. (Twitter’s Fleets, which <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/introducing-fleets-new-way-to-join-the-conversation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came out in November 2020</a>, offers similar 24-hour-only video capabilities.)</p>
<p>Platforms like <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/11/advertising-on-tiktok">TikTok allow marketers</a> to more naturally weave brand content into users’ feeds.</p>
<p>Sarah Walsh, strategic account manager at digital marketing agency <a href="https://www.branchandbramble.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Branch &amp; Bramble</a>, expects to see Instagram users move from static posts to Reels in 2021.</p>
<p>“While video content has a certain expectation to be high quality, Reels owns a unique territory where they don&#8217;t have to be beautifully shot or exceptionally designed to gain attention,” she said.</p>
<p>This means brands can let their hair down a bit.</p>
<p>Lindsey Wigfield, CEO of content marketing agency <a href="https://sweethomemarketing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweet Home Marketing</a>, agreed brands are moving away from always looking professional by embracing <a href="/blog/ws/2020/08/20/daily-hashtags">hashtag</a> challenges on TikTok, for example.</p>

</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><a href="https://blog.sociallyin.com/tiktok-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>&#8220;My prediction is that even more businesses will catch on to the positive brand vibes that are generated through a more laidback social media approach,” she said.</p>
<p>Indeed, marketer, copywriter, and web developer <a href="https://jamesblews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James Blews</a> said <a href="/blog/ws/2016/08/03/video-marketing-ideas">video content</a> helps marketers overcome the feeling of disconnectedness we’ve suffered from in 2020.</p>
<p>“Everyone from landscapers to real estate agents to credit unions will need to use more and more video to overcome that and stay connected to people,” he said.</p>
<h3>12. Go live</h3>
<p>An extension of this video trend is live streams, which will also remain popular.</p>
<p>Reuben Yonatan, CEO of VOIP guide site <a href="https://getvoip.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GetVOIP</a>, noted a sharp uptick in brands going live during the pandemic to interact with consumers in real time.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="16d0fbe9-4309-4a8a-af64-b5de9a9831d7" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/instagram-live-promotion.jpg" alt="Instagram Live promotion example" width="373" height="807" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>“In 2021, going live will continue to be a rising marketing trend,” Yonatan said. “Going live leverages the fact that people working from home are spending more time on social media.”</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>For tips on live streaming, check out our <a href="/blog/ws/2017/07/31/facebook-live-guide">Facebook Live</a>, <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/30/instagram-live">Instagram Live</a>, and <a href="/blog/ws/2020/04/27/youtube-live">Youtube Live</a> tips.</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Ryan Gould, VP of strategy at B2B marketing agency <a href="http://www.elevationb2b.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elevation Marketing</a>, agreed it&#8217;s an inexpensive option to stay connected with consumers and foster more meaningful relationships.</p>
<p>“At the start of quarantine, we started seeing it done in a lot of unexpected businesses like shuttered restaurants teaching free cooking classes and yoga studios running free live sessions in order to keep consumers engaged while they can&#8217;t visit,” he added.</p>
<h3>13. Tap into micro-influencers</h3>
<p>2020 was a good year for <a href="/blog/ws/2018/03/21/social-media-influencers">micro-influencers</a> like Nathan Apodaca, the viral cranberry-juice-drinking TikTok star, and Tony Piloseno, another TikTok user with wildly popular paint-mixing videos who was fired by Sherwin Williams—and then hired by Florida Paints.</p>
<p>With <a href="/blog/ws/2020/07/22/tiktok-ads">TikTok</a> showing no signs of slowing down, the power of influencers—big and small—is expected to continue in 2021.</p>
<p>Lewis noted the pandemic amplified influencers’ impact on sales when in-store shopping options were limited.</p>
<p>“Social media use dramatically increased during the pandemic and research firms believe this trend will be lasting,” he said. “A recent study found that 40% of people reported that they purchased a product online after seeing it used by an influencer on YouTube, Instagram or Twitter.”</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="5549e9e7-4d3e-4ad6-8a70-7c12d1ea182a" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20marketing20strategies20for202021-influencer20marketing.png" alt="best marketing strategies for 2021—quote about influencer marketing" width="800" height="353" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>That’s because influencers speak on a more personal level and give honest opinions that resonate more with their followers, Lewis added.</p>
<p>“As traditional budgets were being cut, <a href="/blog/ws/2015/02/26/influencer-marketing">social influencers and bloggers</a> were seen as a lower-cost alternative to TV and radio,” said Joe Sinkwitz, CEO of influencer network <a href="https://intellifluence.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intellifluence</a>. “Now even with positive vaccine news and early-stage optimism over the possibility of normalcy come Q3 2021, we’re seeing a doubling down effect of influencer budgets expand as the early testing brands from early 2020 are now recognizing the channel is one worthy of reinvestment.”</p>
<h3>14. Use retailer media networks</h3>
<p>Retailers like Amazon and Walmart were among the few to actually benefit from changes spurred by the pandemic.</p>
<p>In recent history, Amazon has also diversified its<a href="/blog/ws/2019/05/01/amazon-advertising-tips"> advertising portfolio</a>, adding units like Sponsored Video Ads, Sponsored Display Ads and OTT ads.</p>
<p>“With these additions, Amazon has become a fully enclosed ecosystem, supporting the whole marketing funnel from product discovery to purchase,” said Natalia Wulfe, CMO of digital marketing agency <a href="https://www.effectivespend.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Effective Spend</a>. “Advertisers can use OTT and Sponsored Display to build awareness, video ads to educate and engage visitors and traditional sponsored product ads to drive transactions.”</p>
<p>Combined, these developments mean advertisers can enjoy better reach and performance on Amazon than ever before, Wulfe added.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Sponsored Video Ads, Sponsored Display Ads, and OTT ads on Amazon can yield better reach and performance in 2021 than ever before.</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Toby agreed the spike in ecommerce and related impact on budget allocations are projected to continue. He pointed to figures from eMarketer, which show advertising on ecommerce platforms jumped 39% in 2020 and will grow another 30% in 2021, capturing 13% of total U.S. digital ad spend.</p>
<p>Measurability is helping drive this change, Toby said.</p>
<p>“According to an April study from Catalyst and Kantar, advertisers believe leading ecommerce sites provide better measurability of ad ROI than many other digital ad types, including social media ads,” he added. “Additionally, ecommerce sites know a lot about their customers, which is key to ad targeting without reliance on third-party cookies.”</p>
<h3>15. Establish brand partnerships</h3>
<p>2020 brought us successful brand collaborations like <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/travis-scott--mcdonalds-highly-anticipated-partnership-launches-301126777.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McDonald’s and Travis Scott</a>, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90510038/adidas-and-allbirds-join-forces-to-design-the-worlds-most-sustainable-shoe">Adidas and Allbirds</a> and <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2020/september/adidas-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adidas and Lego</a>, which means more brand collaborations are likely on the horizon.</p>
<p>“Unexpected partnerships between corporate brands capture media attention, generate social buzz and allow for cross-marketing to customer bases—without celebrity endorsement fees, all of which plays well in an era of hard-to-capture consumer attention and tightened budgets,” Toby said.</p>
<p>But brands that, say, don’t have the resources to hire a Travis Scott can instead team up with brands that offer complementary products or services. That’s what thermal imaging brand <a href="https://thermogears.com/">ThermoGears</a> did when it was looking to <a href="/blog/ws/2014/08/14/increase-traffic-to-my-website">bring new visitors to its website</a>.</p>
<p>“Email marketing is one of the most cost-efficient marketing channels, but it&#8217;s only as powerful as the quality and size of your list,” said CEO Julien Raby. “One approach that is working well for us right now is co-branded emails. In short, we approach companies with an audience similar to ours to craft a deal involving both offerings. We then send this offer to both our email lists.”</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="b78ddffc-22e3-46b6-84a4-3483827e64da" data-langcode="en">

</article>
</div>
<p>One such company was a brand that produces hunting clothes.</p>
<p>“By sending a deal to our respective lists, we got access to a new audience without investing media dollars,” Raby added.</p>
<p>Now, the brand plans to double down on the tactic in 2021.</p>
<h3>16. Get into augmented reality</h3>
<p>Also expect to see more augmented reality (AR) executions in 2021. This will allow brands to show consumers what objects will look in their homes, like Ikea’s AR catalog, or how clothes or accessories look on their bodies, like Warby Parker’s virtual try-on app.</p>
<p>“The pandemic encouraged marketers to think uniquely for ways to connect with consumers who always stay inside their homes,” said Stephen Light, CMO of mattress retailer <a href="https://www.nolahmattress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nolah Mattress</a>. “The solution was AR marketing, which helped the target market get a feel of owning the product even without seeing it personally.”</p>
<p>He noted the biggest misconception about AR ads is they’re expensive, but they’re actually more budget-friendly than traditional channels.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.simple_image" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="1213fe1d-b259-49ab-8779-91d3dbd51ba6" data-langcode="en">
<article>
<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best20marketing20strategies20for20202120augmented20reality.jpg" alt="best marketing strategies for 2021—example of augmented reality" width="800" height="445" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p>“Besides being cheaper than print ads, AR ads can skyrocket engagement rates since they are more interactive and offer a newer experience than traditional marketing mediums,” Light added. “The best part about an AR ad is that marketers can reuse the content across various marketing channels, making it a cost-effective tactic for audience interaction.”</p>
<p>Daniel Snow, CEO of performance and social media marketing agency <a href="https://thesnowagency.com/">the Snow Agency</a>, too, said he plans to expand on augmented reality marketing in 2021 as it helps brands connect with consumers even in lockdown. Plus, by showing consumers what products look like, brands reduce the likelihood of returns.</p>
<h3>17. Automate what you can</h3>
<p>Another tactic to help decrease budget and increase efficiencies is <a href="/blog/ws/2020/09/01/automated-email-marketing">marketing automation</a>.</p>
<p>Sharon van Donkelaar, CMO at LinkedIn <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/08/05/b2b-marketing-automation-tactics">marketing automation</a> company <a href="https://expandi.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Expandi</a>, said automation helps free up employees from “many boring and routine business tasks.”</p>
<p>This includes <a href="/blog/ws/2020/10/15/smart-bidding">Automated Bidding </a>in Google Ads.</p>
<p><strong>“</strong>Google Ads marketers constantly tweak and adjust campaigns, keywords and bids to get the most for their advertising dollars,” said Thierry Tremblay, CEO of online database software <a href="https://www.kohezion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kohezion</a>. “The problem is all of the tweaking comes at a cost that is more in hours and higher management fees. Enter Automated bidding, which allows Google to automate prior moves to adjust your bid in real-time.”</p>
<p>Matt Bertram, CEO of digital marketing agency <a href="https://www.ewrdigital.com/">EWR Digital</a>, noted other automation software can develop, launch and analyze multiple campaigns on autopilot.</p>
<div class="embedded-entity align-center" data-embed-button="images" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:media.embed_image_narrow" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="1261cd8b-65f7-45fb-a239-ed310892d156" data-langcode="en">

<div><img decoding="async" src="https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google20ads20automated20bidding20strategies-3.png" alt="google ads automated bidding strategies" width="800" height="368" /></div>
</article>
</div>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>A chart we adapted from Google’s more comprehensive </em><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2979071?hl=en#:~:text=The%20power%20of%20Smart%20Bidding,to%20each%20and%20every%20auction." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>automated bidding breakdown</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>“At the end of each campaign it will test, <a href="/blog/ws/2017/08/28/behavioral-segmentation">segment</a>, and analyze conversions,” he said. “This leaves you with huge time savings<strong> </strong>and allows you to focus solely on monitoring the results and optimizing to improve future performance.”</p>
<p>And David Kolodny, cofounder of startup studio <a href="https://www.wilburlabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wilbur Labs</a>, noted the value of automation and real-time data skyrocketed in 2020 because it was so important to understand what was happening in the moment—and it’s impossible for manual processes to keep up with such rapid change.</p>
<p>“Though trends are smoother now than they were in March and April, we are still seeing rapid customer behavior changes on a daily basis and real-time data loops have directly contributed to greater marketing efficiencies,” Kolodny said. “By utilizing automation wherever applicable— and connecting it to real-time data—we have been able to ensure that our portfolio companies are maximizing every opportunity available to them. Real-time data and automation will be the difference between companies that excel in 2021 and those that are left behind.”</p>

<h3>18. Embrace B2B2C</h3>
<p>In 2021, we’ll continue to see <a href="/blog/ws/2017/04/11/how-to-get-a-remote-job">remote work</a> and unemployment, which will impact B2B marketing in particular.</p>
<p>Email marketing may suffer as a result of inactive email addresses, said Graham Smith, marketing director of B2B marketing consultancy <a href="https://www.marketinggraham.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marketing Graham</a>. That could, however, be a bright spot for LinkedIn InMail campaigns, which generally have high open and click-through rates.</p>
<p>Dillana Lim, CEO of data technology company <a href="https://versium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Versium</a>, recommended adopting a B2B2C approach by associating consumer attributes with business target lists.</p>
<p>“In other words, mapping a personal email address to a business email or a physical street address or cell phone to a name of a business professional at a particular business,” she said. “This means that B2B marketers can now utilize all the targeting capabilities that B2C marketers have been using for years to effectively reach their ideal prospects at scale across all digital touchpoints.”</p>
