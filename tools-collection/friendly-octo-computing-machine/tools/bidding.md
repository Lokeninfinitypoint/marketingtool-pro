# Bidding

### Bidding overview

The Bidding tool helps you set and manage bids for your keywords and ad groups so you can achieve your desired position and cost-per-conversion. By optimizing bids, you control how aggressively your ads compete in auctions and ensure you’re paying a reasonable amount for each click or conversion.

#### What it does

* Provides suggestions for manual bid adjustments based on performance data.
* Supports automated bidding strategies to maximize clicks, conversions, or return on ad spend.
* Allows bulk editing of bids across multiple keywords or ad groups.

#### How to use it

1. Go to **Tools → Bidding** in your Waduit dashboard.
2. Choose the campaign or ad group you want to manage.
3. Review current bids and performance metrics such as average CPC, position, and conversions.
4. Decide whether to use a manual bidding strategy (you set individual bids) or an automated strategy (the system adjusts bids based on your goals).
5. For manual bidding, enter new bid amounts for your keywords or ad groups.
6. For automated bidding, select the strategy (e.g., maximize conversions) and set any target CPA or ROAS values.
7. Apply your changes and monitor results.

#### Tips

* Regularly review bid performance and adjust bids for keywords that consistently underperform or overperform.
* Use automated bidding strategies when you have enough conversion data for the algorithm to learn effectively.
* Combine bid adjustments with negative keywords and audience targeting for better efficiency.
* Avoid drastic bid changes; instead, tweak incrementally to gather data on the impact.
