# Ad testing

### Ad testing overview

Ad testing allows you to experiment with different ad messages, headlines, descriptions, and calls to action to see what resonates best with your audience. By running controlled tests, you can improve click-through rates and conversions without guessing which creative will perform better.

#### What it does

* Lets you create multiple ad variations and run them against each other in a single campaign.
* Tracks performance metrics like impressions, clicks, conversions, and cost for each variant.
* Highlights the winning ad based on your chosen KPI (e.g., click-through rate or conversion rate).

#### How to use it

1. Navigate to **Tools → Ad testing** in your Waduit dashboard.
2. Select the account and campaign where you want to run tests.
3. Add your ad variants by editing headlines, descriptions, URLs, and extensions.
4. Choose the metric you want to optimize for (for example CTR or conversions).
5. Set a test duration or budget limit and launch the test.
6. Review performance reports regularly to see which variant is leading.
7. Once enough data has accumulated, pause the losing variants and keep the winner.

#### Tips

* Test one element at a time (e.g., headline vs. description) to isolate what’s driving performance.
* Make sure each ad variation is distinct enough to provide meaningful results.
* Run tests long enough to collect statistically significant data before making decisions.
* Use insights from your tests to inform future ad creative across campaigns.
