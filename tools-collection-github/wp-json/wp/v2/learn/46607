The text you typed into that small search box is called your \u201csearch query,\u201d which then directs you to a page similar to the image below. This page is known as a <a href=\"\/serp\">SERP, or Search Engine Results Page<\/a>. The higher you rank on the SERPs, the more traffic you&#8217;ll get to your website. But the question is: How does Google determine who gets these top placements?<\/p>\n<p>This is where search marketing comes into play.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/search20marketing20serp-1.png\" alt=\"serp search marketing\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"1167\" height=\"694\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Search marketing is divided into two main categories:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>SEO (Search Engine Optimization): The process of gaining search engine rankings via organic, unpaid tactics, such as content marketing.<\/li>\n<li>PPC (pay-per-click or paid advertising): The process of placing listings in search engines via paid advertisements.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Why Is Search Marketing Important?<\/h2>\n<p>The answer is simple. Every day millions upon millions of people hop on the internet to search, whether that be for a new restaurant, a problem they\u2019re trying to solve, or a product they\u2019re looking to purchase. Wouldn\u2019t you like your business to appear in the search results to provide them with the solution they\u2019re searching for? This is why search marketing is a critical strategy for all businesses who want to gain and grow their companies.<\/p>\n<p>Now that we know search marketing is critical for business growth, let\u2019s dive the two tactics that can improve your presence on search engines.<\/p>\n<h2>SEO (Search Engine Optimization) or Organic Search Marketing<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/30\/seo-basics\">SEO<\/a> is the process of growing your web presence via unpaid efforts. The unpaid links that appear in the search engine results are known as organic results, which are generally found below the paid search ads. See the image below \u2013 the organic results are the ones found in the green box below the top paid placements highlighted in blue.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/search20marketing20organic20vs20paid-1.png\" alt=\"organic vs paid search marketing\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"605\" height=\"638\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Search engines like Google find organic listings by crawling the internet with spiders that review the text on your website, PDFs, documents, and other content. Google also considers the data in your website\u2019s source code (called meta tags), and many other quality signals, such as site speed and how many other sites are linking directly to your website. For Google, the goal is always to provide the best results possible, so if people aren\u2019t clicking on your site from the SERP or if they have a bad experience once they get there, this can lower your rankings.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do I increase my chances of getting listed organically on Google?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is where SEO comes into play. There are several things you can do such as improve your chances of being ranked organically, such as optimizing your content to include relevant keywords, creating unique, valuable, high-quality content to build authority and links, and maintaining an active presence on social media to help grow an audience.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/localiq-grader?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=SEOpage&amp;utm_campaign=freemium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>How strong is your SEO?

Not to mention you\u2019re up against competitors who are also working for the same rankings. It&#8217;s still worth your investment to do SEO, but when you need results fast, paid search marketing might be your answer.<\/p>\n<h2>PPC (Pay-Per Click) or Paid Search Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>Paid search marketing can give you faster results than SEO, as well as a much higher level of control when it comes to your placement in the search results. Most businesses and websites will get the best results from a mix of paid and unpaid search marketing tactics.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does <a href=\"\/ppc\">paid search marketing work<\/a>?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>With paid search, advertisers tell Google exactly which search terms they want their ads to show for. When someone clicks on one of your paid search ads, you pay a set cost to the search engine (hence,<em> pay per click<\/em>). The amount you pay is called your <a href=\"\/cost-per-click\">cost per click<\/a> (CPC).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/ad-auction-updated.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-39190 size-full\" width=\"2843\" height=\"1672\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/ad-auction-updated.png 2843w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/ad-auction-updated-1280x753.png 1280w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/ad-auction-updated-980x576.png 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/ad-auction-updated-480x282.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 2843px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Your CPC is determined by several factors, including your max CPC (which you control), your <a href=\"\/quality-score\">Quality Score<\/a> (a measure of how relevant your ads and landing pages are to the keywords you&#8217;re bidding on), and the competition level for your keywords.
