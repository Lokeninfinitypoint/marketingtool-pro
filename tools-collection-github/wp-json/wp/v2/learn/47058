You can customize the code for different pages to correspond to more defined categories.<\/p>\n<p>For example, let&#8217;s say you operate an e-commerce business that sells kitchen supples. You might create a \u201ctoaster\u201d remarketing audience based on people who visit the pages of your site where you sell toasters. That way, you can show these specific visitors highly targeted display ads that market your toasters. You already know they are in-market for toasters, and now you can draw them back, perhaps with a special offer like &#8220;free shipping.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/content-remarketing-google-display-network-reach-compressor-1.png\" alt=\"Google Remarketing Content Display Network\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"1077\" height=\"711\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The Google Display Network reaches 92% of all Internet users<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Using remarketing, you can show <a href=\"\/google-ads\">Google ads<\/a> to your previous site visitors while they browse the vast number of Google partner sites in the Google Display Network.<\/p>\n<p>Google recommends that when you are starting your first remarketing campaign, you begin by targeting everyone who viewed your homepage.
