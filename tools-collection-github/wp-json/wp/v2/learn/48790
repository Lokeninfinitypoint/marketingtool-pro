It&#8217;s called &#8220;broad&#8221; because it allows your ad to match the widest range of possible keyword searches that are still somewhat related to your keyword.<\/p>\n<p>Google defines broad match as:<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Broad Match<\/strong> &#8211; This is the default option. If your ad group contained the keyword <em>tennis shoes<\/em>, your ad would be eligible to appear when a user&#8217;s search query contained <em>tennis<\/em> and <em>shoes<\/em>, in any order, and possibly along with other terms. Your ads could also show for <a href=\"\/keyword-plural\" title=\" misspelled keywords tool\">singular\/plural forms<\/a>, synonyms, and <\/em><em>other relevant variations<\/em><em>. For example, your ad might show on <em>tennis shoe<\/em> or <em>tennis sneakers<\/em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>So basically, this option lets you pick a term related to your business, and attempts to discover other terms that search engines deem relevant to your ad.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\"><strong><em>Use our Free Keyword Tool to find the best terms related to your business,<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>The Importance Of Broad Match Keywords<\/h2>\n<p>So what does all that mean to you? Why do you need to know about <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/08\/broad-match-audience-targeting-google-ads\">broad match<\/a>? Well, for starters, there&#8217;s this:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>This is the default option<\/em>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Your keywords are automatically set to the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/29\/succeed-with-google-ads-broad-match\">broad matching option<\/a> as you upload them, so it&#8217;s useful to understand the impact of leaving broad match turned on.<\/p>\n<p>The impact is that the keyword you&#8217;ve selected is now automatically being matched against a broad array of related queries. This has two interesting (and contrasting) ramifications:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Discover and bid on new, useful broad matched keywords<\/strong> &#8211; Broad match can provide you with a host of new phrases that the search engines deem relevant to your business. Phrases you wouldn&#8217;t be able to come up with on your own.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Discover and bid on completely irrelevant broad matched keywords<\/strong> &#8211; In addition to the good stuff this option will unearth for you, it will also match your <a href=\"\/ad-text\" title=\" commercial text\">ad text<\/a> to completely irrelevant keywords. The search engines, after all, offer automated solutions and don&#8217;t truly know your business.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So, we see that broad match is simultaneously adding quality phrases to our keyword lists while also spending our money on unrelated clicks.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a closer look at Google&#8217;s &#8220;tennis shoe&#8221; example to get a better idea of what we mean.<\/p>\n<h2>Google&#8217;s Expanded Broad Match<\/h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ll ask Google&#8217;s own keyword tool what it considers &#8220;relevant&#8221; to tennis shoes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/broad-match-1.gif\" width=\"364\" height=\"194\" alt=\"Broad match will find you a lot of quality keywords you wouldn't normally think to bid on.\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Here we see that Google has offered some suggestions; these all seem pretty good. If I sell tennis shoes, I&#8217;ll probably want to show for these. There could be a case where I sell high-end tennis shoes and don&#8217;t want to show for a phrase like &#8220;discount tennis shoes&#8221;, but on the whole this is pretty good.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not all the queries my ads are running against.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some more keywords Google may be matching your ads against:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/expanded-broad-match-1.gif\" width=\"360\" height=\"174\" alt=\"Google's expanded broad match creates matching options that the engine deems &quot;relevant&quot;.\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This is known as <a href=\"\/expanded-broad-match\" title=\" google adwords broad match type\">&#8220;expanded broad match&#8221;<\/a>. Around 2006 Google introduced this broad match expansion, which basically means that the engine&#8217;s algorithm more aggressively matches your ads against what it deems are relevant variations of your keywords.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is that these variations may not be all that relevant. We see here that Google has determined that these terms &#8220;may be relevant&#8221; to our business. But what if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>We only sell tennis shoes<\/strong> &#8211; Dress shoes and other tennis equipment certainly aren&#8217;t keywords we want our ad to show against, in that instance.<\/li>\n<li><strong>We only sell tennis equipment<\/strong> &#8211; Again, we don&#8217;t want our ad showing against dress shoes and basketball shoes.<\/li>\n<li><strong>We only sell shoes <\/strong>&#8211; We don&#8217;t want our ad to show for tennis equipment and rackets. Also, we won&#8217;t want our <a href=\"\/ad-text\" title=\" text link ad\">ad text<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/great-landing-pages\">landing page<\/a> talking about tennis shoes when our ad is appearing next to dress shoes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But, if we choose a more <a href=\"\/exact-match\" title=\" exact match definition\">restrictive matching option<\/a>, we may miss out on valuable variations of tennis shoes, like &#8220;tennis shoe&#8221; or specific tennis shoe brand names, etc.<\/p>\n<p>So, we need to find a means for implementing broad match without wasting money on irrelevant clicks.<\/p>\n<h2>Getting the Most Out of the Broad Match Type<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/27\/google-ads-match-type-update-2021-explained\">In 2021, Google announced improvements to the broad match type<\/a>, especially as it retired modified broad match six months prior. Even still, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/06\/broad-match-smart-bidding\">you need to be careful with using broad match<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The only way to use the expanded reach of broad match while restricting that reach to only relevant queries is to implement <a href=\"\/negative-keywords\" title=\" negative keyword generator\">negative keywords<\/a> within your account.<\/p>\n<p>Setting a negative keyword tells search engines: &#8220;Don&#8217;t show my ad against this query.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The challenge with negative keywords is much the same as the challenge with <a href=\"\/keyword-research\" title=\" free keyword research tool\">keyword research<\/a> and discovery: how do you find all the keywords you <em>don&#8217;t<\/em> want your ad to show against?<\/p>\n<h2>Try WordStream&#8217;s Free Keyword Tool to Find Your Best Keywords<\/h2>\n<p>Our Free Keyword Tool provides suggestions for Google and Bing separately so you can refine your targeting on each search network.
