Unlike search engines, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/search-engine-spider\">which use web crawlers<\/a> to visit websites and collect data for indexation, search directories are populated through processes of application and approval.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/dmoz-odp.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Open Directory Project (DMOZ)<\/a>, maintained by a massive global network of volunteer editors, is a well-known example of a search directory.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;>  <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/search-directory-dmoz-1.jpg\" width=\"468\" height=\"226\" alt=\"search-directory-dmoz-homepage\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\"><\/div>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Why are search directories important?<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/seo\">Search engine optimization (SEO)<\/a> refers to all the different practices a website can enact to improve its performance in the organic (non-paid) section of search engine results pages (SERPs). The ultimate goal is to rank on the first page, ideally near the top. Ask yourself: when was the last time you went to the second page of Google search results?<\/p>\n<p>SEO is often divided into two categories of practices: on-page and off-page. For our purposes, we will only discuss the latter. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/13\/off-page-seo\">Off-page SEO<\/a> involves doing work outside of your own website to improve its performance. Although this work can be broken into several strategies, there is one true endgame with off-page SEO: to earn links from other websites to your website. Every time you earn a link from an outside resource, you build a little more <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/learn\/seo\/domain-authority\">Domain Authority<\/a>&mdash;a huge factor behind organic search ranking.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;>  <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/search-directory-domain-authority-1.jpg\" width=\"468\" height=\"280\" alt=\"search-directory-domain-authority-illustration\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\"><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Getting your site listed in a search directory is important because it creates a strong inbound link to your website. If a directory you&rsquo;re interested in doesn&rsquo;t charge an entry fee, it&rsquo;s definitely worthwhile to apply for a listing. When it comes to Domain Authority, every link counts.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, despite their declining popularity among Internet users, search directories do drive traffic. Again: if it&rsquo;s free, why not? It&rsquo;s another way to attract new visitors to your website. And, considering the highly categorized nature of sites like DMOZ, it&rsquo;s safe to assume that the traffic driven to your site is relevant to your business&mdash;search directory users need to work to find your site. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/30\/commercial-intent-keywords\">Intent like that<\/a> is what makes prospect convert into customers.<\/p>\n<h2>How do I get listed in a search directory?<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Different search directories have different submission processes. And, like we said&mdash;some will charge you. Considering its popularity, significance, and lack of an entry fee, we&rsquo;ll look at the <a href=\"http:\/\/dmoz-odp.org\/docs\/en\/add.html\">process for getting listed<\/a> on DMOZ.<\/p>\n<p>First things first: make sure your site isn&rsquo;t already listed!<\/p>\n<p>If not, then it&rsquo;s time to assess whether your site is appropriate for listing. Based on the DMOZ guidelines, you can ask yourself the following questions to make this assessment:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does your site contain only the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/06\/duplicate-content\">same or very similar content<\/a> as a site that&rsquo;s already listed?<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Does your site redirect to another site?<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Does your site have a lot of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2010\/06\/02\/how-to-find-and-fix-broken-links\">broken links<\/a>, graphics, and images?<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Does your site consist largely of affiliate links?<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Does your site contain illegal content?<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>(Yes, those guidelines did go from 0 to 100 real quick.)<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hopefully, you answered those five questions with resounding no&rsquo;s. If that&rsquo;s the case, it&rsquo;s time to submit! Select the single most relevant category and submit your site there. Don&rsquo;t apply for multiple categories or repeatedly submit your site. These will both get you in trouble.<\/p>\n<p>If your site is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/information-architecture\">well-built<\/a>, regularly updated and improved, and full of informative content, you should have no problem getting accepted!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Similar to the yellow pages in a phone book, a search directory is a categorized online index of websites.
