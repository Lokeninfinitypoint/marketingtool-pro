To go in-depth with bids, please go here. In the meantime, let\u2019s talk a little more about search terms, keywords, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/search-marketing\">search marketing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Paid Search Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>For the sake of simplicity, let\u2019s stick to Google for now. Google\u2019s paid search advertising platform is called Google Ads (formerly known as AdWords) and it is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/ppc\">pay-per-click (PPC)<\/a> system. This means that a given advertiser pays Google a small fee every time one of its ads is clicked by a Google user.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/search-term-average-cpc-1.jpg\" width=\"468\" height=\"526\" alt=\"search-term-cost-per-click\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The ads you see when using Google depend on the search term you enter. More accurately, the ads depend on the keywords you enter. Essentially, an advertiser identifies the words and phrases (known as keywords) that are relevant to its business. Then, the advertiser declares a bid for each relevant keyword. A bid is the maximum amount of money the advertiser will pay per click for ads linked to a given keyword.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Nike will identify \u201crunning shoes\u201d as a keyword and bid, say, $5 per click. Then, when a consumer enters the search term \u201cmens running shoes,\u201d Google runs an automated auction that involves every advertiser, including Nike, that has bid on keywords connected to \u201cmens running shoes.\u201d In the end, the winners of the auction get the top advertising spots.

It should come as no surprise that the basic goal of SEO is to get on the first page. Just like paid search marketing, SEO revolves around search terms and keywords.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/11\/search-terms-organic-results.png\" alt=\"search terms - organic results example\" width=\"600\" height=\"655\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-51690\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/11\/search-terms-organic-results.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/11\/search-terms-organic-results-480x524.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Organic search results for &#8220;buy a car&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Google wants to deliver to its users relevant, high-quality search results. Thus, Google has an algorithm (which changes every day) to determine which websites get on the first page and how they\u2019re ordered. In order to be one of the top results, a website must be a reputable, authoritative source, and its content must be relevant to the search term.<\/p>\n<p>To be considered reputable, a website must accumulate <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/learn\/seo\/domain-authority\">Domain Authority<\/a>, which is best achieved by getting its content linked to by other reputable sites. Similarly, in order for a single piece of content to attain Page Authority, it must earn a lot of good, outside links. To do this, a site must create informative, engaging content that people want to consume, cite, and share with others, particularly on social media. As you can imagine, earning Domain Authority and Page Authority are not overnight processes.<\/p>\n<p>For a website\u2019s page or piece of content to be considered relevant to a given search term, it must be centered around a keyword. For example, if you run a Boston sports blog, and you want an article to rank highly for searches containing \u201ctom brady,\u201d that keyword should be included in nearly every part of the page: title, headline, URL, subheadings, body copy, image names, and alt texts. Although Google punishes those who unnaturally \u201cstuff\u201d their content full of the keyword, using it reasonably is essential to being considered relevant.<\/p>\n<p>At first glance, \u201csearch term\u201d appears to be an insanely simple thing. But, as you can see, it\u2019s an instrumental part of search marketing \u2013 both paid and unpaid.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A search term, otherwise known as a search query, is the word or phrase someone enters into a search engine, such as Google.
