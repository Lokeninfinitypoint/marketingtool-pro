It&#8217;s calculated using a proprietary formula and measures how relevant your keyword is to your ad group and to a user&#8217;s search query. Quality Score is measured on a scale from 1-10.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-does-google-ads-work-quality-score-definition.png\" alt=\"how does google ads work - quality score\" width=\"720\" height=\"385\" class=\"size-full wp-image-57338 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-does-google-ads-work-quality-score-definition.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/how-does-google-ads-work-quality-score-definition-480x257.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>So why is this important?<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/quality-score\">Quality Score<\/a> is important because the higher a keyword&#8217;s Quality Score, the lower its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/cost-per-click\">cost per click<\/a> (CPC) and the better its ad position. Why? Because Google doesn&#8217;t make money if users don&#8217;t click on its ads, so it benefits Google to serve ads that are relevant and trustworthy.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/14\/how-does-google-ads-work\">how the Google Ads auction works<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p>When your ad gets entered into the Google Ads auction, Google will first calculate your Quality Score. It will then multiply your Quality Score by your maximum bid to determine your Ad Rank. The ads with the highest Ad Rank scores are the ones that show. Google then calculates your cost per click by taking the Ad Rank score of the ad below yours, dividing it by your Quality Score, then adding one cent.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a mouthful (and you can catch the full visual and explanation in the link above), but the important thing to know is that because of these formulas, higher Quality Scores equate to higher ad positions at lower costs.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/06\/why-quality-score-matters.png\" alt=\"diagram showing that higher quality score equates to lower costs in google ads\" width=\"720\" height=\"564\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64537 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/06\/why-quality-score-matters.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/06\/why-quality-score-matters-480x376.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>How to improve your Google Ads Quality Score<\/h2>\n<p>High Quality Scores are obviously important if you want to get the best advertising value and rate of return possible.\u00a0The question then becomes, how are the scores calculated?\u00a0Google\u00a0reports that the core components of Quality Score are as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>historical click-through rate <\/strong>(CTR) of the keyword and the matched ad on Google<\/li>\n<li>Your <a href=\"\/adwords-account\"><strong>Google Ads account<\/strong><\/a><strong> history<\/strong>, which is measured by the CTR of all the ads and keywords in your account<\/li>\n<li>The <strong>historical CTR of the display URLs <\/strong>in the ad group<\/li>\n<li>The <strong>quality of your landing page <\/strong><\/li>\n<li>The <strong>relevance of the keyword to the ads <\/strong>in its ad group<\/li>\n<li>The <strong>relevance of the keyword and the matched ad to the search query <\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Your account&#8217;s performance <\/strong>in the geographical region where the ad will be shown<\/li>\n<li>Other relevance factors<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So basically, you need to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Maintain a high <a href=\"\/ppc-click-through-rate\" title=\" what is ppc click-through rate\">PPC\u00a0click-through rate<\/a><\/strong> &#8211; The <a href=\"\/click-through-rate\" title=\" ad click through rate\">click-through rate<\/a> is the percentage of people seeing your ad who actually click on it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Create relevant ad groups<\/strong> &#8211; An <a href=\"\/ad-groups\" title=\" adwords ad group\">ad group<\/a> consists of an association of one or more specific keywords which in turn trigger the display of one or more <a href=\"\/ad-text\" title=\" text link ad\">text ads<\/a>.
