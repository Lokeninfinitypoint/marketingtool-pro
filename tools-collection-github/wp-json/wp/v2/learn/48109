These ads appear when people search for things online using a search engine like Google \u2013 especially when they are performing commercial searches, meaning that they&#8217;re looking for something to buy. This could be anything from a mobile search (someone looking for &#8220;pizza near me&#8221; on their phone) to a local service search (someone looking for a dentist or a plumber in their area) to someone shopping for a gift (&#8220;Mother&#8217;s Day flowers&#8221;) or a high-end item like enterprise software. All of these searches trigger pay-per-click ads.<\/p>\n<p>In pay-per-click advertising, businesses running ads are only charged when a user actually clicks on their ad, hence the name \u201cpay-per-click.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Other forms of PPC advertising include display advertising (typically, serving <a href=\"\/smart-ads-creator\">banner ads<\/a>)\u00a0and remarketing.<\/p>\n<h2>How Does Pay-Per-Click Advertising Work?<\/h2>\n<p>In order for ads to appear alongside the results on a search engine (commonly referred to as a Search Engine Results Page, or SERP), advertisers cannot simply pay more to ensure that their ads appear more prominently than their competitor\u2019s ads. Instead, ads are subject to what is known as the Ad Auction, an entirely automated process that Google and other major search engines use to determine the relevance and validity of advertisements that appear on their SERPs.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSPPC101Guide.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_PPC_PPC101_Download\"><em><strong>Need help with your PPC ad campaigns? Check out our free beginner&#8217;s guide to Google Ads.<\/strong><\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>How Keywords Work in Pay-Per-Click Advertising<\/h3>\n<p>As its name implies, the <a href=\"\/articles\/what-is-google-adwords\">Ad Auction<\/a> is a bidding system. This means that advertisers must bid on the terms they want to \u201ctrigger,\u201d or display, their ads. These terms are known as keywords.<\/p>\n<p>Say, for example, that your business specializes in camping equipment. A user wanting to purchase a new tent, sleeping bag, or portable stove might enter the keyword \u201ccamping equipment\u201d into a search engine to find retailers offering these items.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/pay-per-click-advertising-camping-equipment-example-1.png\" alt=\"Pay per click advertising example SERP\" width=\"650\" height=\"334\" \/><br \/>\nAt the moment the user submits their search query, the search engine performs the complex algorithmic calculations that the Ad Auction is based upon. This determines which ads are displayed, in which order, and by which advertiser.<\/p>\n<p>Since you have to pay for each click on your ads, it&#8217;s imperative to only bid on keywords that are relevant to your business, so you can be sure to get ROI from your ad spend. A <a href=\"\/keywords\">keyword tool<\/a> can help you find the right keywords to bid on that are both likely to drive sales or conversions, and are not prohibitively expensive.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Optimize Your Pay-Per-Click Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Pay-per-click marketing can be a very <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/17\/lower-cost-per-click\">cost-effective way<\/a> to drive traffic to your website and grow your business. But it takes time and effort to do it right. A number of factors can affect your PPC costs, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The relevance of the keywords you choose to bid on<\/strong> &#8211; Are they the search terms your best audience is really using to find products they want to buy, or solutions to their problems?<\/li>\n<li><strong>The quality of your ads and landing pages<\/strong> &#8211; Google awards the best ad placements and the lowest costs to businesses that provide a good consumer experience. Your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/click-through-rate\">click-through rate, or CTR<\/a>, is a good indication of whether or not your ad creative is resonating with people.<\/li>\n<li><strong>A solid account structure<\/strong> &#8211; Your PPC account is like a house.
