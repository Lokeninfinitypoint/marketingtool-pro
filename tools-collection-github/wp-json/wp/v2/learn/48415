Generally, white hat SEO refers to any practice that improves your search rankings on a search engine results page (<a href=\"\/serp\" title=\"serp\">SERP<\/a>) while maintaining the integrity of your website and staying within the search engines&#8217; terms of service. These tactics stay within the bounds as <a href=\"http:\/\/googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com\/2008\/11\/googles-seo-starter-guide.html\">defined<\/a> by Google. Examples of white hat SEO include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Offering quality content and services<\/li>\n<li>Fast site loading times and mobile-friendliness<\/li>\n<li>Using descriptive, keyword-rich <a href=\"\/meta-tags\" title=\" meta tags seo\">meta tags<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Making your site easy to navigate<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Examples of black hat SEO, by contrast, include purchasing links or using deceptive cloaking techniques. Any tactics that are considered deceitful or harmful for consumers would qualify as black hat. Black hat tactics are extremely risky and, as <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/12\/07\/google-algorithm-update\">Google&#8217;s algorithms<\/a> evolve, less and less likely to work.<\/p>\n<h3>Why Are White Hat SEO Techniques Important?<\/h3>\n<p>Failure to engage only in White Hat SEO practices can get your site banned from Google and other search engines.<\/p>\n<p>As the number one search engine, Google is visited by billions of people per day, and\u00a0each visit\u00a0presents the potential for your site to be discovered by a\u00a0new user.<\/p>\n<p>Google is\u00a0an undeniably\u00a0powerful source of traffic to your website, and being banned can result in a drastic drop in website traffic and even business. Consider all the work that goes into your website and then think about what it would be like to be banned from the internet&#8217;s most commonly used search engine. What&#8217;s worse, once you&#8217;re banned from Google, there is no guarantee that they will ever re-list you. A lifetime ban from Google would have tremendous consequences.<\/p>\n<p>Why risk it?
