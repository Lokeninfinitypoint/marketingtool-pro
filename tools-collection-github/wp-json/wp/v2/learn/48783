You know those sponsored ads you often see at the top of Google\u2019s search results page? That\u2019s pay-per-click advertising (specifically <a href=\"\/google-adwords\">Google Ads PPC<\/a>, which we\u2019ll talk about below).<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/what-is-google-ads-serp-paid-organic-1.png\" alt=\"paid vs organic results in google serp\" width=\"633\" height=\"647\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-47172\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/what-is-google-ads-serp-paid-organic-1.png 633w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/what-is-google-ads-serp-paid-organic-1-480x491.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 633px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nHere\u2019s how it works: Every time your ad is clicked, sending a visitor to your website, you pay the search engine a small fee. (That\u2019s why it\u2019s called \u201cpay per click.\u201d) When your <a href=\"\/ppc\">PPC<\/a> campaign is well-designed and running smoothly, that fee will be trivial, because\u00a0the visit is worth more to your business than what you pay for it. For example, if you pay $10 for a click, but the click results in a $300 sale, then using PPC is a no-brainer.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, pay-per-click marketing is good for everyone:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s good for searchers\u00a0<\/strong>\u2013 Research indicates that searchers click on\u00a0<a href=\"\/paid-search\" title=\"paid search\">paid search<\/a>\u00a0ads more often than any other form of digital advertising. This means that people really <em>don\u2019t<\/em> mind being advertised to, provided that the products and services advertised actually fit the searcher\u2019s needs. And because we use search engines when we\u2019re looking for products and services, the results, including the ads, are generally highly relevant to what we\u2019re looking for. Plus, Google has developed an excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/17\/ppc-formulas\">formula<\/a> for ensuring that PPC ads meet the user\u2019s needs.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s good for advertisers\u00a0<\/strong>&#8211; Advertisers are offered a unique means of putting their message in front of an audience who is actively and specifically seeking out their product. Because searchers reveal their <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/30\/commercial-intent-keywords\">intent<\/a> through their search query, advertisers are able to measure the quality of traffic that results from search engine clicks.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s good for search engines\u00a0<\/strong>\u2013 PPC enables search engines to cater to searchers and advertisers simultaneously. The searchers comprise their user-base, while the advertisers provide them with their revenue stream. The engines want to provide relevant results, first and foremost, while offering a highly targeted, revenue-driving advertising channel.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The unique advantage of PPC marketing is that Google (and other ad networks) don\u2019t just reward the highest bidders for that ad space, they reward the highest-quality ads (meaning the ads that are most popular with users). Essentially, Google rewards good performance. The better your ads, the greater your click-through rates and the lower your costs.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLWebBlogInContentTextLinkAllStarPlaybook.html?cid=Web_Blog_InContent_TextLink_AllStarPlaybook_Download\"><em><strong>Need more help with your ad campaigns? Check out our free, all-star playbook to online advertising.<\/strong><\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Google Ads for Pay-Per-Click Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>Google Ads, formerly known as Google AdWords \u2013 by far the most popular PPC platform \u2013 operates on a pay-per-click model, in which users bid on keywords and pay for each click on their advertisements.<\/p>\n<p>Every time a search is initiated, Google digs into the pool of bidding advertisers and chooses a set of winners to appear in the ad space on its search results page. The \u201cwinners\u201d are chosen based on a combination of factors, including the quality and relevance of their <a href=\"\/keyword\">keywords<\/a> and <a href=\"\/ad-text\">ad text<\/a>, as well as the size of their keyword bids. For example, if WordStream bid on the keyword \u201cPPC software,\u201d our ad might show up in the very top spot on the Google results page.<\/p>\n<p>More specifically, who gets to appear on the page and where is based on an advertiser\u2019s Ad Rank, a metric calculated by multiplying two key factors \u2013 CPC Bid (the highest amount an advertiser is willing to spend) and\u00a0<a href=\"\/quality-score\">Quality Score<\/a>\u00a0(a value that takes into account your click-through rate, relevance, and landing page quality, among other factors). In turn, your Quality Score affects your actual cost per click, or <a href=\"\/cost-per-click\">CPC<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This system allows winning advertisers to reach potential customers at a cost that fits their budget.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/14\/how-does-google-ads-work\">View the full infographic here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/05\/google-ads-auction-shortened.jpg\" alt=\"the google ads auction\" width=\"615\" height=\"1861\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-58881\" \/><br \/>\nThe good news for advertisers\u00a0is that in giving the search engines what they want (relevant\u00a0<a href=\"\/pay-per-click-ads\" title=\" pay per click ad\">pay-per-click ads<\/a>) you&#8217;re also delivering targeted advertisements to people who are literally\u00a0<em>seeking out<\/em>\u00a0your product. It\u2019s a win-win.<\/p>\n<h2>Is Pay-Per-Click Marketing Right for You?<\/h2>\n<p>As we\u2019ve established, PPC advertising offers a unique opportunity to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Grow Your Customer Base<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; Connect with searchers actively looking for products and services like yours, and respond to that need by providing them with an offer relevant to their search query.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Generate Leads at Low Costs<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; Because pay-per-click marketing allows you to reach leads and prospects when they\u2019re researching and looking to buy, it\u2019s a highly effective way to bring interested visitors to your site. Plus, you can enjoy an algorithmically generated discount from the search engines in exchange for making their users happy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The truth is, pay-per-click marketing can work for almost any kind of business, whether you\u2019re looking to sell products through an e-commerce website, generate leads for a service-based or software business, build brand awareness, or even drive foot traffic and <a href=\"\/call-tracking\">phone calls<\/a> to your local store.<\/p>\n<p>The difficulty is in the execution. In order to get the most out of your pay-per-click marketing\u00a0campaign, you need to follow a few best practices.<\/p>\n<h2>Keyword Research for Pay-Per-Click Marketing<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"\/keyword-research\">Keyword research<\/a>\u00a0for PPC can be time-consuming, but it is also incredibly important.<\/p>\n<p>Your entire PPC campaign is built around keywords, and the most successful Google advertisers continuously grow and refine their PPC keyword list (ideally, using a variety of tools, not just <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/04\/25\/keyword-planner\">Keyword Planner<\/a>). If you only do keyword research once, when you create your first campaign, you are probably missing out on hundreds of thousands of valuable, long-tail, low-cost and highly relevant keywords that could be driving traffic to your site.<\/p>\n<p>An effective PPC keyword list should be:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Relevant<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 Of course, you don&#8217;t want to be paying for\u00a0<a href=\"\/web-traffic\">Web traffic<\/a>\u00a0that has nothing to do with your business. You want to find targeted keywords that will lead to a high\u00a0<a href=\"\/ppc-click-through-rate\">PPC click-through rate<\/a>, a low <a href=\"\/cost-per-click\">cost per click<\/a>, and increased profits. That means the keywords you bid on should be closely related to the offerings you sell.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Exhaustive<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 Your keyword research should include not only the most popular and frequently searched terms in your niche, but also extend to\u00a0<a href=\"\/long-tail\">the long tail of search<\/a>. Long-tail keywords are more specific and less common, but they add up to account for the majority of search-driven traffic. In addition, they are less competitive, and therefore less expensive.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Expansive<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 PPC is iterative. You want to constantly refine and expand your campaigns, and create an environment in which your keyword list is constantly growing and adapting.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Your pay-per-click keyword strategy should also include regular <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/04\/negative-keyword-list\">negative keyword discovery<\/a> \u2013 negative keywords prevent your ads from showing up for searches that are <em>not<\/em> relevant to your business and are unlikely to convert.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\"><strong><em>Use the Free Keyword Tool to find hundreds of relevant keywords for your campaigns!<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Managing Your Pay-Per-Click Campaigns<\/h2>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve created your new campaigns, you\u2019ll need to manage them regularly to make sure they continue to be effective.
