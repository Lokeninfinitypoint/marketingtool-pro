Video advertising will remain insanely popular<\/h3>\n<p>The popularity of social media video advertising has increased dramatically over time, and video ads are now used by a wide range of different businesses.<\/p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t surprising when you consider that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/25\/facebook-video-ads\">Facebook video ads<\/a> enable marketers to tell in-depth brand stories and showcase their products with eye-catching assets.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, Facebook has invested heavily in its video offering.

Short-form video will reign supreme<\/h3>\n<p>Short-form content came onto the scene with Vine, exploded in popularity with TikTok, and is now taking over multiple social media platforms\u2014Facebook included. In fact, short-form videos have now become the default content type for many social feeds, and this trend will only continue to grow in 2025.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook actually beats TikTok when it comes to short-form video consumption among US audiences (Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hootsuite.com\/facebook-statistics\/#Facebook_video_stats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hootsuite<\/a>).

The &#8220;TikTokification&#8221; of creative content<\/h3>\n<p>TikTok is a social media phenomenon. The platform has swiftly acquired a colossal audience (that\u2019s still growing) and is now leading the charge when it comes to producing new social trends and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/types-of-social-media-content\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media content ideas<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Influencer-style direct-to-camera videos are hugely popular on TikTok, and this type of content is now infiltrating every social media platform.

Shoppable ads will be adopted at scale<\/h3>\n<p>Facebook has been consistently refining its social shopping offering over time, and the lines between online shopping and social media are becoming increasingly blurred.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook Shops came onto the scene in early 2020, which allowed businesses to showcase and sell their products directly through the Facebook and Instagram apps.<\/p>\n<p>Since then, the platform has continued to develop new social selling solutions.

Establish a clear creative direction<\/h3>\n<p>Wondering which creative style is going to drive the best results for your brand on Facebook? The classic user-generated content-style Facebook ads produce excellent results, especially for solution-based ecommerce products or lead-generation campaigns. This type of content tends to be less polished, with fewer logos and branded elements.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/user-generated-content-facebook.png\" alt=\"user generated content on facebook\" width=\"600\" height=\"676\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68279 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/user-generated-content-facebook.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/user-generated-content-facebook-480x541.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>However, many advertisers have now adopted this approach. You may want to try out trending sounds and engaging visuals to stand out in a competitive feed. If you\u2019re in the fashion or clothing industry, consider creating more polished videos with premium-style imagery, fast motion, and strong branding.\u00a0 Audiences expect to see clothing products showcased upfront, so make sure that you\u2019re placing your wares on center stage.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/24\/design-facebook-ads-free\">Here are some of the best free tools for designing Facebook ads like a pro.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/facebook-ad-templates-canva-tools.png\" alt=\"facebook ad templates in canva\" width=\"720\" height=\"304\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68283 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/facebook-ad-templates-canva-tools.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/facebook-ad-templates-canva-tools-480x203.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The key is to pick one approach and stick with it\u2014there\u2019s no time to sit on the fence!

Try out Advantage+ campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>Advantage+ campaigns are an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/27\/facebook-automated-rules\">automated campaign type<\/a> where Facebook optimizes campaign settings to maximize returns. They&#8217;re essentially streamlined conversion campaigns that reduce manual inputs for advertisers and save them time. Advantage+ will also run campaigns specifically for catalog ads and app installs, and automatically optimize your creative assets.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/facebook-advantage-campaigns.png\" alt=\"facebook advantage plus campaign example\" width=\"720\" height=\"361\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68280 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/facebook-advantage-campaigns.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/facebook-advantage-campaigns-480x241.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/1720288338140238\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Advantage+ campaigns have delivered positive returns for many brands so far, so they\u2019re worth pursuing, particularly for newer advertisers.

Use cost per result bidding to scale budget<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/08\/how-to-scale-facebook-ads\">Effectively scaling up your Facebook campaigns<\/a> is crucial to generating more conversions and improving the efficiency of your ad spend.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cost per result goal bidding<\/strong> (formerly cost cap) is a reliable and efficient method for budget scaling and can deliver consistent results for Facebook advertisers in 2025. Start by testing out several bids through CBO (Campaign Budget Optimization) with a minimum spend on each ad set. Since Facebook will automatically test various bids across different ranges, you\u2019ll be able to scale up successful tactics quickly and effectively.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/facebook-ads-bidding-cost-per-result-goal.png\" alt=\"facebook ads bidding - cost per result goal\" width=\"600\" height=\"500\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65848 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/facebook-ads-bidding-cost-per-result-goal.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/facebook-ads-bidding-cost-per-result-goal-480x400.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also be able to leverage these insights to set up larger ABO (Ad Budget Optimization) campaigns with increased spend on the best bids.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have a sufficient budget for testing multiple bids, then set up one ad set with a cost-cap bid slightly higher than your current Facebook CPA.<br \/>\n<a id=\"broad\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>4. Guide the algorithm with broad targeting<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll need to stick to <strong>broad audience targeting<\/strong> while scaling up your campaigns to allow the algorithm to collect data and implement optimizations. Stack Interest categories that have performed well previously to increase audience size.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-scale-facebook-ads-detailed-targeting.png\" alt=\"how to scale facebook ads - detailed targeting\" width=\"720\" height=\"352\" class=\"size-full wp-image-61646 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-scale-facebook-ads-detailed-targeting.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/how-to-scale-facebook-ads-detailed-targeting-480x235.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also important to guide the ad account in the early stages of your campaign if you\u2019re on a small budget.<\/p>\n<p>Try and use interest targeting to build relevant audience segments initially, and once you\u2019ve collected enough data, test out broader audiences with no interest layers to scale up your campaign.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to skyrocket your campaign scaling, don\u2019t obsess over finding the perfect ad for a specific target audience. Test everything on larger audiences to generate valuable insights and find a broad creative appeal that resonates with the majority of users.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Be patient with your Facebook ad sets<\/h3>\n<p>Whenever you make changes to your Facebook ads, you reset the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/13\/learning-period\">algorithmic learning period<\/a>. So try to avoid tweaking or adjusting your ad sets, particularly in the early stages of a campaign, to allow them to optimize effectively. This has always been advisable, and it seems like this will be more important than ever in 2025.<\/p>\n<p>Monitor ad set delivery to ensure that your results are improving over time and stick to 20% scaling every couple of days to maintain optimal performance. If you need to scale faster, duplicate the ad set to experiment with different tactics.<br \/>\n<a id=\"placements\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>6. Use multiple placements &amp; formats<\/h3>\n<p>Facebook offers advertisers a wide range of high-performing placements and formats, so make sure you\u2019re capitalizing on these opportunities with a proper balance of image, video, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/21\/facebook-carousel-ads\">carousel ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ad-placements-preview.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"607\" height=\"420\" class=\"size-full wp-image-12683 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ad-placements-preview.jpg 607w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ad-placements-preview-480x332.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 607px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re in ecommerce, TikTok-style reel videos can also deliver tremendous performance, so be sure to jump on this trend before it becomes too saturated.<\/p>\n<p>As I mentioned above, creativity will be key to differentiating yourself from the competition in 2025, so focus on engaging and unique executions. Adapt popular content styles from the likes of TikTok and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/22\/instagram-reels-ideas-for-businesses\">Instagram Reels<\/a> (e.g. presenters talking to members of the public, trending sounds, and hashtag challenges) and act decisively to avoid missing out.<br \/>\n<a id=\"reporting\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>7. Make the most of improved Facebook reporting features<\/h3>\n<p>iOS and other privacy updates have caused disruptions in the Facebook targeting and reporting ecosystem, but Facebook has been working on improvements and solutions that you can (and should) use to your advantage when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/26\/how-to-optimize-facebook-ads\">optimizing your Facebook campaigns<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For example, the\u00a0reintroduction of the 28-day click attribution window<b> <\/b>will be valuable for harvesting more granular insights and viewing demographic audience breakdowns in the ad account.

The more campaign data you can access, the easier it will be to implement effective optimizations.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also worth noting that new terms for self-serve ads manager accounts suggest that Facebook is both reducing its accountability and tightening restrictions, so keep an eye on these updates to stay in the loop.<\/p>\n<h2>Use these Facebook advertising trends &amp;
