Google crawls the web regularly to update its index, but it\u2019s got a lot of material to go through! Keep in mind also that some of the information on your Google My Business listing cannot be edited, updated, or removed, as it comes from other sources.<\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Why update my Google business listing?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>As mentioned above, updates and changes are\u00a0among the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/03\/google-my-business-optimization\">essential Google My Business optimizations<\/a> you can make to rank higher in local searches. The more active you are on the platform, the more signals you send to Google that your listing is accurate and trustworthy. The more Google trusts you, the higher you will <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/02\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps\">rank on Google Maps <\/a>and the local section of Google search. With a higher rank, you can enjoy the following benefits:<\/p>\n<h3>Get discovered<\/h3>\n<p>This benefit has to do with editing your category in Google My Business.\u00a0 By choosing a category, you enable your business to get discovered by people who are searching for the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/29\/how-to-promote-a-product\">product or service<\/a> you offer rather than your specific business name (think about how many customers don\u2019t yet know you exist). This is especially helpful for businesses whose name doesn\u2019t imply their offering. For example, \u201cSam\u2019s Auto Repair\u201d is pretty straightforward, but \u201cHappy Trails\u201d could be a dog walking service, hiking tour company, or a bike path paving company\u00a0(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/08\/business-name-ideas\">more creative business name ideas here!)<\/a>. Categorizing your business\u2019s Google listing is an easy way to get more of the right people to learn that you exist.<\/p>\n<h3>Further your reach<\/h3>\n<p>When you were a kid and you had a lemonade stand, where did you set it up? Not in the backyard or in the house, but on the street. Why? Because that\u2019s where people are. The same concept holds true for businesses today. If you want to be seen, you need to be where people are; and today, people are online.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, according to Google, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/advertising-channels\/search\/how-advertisers-can-extend-their-relevance-with-search-download\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">84%<\/a> of consumers use their computer or tablet to search for local businesses online, and 88% use their smartphone. By creating and maintaining your Google business listing, you can ensure that your business reaches as many consumers as possible where they are spending a lot of their time.<\/p>\n<h3>Drive leads<\/h3>\n<p>Unlike your lemonade stand from childhood, people are not just driving by\u2014they\u2019re actively searching for businesses like yours. They\u2019re on Google Maps and Google Search, searching for products and services near them and doing research to compare businesses. In order to get found by the people who have the intent to buy from you, you\u2019ve got to update your Google listing.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/what20is20google20my20business20business20profile20in20maps20fresh20n20clean20dry20cleaning-1.png\" alt=\"what is google my business business profile in maps fresh n clean dry cleaning\" width=\"800\" height=\"552\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Attract customers<\/h3>\n<p>According to the same study above, 34% of consumers who find a business through local search on their computer or tablet end up at its physical location, and the rate is even higher (50%) for those who search on mobile phones. In addition, 18% of local searches lead to a purchase within a day, versus only 7% of non-local searches. This means that the more <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/22\/stand-out-from-competitors-on-google\">your business stands out online<\/a>, the more likely it is that a customer will make a purchase within a day of searching for your business. The data shows that something as simple as a Google listing update can increase traffic to your store and boost sales.<\/p>\n<h3>Improve your SEO<\/h3>\n<p>Many people are intimidated by <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/12\/top-seo-trends-2021\">SEO<\/a> (search engine optimization), but SEO can be done in bite-sized pieces. One of the easiest ways to improve your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/12\/local-seo\">local SEO <\/a>is to update your Google listing and make sure the information in the rest of your listings is identical to that of your Google listing.<\/p>\n<p>Google is constantly crawling the internet for updated information in order to provide the most accurate and reliable search results. The more consistent your contact information is across the web, the more favor you&#8217;ll win in Google&#8217;s eyes.<\/p>\n<h3>Boost exposure<\/h3>\n<p>Search engines are not the only tool people use to find products and services they need. There are hundreds of apps and directories out there today that are more specifically directing people to the right destination for them. However, these platforms build their databases by crawling the web and relying on larger search engines to gather this information, such as Google. As a result, many of the listings in these smaller but more commonly used directories contain information that has trickled down through Google business listings. Update your Google listing to make sure that the hundreds of other applications out there will be populated with the right information and can <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/17\/website-visibility\">multiply your reach.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Having a Google business listing will do nothing to benefit your business unless it is accurate, consistent, and up to date. Do your job of maintaining your business listing so that Google can do its job of helping to get your business found by the people looking for it. More information for more people means growth for your business and more happy customers!<\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">When should I update my Google business listing?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>There are many different circumstances that will call for you to update or make edits to your Google business listing. Below are just a few.<\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Business moving or relocation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re moving the location of your business, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/26\/word-of-mouth-marketing\">word of mouth<\/a> will inform some, but not all. Announcing your move on social media will inform more, but not for long, as the posts will eventually get buried under new ones. In order to prevent the loss of existing customers and to promote the increase of new customers, update your Google business listing to ensure a seamless transition.<\/p>\n<p>Existing customers and community members may be aware of your new location, but what about future customers and community members? They won\u2019t know to visit your old location to find your new location. You don\u2019t even exist to them yet! This is why it\u2019s crucial to update your business listing with any and all changes to your information as soon as possible. Even the smallest changes need to be reported, such as to a different suite or floor within the same building. Accuracy is crucial in getting <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/best-free-business-listing-sites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online listings <\/a>and search engines to benefit your business.<\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">Multiple business locations<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Having multiple locations can be confusing for search engines and people.

However, it\u2019s important to only choose additional categories if these accurately describe your business.<\/li>\n<li>The primary category you choose should be the one that best describes your business. This ensures that your business can be included in both specific and broad searches. For example, when you choose the category \u201cIndian Restaurant\u201d your business can be included in searches for \u201cindian restaurant\u201d and \u201crestaurant\u201d.<\/li>\n<li>The categories you select also determine some of the additional features that Google makes available in the listing, especially attributes.

There are different groups of attributes based on the category of your business falls. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hair salons: takes walk-ins, accepts credit cards<\/li>\n<li>Restaurants: outdoor seating, gluten-free options, casual atmosphere<\/li>\n<li>Dry cleaners: drive-through, tailoring services<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The more information you provide to Google, the better Google can match you to relevant searches in Google Search and on Google Maps. Some attributes automatically appear based on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/24\/customer-feedback\">feedback<\/a> from customers, while others you will select manually.<\/p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">To edit the attributes in your Google My Business Listing via desktop:<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Log into your Google My Business account<\/li>\n<li>Choose Info<\/li>\n<li>Look for Add attributes next to the tag icon and click on the pencil to edit<\/li>\n<li>Review and select attributes for your business<\/li>\n<li>Attributes that have not been set are shown with a \u201c+\u201d symbol<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Important: Click or tap twice if an attribute does not apply.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/edit-update-google-business-listing-attributes-1.png\" alt=\"how to edit and update your google business listing attributes\" width=\"800\" height=\"332\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN\">To edit the attributes in your Google My Business Listing via mobile<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to the Google My Business mobile app<\/li>\n<li>Tap Profile, then Edit<\/li>\n<li>In the Attributes section, tap Edit<\/li>\n<li>Update your attributes then tap Apply<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Information you cannot change<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">There are some sections in your Google My Business profile that you can\u2019t change.
