Promotions are one way to do it.<\/p>\n<p>Promotions have the power to encourage existing customers to repurchase and woo new prospects to your brand. How you choose to approach promotions is up to you. There are dozens of promotion ideas that work, so you can test several throughout the year and refine your tactics to get the greatest results.<\/p>\n<h2>The best promotion ideas for your business<\/h2>\n<p>Ready to explore some tried and true sales promotion ideas? Let\u2019s go.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Launch a flash sale<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/limited-time-offers\/\">Limited-time offers<\/a> can encourage your audience to take action. A flash sale can induce FOMO and spur them to buy before it\u2019s too late.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/promotion-ideas-example-walmart.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"936\" height=\"546\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81151\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/promotion-ideas-example-walmart.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/promotion-ideas-example-walmart-480x280.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>In honor of Valentine\u2019s Day, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.walmart.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Walmart<\/a> offered flash deals on jewelry.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Flash sales usually have an element of surprise\u2014they\u2019re launched without advanced warning\u2014and offer great bargains for a <em>very <\/em>limited time.<\/p>\n<p>How you structure your flash sale is up to you.

Start a seasonal promotion<\/h3>\n<p>Like a flash sale, a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/seasonal-marketing\/\">seasonal promotion<\/a> creates a sense of urgency for your audience.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/promotion-ideas-example-target.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"936\" height=\"411\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81152\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/promotion-ideas-example-target.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/promotion-ideas-example-target-480x211.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.target.com\/c\/valentine-s-day\/-\/N-5xt1e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Target\u2019s<\/a> \u201cpriced-right picks\u201d are an assortment of adorable Valentine\u2019s Day items. <\/em><em>Image source<\/em><\/p>\n<p>A seasonal promotion can be inspired by just about any timely event.

For example, your Leap Day Sale might feature a 29% discount on all purchases.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udea8 Get promotion ideas for every month and season &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite2024MarketingCalendar.html?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2024MarketingCalendar_Download\">The Mega Must-Have Marketing Calendar<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>3. Offer BOGO deals<\/h3>\n<p>Buy one, get one deals can be a win for you and your customers. Starting a BOGO sale promotion when you\u2019re trying to clear out seasonal inventory can move those items twice as fast. Meanwhile, customers enjoy steeper discounts than they might ordinarily see at your store.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t want to include all of your inventory in your BOGO offer, you can limit the items that fall under the promotion. A bar, for example, might offer BOGO deals on draft beer and well drinks only.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Conjure up a mystery discount sale<\/h3>\n<p>Sometimes, the element of surprise can inspire your audience to stop scrolling and pay attention to your promotion.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/promotion-ideas-mystery-discount.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"936\" height=\"517\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81153\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/promotion-ideas-mystery-discount.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/promotion-ideas-mystery-discount-480x265.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/inhhair.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Consider designing your promotion to embrace a little bit of mystery.

Or send an email to your subscribers with a \u201cscratch off\u201d deal where they can click a black box and reveal a promo code for your site.<\/p>\n<p>Combine this mystery discount with a limited time in which they may use it to tap into that sense of urgency and encourage a purchase.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udcda <strong>Free guide &gt;&gt;<\/strong>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download\">25 Ways to Increase Website Traffic<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>5. Host a social media contest or giveaway<\/h3>\n<p>Who doesn\u2019t love a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-run-a-facebook-giveaway-or-contest\/\">social media contest<\/a>? These promotion ideas can create an online buzz and help you expand your audience online.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/giveaway-ideas\">Giveaways<\/a> that encourage your followers to tag friends in the comments as part of entry introduce you to second-degree connections.<\/p>\n<p>Contests that invite people to vote for their favorite entrants encourage those contestants to share their posts with friends to drum up support.<\/p>\n<p>Either way, you are casting a wider net with your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-increase-social-media-presence\/\">social media presence<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Design a rewards or loyalty program<\/h3>\n<p>Showing your loyal customers a little bit of love is a way to reinforce your relationship. Why not offer a promotion as part of your rewards or <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-run-customer-loyalty-programs\/\">loyalty program<\/a>?<\/p>\n<p>There are several ways to structure it. Some businesses offer points for every dollar spent, which customers can redeem on future purchases. Other brands keep it simple with a punch card that rewards customers on every X visit with a free item or percentage off that purchase.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Establish a referral program<\/h3>\n<p>Your best future customer just might be one who knows a current customer. Studies have shown that customers who come to a business via referral are more loyal and have a <a href=\"https:\/\/faculty.wharton.upenn.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/Schmitt-Skiera-vandenBulte-2011-Referral-Programs-Customer-Value.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">16%<\/a> higher average value than those who find it through other channels.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/promotion-ideas-referrals.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"330\" height=\"597\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81154\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/promotion-ideas-referrals.webp 330w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/promotion-ideas-referrals-166x300.webp 166w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.stitchfix.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/customer-referral-program\/\">Starting a referral program<\/a> can help you tap into your current network of happy customers to meet new people who will come to know, like, and trust your brand. A formal program with an incentive can help get your referral engine purring.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Offer an influencer marketing discount code<\/h3>\n<p>Social media influencers have been around for a while now, but in the era of TikTok, their power only grows. Partnering with an influencer to promote your product can be a great way to tap into an existing community of people passionate about your field.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a makeup brand partnering with a makeup influencer doesn\u2019t have to worry whether the influencer\u2019s audience will care about its product. These people have self-selected to follow an account dedicated to makeup information and tips. That\u2019s the brand\u2019s dream audience!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/promotion-ideas-influencers.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"716\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81155\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/promotion-ideas-influencers.webp 716w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/promotion-ideas-influencers-480x402.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 716px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reel\/C2xpIt1Ppm0\/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re worried that <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/digital-marketing\/influencer-marketing-tips\/\">influencer marketing<\/a> is only for the big brands, you can put that fear to rest. Micro-influencers are an affordable, effective, and accessible channel for small businesses. And when you create a discount code for each influencer you work with, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-roi\/\">track the ROI<\/a> of your investment.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Create promotions for event attendees<\/h3>\n<p>Attending, sponsoring, or hosting an event requires a significant marketing investment. To make the most of the time and money you put in, you want your event to continue to pay dividends after it\u2019s over.<\/p>\n<p>Designing a promotion specifically for those you meet at the event is a great way to maintain contact with those individuals. Collect email addresses for event attendees and send a follow-up email. In it, you can thank them for attending or visiting your booth and offer a discount code or special offer as a token of your gratitude.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Promo partnerships with another business<\/h3>\n<p>With promotional ideas, sometimes two is better than one. Partnering with another local business to create a promotion can be mutually beneficial. You introduce each other to your respective audiences and expand the power of your offer by giving your audience access to both of your brands.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/promotion-ideas-business-partnership.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"847\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81156\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/promotion-ideas-business-partnership.webp 847w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/promotion-ideas-business-partnership-480x340.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 847px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/C3BhXNMRVYM\/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Creating a winning promotion with another business is about finding synergy. What partnership would help you both maximize your powers? A local brewery might make a beer that pairs perfectly with a pizzeria\u2019s signature pie\u2014on tap for a limited time, only at the pizza shop.<\/p>\n<h3>11. Send out direct mail offers<\/h3>\n<p>Direct mail may seem old school, but it remains a highly effective marketing tactic, even among younger generations. A study from the USPS found that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uspsdelivers.com\/2020-2021-generational-research-report\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">72%<\/a> of Gen Z respondents look forward to receiving mail, and 38% of them visited a website after getting a mailer.<\/p>\n<p>For local businesses, direct mail is a powerful way to greet your neighbors with promotions and offers at home. It\u2019s fun to get creative with direct mailers, but the offer can be as simple as a coupon on the card you send!<\/p>\n<h3>12. Use paid marketing for targeted offers<\/h3>\n<p>Some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/13\/sales-promotion-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sales promotion ideas<\/a> do best with advertising spend to back them up. Paid marketing is a great way to ensure you greet the right person with the right offer at the right time.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/promotion-ideas-display-ads.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"936\" height=\"265\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81157\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/promotion-ideas-display-ads.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/promotion-ideas-display-ads-480x136.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>TD Bank runs display ads for its promotional offer for new checking customers.

Donation promotions<\/h3>\n<p>Doing good is always a positive. Not only does it feel good, it shows your customers your caring side and makes them feel better about doing business with a kindhearted brand.<\/p>\n<p>Promotional ideas that allow you to give back can be a win for everyone: your team, your brand, your customers, and those you give to. Consider designing a promotion that rewards giving back, like a food drive before the winter holidays. When customers bring in canned goods, you offer them a percentage off their purchase.<\/p>\n<h3>14. Build promos around trends<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s always something new trending on the internet. Why not build your sales promotion ideas around the latest and greatest to capitalize on the buzz?<\/p>\n<p>The list of internet <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/14\/tiktok-trend-discovery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">trends<\/a> is ever-changing. The key here is to act quickly in designing your promotion to get your offer out there while the hype is still cresting. The easiest way to do that is to find one that\u2019s a natural fit for your brand.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/promotion-ideas-trends.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"723\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81158\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/promotion-ideas-trends.webp 723w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/promotion-ideas-trends-480x398.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 723px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reel\/C2afbO3JpcS\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This<\/a> vintage store built a social post around the \u201cmob wife aesthetic\u201d trend.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>15. Thank customers for their feedback<\/h3>\n<p>Are you looking to build up your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-respond-to-google-reviews-with-examples\/\">online reviews<\/a>? Consider offering a promotion as a thank you to someone writing a review on your website.<\/p>\n<p>Follow up with new customers, asking them to review their purchases. When they share their thoughts, you\u2019ll give them a thank-you percentage off to use next time.<\/p>\n<p>Just be careful to disclose that those reviews are incentivized, and be cautious about where you employ this tactic. Some sites (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.yelp-support.com\/article\/Don-t-Ask-for-Reviews?l=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">like Yelp<\/a>) do not allow businesses to solicit reviews.<\/p>\n<h3>16. Do \u201con the street\u201d promotion<\/h3>\n<p>Another way to make an impact with your promotion is to take it to the streets! A classic example is the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile, which has been on the road <a href=\"https:\/\/automotivehistory.org\/july-18-1936-the-wienermobile-debuts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">since 1936<\/a>, demonstrating the power of this promotional idea.<\/p>\n<p>Get out into your community, trumpet your brand, and offer giveaways or discount coupons to those you meet. To get extra mileage from this promotion idea, take videos and photos and reshare your adventures on social media.<\/p>\n<h3>17. Run a larger contest or sweepstakes<\/h3>\n<p>Social media contests are great for building your audience and growing engagement. But if you&#8217;re looking for a way to generate even more buzz and even better&#8211;leads&#8211;then a larger contest or sweepstakes is the way to go.<\/p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/custom-promotions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">custom promotion<\/a> like this can promote your business by attracting potential customers for a big, exciting prize. They get the opportunity to win something great and you get their contact information so you can follow up with them and nurture them through the funnel.<\/p>\n<p>By promoting your contest or sweepstakes across channels, like on social media, with display ads, and through email marketing, you can get your business in front of an expanded audience.<\/p>\n<h2>Find the right promotion ideas for your business<\/h2>\n<p>With so many tactics to try, you can run several promotions throughout the year to see what works best for your business. Test different approaches, measure your results, and note the successful ones you want to refine further.<\/p>\n<p>Most importantly, have fun! Promotions should be exciting for you and your audience. You get to generate more sales while your customers get access to deals. What\u2019s not to love?
