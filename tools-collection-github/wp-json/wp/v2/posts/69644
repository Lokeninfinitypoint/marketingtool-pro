The effect is cool and clickable, which is ideal for a restaurant looking to get reservations and online orders.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Bennett\u2019s<\/h3>\n<p>In case you\u2019re thinking appealing brand design is just for cool or upscale restaurants, let\u2019s look at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bennettssandwichshop.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bennett\u2019s<\/a>. This sandwich shop is located in Kennebunk, Maine, with additional locations in New Hampshire, Maine, and Boston.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-bennetts.png\" alt=\"restaurant website design examples - bennett's\" width=\"720\" height=\"358\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69653 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-bennetts.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-bennetts-480x239.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The line-drawn sandwich feels nostalgic, but the logo font is nice and modern. The black-and-white is also a sharp backdrop for the sandwich photos, and the fun, bright yellow accent. Plus, this works well for a sandwich place with a beach-town origin.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Shake Shack<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/shakeshack.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shake Shack<\/a> is a large fast-food chain with a young, modern feel.

An excellent way to communicate to potential patrons the feel-good center of this local chain.<\/p>\n<h3>6. The Lost Kitchen<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.findthelostkitchen.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Lost Kitchen<\/a> is a small, boutique restaurant opened by Erin French that exploded in the last few years. It\u2019s way more than just the restaurant now\u2014it\u2019s a BnB, a small goods store, cookbooks, and even a TV show. The website communicates this well, without losing sight of the brand.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-lost-kitchen.png\" alt=\"restaurant website design examples - lost kitchen\" width=\"720\" height=\"331\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69650 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-lost-kitchen.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-lost-kitchen-480x221.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The soft off-white backgrounds and deep gray fonts. The simple design. And notice the muted bucolic photos flanking the brighter, more colorful shot of Erin French. This keeps the heart of the restaurant, now the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/23\/how-brand-your-business\">brand<\/a>, at the center.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Giusto<\/h3>\n<p>Your restaurant doesn\u2019t need to have a celebrity chef or a TV show to be able to feature your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/04\/07\/unique-selling-proposition\">unique selling points<\/a>. Maybe it\u2019s a specific one-of-a-kind dish, maybe it\u2019s the location, maybe it\u2019s the family tradition. Whatever makes your place special needs to be highlighted on your website.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/giustonewport.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Giusto<\/a> does this really well. The restaurant has a small indoor section and a large, open-air bar and bar seating on a deck overlooking Newport, Rhode Island\u2019s harbor. This photo is, of course, on its homepage.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-giusto.jpg\" alt=\"restaurant website design examples - giusto\" width=\"720\" height=\"308\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69655 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-giusto.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-giusto-480x205.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>8. Pizzeria Beddia<\/h3>\n<p>Having a completely unique history, location, or focus is great (especially for your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/27\/guide-to-about-us-pages\">about us page<\/a>). But sometimes what makes your restaurant special can be more common: farm-fresh food, a local connection, a slow, handmade specialty.<\/p>\n<p>This still deserves top billing in any restaurant website design.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pizzeriabeddia.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pizzeria Beddia<\/a>, located in Philadelphia, showcases its handmade pizza and the process right on the homepage.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-pizzeria-beddia.jpg\" alt=\"restaurant website design examples - pizzeria beddia\" width=\"720\" height=\"343\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69658 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-pizzeria-beddia.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-pizzeria-beddia-480x229.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It looks delicious. Bonus points for the banner advertising the schedule change, too.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Rebel Rebel<\/h3>\n<p>If your restaurant has been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/04\/how-to-write-a-press-release\">featured in the press<\/a> or received any awards, this should go on your website. Depending on your brand, this could be a photo, a link, or a badge on your homepage.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rebelrebelsomerville.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rebel Rebel<\/a> is a natural wine bar in Somerville, Massachusetts that manages to share its achievements prominently without breaking out of its hipster-y personality.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-rebel-rebel.png\" alt=\"restaurant website design examples - rebel rebel\" width=\"720\" height=\"359\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69648 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-rebel-rebel.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-rebel-rebel-480x239.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Rebel Rebel celebrates its James Beard award with a simple banner\u2014letting everyone know, but not gushing or getting uncool.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Condesa<\/h3>\n<p>Whenever I\u2019m visiting a restaurant website (or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/14\/website-examples\">any website<\/a>, for that matter), I\u2019m looking for something. A menu, hours, social links, a reservation. That\u2019s why you need to prioritize easy navigation on your own site.<\/p>\n<p>I love how <a href=\"https:\/\/www.condesaphilly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Condesa<\/a>, a Mexican restaurant in Philadelphia, accomplishes this without the design looking utilitarian or boring.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-condesa.png\" alt=\"restaurant website design examples - condesa\" width=\"720\" height=\"376\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69647 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-condesa.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-condesa-480x251.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The left revolves through a gallery of restaurant photos, and the bold pink on the right has all of the information you need, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/13\/call-to-action-examples\">including a CTA<\/a> to book a reservation and another to order takeout. Nice and easy.<\/p>\n<h3>11. Rose Foods<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rosefoods.me\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rose Foods<\/a> also uses bright colors to show off its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/31\/brand-personality-messaging\">brand personality<\/a>. Located in Portland, Maine, this restaurant described itself across the internet as a house-made bagel shop featuring sandwiches and classic Jewish deli fare.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-rose-foods.png\" alt=\"restaurant website design examples - rose foods\" width=\"720\" height=\"351\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69646 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-rose-foods.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-rose-foods-480x234.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Because the focus is on classics, Rose Foods leans into retro fonts and kitschy line drawings and includes just a few photos. The effect? Based on the small shop\u2019s weekend waits and 20k <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/get-more-instagram-followers\">Instagram followers<\/a>, it works.<\/p>\n<h3>12. Uni<\/h3>\n<p>One of the reasons why a restaurant website is so important to get right is because it\u2019s often your potential customer\u2019s first interaction with your band. You want to include all of the basic information, as well as let them know what to expect when they visit you IRL.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a great example from <a href=\"https:\/\/uni-boston.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Uni<\/a>, an izakaya in Boston.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-uni.jpg\" alt=\"restaurant website design examples - uni\" width=\"720\" height=\"350\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69657 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-uni.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-uni-480x233.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The feel of the website is sleek, dark, intimate, and crowded (in a cozy way). This is exactly what Uni feels like inside.<\/p>\n<h3>13. Girl &amp; the Goat<\/h3>\n<p>Some restaurants have multiple locations that are nearly identical. But others have a few locations with distinct personalities. If that\u2019s your restaurant, make sure to convey this on your website. <a href=\"https:\/\/girlandthegoat.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Girl &amp; the Goat<\/a> does this well.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-girl-goat.jpg\" alt=\"restaurant website design examples - the girl and the goat\" width=\"720\" height=\"350\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69656 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-girl-goat.jpg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/restaurant-website-design-examples-girl-goat-480x233.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The interior of the Los Angeles location is light and airy with lots of natural sunlight and greenery. The Chicago location is darker and moodier with deep wood tones, black accents, and an ornate bar. The website features photos highlighting the appeal of each location\u2019s ambiance, as well as the same delicious food.<\/p>\n<h2>Make sure your restaurant website design delivers<\/h2>\n<p>Your restaurant\u2019s website is another element of your customer experience, so take advantage of that opportunity. You want to offer the same high-quality service, share the same information, invite the same ideal customers, and start forming that relationship right away.<\/p>\n<p>The restaurant website design examples above offer tons of great ideas for inspiration, and a few repeat essentials. Here\u2019s a quick run-down of the elements you should focus on to make sure your restaurant website as effective as possible:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Clear location or locations<\/li>\n<li>Easy-to-access
