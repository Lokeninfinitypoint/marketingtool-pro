From <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/15\/chrome-ad-blocker\">Chrome\u2019s baked-in ad blocker<\/a> to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/14\/amp-stories\">AMP-based creative<\/a> outlets and more, one thing\u2019s clear: Google understands users\u2019 unyielding desire for faster, better browsing, and is making it easier for businesses to identify ways to improve their site performance and content on mobile devices.<\/p>\n<h2>Using Google\u2019s Mobile Speed Scorecard<\/h2>\n<p>Google, internet-aggregator extraordinaire, knows that you, me, the guy who lives at the end of the hall, the three kids bouncing a tennis ball off your car for fun, we\u2019ve all got something in common: we aren\u2019t going to wait around for a website to load, <em>especially<\/em> if we\u2019re on our phones.<\/p>\n<p>While it might sound like a reskinned version of the mobile PageSpeed tool Google released in tandem with its <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/22\/google-speed-update\">Speed Update<\/a> at the beginning of February, the Speed Scorecard is another beast entirely. Its primary differentiator is that it gives you the ability to see how your site compares to your competition.<\/p>\n<p>Above the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/feature\/mobile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Speed Scoreboard<\/a>, you\u2019re asked to select your country and whether you would like your speed based on 3G or 4G metrics, like so:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f1c1e79f-30b4-4fb6-8ac4-db6e5959a3a9\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/speed-scorecard-country-network-speed.png\" alt=\"google speed scorecard country and network speed\" width=\"260\" height=\"54\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Google recommends that, on middle-of-the-road mobile devices, your website loads within five seconds on 3G and 3 seconds on 4G, respectively. In the event you\u2019re, say, Sports Illustrated (8 seconds on 4G, yikes), you\u2019ve got some work to do.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, 12 countries can be selected.

Instead, it\u2019s an aggregate score made up of three metrics that, frankly, go above my pay grade. So here\u2019s what Google has to say about them\u2026<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No single metric perfectly captures mobile site speed and user experience. As such, the ranking methodology is based on a combination of three metrics as reported across mobile devices by the CrUX Report: First Contentful Paint, DomContentLoaded and Onload. The site speed metric shows the 90th percentile of First Contentful Paint from the CrUX report. However, since rank is based on multiple metrics rather than on First Contentful Paint alone, sites with slower First Contentful Paint times may rank higher than sites with faster First Contentful Paint times.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Might as well be Latin, right?<\/p>\n<p>Basically, this says that your site speed is based on three metrics: First Contentful Paint, DomContentLoaded, and Onload. You should also know that, in the event one of the domains you\u2019d like to research doesn\u2019t show up, it\u2019s due to the fact that the Speed Scorecard\u2019s dataset is reliant on \u201ca subset of sites from the CrUX Report; if Google doesn\u2019t know you\u2014or your nemeses\u2014you\u2019re not going to get much utility out of the tool.<\/p>\n<h2>Translating the Impact Calculator<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cEven a one-second improvement could increase conversions.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That sounds ridiculous, right? The sort of whimsical grift foisted on fledgling #marketers two internships and a few hundred High Life\u2019s from a degree in [field]. But <a href=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/simple_image\/public\/images\/google-impact-calculator.gif?jfqVsO7XRiZcqyzf.V9SbBY2nZz_cOqA&amp;itok=9-uirTir\">watch it in action<\/a>\u2026<\/p>\n<p>While poor mobile experience agitates the hell out of site visitors, it also has the capacity to bleed your business.
