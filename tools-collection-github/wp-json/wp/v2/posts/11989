Earlier this month in March, we shared <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/09\/google-ads-benchmarks-your-industry-sneak-preview\">a sneak preview of Google Ads industry benchmarks for 2020 <\/a>and we felt great about what we had to share. Then a pandemic changed everything.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve seen COVID-19 change our daily lives, our businesses, and more over the past month. Even on the Google SERP, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/18\/covid-19-google-ads-data\">we\u2019ve seen COVID-19 impact Google Ads performance for several different industries<\/a> over the past weeks and many advertisers are scrambling to figure out how to adjust to the new normal in a rapidly changing landscape. But what is the new \u201cnormal\u201d in your industry? In this post, we dug into new data from the past three weeks and collected the performance for our own clients advertising across five different networks:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Search Ads<\/li>\n<li>Bing Search Ads<\/li>\n<li>Google Shopping Ads<\/li>\n<li>Bing Shopping Ads<\/li>\n<li>Google Display Ads<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We analyzed this data to provide the current benchmarks of what advertisers are seeing on these PPC networks, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Average click-through rate\u00a0(CTR) by industry<\/li>\n<li>Average cost per click (CPC) by industry<\/li>\n<li>Average conversion rate (CVR) by industry<\/li>\n<li>Average cost per action (CPA) by industry<\/li>\n<li>Average daily PPC advertising budget by industry<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You\u2019ll find averages across these PPC metrics for 21 industries: Arts &amp; Entertainment, Automotive, Beauty &amp; Personal Care, Business &amp; Industrial, Clothing &amp; Apparel, Computers &amp; Consumer Electronics, Dining &amp; Nightlife, Education, Finance, Food &amp; Groceries, Health &amp; Medical, Hobbies &amp; Leisure, Home &amp; Garden, Internet &amp; Telecom, Legal, Nonprofits &amp; Charities, Occasions &amp; Gifts, Real Estate, Retailers, Sports &amp; Fitness, and Travel &amp; Tourism.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>See our <\/strong><\/em><em><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/2025-google-ads-benchmarks\">2025 search advertising benchmarks here<\/a>.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Average CTRs\u00a0have increased during COVID-19<\/h2>\n<p>Overall, the average click-through rate on PPC ads has increased since February, especially on Google <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/30\/covid-19-google-search-trends\">search<\/a> campaigns.<\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/images\/media\/images\/Covid-Benchmarks-Big-CTR_0.png\">View larger image<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"https:\/\/go.aws\/2RO5orL\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"751b2cc4-2890-49e5-b818-49cfcabf6ada\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Covid-Benchmarks-Big-CTR_0-3.png\" alt=\"Covid-Benchmarks-Big-CTR\" width=\"800\" height=\"1050\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Many industries have found more impressions and clicks on the SERP since the COVID outbreak. Food &amp; Groceries and Charities &amp; Nonprofits have CTRs that far exceed their typical performance. Even industries that traditionally suffer from low CTRs, like Finance or Legal, are finding a strong footing on the SERP.<\/p>\n<p>Higher CTRs on Travel &amp; Tourism may be a sign of trouble, however. Increasing travel advisories and restrictions have many searchers looking to cancel their itineraries. Advertisers would be wise to exclude customers who have upcoming travel plans from their paid marketing campaigns to avoid paying for them to arrive back to their site just to cancel or postpone their plans.<br \/>\nAs many advertisers pull back, ad auctions are slightly less competitive and PPC cost per clicks have been declining.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>&gt;&gt;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/google-ads-industry-benchmarks?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2025GoogleAdsBenchmarks_Download\">Download our latest search advertising benchmarks report here!<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLWebAnyInContentTextLinkPPCCOVID19Guide.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_COVID19Guide_Download\"><em><strong>Navigate the changing online advertising landscape with this free small business guide to COVID-19.<\/strong><\/em><\/a><\/h3>\n<h2>Average CPCs have dropped during COVID-19<\/h2>\n<p>Some industries are noticing lower CPCs as ad competition becomes scarce.

In mid-March, we saw local advertisers struggle the most and many have noticed a significantly lower CVR with their paid ads.<\/p>\n<p>But many have been able to pivot and find better ways to convert customers online. For instance, restaurateurs may have fewer or no diners in their front of house, but as more turn to ordering in advance and contactless delivery, they\u2019re converting those diners more effectively online than they were a month ago. Similarly, as fewer people are willing to visit a car dealership in person during the pandemic, many automotive advertisers have adjusted to showcase their inventory and auctions online.<\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/images\/media\/images\/Covid-Benchmarks-fullsize-CVR_0.png?ehEghIHm5HSUi\"><em>View larger image<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/images\/media\/images\/Covid-Benchmarks-fullsize-CVR_0.png?ehEghIHm5HSUi\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d64f3109-29fb-48a9-b87b-c7fc369a5fc9\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Covid-Benchmarks-Big-CVR-1.png\" alt=\"Covid-Benchmarks-Big-CVR\" width=\"800\" height=\"1050\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Average CPAs\u00a0vary by network during COVID-19<\/h2>\n<p>Online advertising has changed rapidly over the past few weeks and many of the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/23\/covid-19-business-trends\">trends<\/a> we\u2019ve seen evolve over the past years have recently reversed.
