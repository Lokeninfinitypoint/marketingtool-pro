According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/laurashin\/2017\/01\/31\/work-from-home-in-2017-the-top-100-companies-offering-remote-jobs\/#36d7e71b42d8\">Forbes<\/a>, 68% of U.S. workers say that they expect to work remotely in the future. It\u2019s rare to find a company that wouldn\u2019t allow you to work from bed when you come down with the flu, but it can be trickier to find a spot that would want you to work remotely 100% of the time.<\/p>\n<p>Whether it\u2019s to feed your travel addiction, assuaging relocation fears, or the office is simply in an undesirable location, working remotely can be a great solution. In this post, I\u2019ll outline a few ways to find a remote job and how to optimize for productivity once you land it.<\/p>\n<h2>Where Can I Find a Remote Job?<\/h2>\n<p>When you\u2019re first starting to consider working from home permanently\u2014or even traveling for an undetermined amount of time and need a flexible job\u2014it can be intimidating. Luckily, finding one is simpler than you think! As popularity increases, job boards meet demand by specializing in remote careers. Check it out!<\/p>\n<h3>1. <a href=\"https:\/\/weworkremotely.com\/\">We Work Remotely<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>This online board allows job seekers to look for jobs that are unrestricted by geography, and it is constantly being updated. Simply search by title or skill to find a career you can start anywhere in the world! If you are an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/17\/goal-talk-episode-6\">employer looking to hire <\/a>a remote employee, it\u2019s $200 for 30 days per post.<\/p>\n<h3>2.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.flexjobs.com\/\"> FlexJobs<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>Boasting 33k postings from 4.6k companies, FlexJobs exists to serve part-time, freelance, and remote job searchers. The goal is to provide employees with a \u201cjob that fits into your life, not a life that fits into a job!\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>3. <a href=\"https:\/\/remote.co\/\">Remote.co<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>Founded by the same woman as FlexJobs, Remote.co helps companies hire, train, and manage remote employees. They have a helpful blog, Q&amp;A\u2019s for employees and employers, and job listings.<\/p>\n<h3>4. <a href=\"https:\/\/remoteok.io\/\">Remote OK<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>Providing a daily listing of remote employment opportunities, Remote OK also sends email updates when new jobs in your category are posted. Though it is most common for telecommuting employees to work in tech, Remote OK also advertises employment opportunities outside of the tech industry.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/remoteok-job-board.png\" alt=\"Remote Job Board\" width=\"800\" height=\"385\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>5. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.themuse.com\/\">The Muse<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>Advertised as the \u201cultimate career finder and guidance destination,\u201d the Muse offers behind-the-scenes looks at job opportunities on-site and remote.

Though generally not fulltime, it is a great way to get your side hustle on, without having to commit to going into an office. The catch? Upwork does charge a service fee based on how the client is billed&#8230;but you can get hired and paid fast!<\/p>\n<h3>7. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.indeed.com\/l-Remote-jobs.html\">Indeed<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>To use this giant job board to find a remote position, simply input \u201cremote\u201d in the \u201cwhere\u201d field. You can also upload your resume to let employers looking for remote employees find you.<\/p>\n<h2>What Companies Hire Remote Employees?<\/h2>\n<p>While most companies will allow employees work from home on occasion\u2014when that freak snowstorm hits, if you are feeling sick, if your nanny calls out sick at the last minute\u2014but it can be harder to find a company that wants you to work remotely all the time. Luckily, these companies do exist! Here are a few that might pique your interest.<\/p>\n<h3>1. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.upworthy.com\/\">Upworthy<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>This online cache of uplifting, click-worthy stories is curated by a team that largely works from \u201canywhere with good enough internet to do a Google Hangout.\u201d However, their team isn\u2019t \u201cremote\u201d; it\u2019s \u201cdistributed.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>2. <a href=\"https:\/\/buffer.com\/journey\">Buffer<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>A social media management company with a huge loyal fanbase, Buffer encourages their employees to \u201cwork in the place that makes you happy, that inspires you daily, and helps you to become the person that you wish to be.\u201d The company even brags that they don\u2019t have a physical office\u2014but tons of perks!<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/buffer-remote-employees.png\" alt=\"Remote Employees at Buffer\" width=\"750\" height=\"361\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>3. <a href=\"https:\/\/basecamp.com\/about\">Basecamp<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>Basecamp is an all-in-one project management platform based in Chicago, but, because they \u201cgive a damn\u201d about their employees\u2019 happiness, all employees are free to live and work wherever they want. They even wrote a book on remote working, REWORK!<\/p>\n<h3>4. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flexjobs.com\/FlexJobsTeam.aspx\">FlexJobs<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>Staying true to their offering, FlexJobs\u2019 team is completely remote, working virtually from all over the United States.<\/p>\n<h3>5. <a href=\"http:\/\/fire-engine-red.com\/about\/#careers\">Fire Engine RED<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>A marketing, technology, and data solutions company, employees are 100% virtual\/distributed\/remote throughout the US and Canada.

They also brag about a strong company culture despite the lack of office space!<\/p>\n<h2>How Can I Stay Productive When Working Remotely?<\/h2>\n<p>Working remotely and staying on task can be hard. There can be more distractions\u2014kids, people playing music in your caf\u00e9, Netflix vying for your attention\u2014but there are some simple ways you can be productive and achieve your goals.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Communicate Transparently and Often<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.proven.com\/\">Proven<\/a>, a subscription-based job board, surveyed 39 remote companies on their metrics for success and characteristics for remote employees. The overarching theme of almost all the answers was communication! Whether it is through Skype, Slack, Pidgin, Trello, or simply email, staying visible to team members is hugely important. It can be easy to find yourself out of the loop when you\u2019re physically far away, take advantage of any chance to hop on a call or shoot an instant message to stay on top of projects and develop relationships.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/communicate-remotely-meme.png\" alt=\"how to communicate working remotely\" width=\"762\" height=\"858\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>2. Take Initiative<\/h3>\n<p>When you\u2019re don\u2019t have any physical face time with your co-workers or managers, it can be easy for people to forget about what you are working on or where you want your career to go. The easiest way to combat this is to take matters into your own hands\u2014start new projects, offer to host remote lunch-and-learns, offer your expertise wherever possible.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Stay Accountable<\/h3>\n<p>The fear a lot of managers or bosses seem to have is, \u201cHow will I know my employees are working?\u201d Easy. Set goals for yourself\u2014or have your manager set them for you\u2014and report on them on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<p>Trello can also be a great source for this\u2014let your coworkers know what is on your to-do list with the easy ability to publish when you\u2019ve completed tasks.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Want to work from home?
