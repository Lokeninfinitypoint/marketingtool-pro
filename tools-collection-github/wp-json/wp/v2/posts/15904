But while it\u2019s important to know how many times in a given month your keyword is typically entered as a query, it\u2019s equally important to understand the level of competition vying for ranking supremacy on that keyword. Find that strong inverse relationship between search volume and keyword difficulty\u2014a high volume keyword with a low keyword difficulty level\u2014using a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-research-tool\"> keyword research tool<\/a>, and you may just have yourself a business-valuable keyword to bid on (using PPC) or create organic content around (using SEO).<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/keyword-difficulty_1.png\" alt=\"Keyword Difficulty\" width=\"722\" height=\"510\" \/><\/div>\n<p>But there\u2019s a third ingredient to the secret sauce when it comes to finding impactful keywords for your business\u2014intent. A keyword with high volume and low difficulty is useless if it doesn\u2019t fit your marketing objective\u2014so it\u2019s pivotal to understand not just <em>what <\/em>people are searching for, but <em>why <\/em>they\u2019re searching for it. Is the keyword relevant enough to merit a bid? Is it applicable enough to your business to merit a blog post?<\/p>\n<p>The purpose of this guide is to give an in-depth look at the importance of keyword difficulty in conducting effective<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-research\"> keyword research<\/a>\u2014specifically, as it relates to search volume and search intent. We\u2019re also going to take a look at the nuances of utilizing keyword difficulty for disparate ends\u2014finding<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/ppc-keyword\"> PPC keywords<\/a>, and finding<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/seo-keyword\"> SEO keywords<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>What Is Keyword Difficulty?<\/h2>\n<p>Keyword difficulty (or \u201ccompetition\u201d) is a metric used to determine how difficult it is rank for a keyword. Assessing keyword difficulty can help you determine whether or not it\u2019s worth your time and money to either: 1. Optimize an organic page for that keyword, or 2. Bid on that keyword in a Google Ads campaign. There are a number of factors that go into determining how competitive a keyword is, and a number of nuances that go into incorporating keyword competition into various marketing campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with how you can use keyword difficulty to maximize SEO.<\/p>\n<h2>Keyword Difficulty: Through the Lens of SEO<\/h2>\n<p>Keyword difficulty in SEO is largely a measure of the number and quality of backlinks to the top ten pages in the Search Engine Results Page (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/serp\">SERP<\/a>) for that keyword\u2014or how competitive those pages are based on how strong their backlinks are. SEO keyword tools gauge the \u201ccompetitiveness\u201d of a SERP by looking at the domain authorities (or domain ratings) and page authorities (or URL ratings) of the indexed pages.<\/p>\n<p>Confused? Let\u2019s review these terms in a little more detail.<\/p>\n<h3>Understanding Domain Authority, Page Authority, and Link Equity<\/h3>\n<p>Like \u201ckeyword difficulty,\u201d \u201cdomain authority\u201d and \u201cpage authority\u201d\u2014you may also see them called domain rating and URL rating depending on the product you use\u2014are not Google-sanctioned terms. Rather, they are metrics created by SEO software companies to estimate how much<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2010\/07\/15\/how-to-find-and-drain-link-juice\"> link equity<\/a> a page or a domain contains. Because of that, you\u2019re going to see some variation around the metrics themselves\u2014not only from product to product, but in terms of how accurately they reflect the strength of the pages they\u2019re assessing.<\/p>\n<p>Link equity is as good a place as any to start when conceptualizing domain authority and page authority. An outbound link from a page contains as much link equity as the inbound links (external and internal) pointing to it. So, if you have two pages, Page A and Page B\u2026<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/keyword-difficulty-link-equity_0.png\" alt=\"Keyword Difficulty Link Equity\" width=\"600\" height=\"320\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u2026and Page A has more inbound external links than Page B, an outbound link from Page A is going to contain more link equity than an outbound link from Page B (assuming the inbound links are coming from pages with the same level of authority). Page authority measures link equity at a page level. Domain authority measures it at a site-wide level. While domain authority is a strong indicator of the quality of an inbound link, page authority usually corresponds more directly with Google rankings, because it offers a more granular look at the backlink profiles of the indexed pages.<\/p>\n<h2>How Keyword Difficulty Fits in<\/h2>\n<p>Because keyword difficulty gauges the competitiveness of the top 10 pages in the SERP you\u2019re vying for, you can estimate how \u201cdifficult\u201d a keyword is going to be to rank for by looking at the domain authorities and page authorities of the pages listed. Say you\u2019re writing a blog post about keyword difficulty:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/keywor-difficulty-page-authority.png\" alt=\"Keyword Difficulty Page Authority\" width=\"1297\" height=\"580\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You can run some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/18\/ppc-competitor-analysis\">competitive analysis<\/a> by looking, on a page-by-page basis, at how strong your competitors\u2019 backlink profiles are. The above broad look at competitor domain authorities and page authorities comes courtesy of an extension from Moz called<a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/products\/pro\/seo-toolbar\"> MozBar<\/a>. MozBar tells you exactly how many backlinks you\u2019re contending with on each page; what it doesn\u2019t tell you the quality of those backlinks. If you want to get more granular in your investigation, you can use a tool like Ahrefs\u2019 Site Explorer to see just where the page with the #1 ranking is getting its inbound links:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/keyword-difficulty-backlinks.png\" alt=\"Keyword Difficulty Backlinks\" width=\"1223\" height=\"517\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking at keyword difficulty through the Ahrefs prism you\u2019ll also see the approximate number of referring domains you\u2019ll need to accrue to rank for a given keyword:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/keyword-difficulty-referring-domains.png\" alt=\"Keyword Difficulty Referring Domains\" width=\"828\" height=\"329\" \/><\/div>\n<p>A metric which, again, does not tell the entire story\u2014links from 68 subpar sites aren\u2019t going to get you on page one. But it\u2019s still useful\u2014SEMrush has referring domains at number 5 on its<a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/ranking-factors\/\"> list of top ranking factors<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at these elements in the broader context of finding the best SEO keywords for your content.<\/p>\n<h3>Bringing in Volume and Intent<\/h3>\n<p>As discussed, there are three ingredients to conducting effective keyword research\u2014keyword difficulty, search volume, and intent. Now that you understand keyword difficulty from the perspective of an SEO, let\u2019s talk about combining it with search volume and intent to find business-valuable SEO keywords.<\/p>\n<h4><em>Search Volume in SEO<\/em><\/h4>\n<p>Search volume in SEO is the number of monthly searches conducted each month for your keyword. Generally speaking, the higher a keyword\u2019s search volume, the more likely a page optimized for that keyword will generate meaningful traffic for your business. You can evaluate the potential traffic value of a keyword by comparing search volume to pageviews in Analytics\u2014if your best blog posts rake in 300 hits per month, then a 300 search volume is a good benchmark to use when looking for new keywords around which to base your content.<\/p>\n<h4><em>Intent in SEO<\/em><\/h4>\n<p>There are traditionally three types of search intent (we\u2019ll come back to these when we discuss PPC):<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Transactional: <\/strong>A search made with the aim of making a purchase\u2014i.e., \u201cbuy PPC software.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Navigational: <\/strong>A search made with the aim of reaching a destination on the web\u2014i.e., \u201cwordstream\u201d if your intent was to get to the WordStream homepage.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Informational: <\/strong>A search made with the intent of acquiring information\u2014i.e. \u201cbest PPC software.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Note: depending on who you ask, a fourth type of query, \u201ccommercial intent,\u201d would represent a person <em>nearly <\/em>ready to make a purchase. We&#8217;ll stick with the above three variations for now.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to optimize for all three flavors of search intent. Pages closer to your homepage\u2014product pages, about pages, etc.\u2014should be optimized more heavily for navigational and transactional keywords than pages farther away from your homepage. For instance, a person looking for \u201cmen\u2019s fur coats\u201d is closer to purchase than a person looking for \u201chow to choose a fur coat.\u201d A product page is more appropriate for the first query; a blog post is more appropriate for the second.<\/p>\n<p>Informational search intent is a bit less monolithic than navigational intent or transactional intent. Depending on your business goals, you can optimize for informational keywords that are both very loosely <em>and <\/em>very closely related to your brand and products. Say, for instance, your goal is to drive very top-of-funnel traffic\u2014to get users to your site by any means possible so that they might gain familiarity with your brand. Using the above fur coat example: if you sell fur coats, \u201ccoat vs jacket\u201d is not as low in the purchasing funnel as \u201chow to buy a fur coat.\u201d But it has a very strong volume to difficulty ratio:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/keyword-difficulty-coat-vs-jacket.png\" alt=\"Keyword Difficulty Coat vs Jacket\" width=\"845\" height=\"325\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Get these users\u2014who are merely looking for information\u2014to your website, and you\u2019ve turned them from users into prospects. They now have the opportunity to navigate to your product pages, engage with a lead form, or fire your Facebook pixel and open themselves up to remarketing.<\/p>\n<h3>Keyword Difficulty: The Secret Sauce<\/h3>\n<p><em>All <\/em>sites want to rank for high-volume keywords with intents that match their business goals; and because of that, keyword difficulty is a key differentiator. You can use keyword difficulty to find high-volume, high-intent keywords that are less difficult to rank for than other high-volume, high-intent keywords. Doing so can save you massive amounts of time and frustration creating content that has the <em>potential <\/em>to generate traffic, but never quite does because of the level of competition in the SERP.<\/p>\n<p>Like in the above example, you can use keyword difficulty as a fulcrum to find keywords that already meet your volume and intent-based needs, but may or may not be worth your time based on how competitive they are.<\/p>\n<h2>Keyword Difficulty: Through the Lens of PPC<\/h2>\n<p>Keyword difficulty works a little differently in PPC, most obviously in name: \u201cCompetition\u201d is the metric we\u2019re going to be talking about. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/articles\/ultimate-guide-to-keyword-competition\">Keyword competition in PPC<\/a> is typically assigned a rank\u2014either Low, Medium, or High\u2014which denotes the level of competition for that keyword relative to all keywords. Per Google\u2019s Keyword Planner: \u201cCompetition is the number of advertisers that showed on each keyword relative to all keywords across Google. We calculate the number of advertisers bidding on each keyword relative to all keywords across Google. This data is specific to the locations and Search Network targeting option that you&#8217;ve selected.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Much like SEO keywords, the most coveted PPC keywords maintain a <strong>high-volume-to-low-competition<\/strong> ratio. These keywords represent the potential to drive substantial traffic without costing an arm and a leg. As such, competition is key when assessing whether or not you should bid on a keyword\u2014but as discussed earlier, volume and intent are still irreplaceable parts of the process.<\/p>\n<h3>Search Volume in PPC<\/h3>\n<p>As you might expect, longer keywords typically have lower search volumes\u2014but that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. Let\u2019s compare, for instance, \u201cmarketing\u201d and \u201cpay per click marketing software.\u201d We would call marketing a \u201chead\u201d term\u2014a broad keyword that consists of a single word or short phrase. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/head-term\">Head terms<\/a> usually have high volumes. On the flip side of that, because high volumes are sexy, head terms are usually highly competitive\u2014they represent the potential for high traffic, but not without a significant bid, and not without a well-crafted ad.<\/p>\n<p>We would call \u201cpay per click marketing software,\u201d on the other hand, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/11\/07\/how-to-find-long-tail-keywords\">long-tail keyword<\/a>. Long-tail keywords with super low search volumes are not ideal; but because they are longer, they are usually more specific. If you can find one with decent search volume that is hyper-relevant to your niche, you give yourself the opportunity to earn high-value clicks at a very reasonable price.<\/p>\n<h3>Intent in PPC<\/h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s run through the traditional types of search intent again:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Transactional: <\/strong>A search made with the aim of making a purchase\u2014i.e., \u201cbuy PPC software.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Navigational: <\/strong>A search made with the aim of reaching a destination on the web\u2014i.e., \u201cwordstream\u201d if your intent was to get to the WordStream homepage.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Informational: <\/strong>A search made with the intent of acquiring information\u2014i.e. \u201cbest PPC software.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Intent in PPC is as important, if not more important than intent in SEO. A blog post optimized for a keyword that turns out to be irrelevant costs you nothing but the time it took to write the post; a search ad optimized for an irrelevant term costs you ad spend.<\/p>\n<p>Ask yourself: What is your ideal customer looking for? Does the query realistically align with that need? Does the query trigger irrelevant searches that should be added as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/negative-keywords\">negative keywords<\/a>? All of these questions play a role in determining whether or not you should bid\u00a0on a keyword, and how aggressive you should be in your bid strategy.<\/p>\n<p>One effective way to layer intent in PPC is to incorporate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/12\/remarketing-lists-for-search-ads\">Remarketing Lists for Search Ads<\/a> (RSLAs). RSLAs allow you to customize your campaigns for people who have previously visited your site, and tailor your bids and ads to these visitors when they&#8217;re searching on Google and search partner sites. When you pair RSLAs with keywords, you assign those a more granular layer of intent\u2014this person has searched for your target keyword <em>and <\/em>visited your site in the past\u2014which allows you to adjust your offer, message, and bid strategy accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>While we\u2019re on the subject of getting more for your ad spend, we should mention proper budgeting. When we say \u201cproper,\u201d we mean this: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/09\/14\/adwords-budget-guide\">the majority of your PPC budget<\/a> should be spent on the keywords that have the greatest chance of converting:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-search-campaign-budget-breakdown-diagram.png\" alt=\"Keyword Difficulty Budgeting\" width=\"600\" height=\"371\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>These numbers are not exact. This is just an example of a potential breakdown.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Read: be balanced, but devote the most dollars to keywords with the highest transactional intent.<\/p>\n<h3>Keyword Competition: How to Be Competitive While Hedging Against Overspending<\/h3>\n<p>Naturally, lower competition is \u201cbetter\u201d; but inevitably, there are going to be competitive keywords you want to bid on because they align with the goals of your campaign. Here are some ways to hedge against overspending in those cases:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Be conservative in your <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-match-types\"><strong>match type<\/strong><\/a><strong>. <\/strong>Bidding on long-tail keywords with exact or phrase match gives you more control over where you\u2019re serving your ads. Doing so can help you avoid serving ads to people who have made irrelevant queries. Take note, though, that exact match is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/07\/exact-match-keywords-even-more-variants\">not as exact as it used to be<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Conduct negative keyword research. <\/strong>You may find that some of the competitive difficulty surrounding a keyword stems from queries that are <em>related<\/em> to your product or service, but are ultimately irrelevant. Finding and adding negative keywords gives you the ability eliminate those keywords, reduce wasted spend, and improve your competitive edge.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/keyword-difficulty-negative-kwywords.png\" alt=\"Keyword Difficulty Negatives\" width=\"558\" height=\"387\" \/><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Focus on quality score. <\/strong>If your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/14\/ppc-ad-copywriting\">ad copy<\/a> is relevant and your landing page is optimized, you\u2019ll invariably lower costs and give yourself an edge in the auction.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Take note of Suggested Bids.<\/strong> Suggested Bid is a Keyword Planner metric that gives you an idea of how much you should be bidding in order to capture ad slots for your target keyword. It takes into account the costs-per-click (CPCs) that advertisers are paying for that keyword, as well as the location and Search Network settings you&#8217;ve selected. For <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/06\/small-marketing-budget\">advertisers with smaller budgets<\/a>, Suggested Bid can help you determine the feasibility of capturing that ad position.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Using Opportunity Score to Uncover Valuable Keywords<\/h3>\n<p>Volume, Competition, Average CPC, intent\u2026it can be a little overwhelming to sift through piles of keywords while keeping all of these relevant factors in mind. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if you could measure the prospective viability of a keyword by consolidating all the metrics that mattered into one?<\/p>\n<p>WordStream\u2019s Opportunity Score does just that. Use our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a>, and you\u2019ll find each keyword scored based on how much potential value it represents for your business.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/keyword-difficulty-keyword-tool.png\" alt=\"Keyword Difficulty FKT\" width=\"979\" height=\"589\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Opportunity Score takes into account Search Volume, Competition, and Average CPC, and assigns each keyword a score of 1-10 based on those metrics. With the ratio of volume-to-competition quantified, you can focus on filtering for intent.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s reiterate the keyword research secret sauce: search volume, keyword difficulty (or competition), and intent. No keyword can be properly assessed without all three ingredients accounted for\u2014whether you\u2019re working in paid or organic search. That said: control for search volume and intent, and keyword difficulty becomes an effective metric by which to filter your search. Know your budget and your campaign goals, identify the SERPs in which you can be competitive, and select accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><em>Shout-out to Kristina Simonson, our in-house acquisition expert, who helped write this post.\u00a0 <\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The purpose of this guide is to give you an in-depth look at the importance of keyword difficulty in conducting effective keyword research for both organic and paid search.
