Screens are small, connections are slow, and your customers\u2019 attentions are short. All of these factors come together to form an inconvenient truth: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/13\/google-ads-mobile-benchmarks\">Mobile conversion rates are lower than on desktop<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google_mobile_benchmarks_CVR_small-1.png\" alt=\"Google Ads Mobile Benchmarks Average CVR\" width=\"900\" height=\"1000\" \/><\/div>\n<p>There are many ways to improve your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/18\/mobile-conversion-rates\">mobile conversion rate<\/a> and get more searchers to convert on mobile, but at the end of the day filling out a form on a mobile site will always be harder. Google\u2019s looked for creative solutions in the past to allow users new ways to convert without visiting a mobile site\u2014from allowing users to call a business directly with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/10\/06\/google-adwords-call-extensions\">call extensions<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/20\/google-call-only-campaigns\">call-only ads<\/a>, message a business with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/19\/adwords-message-extensions\">message extensions<\/a>, or even buy directly on the SERP with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/08\/purchases-on-google\">purchases on Google<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s lead form ad extensions, originally announced in <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/9594220\">2019<\/a>, are designed to help mobile users convert and provide their contact information without ever leaving the SERP. And now,\u00a0Google has made further <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/10364931\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">updates<\/a> whereby the form opens up\u00a0on mobile when users click on your ad headline. This enables you to generate even more leads from your Search ads.\u00a0In this post, we\u2019re sharing everything you need to know about this ad type.<\/p>\n<h1>What are Google lead form extensions?<\/h1>\n<p>Google lead form extensions show beneath your search ad on mobile and tablet devices and allow a user to provide their contact information directly through your ad on the SERP, rather than visiting a landing page. This replaces the need for a user to visit your mobile site to convert. If the searcher is signed into their Google account, they\u2019ll reach a Google-hosted form already pre-populated with their contact details and can immediately convert with one click.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/google-lead-form-extensions.png\" alt=\"Google Lead Form Extensions\" width=\"640\" height=\"411\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-59197\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/google-lead-form-extensions.png 640w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/google-lead-form-extensions-480x308.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 640px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s lead form extensions stick out on the smaller mobile SERP, make your search ads larger, and help users convert faster and easier! Like all ad extensions, you only pay when a user clicks on your lead form extension. Additionally, your lead form extension is not guaranteed to show all the time and is more likely to show in top positions.<\/p>\n<h1>How do you create Google lead form extensions?<\/h1>\n<p>Creating lead form extensions is simple. First, dive into a search campaign within Google Ads (set Leads as your goal and Search as your campaign type).<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-lead-form-extension-new-campaign.jpg\" alt=\"google ad lead form extension campaign\" width=\"800\" height=\"413\" \/><\/div>\n<p>From there, visit the \u201cAds and Extensions\u201d tab on the left handrail. Then, click on the \u201cExtensions\u201d tab on the top bar. If your account has access to this beta, clicking on the blue \u201c+\u201d will give you this drop-down, with a noted \u201cLead form extension\u201d offer:<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-lead-form-extension-add-extension.png\" alt=\"google ads lead form extension new\" width=\"700\" height=\"560\" \/><\/div>\n<p>From here, there are a few different steps to creating the ad.<\/p>\n<h3>Create your lead form extension<\/h3>\n<p>First, you\u2019ll be prompted to design how your lead form extension will show beneath your ad. You\u2019ll need to select a Call-to-action and write a short message to appear alongside your lead form extension.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-lead-form-extensions-cta.jpg\" alt=\"Google lead form extensions CTAs\" width=\"351\" height=\"51\" \/><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Call to action: <\/strong>You\u2019ll be able to select one of these eight calls to action for your lead form extension:\n<ul>\n<li>Get quote<\/li>\n<li>Apply now<\/li>\n<li>Sign up<\/li>\n<li>Contact us<\/li>\n<li>Subscribe<\/li>\n<li>Download<\/li>\n<li>Book now<\/li>\n<li>Get offer<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Extension text: <\/strong>This short message (30 characters) will appear below your call to action with your lead form extension on the SERP. Provide a compelling offer to supplement your call to action!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Create your lead form<\/h3>\n<p>Next, you\u2019ll create the lead form that users will see after clicking on your lead form extension. You can also choose what information you want to collect from searchers through this form.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/lead-form-extensions-create-lead-form.png\" alt=\"google ads lead form extensions create lead form\" width=\"600\" height=\"615\" \/><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Business name (30 characters): <\/strong>This will be at the top of the form.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Headline (30 characters): <\/strong>Immediately below your business name, use your headline to serve as your primary call to action on the form<\/li>\n<li><strong>Description (200 characters): <\/strong>This will make up the body of the content on your form. Provide additional context and detail your offer and values to searchers in the description!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Questions:<\/strong> You can choose up to ten fields in your form to be populated, asking for contact information and work information.\u00a0Note that Google says &#8220;Tbese\u00a0questions may be pre-filled with a person&#8217;s information when available, making it more likely a person submits the form.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Privacy policy page:<\/strong>\u00a0You\u2019ll also need to provide a link to your company\u2019s privacy policy to be compliant with Google.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Background image (optional):<\/strong>\u00a0Additionally, you\u2019ll have the option to include a background image to appear behind the lead form. Recommended dimensions for your image are 1200 x 628, which corresponds to an aspect ratio of 1.91:1.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Create your form submission message<\/h3>\n<p>After finishing your lead form, you\u2019ll create your form submission message for your lead form extension. This is what users will see after they submit their contact information.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-lead-extension-forms-submission-message.png\" alt=\"google ads lead form extension submission\" width=\"436\" height=\"354\" \/><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Headline (30 characters): <\/strong>This will appear at the top of the submission message.\u00a0A simple &#8220;Thank you&#8221; or &#8220;Form submitted!&#8221; could work here.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Description (200 characters): <\/strong>This will make up the content for this page.

You\u2019ll want to follow up with these fresh leads as soon as possible to close the deal. Google provides you two options to reach these customers who submit via lead form extensions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Download your leads as a CSV: <\/strong>Beneath your lead form extension in Google Ads, you\u2019ll note a blue link to \u201cdownload leads.\u201d This will allow you to download the contact information from each lead form extension. You\u2019ll need to download these leads often because Google will only store leads for 30 days.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-lead-form-extensions-lead-csv.jpg\" alt=\"Google leads csv\" width=\"233\" height=\"120\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>2.

Confirm within your CRM that you have received the test data in the correct format.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-lead-extension-forms-lead-delivery-option.png\" alt=\"google ads lead form extension delivery option zapier\" width=\"423\" height=\"489\" \/><\/div>\n<h1>Some important limitations of Google lead form extensions<\/h1>\n<p>Lead form extensions are a great new option, but these ad extensions do have some limitations:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lead form extensions will only show in search campaigns.<\/li>\n<li>Lead form extensions will only show on mobile and tablet devices.<\/li>\n<li>You cannot create lead form extensions at the account level or ad group level. Each lead form extension can only be applied at the campaign level.<\/li>\n<li>Some sensitive industries (such as healthcare) will not be able to collect personal information with lead form extensions. For a full list of restrictions for lead form extensions, <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/9472930\">visit this page.<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Your usage of the personal information you collect with lead form extensions must comply with your company\u2019s provided privacy policy, <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/6020956#298\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google\u2019s data collection policies<\/a>, and the local legal requirements of your users.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Take advantage of lead form extensions for mobile conversions<\/h2>\n<p>These lead form extensions offer a revolutionary solution to help advertisers convert more mobile searchers. As they roll out to more advertisers, be sure to add these to your accounts and then <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/26\/device-level-bid-adjustments\">adjust your mobile bids<\/a> to make the most of this mobile ad extension.<\/p>\n<p>P.S.
