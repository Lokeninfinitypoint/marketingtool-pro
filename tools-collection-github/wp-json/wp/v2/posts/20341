You can have it, but not hold it. It can take years to gain, and can be lost in seconds \u2013 and it\u2019s the single most important element of any transaction or relationship.<\/p>\n<p>What am I talking about?<\/p>\n<p>Trust.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trust-signals-header1.png\" alt=\"Trust signals and how to use them\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Although technology and shifts in how we do business have made it easier to buy and sell without fear of being ripped off (or offer some sort of recourse in the event you are), most transactions we engage in every day are based primarily on trust.<\/p>\n<p>Many websites and ecommerce retailers use trust signals to put prospective customers at ease, but what are trust signals? How do they work? What makes them so effective? And \u2013 perhaps most importantly \u2013 how and when should you use them?<\/p>\n<p>These are all questions we\u2019ll be answering in today\u2019s post.<\/p>\n<h2>What are trust signals?<\/h2>\n<p>Trust signals are elements that are often displayed on websites and at physical points of sale in brick-and-mortar businesses to help customers feel more secure in their decision to patronize a specific business or buy a specific product or service.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trust-signals-logos.png\" alt=\"Trust signal logos\" width=\"600\" height=\"153\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Some trust signals are little more than logos that offer reassurances that a retailer or site belongs to a certain trade organization, whereas others are proof of a business\u2019 conduct or trustworthiness. Trust signals can and do vary widely in form, but they all perform the same function \u2013 making prospective customers feel better about doing business with a company. As such, trust signals are an element of conversion rate optimization.<\/p>\n<h2>What are some different types of trust signals?<\/h2>\n<p>Some trust signals are instantly recognizable, whereas others are more subtly implied. It all depends on the type of business in question, the industry or vertical that business is in, and dozens of other factors. As a result, there are many different types of trust signals.<\/p>\n<h3>Guarantee trust signals<\/h3>\n<p>Among the most common type of trust signal is the guarantee.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trust-signals-guarantee.jpg\" alt=\"Trust signals guarantee logo\" width=\"500\" height=\"350\" \/><\/div>\n<p>These trust signals can be immensely powerful (and even expected, in some industries), as they offer peace of mind to the consumer. They assure prospective customers that, in the event a retailer or website turns out to be unscrupulous, or the customer changes their mind or is dissatisfied with their purchase, their money or investment is protected. This can be something as unique to your business as a specific refund or returns policy, to the inclusion of the Visa or MasterCard logo on your website.<\/p>\n<p>These trust signals are everywhere in the financial services market, and for good reason. These are also among the most commonplace and recognizable symbols in the world, simply because we\u2019re so used to seeing them. In fact, they\u2019re so common, it\u2019s often more jarring or suspicious if we <em>don\u2019t<\/em> see them.<\/p>\n<h3>Social proof trust signals<\/h3>\n<p>The meteoric rise of social media brought with it many things, not least of which was the explosive growth in \u201c<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/01\/10\/social-proof-guide\">social proof<\/a>\u201d as a trust signal.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trust-signals-customer-testimonials.png\" alt=\"Trust signals customer testimonials examples\" width=\"1068\" height=\"604\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Example of a \u201csocial proof\u201d trust signal in the form of customer testimonials, as used by email marketing firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aweber.com\/\">AWeber<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>This category of trust signal includes everything from <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/05\/customer-testimonials\">customer reviews<\/a> such as those seen on sites like Yelp, to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/26\/word-of-mouth-marketing\">word-of-mouth recommendations<\/a> from satisfied customers and industry experts.<\/p>\n<p>Like guarantees, social proof trust signals can be powerfully persuasive, as few things are more compelling to prospective customers than positive feedback, great reviews, and general positivity about a product or brand from \u201creal\u201d people. Plus, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/20\/social-signals-for-seo\">social signals can indirectly improve your SEO<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Some sites favor industry-insider recommendations, as seen in the example from <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/12\/is-email-marketing-effective\">email marketing<\/a> firm AWeber above. Other sites opt to include customer feedback via social media. If you\u2019re considering using this type of trust signal, be sure that the individual\u2019s name and identity are easily verifiable \u2013 don\u2019t use anonymized reviews that anybody could have written, and don\u2019t use composites of several people. Authenticity is key to the success of this kind of trust signal.<\/p>\n<h3>Trust by association trust signals<\/h3>\n<p>This type of trust signal is very broad and encompasses several different types of trust signal, each of which can help prospects feel better about doing business with you.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trust-signals-client-list.png\" alt=\"Trust signals client list\" width=\"1169\" height=\"618\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The first \u201ctrust by association\u201d signal you\u2019ve probably seen is the client list, as in the example above. Many companies feature the logos of well-known brands on their websites as an implied indicator of their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/12\/google-e-a-t\">trustworthiness<\/a>. The logic behind this type of trust signal lies in the implication that if a company can land a household-name brand client, they must be trustworthy, right?<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, media mentions can also be used as a trust signal. Some companies (WordStream included) choose to use their media coverage as a trust signal:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trust-signals-media-mentions.png\" alt=\"Trust signals media mentions\" width=\"1084\" height=\"176\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Media mentions as a trust signal, as seen on the WordStream homepage<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This is especially common among <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/12\/startup-marketing\">startups<\/a> and young tech companies that are still growing. Their association with well-known media brands serves as an implied trust signal, hopefully reassuring prospective customers that they\u2019re making a good choice.<\/p>\n<h3>Membership trust signals<\/h3>\n<p>Although this type of trust signal is closely related to the \u201ctrust by association\u201d signals above, they\u2019re worth a mention in their own right.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trust-signals-bbb-member-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Trust signals Better Business Bureau logo\" width=\"365\" height=\"591\" class=\"\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Memberships to professional organizations is often leveraged as a trust signal. In the United States, this is perhaps best exemplified by membership to the Better Business Bureau, whose logo is a familiar sight for millions of people at thousands of businesses across the country.<\/p>\n<p>This type of trust signal also includes memberships to local chambers of commerce, workers\u2019 unions, artisanal guilds, and other professional organizations.<\/p>\n<h2>What makes trust signals so effective?<\/h2>\n<p>Understandably, the primary focus of most analyses of trust signals is the comfort and familiarity that many common trust signals offer. However, another reason for trust signals\u2019 power that\u2019s discussed far less frequently is that we <em>want<\/em> to find \u2013 and believe \u2013 them.<\/p>\n<h3>Trust signals and cognitive biases<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019ve talked about <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/22\/landing-pages-cognitive-biases\">cognitive biases<\/a> before, but their relationship to our behavior when it comes to transactions and trust is unique.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trust-signals-cognitive-bias.jpeg\" alt=\"Trust signals cognitive bias\" width=\"800\" height=\"285\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image via Kris Straub\/<\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/chainsawsuit.com\/\"><em>Chainsawsuit<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>If we\u2019ve already decided to buy something, anything that will make us feel better about our decision can be a powerful motivator, especially for big-ticket items. This can be illustrated by an effect known as \u201czero-risk bias,\u201d a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/06\/cognitive-biases\">cognitive bias<\/a> that makes people prefer scenarios and situations in which there is the complete elimination of all risk, such as ironclad money-back guarantees and no-obligation free trials, even if other available choices actually offer less risk, such as buying the desired item from another more established, trusted retailer for a slightly higher price.<\/p>\n<p>Confirmation bias is another powerful motivator that can be amplified by trust signals. Let\u2019s say you really want to buy something \u2013 a new leather jacket, a video game console, a vacation package, whatever. These purchases are often relatively expensive, meaning that prospective customers may experience at least some hesitation before committing to such a considerable investment.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trust-signals-verified-by-visa.png\" alt=\"Trust signals Verified by Visa logo\" width=\"600\" height=\"265\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Now let\u2019s say that, upon visiting a website that sells whatever you\u2019re thinking of buying, you discover a Verified by Visa trust signal on the checkout page (the point at which <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/03\/17\/shopping-cart-abandonment\">many online shopping carts are abandoned<\/a>). The Verified by Visa logo signifies that the transaction will be protected from fraud by one of the largest financial services providers in the world \u2013 but that\u2019s it. This trust signal merely tells you that you won\u2019t be ripped off when purchasing that big-ticket item, yet it\u2019s still very compelling to someone who\u2019s already made up their mind to drop several hundred dollars on a luxury item.<\/p>\n<h3>Consumer trust varies widely by demographic<\/h3>\n<p>Another vital element to consider when asking what makes trust signals so effective is that of demographics.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nielsen.com\/content\/dam\/nielsenglobal\/apac\/docs\/reports\/2015\/nielsen-global-trust-in-advertising-report-september-2015.pdf\">data from Nielsen<\/a>, millennial consumers tend to be much more trusting of brands than any other age range. (I was personally surprised to see that this trust also applies, for the most part, to traditional media such as TV and newspapers).<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trust-signals-millennial-trust-media-nielsen.png\" alt=\"Trust signals Millennial consumer trust in the media Nielsen report\" width=\"816\" height=\"513\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Image\/data via Nielsen<\/em><\/p>\n<p>With <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/09\/28\/generational-marketing-tactics\">millennials<\/a> making up a significant proportion of the workforce, it comes as little surprise that the most trusting demographic has had a considerable impact on the importance of trust in today\u2019s transactions. This is among the many reasons why \u201csocial proof\u201d and earned media have become such powerful tools for brands and marketers.<\/p>\n<h2>How and when to use trust signals<\/h2>\n<p>So, now that we\u2019ve covered what trust signals are, some of the different types of trust signal you\u2019ve probably seen, and what makes them so effective, let\u2019s get to the real meat \u2013 how trust signals can improve your conversion rates, and when to use them.<\/p>\n<h3>Tell your customers they\u2019re safe<\/h3>\n<p>As we\u2019ve established, one of the primary reasons to use trust signals on your site is to help prospective customers feel good about their decision. Oftentimes, this directly equates to putting the customer\u2019s mind at ease that their money is safe and that they\u2019ll actually get what they\u2019re paying for, and trust signals offer prospects the peace of mind they need to cross the line and convert.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trust-signals-most-trusted-logos-2.png\" alt=\"How to drive more ecommerce sales with product pages trust signals logos\" width=\"847\" height=\"609\" \/><\/div>\n<p>When it comes to which specific trust signals to use, this will vary widely depending on your business. If you run an ecommerce site, you may want to look into joining the Verified by Visa program to protect your customers\u2019 credit card transactions. If your company offers software downloads or a similar product, you might want to think about implementing some sort of encryption protocol (such as https for secure web connections) or brand-name virus protection.<\/p>\n<h3>Where to use security or guarantee trust signals<\/h3>\n<p>Security emblems, transaction protection symbols, and other similar trust signals can and should be placed on web pages that ask users for sensitive information such as credit card details or on checkout pages. These trust signals can also be placed strategically on product pages, particularly if your company offers software or online services that rely on the integrity of user data or privacy.<\/p>\n<h3>A brief note on Google Trusted Stores<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019ve ever bought something online, you\u2019ve probably seen the \u201cGoogle Trusted Store\u201d trust signal on certain transactional pages or websites, particularly among <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/04\/google-shopping-campaigns-tips-tricks\">Google Shopping<\/a> results.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trust-signals-google-trusted-stores.png\" alt=\"Trust signals Google Trusted Stores\" width=\"397\" height=\"370\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If you were thinking about registering to become a Google Trusted Store, you should know that Google is retiring this program in the near future. Google Trusted Stores will be replaced\/merged with Google Customer Reviews. Virtually everything about the program will remain the same, with the notable exception that Google Customer Reviews \u2013 unlike Trusted Stores \u2013 will <strong>not<\/strong> offer purchase protection coverage to consumers. Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/trustedstoresmerchant\/answer\/7078111?hl=en\">the official Google documentation<\/a> to learn more about the two programs.<\/p>\n<h3>Be transparent with user reviews and customer feedback<\/h3>\n<p>One of the best ways to build trust in your brand is by including satisfied customer feedback, such as reviews, on your site.<\/p>\n<p>One of the fastest ways to tank that trust and credibility is by trying to pull the proverbial wool over your prospects\u2019 eyes.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trust-signals-bad-customer-review.jpg\" alt=\"Trust signals bad customer review example\" width=\"634\" height=\"475\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Sooner or later, somebody <em>will<\/em> have a beef with either you or your company, and they <em>will<\/em> vent about it, either on your own site or a third-party site. There is literally nothing you can do to avoid this situation, and trying to \u201cbury\u201d a bad review is as sleazy as it sounds.<\/p>\n<p>If someone leaves negative feedback or a bad review, think of it as an opportunity to demonstrate superior customer service. Be honest with yourself \u2013 does the disgruntled customer have a fair point? Is there something you could have done better? Was it your fault? Whatever the situation, be sure to handle it promptly, honestly, and transparently. This might mean responding to a poorly written comment on a Facebook post, or sharing your side of the story with a third-party side or organization, such as the Better Business Bureau.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trust-signals-fake-customer-testimonials.png\" alt=\"Trust signals fake customer testimonials example\" width=\"505\" height=\"341\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Openness and transparency work similarly to trust signals; they make people feel better about doing business with you. This means you shouldn\u2019t buy falsified reviews \u2013 EVER \u2013 including \u201csponsored reviews\u201d or whatever else they\u2019re trying to pass them off as these days. Same goes for those semi-anonymous testimonials by \u201cJon S. of Tucson, AZ\u201d and the like, which are about as trustworthy as a Ponzi scheme.<\/p>\n<p>If people can\u2019t trust the reviews on your site, they can\u2019t trust <em>you<\/em> \u2013 period.<\/p>\n<h3>Where to use customer testimonials and social review trust signals<\/h3>\n<p>One of the best things about customer testimonials and social media recommendations is that they can be used almost anywhere on your website \u2013 even your homepage. You could include them in a \u201cSee what our customers love about us\u201d section on your homepage, feature them alongside product feature information or specification pages, or as part of special offers.<\/p>\n<h3>Exercise restraint when using trust signals<\/h3>\n<p>The inclusion of trust signals can and does improve conversion rates. However, as with virtually everything in life, moderation is key.<\/p>\n<p>Put another way, you don\u2019t want your site to have so many logos on it that it\u2019d put a NASCAR driver to shame.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trust-signals-too-many-logos.jpg\" alt=\"Trust signals too many logos\" width=\"569\" height=\"296\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Choose one or two strong, recognizable trust signals to include on your site \u2013 then leave it alone. Don\u2019t clutter your site with dozens of logos that could confuse or deter prospective customers from converting.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and be sure to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/06\/16\/ab-testing-tips\">A\/B test<\/a> your signal placement to ensure that it\u2019s not actually hurting your conversion rates. You know what they say about assumptions!<\/p>\n<h2>A matter of trust<\/h2>\n<p>Trust signals are a powerful way to put your visitors at ease and \u2013 hopefully \u2013 increase conversion rates. As potentially impactful as they are, however, they\u2019re no substitute for good customer service, a commitment to ethical business practices, and offering the best products or services at the best possible price. Remember that what works like gangbusters for one business may not do anything for another, so be sure to test the inclusion of trust signals to see what your visitors are actually doing, not just what you think they\u2019re doing.<\/p>\n<p>What have your experiences using trust signals been like?
