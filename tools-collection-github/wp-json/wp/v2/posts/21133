The Competitive Bid<\/h2>\n<p>In the past ten years or so, the social commerce market has exploded.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s gone from virtually nonexistent to like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adweek.com\/socialtimes\/social-commerce-infographic-3\/203423\">$15 billion<\/a> in just a few years.<\/p>\n<p>So there\u2019s a lot at stake.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s also an odd, borderline incestuous history within the group of largest competitors vying for profitable enterprise clients at the top of the heap.<\/p>\n<p>Bazaarvoice, the big industry stalwart, actually acquired PowerReviews (the next in line) at one point in time\u2026<\/p>\n<p>\u2026 only for the Department of Justice to <a href=\"http:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2014\/02\/21\/the-doj-wants-to-squash-reviews-network-bazaarvoice-and-the-company-has-it-coming\/\">claim antitrust<\/a> and force them to turn around and sell to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2014\/06\/04\/bazaarvoice-sells-powerreviews\/\">another competitor<\/a> afterwards.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s fair to say that the competition is stiff.<\/p>\n<p>So\u2026 how do people and consumers choose? They might start with <em>generic<\/em> searches to get a lay of the land. But when they\u2019re using <em>branded<\/em> ones, they\u2019re beginning to seriously evaluate their options to purchase.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/tools\/customer-journey-to-online-purchase.html\">Customer Journey to Online Purchase<\/a> tool can help you see how this behavior plays out:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/explore-marketing-channels.png\" alt=\"Explore Marketing Channels\" width=\"728\" height=\"484\" \/><\/div>\n<p>What better place to hijack a soon-to-be-customer then on your competitor\u2019s branded search then?<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/bazaar-voice.png\" alt=\"BazaarVoice\" width=\"750\" height=\"502\" \/><\/div>\n<p>While Bazaarvoice valiantly tries to make their case, they\u2019re being sandwiched and outfoxed by PowerReviews and TurnTo Networks who kick off their headlines with the same \u201cWhy Choose [Our Brand]\u201d formula.<\/p>\n<p>However my money here is on PowerReviews, who follows this up with a stronger value prop in the extended headline.<\/p>\n<p>Another example beyond, \u201cWhy Choose ____?\u201d, includes, \u201cAlternative to ____\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Ways to improve or test in the original ad?<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Try highlighting the cost discrepancy, the specific and odd \u201c$99\/mo starting price\u201d (based on the numbers bit in formula #4 above).<\/li>\n<li>Try carrying in the \u201cNo Startup Fees\u201d or \u201c$0 Startup Fees\u201d or similar (based on overcoming objections in formula #5 above).<\/li>\n<li>Try including a special discount or incentive (that expires soon) for those considering HubSpot only (based on incentives in formula #6 above).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>In Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019d think it\u2019d be easy. Just a few words, a couple dozen characters or so. And yet it takes all afternoon.<\/p>\n<p>Crafting the perfect Google Ads headline is tough cause you gotta take so many things into account. Like what they were searching for and if they have purchasing motivation or not and how do you get this stuff to link with what\u2019s on your landing pages.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, you can 80\/20 the
