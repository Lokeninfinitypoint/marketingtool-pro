For example: I recently read <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2009\/10\/02\/google-wave-invites-user-adoption\">this one from 2009<\/a>, where Elisa told us Google Wave might just be the next big thing. Our readers probably have a similar feeling of nostalgia when they find our original Most Expensive Keywords post from 2011 (\u201cInsurance keywords at only $25 per click? Those were the days!\u201d)<\/p>\n<p>As you might have guessed, the paid search landscape has changed just a little, teensy bit since 2011. So have we: our product and free tools are light years ahead of where we were then, and it was high time to update our <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/27\/most-expensive-keywords\">Most Expensive Keywords data<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This time, not only did we update the data, but we created currency-specific iterations of the infographic. They each have their charms: I\u2019ve learned a lot about <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/28\/most-expensive-keywords-uk-edition\">gambling in Great Britain<\/a> and the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/03\/most-expensive-keywords-australia-edition\">litigiousness of our Australian friends<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Today, we\u2019re bringing you the Top 25 Costliest Keywords, South Africa Edition!<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1bed8297-0852-4336-81b7-7f8843249051\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/most-expensive-keywords-zar-web-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"South African Keyword Cost\" width=\"800\" height=\"3500\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>While there\u2019s some overlap between the ZAR dataset and our other datasets (USA, Canada, United Kingdom, and Australia), there are a few significant differences. Though business services, software, loans, and finance all broke into the top 25, the \u201cmoney category\u201d (as Allen called it) was much smaller and lower on the list than in other countries.<\/p>\n<h2>Car insurance takes the cake<\/h2>\n<p>Insurance was the most expensive category in ZAR, by far. Car insurance was particularly prevalent in this data set, which included branded searches for Hippo Insurance (a popular South African insurer.) Interestingly, car insurance isn\u2019t compulsory in South Africa, as it is in many other nations. (Norway, the UK, and the US all legally require drivers to carry third-party insurance.) Some statistics indicate that the majority of cars in South Africa\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/businesstech.co.za\/news\/motoring\/147543\/7-tips-to-help-you-save-on-your-car-insurance-premiums\/\">up to 65%<\/a>\u2014are uninsured, which means the cost of a vehicle crash could be alarmingly high for all parties involved.<\/p>\n<h2>\u2026But you might not have that car for long<\/h2>\n<p>Pawn services came in at #12 on our list, at an average of R24.77\/click. Interestingly enough for this bike-riding writer, people were almost as eager to pawn their cars as they were to insure them. Many of the keywords in the \u201cpawn services\u201d category dealt with cars \u2013 including \u201cpawn and drive,\u201d \u201cpawn my car,\u201d and \u201cpawn my car title.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Moving<\/h2>\n<p>South Africa was the only region where \u201cmoving\u201d was on the list \u2013 and it came in quite high, at #4! Popular keywords in this category were focused around home moves, particularly in Durban, South Africa\u2019s third-largest city in the province of KwaZulu Natal. The province as a whole had the highest estimated inward migration of any province in South Africa over the past 5 years (2011-2016 saw an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.statssa.gov.za\/publications\/P0302\/P03022014.pdf\">influx of 1.1m in-migrants<\/a>) \u2013 keeping movers busy!<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3716c6d1-31fd-42ba-a6cb-8915cfed398a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/durban-south-africa-keywords.jpg\" alt=\"Costly Keywords in South Africa\" width=\"1080\" height=\"675\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Beautiful downtown Durban<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Image-conscious categories: Jewelry, Health &amp; Fitness, Cosmetics, and Decorations<\/h2>\n<p>The categories that rounded out the last 20% of the list were largely image-focused: jewelry, health &amp; fitness, cosmetics, and decorations!

Likewise, keywords involving different types of lawyers (which happens to be the most expensive grouping in our AUD data set) or insurance were grouped together. We used a similar methodology when we created our first \u201cMost Expensive Keywords\u201d infographic back in 2011 so as to avoid featuring too many specific long-tail or local keywords that wouldn\u2019t have broad applicability to a large number of businesses. We separated distinct services (pest control vs. termites) as much as possible.<\/p>\n<p>We also filtered out keywords with less than 100 clicks from our data set. We only looked at advertisers bidding in USD, AUD, CAD, and ZAR, and analyzed different currencies separately. We also eliminated non-English ads and duplicates (where both the keyword and the CPC were exactly the same) from that set. The results you\u2019re reading about in this article are in ZAR.<\/p>\n<p>(Thank you to everyone who helped compile, analyze, and illustrate the data, including our data analyst Josh Brackett and our designer Kate Lindsay!)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What keywords demand the highest bids and costs per click (CPC&#8217;s) in the ZAR currency?
