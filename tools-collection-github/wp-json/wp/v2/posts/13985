Out of the three, technical SEO is most often ignored, most likely because it\u2019s the trickiest to master. However, with the competition in search results now, marketers cannot afford to shy away from the challenges of technical SEO\u2014having a site that is <strong>crawlable, fast, and secure<\/strong> has never been more essential to ensure your site performs well and ranks well in search engines.<\/p>\n<p>Because technical SEO is such a vast topic (and growing), this piece won\u2019t cover everything required for a full technical SEO audit.

Make sure your site is crawlable<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s no use writing pages of great content if search engines cannot crawl and index these pages. Therefore, you should start by checking your robots.txt file. This file is the first point of call for any web-crawling software when it arrives at your site. Your robots.txt file outlines which parts of your website should and should not be crawled. It does this by \u201callowing\u201d or \u201cdisallowing\u201d the behavior of certain user agents.<\/p>\n<p>To find your robot.txt file, simply go to yourwebsite.com\/robots.txt<\/p>\n<p>The robots.txt file is publicly available and can be found by adding \/robots.txt to the end of any root domain. Here is an example for the Hallam site.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/technical-seo-checklist-robot-file.jpg\" alt=\"robot.txt file\" width=\"735\" height=\"138\" \/><\/div>\n<p>We can see that Hallam is requesting any URLs starting with \/wp-admin (the backend of the website) not to be crawled. By indicating where not to allow these user agents, you save bandwidth, server resources, and your crawl budget. You also don\u2019t want to have prevented any search engine bots from crawling important parts of your website by accidentally \u201cdisallowing\u201d them. Because it is the first file a bot sees when crawling your site, it is also best practice to point to your sitemap.<\/p>\n<p>You can edit and test your robots.txt file with <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/6062598?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google&#8217;s robots.txt tester.<\/a><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/technical-seo-checklist-robot.txt-file-test.jpg\" alt=\"robot.txt file test in Google Search Console\" width=\"819\" height=\"391\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Here, you can input any URL on the site to check if it is crawlable or if there are any errors or warnings in your robots.txt file.<\/p>\n<p>While Google has done a relatively good job of transferring the most important aspects of the old tool into the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/25\/new-google-search-console\">new Google Search Console<\/a>, for many digital marketers the new version still offers less functionality than the old one. This is particularly relevant when it comes to technical SEO. At the time of writing, the crawl stats area on the old search console is still viewable and is fundamental to understand how your site is being crawled.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/technical-seo-checklist-crawl-stats.jpg\" alt=\"crawl stats\" width=\"851\" height=\"247\" \/><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/technical-seo-checklist-more-crawl-stats.jpg\" alt=\"crawl stats\" width=\"839\" height=\"418\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This report shows three main graphs with data from the last 90 days. Pages crawled per day, kilobytes downloaded per day, and time spent downloading a page (in milliseconds) all summarize your website\u2019s crawl rate and relationship with search engine bots. You want your website to almost always have a high crawl rate; this means that your website is visited regularly by search engine bots and indicates a fast and easy-to-crawl website. Consistency is the desired outcome from these graphs\u2014any major fluctuations can point to broken HTML, stale content or your robots.txt file blocking too much on your website. If your time spent downloading a page contains very high numbers, it means Googlebot is spending too long on your website crawling and indexing it slower.<\/p>\n<p>You can see crawl errors in the coverage report in the new <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/16\/how-to-use-google-search-console\">Search Console<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/technical-seo-checklist-crawl-errors.jpg\" alt=\"crawl error report\" width=\"819\" height=\"383\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Clicking through to these gives highlights specific pages with crawl issues. You\u2019ll want to make sure these pages are not any important ones for your website and address the issue causing it as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p>If you find significant crawl errors or fluctuations in either the crawl stats or coverage reports, you can look into it further by carrying out a log file analysis. Accessing the raw data from your server logs can be a bit of a pain, and the analysis is very advanced, but it can help you understand exactly what pages can and cannot be crawled, which pages are prioritised, areas of crawl budget waste, and the server responses encountered by bots during their crawl of your website.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/localiq-grader?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Is your site optimized? Get a free SEO audit with our website grader.<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>2.\u00a0Check that your site is indexable<\/h2>\n<p>Now we\u2019ve analysed whether Googlebot can actually crawl our website, we need to understand whether the pages on our site are being indexed. There are many ways to do this.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Search Console coverage report<\/h3>\n<p>Diving back into the Google Search Console coverage report, we can look at the status of every page of the website.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/technical-seo-checklist-check-impressions.jpg\" alt=\"Google Analytics impressions\" width=\"832\" height=\"396\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In this report we can see:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Errors:<\/strong> Redirect errors, 404s.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Valid with warnings<\/strong>: Pages that are indexed but with warnings attached to them<\/li>\n<li><strong>Valid<\/strong>: Pages that are successfully indexed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Excluded<\/strong>: Pages that are excluded from being indexed and the reasons for this, such as pages with redirects or blocked by the robots.txt.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can also analyze specific URLs using the URL inspection tool. Perhaps you want to check a new page you\u2019ve added is indexed or troubleshoot a URL if there has been a drop in traffic to one of your main pages.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Use a crawl tool (like Screaming Frog)<\/h3>\n<p>Another good way to check the indexability of your website is to run a crawl. One of the most powerful and versatile pieces of crawling software is Screaming Frog. Depending on the size of your website, you can use the free version which has a crawl limit of 500 URLs, and more limited capabilities; or the paid version which is \u00a3149 per year with no crawl limit, greater functionality and APIs available.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/technical-seo-checklist-indexability-report.jpg\" alt=\"technical SEO index report\" width=\"781\" height=\"390\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Once the crawl has run you can see two columns regarding indexing.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Indexability<\/strong>: This will indicate whether the URL is \u201cIndexable\u201d or \u201cNon-Indexable.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Indexability Status<\/strong>: This will show the reason why a URL is non-indexable. For example, if it\u2019s canonicalised to another URL or has a no-index tag.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/14\/seo-tools\"> SEO tool<\/a> is a great way of bulk auditing your site to understand which pages are being indexed and will therefore appear in the search results and which ones are non-indexable. Sort the columns and look for anomalies; using the Google Analytics API is a good way of identifying important pages of which you can check their indexability.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Search on Google<\/h3>\n<p>Finally, the easiest way of checking how many of your pages are indexed is using the site:domain Google Search parameter. In the search bar, input site:yourdomain and press enter. The search results will show you every page on your website that has been indexed by Google. Here\u2019s an example:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/technical-seo-checklist-domain-search.jpg\" alt=\"domain search example\" width=\"666\" height=\"333\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Here we see that boots.com has around 95,000 URLs indexed. Using this function can give you a good understanding of how many pages Google is currently storing. If you notice a large difference between the number of pages you think you have and the number of pages being indexed, then it is worth investigating further.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the HTTP version of your site still being indexed?<\/li>\n<li>Do you have duplicate pages indexed that should be canonicalised?<\/li>\n<li>Are large parts of your website not being indexed that should be?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Using these three techniques, you can build up a good picture of how your site is being indexed by Google and make changes accordingly.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Review your sitemap<\/h2>\n<p>The importance of a comprehensive and structured sitemap cannot be underestimated when it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/search-engine-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO<\/a>. Your XML sitemap is a map of your website to Google and other search engine crawlers. Essentially, it helps these crawlers find and rank your website pages.<\/p>\n<p>There are some important elements to consider when it comes to an effective sitemap:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your sitemap should be formatted properly in an XML document.<\/li>\n<li>It should follow XML sitemap protocol.<\/li>\n<li>Only include canonical versions of URLs.<\/li>\n<li>Do not include \u201cnoindex\u201d URLs.<\/li>\n<li>Include all new pages when you update or create them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you use the Yoast SEO plugin, it can create an XML sitemap for you. If you\u2019re using Screaming Frog, their sitemap analysis is very detailed. You can see the URLs in your sitemap, missing URLs and orphaned URLs.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/technical-seo-checklist-sitemap.jpg\" alt=\"sitemap example\" width=\"537\" height=\"297\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Make sure your sitemap includes your most important pages, isn\u2019t including pages you don\u2019t want Google to index, and is structured correctly. Once you have done all this, you should resubmit your sitemap to your Google Search Console.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED:<\/strong> Get a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/18\/website-maintenance\">website maintenance checklist<\/a> to keep your site in good shape.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Ensure your website is mobile-friendly<\/h2>\n<p>Last year <a href=\"https:\/\/webmasters.googleblog.com\/2018\/03\/rolling-out-mobile-first-indexing.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google announced the roll out of mobile-first indexing<\/a>. This meant that instead of using the desktop versions of the page for ranking and indexing, they would be using the mobile version of your page. This is all part of keeping up with how users are engaging with content online. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/277125\/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">52% of global internet traffic <\/a>now comes from mobile devices so ensuring your website is mobile-friendly is more important than ever.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/search.google.com\/test\/mobile-friendly\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mobile-Friendly Test <\/a>is a free tool you can use to check if your page is mobile responsive and easy to use. Input your domain, and it will show you how the page is rendered for mobile and indicate whether it is mobile-friendly.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to manually check your website, too. Use your own phone and navigate across your site, spotting any errors along key conversion pathways of your site. Check all contact forms, phone numbers, and key service pages are functioning correctly. If you\u2019re on desktop, right click and inspect the page.<\/p>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t built your website to be compatible on mobile, then you should address this immediately (see the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/15\/mobile-first-indexing\">2021 update on mobile-first indexing<\/a>). Many of your competitors will have already considered this and the longer you leave it the further behind you\u2019ll be. Don\u2019t miss out on traffic and potential conversions by leaving it any longer.<\/p>\n<p>For more on this aspect of SEO, head to our post on mobile-first indexing<\/p>\n<h2>5. Audit page speed<\/h2>\n<p>Page speed is now a ranking factor. Having a site that is fast, responsive and user-friendly is the name of the game for Google in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>You can assess your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/22\/google-speed-update\">site\u2019s speed<\/a> with a whole variety of tools. I\u2019ll cover some of the main ones here and include some recommendations.<\/p>\n<h3>Google PageSpeed Insights<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/speed\/pagespeed\/insights\/\">Google PageSpeed Insights<\/a> is another powerful and free Google tool. It gives you a score of \u201cFast,\u201d \u201cAverage,\u201d or \u201cSlow\u201d on both mobile and desktop, and it includes recommendations for improving your page speed.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/technical-seo-checklist-google-pagespeed-insights-opporunities.jpg\" alt=\"Google PageSpeed Insights &quot;Opportunities&quot;\" width=\"875\" height=\"239\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Test your homepage and core pages to see where your website is coming up short and what you can do to improve your site speed.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to understand that when digital marketers talk about page speed, we aren\u2019t just referring to how fast the page loads for a person but also how easy and fast it is for search engines to crawl. This is why it\u2019s best practice to minify and bundle your CSS and Javascript files. Don\u2019t rely on just checking how the page looks to the naked eye, use online tools to fully analyse how the page loads for humans <em>and <\/em>search engines.<\/p>\n<p>Google has another free tool for site speed focusing on mobile in particular, reinforcing how important mobile site speed is for Google. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/intl\/en-gb\/feature\/testmysite\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Test My Site<\/a> from Google provides you with in-depth analysis on how your website for mobile, including:<\/p>\n<p><strong>How fast your site is on a 3G and 4G connection <\/strong><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/technical-seo-checklist-4G-3G.jpg\" alt=\"site speed 3G or 4G image\" width=\"763\" height=\"345\" \/><\/div>\n<p>It will include your speed in seconds, rating, and whether it is slowing down or speeding up.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Custom fixes for individual pages <\/strong><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/technical-seo-checklist-individual-page-check.jpg\" alt=\"individual page check\" width=\"763\" height=\"474\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Ability to benchmark your site speed against up to 10 competitors<\/strong><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/technical-seo-checklist-competitor-benchmark.jpg\" alt=\"technical seo competitor benchmarks\" width=\"759\" height=\"443\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>Most importantly, how your revenue is impacted by site speed<\/strong><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/technical-seo-checklist-revenue.jpg\" alt=\"revenue image\" width=\"768\" height=\"373\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This is vital if you own an ecommerce site, because it demonstrates how much potential revenue you are losing from poor mobile site speed and the positive impact small improvements can make to your bottom line.<\/p>\n<p>Conveniently, it can all be summarised in your free, easy to understand report.<\/p>\n<h3>Google Analytics<\/h3>\n<p>You can also use Google Analytics to see detailed diagnostics of how to improve your site speed. The site speed area in Analytics, found in Behaviour &gt; Site Speed, is packed full of useful data including how specific pages perform in different browsers and countries. You can check this against your page views to make sure you are prioritising your most important pages.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/technical-seo-checklist-google-analytics.jpg\" alt=\"Google Analytics screenshot\" width=\"753\" height=\"64\" \/><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/technical-seo-checklist-more-google-analytics.jpg\" alt=\"Google Analytics\" width=\"778\" height=\"158\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-increase-website-speed\">page load speed<\/a> depends on many different factors. But there are some common fixes that you can look at once you\u2019ve done your research, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Optimising your images<\/li>\n<li>Fix bloated javascript<\/li>\n<li>Reducing server requests<\/li>\n<li>Ensure effective caching<\/li>\n<li>Look at your server, it needs to be quick<\/li>\n<li>Consider using a Content Delivery Network (CDN)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>6. Duplicate content review<\/h2>\n<p>Finally, it\u2019s time to look at your website\u2019s duplicate content. As most people in digital marketing know, duplicate content is a big no-no for SEO. While there is no Google penalty for duplicate content, Google doesn\u2019t like multiple copies of the same information. They serve little purpose to the user and Google struggles to understand which page to rank in the SERPs\u2014ultimately meaning it\u2019s more likely to serve one of your competitor\u2019s pages.<\/p>\n<p>There is one quick check you can do using Google search parameters. Enter \u201cinfo:www.your-domain-name.com\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Head to the last page of the search results, if you have duplicate content you may see the following message:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/technical-seo-checklist-duplicate-content-warning.jpg\" alt=\"duplicate content warning\" width=\"598\" height=\"65\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If you have duplicate content showing here, then it\u2019s worth running a crawl using Screaming Frog. You can then sort by Page Title to see if there are any duplicate pages on your site.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/technical-seo-checklist-duplicate-content-review.jpg\" alt=\"duplicate content review sheet\" width=\"832\" height=\"338\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>Get your technical SEO audit started<\/h2>\n<p>These really are the basics of technical SEO, any digital marketer worth their salt will have these fundamentals working for any website they manage.
