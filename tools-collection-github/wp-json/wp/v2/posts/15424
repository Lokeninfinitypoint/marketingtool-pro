Tryptophan comas. Mother-in-laws.<\/p>\n<p>Yup: the holiday season is finally underway. For most people that means truncated workweeks, a few extra layers for the daily commute (in our neck of the woods, at least), and those warm-fuzzy feelings incited by too much time spent among distant relatives. For ecommerce advertisers, however, the end of the year inevitably comes with a heaping side of unyielding stress.<\/p>\n<p>Unless, of course, you\u2019ve decided to alleviate the pre-yuletide neuroses associated with managing your Google search and shopping ads with product promotions.<\/p>\n<p>Today, I\u2019m going to show you how you can gain a distinct competitive advantage in Google Ads using one (or every) flavor of these powerful tools. For those unfamiliar, product promotions include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Merchant Center-only promotion extensions<\/li>\n<li>Implementing sale pricing within your shopping feed<\/li>\n<li>Pricing and promotion extensions (these are for search ads, but they\u2019re particularly useful for ecommerce advertisers!)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For each, you\u2019ll learn what each promotion is, when to use them, and, most importantly, how to implement them in your Google Ads account.<\/p>\n<p>But first&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>The (Rather Obvious) Case for Product Promotions<\/h2>\n<p>Holiday shoppers are a fickle bunch.<\/p>\n<p>They\u2019re picky.

The specific colors used for annotations differ depending on where your ad appears.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of whether or not the annotation shows, there are, of course, some additional hoops to jump through (thanks, Google!) in order for a sale price to show at all:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The initial price and the sale price must <strong>both<\/strong> be present on your landing page. The sale price does not have to be more prominent, but both prices <em>do<\/em> need to be clearly displayed.<\/li>\n<li>The sale price in your feed needs to match the sale price on your website. It also needs to be presented in a way that makes sense within the context of your target country\u2019s currency (so, like, $511.918171773 aint gonna fly)<\/li>\n<li>This should go without saying, but the sale price you submit must be <em>lower<\/em> than your original price.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Finally, know this: if your sale will run in perpetuity, you don\u2019t <em>have<\/em> to include the <strong>sale_price_effective_date <\/strong>field in your feed; Google will assume that the sale price should go into effect ASAP and it will run until you remove the field entirely.<\/p>\n<h2>Leverage Merchant Promotions<\/h2>\n<p>Merchant Promotions let you augment your shopping ads on Google with badges that convey potentially irresistible offers.

They\u2019re the best friend of the busy ecommerce advertiser looking to stand out from the competition.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, ads using promotion extensions had CTRs that more than doubled those of text ads served without any extensions:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3bf27356-7d74-4a52-a4de-bec5f0245ed2\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/shopping-promotions-google-ads-promotion-extension-performance202800229.png\" alt=\"Google Ads promotion extension performance\" width=\"458\" height=\"282\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Promotion extensions show a price tag icon beneath your ad and highlight a sale you\u2019re running on your website. Additionally, you can specify details around your promotion, such as whether it requires any promo code at checkout and when the sales ends.<\/p>\n<p>As you can imagine after reading that description, promotion extensions have <em>a lot<\/em> of moving parts, which can make them seem a bit intimidating.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7f52bc28-ced8-4ad9-b171-28dae796a585\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/shopping-promotions-google-ads-promotion-extension-components202800229.png\" alt=\"promotion extension components\" width=\"407\" height=\"111\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The components include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Occasion: <\/strong>An optional field you can use if your promotion aligns with a holiday (and in our case, it certainly does).
