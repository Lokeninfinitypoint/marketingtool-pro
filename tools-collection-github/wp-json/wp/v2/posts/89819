For ecommerce companies, these values are pretty easy to assign. They\u2019re the value of the product that you sold on your website.<\/p>\n<p>But for lead generation companies, it might not be as clear as to what the value should be. Or why you should use values in the first place. Most lead generation companies that we work with only use conversion total and cost per conversion as their main performance metrics. But that\u2019s leaving quite a bit of optimization on the table.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, I want to tell you why you should be using conversion values in your lead generation account on Google Ads. And for those of you who don\u2019t know the value of a lead, I\u2019ll walk you through how to calculate that based on your actual business numbers.<\/p>\n<h3>Contents<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#google-ads-conversion-values\">What types of businesses should use conversion values in Google Ads?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#google-ads-conversion-values-benefits\">Why should lead gen companies use conversion values in Google Ads?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-to-add-google-ads-conversion-values\">How do you add values to conversions in Google Ads?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-to-calculate-google-ads-conversion-values\">How do you calculate the value of a lead in Google Ads?<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"google-ads-conversion-values\"><\/div>\n<h2>Who should use conversion values in Google Ads?<\/h2>\n<p>If your lead generation company only uses one type of lead and every customer has the same value to you, then this strategy might be a little bit overkill. Target CPA is likely okay for you since you know the regular value of a customer and can calculate an efficient lead cost from that.<\/p>\n<p>But if you\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/lead-generation-ideas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">like most lead generation companies<\/a> we work with, you likely have one of two things going on that makes you suitable for using conversion values.<\/p>\n<p>First, you may be using multiple types of lead forms on your site. One might ask for only name and email and be for content while another form might ask for lots of identifying information and be for a demo request.<\/p>\n<p>Second, if your products or services have widely differing revenues for your company then each customer (and lead) holds different values for you based on what they select. That\u2019s worth calculating into your marketing efforts. One customer may be worth $500 and another may be worth $10,000 or even $1 million for your company.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re in either one of these buckets or some combination of both, using conversion values in your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-run-google-ads\">Google Ads account<\/a> will be a highly valuable tool for you to see the best performance you can from your campaigns.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udca1 How can your business&#8217;s Google Ads account reach peak performance?<\/strong> Find out instantly with our free <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads Grader<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-conversion-values-benefits\"><\/div>\n<h2>Why lead gen companies should use conversion values in Google Ads<\/h2>\n<p>In my mind, there are two main reasons why lead generation companies should include conversion values in their Google Ads account whenever possible.<\/p>\n<h3>Better transparency into campaign performance<\/h3>\n<p>The first is simply for transparency into campaign performance. For ecommerce companies, it\u2019s very easy to log into Google Ads and see which campaigns are<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-not-working\"> not only performing wel<\/a>l but which are the most profitable. They\u2019re the ones that are not only making sales but making sales at a cost that is much lower than the revenue associated with that sale.<\/p>\n<p>For lead generation companies, you may have a campaign that\u2019s generating lots of leads at a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/07\/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead-google-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">low cost per lead<\/a>, but your actual profitability on that campaign is low or even negative because some or none of those leads are turning into customers.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not generating customers, you\u2019re not generating revenue.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve seen many accounts that generate lots of leads at a low cost, but they\u2019re extremely low quality and never offset their advertising cost because they don\u2019t generate customers. Cost per lead can be a very misleading metric and having values associated with your conversions can help you understand which<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/10\/google-ads-account-structure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> keywords, ad groups, and campaigns<\/a> are actually impacting your company&#8217;s bottom line for the better rather than simply spending more and generating nothing.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-account-structure.webp\" alt=\"gogle ads account structure chart\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89845 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-account-structure.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-account-structure-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Conversion values can help you better understand which assets within your Google Ads account structure are contributing to your bottom line. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udea8 Pro tip: Get your account structure in order before you add conversion values into the mix<\/strong> using our free, complete guide to<a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.localiq.com\/WSLIQContentDLAccountStructure.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_LastAccountStructureGuide_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> the perfect Google Ads account structure<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h3>Better understanding of which campaigns are the most profitable<\/h3>\n<p>The second reason is to go one step beyond simply understanding which campaigns are the most profitable and actually leveraging Google\u2019s very smart machine learning to lean further into the campaigns that are more profitable and lean out of those that are less profitable.<\/p>\n<p>More often than not, most lead generation companies use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/19\/google-ads-automated-bidding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">conversion-focused bidding strategies<\/a> like maximize conversion or target CPA. While there\u2019s nothing wrong with those bidding strategies and they can perform very well for your account, they can sometimes fall into the trap that I just mentioned. Generating lots of leads at a low cost per lead, but that are low quality as well.<\/p>\n<p>When you incorporate conversion values into your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/customize-google-ads-conversion-tracking\">Google Ads conversion tracking<\/a> you can leverage the Google smart bidding algorithm to maximize conversion value and target return on ad spend to not only optimize toward leads but higher quality leads as well.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a scenario for a business with multiple calls to action on its site. Let\u2019s say they\u2019re using a contact us form and an ebook content download as CTAs. When someone converts, both of these are leads generated for your business, but they have very different levels of intent.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-conversion-actions-example-png.webp\" alt=\"google ads conversion actions - example site\" width=\"765\" height=\"339\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89836 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-conversion-actions-example-png.webp 765w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-conversion-actions-example-480x213.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 765px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>All the potential actions on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bostonstandardplumbing.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this example site<\/a> could be worth more or less to the business. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>The contact us form may be worth 10 times as much as the ebook download because those users are far more likely to turn into a customer over somebody simply wanting to read your content.<\/p>\n<p>In the last section of this post, we\u2019ll talk about how to calculate the value of a given lead type, but for now, it\u2019s important to understand that differing lead types should have different values associated with them so that you can understand the actual profitability of different campaign groups and keywords.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re leveraging smart bidding, Google can optimize to a higher profitability level by generating leads for the ebook at a low cost per lead since the likelihood of a customer is low. For the contact us form, Google has a lot more leniency because that lead action is worth so much more to your company based on the value you assigned it.<\/p>\n<p>In practicality, a single campaign with goals for ebook downloads and contact us forms could be bidding drastically differently from one user to the next depending on which conversion action Google thinks is likely to take place. This is similar to how Google bids more or less aggressively for ecommerce accounts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udcca Understand your most important baseline metrics in Google Ads<\/strong> with our free <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/google-ads-industry-benchmarks?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2024GoogleAdsBenchmarks_Download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Search Ads Benchmarks Report<\/a> that includes average cost per click, cost per lead, and more broken out by industry!<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-add-google-ads-conversion-values\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to add values to conversions in Google Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Adding values to your conversion actions in Google Ads is very simple.<\/p>\n<p>First, navigate to the conversion summary page by going to Goal and conversion summary in the left-hand navigation.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-conversion-values-summary.webp\" alt=\"google ads conversion values - conversion summary screenshot\" width=\"357\" height=\"366\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89833 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-conversion-values-summary.webp 357w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-conversion-values-summary-293x300.webp 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re creating a new conversion action, then value will be one of the settings that you can add in the conversion set up process.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re updating the value in an existing conversion action, all you have to do is click on the conversion action name, navigate to the settings tab, click edit, then add in the value you want for that conversion action, and then click save in the bottom right corner.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-conversion-value-goals.webp\" alt=\"google ads conversion values - conversion value section in google ads\" width=\"769\" height=\"363\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89830 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-conversion-value-goals.webp 769w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/google-ads-conversion-value-goals-480x227.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 769px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-calculate-google-ads-conversion-values\"><\/div>\n<h2>How to calculate the value of a lead in Google Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you know why and how to assign values to your conversion actions in Google Ads, it\u2019s time to talk about what the value should be for each lead.

Just use the amount of revenue you gain every time you get a customer.<\/p>\n<p>For companies that have differing degrees of revenue associated with each customer, this will take a little bit of work.
