So if you are targeting multiple exact match keywords in an ad group, prior to this update, Google might choose an exact match keyword slightly different from the search query if it is deemed more relevant to the meaning of that query. Now, it will prioritize the identical exact match keyword.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\" xml_lang=\"EN\">Now this same logic will be applied to broad and phrase match keywords.
