Or revamp your website. Or maybe you\u2019re building a site for the first time. How are you going to present yourself to the world wide web? What does a visitor need to know about you and your business to compel them to stick around?<\/p>\n<p>As someone coming off of a fresh job search (yay, WordStream!), I can\u2019t tell you how much About Us content I browsed over the past few months. Or worse, couldn\u2019t find at all!<\/p>\n<p>In this guide I\u2019ll share 3 main points to keep in mind when you\u2019re looking for answers to that eternal question, \u201cHow do I design my About Us page?\u201d\u2014or your audience\u2019s question, \u201cTell me about yourself\u201d \u2014including tips for your About Us page\u2019s content, layout, design, and concept.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1dbe0f72-75a7-404c-bde7-80260381292a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/about20us20page20kickstarter20resized.jpg\" alt=\"kickstarter about us page guide\" width=\"800\" height=\"759\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Kickstarter\u2019s About Us page answers all our questions<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Answer the 5 W\u2019s of Show and Tell<\/h2>\n<p>In kindergarten, Show and Tell was my favorite day of the week. Probably because I like to talk (a lot) and I had an impressive collection of Beanie Babies. The teachers made us follow a basic structure of \u201cwho\/what\/where\/when\/why\/how\u201d to keep our stories going in the right direction.<\/p>\n<p>Turns out, kindergarten teachers knew what they were doing; using the same structure, you can share your story on your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/about-us-page-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">About Us page<\/a> with everything your visitors need to know. So keep these five W\u2019s in mind when writing the content for your About Us page:<\/p>\n<h3>Who:<\/h3>\n<p>\u2026is your team? Who had the idea in the very beginning, who is in charge now, what kind of people work there? If you are connected with non-profit organizations, what do they do and why do you care? You can also use this section to plug in a \u201cWe\u2019re Hiring!\u201d link with open positions\u2014if the About Our Team content is engaging, hopefully a prospect will want to join the party.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6deb9f5c-38d6-40ea-82b5-a0eca3947be8\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/about20us20page20guide20blue20apron20resized.jpg\" alt=\"blue apron about us page guide\" width=\"800\" height=\"355\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Blue Apron features a picture of their whole team!<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>What:<\/h3>\n<p>If you are blazing your own trail and offering something brand new, this is SO important. Your branding could be amazing, your website design engaging, but if I can\u2019t understand what it is you are offering, I\u2019m going to abandon your site and never look back. However, if your service is retail (i.e. Brandy Melville, Kate Spade, Tobi), I think we all know what you do. Feel free to move along.<\/p>\n<p>Rent the Runway does an amazing job at explaining what they do\u2014the company\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.renttherunway.com\/pages\/about\">About Us page<\/a> is totally comprehensive\u2014and I especially love the graphic they use to explain their service.

If I am looking for a service, I want to know where your stores are; or do you deliver to my location? This may be the simplest step in your About Us design; an address to an office will work! Or a little map with store\/office locations, those are my favorite. Cupcakes are also my favorite. (If they\u2019re quarter-size, I can eat 12 and not worry about it, right?)<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2786a18b-496b-427a-a51d-3932ea63767a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/about20us20page20guide20baked20by20melissa20resized_0.jpg\" alt=\"baked by melissa about us page guide\" width=\"800\" height=\"386\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Baked by Melissa has a store locator page directly linked to their About Us content<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>When\/Why:<\/h3>\n<p>I think that you can combine the <em>when<\/em> and <em>why<\/em> because they seem to go hand-in-hand: \u201cI lost my job in finance in 2006 and decided to follow my heart\u2014so I became an eco-conscious jewelry designer!\u201d This is a key part of your story to tell, probably something that is close to your heart. This is a perfect opportunity to take your customer on a mini-adventure with you through your own soul-searching; or better, where you started and how far you\u2019ve climbed.

You want to make sure that your About Us page is attractive and compelling\u2014a nice balance of graphics\/photos and text. Look at the flow, whether that is having sub-pages within your \u201cAbout\u201d section, or simply scrolling through. Most of all, keep it in line with your brand. This aesthetic should be a perfect representation of your website and your customer\u2019s browsing experience as a whole.<\/p>\n<h3>About Us Page Examples<\/h3>\n<p>Tumblr does a great job of making their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tumblr.com\/about\">About Us page<\/a> true to brand\u2014it\u2019s simple, attractive and gives you all the information you need!
