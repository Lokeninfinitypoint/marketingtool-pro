But it can also be a very easy mistake to overlook when trying to figure out why performance isn\u2019t where you want it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-active-conversion-settings.webp\" alt=\"conversion settings in google ads showing status\" width=\"900\" height=\"350\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-92102\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-active-conversion-settings.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-active-conversion-settings-480x187.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Whenever I have a campaign that has started performing poorly, or that has never performed well, I always go back and check on the conversion tracking setup to ensure everything is working well.

Look into your goal optimization settings<\/h3>\n<p>Just because your conversion actions are firing properly doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re finished with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/04\/17\/how-to-set-up-google-ads-enhanced-conversions\">conversion action setup<\/a>. Depending on how you have your account set up, you can be either prioritizing or de-prioritizing different conversion events.<\/p>\n<p>Here are three things to look into:<\/p>\n<h4>Account default goals<\/h4>\n<p>In the conversion manager, each action item is organized into a conversion category. That conversion category is then considered either an account default goal, meaning the conversion actions in that category will be counted in the conversions column, or not.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-account-default-goals.webp\" alt=\"google ads account default goals\" width=\"900\" height=\"350\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-92103\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-account-default-goals.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-account-default-goals-480x187.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If the conversion actions you\u2019re trying to optimize for are not in an account default goal category, then you may need to make some adjustments. (There are other settings you can use to overcome this that we\u2019ll cover soon.)<\/p>\n<h4>Secondary vs. Primary goals<\/h4>\n<p>Issues can arise when your conversion action is set to a Secondary goal rather than a Primary one. Primary goals are counted in the conversions column and used as optimization events for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-smart-bidding\">Smart Bidding<\/a>, but Secondary actions are not used as optimization signals and are only counted in the All Conversions column&#8211;not Conversions.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-secondary-goal.webp\" alt=\"google ads secondary goal\" width=\"786\" height=\"498\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-92105\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-secondary-goal.webp 786w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-secondary-goal-480x304.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 786px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Individual campaign setting goals<\/h4>\n<p>At the campaign level, advertisers can opt to use account-level or campaign-level conversions. If your campaigns are set up to focus on conversions that are different from your account-level goals, that could also be causing issues in performance.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-campaign-specific-conversion-goals.webp\" alt=\"google ads campaign specific goal\" width=\"900\" height=\"317\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-92106\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-campaign-specific-conversion-goals.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-campaign-specific-conversion-goals-480x169.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>\u2705 Action items<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Confirm all conversion tracking is working properly.<\/li>\n<li>Ensure all account default goals are set up to your liking.<\/li>\n<li>Make sure all goals are assigned either Primary or Secondary status as needed.<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t forget to confirm that all campaign-level settings are in line with your goals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"adjust-your-bid-strategies\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Adjust your bid strategies<\/h3>\n<p>All of the Google Ads bid strategies are designed to do a very specific thing, so if you\u2019re using the wrong one, it could be causing issues.<\/p>\n<p>For the most part, all of these bid strategies are pretty self-explanatory. Maximize Conversions and Maximize Conversion Value work to get you good results, but sometimes they can be less efficient than those same bid strategies with additional controls like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/31\/google-retiring-tcpa-troas\">tCPA and tROAS<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/google-ads-bidding-strategies-smart.jpg\" alt=\"google ads bidding strategies\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-91784\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/google-ads-bidding-strategies-smart.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/google-ads-bidding-strategies-smart-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But in addition to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/19\/google-ads-automated-bidding\">picking the right bid strategy<\/a>, it\u2019s also important to make sure the bid strategy is set up for success. Smart Bidding requires enough success points and wiggle room to see results.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some common problems we see with bid strategies that hinder performance:<\/p>\n<h4>Unrealistic goals<\/h4>\n<p>While we would all like to have extremely high ROAS or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-lower-cost-per-lead\">super low CPLs<\/a>, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re realistic and achievable in the long run. To help keep your goals realistic, start out with targets that are in line with your performance as a business.<\/p>\n<p>If your entire site sees a 300% ROI, then 300% is likely a reasonable ROAS to set. When you leverage unrealistic goals, like 1,000% ROAS on a site with 300% ROI, you\u2019ll stifle the bid strategy, and it will slowly stop serving ads since it likely can\u2019t hit your target.<\/p>\n<h4>Limited performance indicators<\/h4>\n<p>A common issue I see with bid strategies centers around the volume of conversions being tracked. A general rule of thumb is one conversion per day.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-smart-bidding-suggestion-for-volume.webp\" alt=\"google ads smart bidding volume suggestion\" width=\"900\" height=\"185\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-92108\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-smart-bidding-suggestion-for-volume.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-smart-bidding-suggestion-for-volume-480x99.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If your account (not campaign, account) isn\u2019t averaging at least 30 conversions in 30 days, then you might not have enough volume to optimize for that action.<\/p>\n<p>Without those positive indicators coming in regularly, Google won\u2019t get enough positive signals that a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/conversion-rate-optimization-marketing\">click leads to a conversion<\/a> and will, again, slowly stop serving ads.<\/p>\n<h4>Restricted budgets<\/h4>\n<p>Even if you have realistic goals and enough conversion volume, keeping your budget too low can cause issues. Yes, we know Google always tells you to increase your budget, but this could be a performance killer.<\/p>\n<p>If your target CPL is $100, but your daily budget is only $50, then you\u2019re setting that campaign up to hit only one conversion every couple of days, falling below our regular rule of thumb.<\/p>\n<h4>Not adjusting bid strategies with time<\/h4>\n<p>Just because a bid strategy works for you for a time, that doesn\u2019t mean it will work forever. You may need to change bid strategies or tweak the settings for that bid strategy over time. These require regular maintenance and adjustment right alongside all the other aspects within your account.<\/p>\n<h4>\u2705 Action items<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Review your bid strategies and ensure they\u2019re the right ones to achieve your goals.<\/li>\n<li>Be sure the goals for your campaigns are realistic.<\/li>\n<li>Ensure your campaigns have enough budget for your bid strategy to operate.<\/li>\n<li>Only use Smart Bidding strategies for conversion actions that have enough volume to support the machine learning cycles.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-audit\">Regularly review your bid strategy settings and performance<\/a>, and don\u2019t be afraid to test and iterate as needed to keep seeing strong results.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\ud83d\udcb0 <strong>How much should you be spending on Google Ads?<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/google-ads-industry-benchmarks?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_2025GoogleAdsBenchmarks_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\">Get our latest Google Ads Benchmarks to find out<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"evaluate-your-targeting\"><\/div>\n<h3>4.

They have the widest reach of all the match types and can end up showing for quite a bit of traffic that isn\u2019t relevant to your business. Broad match isn\u2019t categorically bad, but without oversight, it can get out of hand very quickly.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/keyword-match-types-broad-match-png.webp\" alt=\"keyword match types chart with arrow pointing to broad match\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-90367\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/keyword-match-types-broad-match-png.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/keyword-match-types-broad-match-480x308.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Performance Max<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/01\/is-performance-max-right-for-you\">Performance Max<\/a> targets users across all networks within the Google Ads ecosystem, and each of those placements has their own set of best practices when it comes to targeting.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/performance-max-placements.webp\" alt=\"performance max placements\" width=\"900\" height=\"424\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-92109\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/performance-max-placements.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/performance-max-placements-480x226.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Within the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/23\/optimize-performance-max-campaigns\">Performance Max campaign setup<\/a>, you have some controls over where you show, but they\u2019re less specific than other campaign types. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/11\/search-themes-for-performance-max-campaigns\">Search themes<\/a> are just suggestions, not keywords.

Determine whether or not you have segment inefficiencies<\/h3>\n<p>Expanding on the idea of targeting inefficiencies, some pockets of performance aren\u2019t necessarily targeting but are still sneaky subsets of targeting that can drive your account to underperform.<\/p>\n<h4>Network problems<\/h4>\n<p>For Search campaigns, you can opt into the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-search-partner-insights\">Search Partner Network<\/a>, which is an expanded network of listings on sites other than Google, but powered by Google Search. These placements can range from totally legit to completely sketchy.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-network-segmentation-report.webp\" alt=\"google ads network segmentation report\" width=\"900\" height=\"298\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-92112\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-network-segmentation-report.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-network-segmentation-report-480x159.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Whenever I have bad performance in a Search campaign, one of the first places I look is at the Search Partner performance.

By default, Google will opt Search campaigns into the Display Network. Please, please, please, don\u2019t do this. If you want a cross-platform campaign, use Performance Max.

Those differences can cause performance variance between the device categories.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Google has kind of buried the Device report in the newly rearranged interface. You can find your accounts\u2019 device performance in the Insights and Reports section, in the When and Where Ads Showed report, then choose the Devices tab. Depending on the other settings for your campaign, you can either opt out of a device category as a whole or you can adjust your bids to be more or less aggressive for a specific device category.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-device-performance.webp\" alt=\"google ads device performance\" width=\"900\" height=\"390\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-92114\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-device-performance.webp 900w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/google-ads-device-performance-480x208.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Additional segments to review<\/h4>\n<p>Other categories that are good to check include your Ad Scheduling, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/10\/17\/google-ads-location-targeting\">Location targeting<\/a>, and Audience segments.

Assess your copy and landing pages<\/h3>\n<p>Google Ads campaigns definitely have lots of technical considerations that go into them to see good performance. The previous sections should highlight that pretty well.<\/p>\n<p>But these campaigns also require you to have a personal marketing touch, which means the content and designs that feed your campaigns need to be compelling and user-friendly.<\/p>\n<p>One problem area can be your ad copy.
