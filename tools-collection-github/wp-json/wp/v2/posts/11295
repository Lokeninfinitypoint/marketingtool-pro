I was a doubter for some time, but let me tell you: This platform is addictive in all the right ways. Not only is there something for everyone (dance Tiktok, activist TikTok, beauty TikTok, beans TikTok), you will inevitably learn new skills and songs. Oh, the songs! It\u2019s also basically a free comedy show for as long as you can swipe\u2014or until you get a Netflix-like warning that tells you to be responsible and stop scrolling. Guilty.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/tiktok-advertising-intro.jpg\" alt=\"TikTok advertising example, Hollister ad\" width=\"282\" height=\"609\" \/><\/div>\n<p>My point? If you\u2019re not on TikTok, you should be. And your business should be, too. The platform is quickly surpassing Instagram for youth engagement metrics and if your audience is there, that\u2019s where you should be speaking their language. In this guide, I\u2019m going through how to get started with TikTok advertising in five simple steps. Plus, I\u2019ll share how to report on your ads.<\/p>\n<p>But first, let\u2019s talk about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/11\/advertising-on-tiktok\">why you should be advertising on TikTok<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Why TikTok ads?<\/h2>\n<p>TikTok is the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pixlee.com\/blog\/advertise-tiktok\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fastest growing social media platform<\/a> with more than 2 billion downloads to date. Particularly in this pandemic world, TikTok can be a whiff of fresh air for people looking for new and funny ways to connect with each other by creating their own content.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/tiktok-advertising-downloads-1.jpg\" alt=\"TikTok tops this most downloaded apps graphic\" width=\"725\" height=\"432\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>TikTok was downloaded <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/sensortower.com\/blog\/top-apps-worldwide-june-2020-by-downloads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>87 million times<\/em><\/a><em> just last month.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>While TikTok doesn\u2019t release audience data, reports confirm that their user base is expanding from Gen Z to Millennials; however, <a href=\"https:\/\/tinuiti.com\/blog\/paid-social\/tiktok-advertising-guide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">67% of users are under the age of 29<\/a>. They have about 800 million MAU (monthly active users), and 65 million of those are in the US.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, costs are feasible. When you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/07\/facebook-vs-tiktok-ads\">compare TikTok to Facebook ads<\/a>, the cost per click is about the same at $1.00.<\/p>\n<h2>5 steps to set up your TikTok ads<\/h2>\n<p>TikTok advertising is structured in three layers: ad campaigns, ad groups, and ads. In this section, I\u2019m going to walk you through the steps to create each of these to get your TikTok ads up and running.<\/p>\n<h3>Step #1: Create a business account<\/h3>\n<p>Even if you already have a personal TikTok account, you\u2019ll need to create an account specifically for your business\u2014I would recommend using your business email here. In the past, you had to get your business approved to advertise on the platform, but now anyone can get in and start launching campaigns.<\/p>\n<h3>Step #2: Create an ad campaign<\/h3>\n<p>Once you log in, TikTok will take you straight to the campaign creation. Lucky you. If you\u2019d like to poke around before getting started, you can easily navigate back via the \u201cCampaign\u201d tab. Truly, this platform is very simple (almost barebones), so you cannot get lost.<\/p>\n<p>Remember to name your campaign and set your budget in the settings! A nice feature on TikTok: You can easily start a creative split test at the campaign level.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve named your campaign and set your budget, the time has come. You need to choose an advertising objective for your campaign. Like most ad platforms, TikTok breaks it down for you. Let\u2019s run through the options.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/09\/best-time-to-post-on-tiktok\">The Best Time to Post on TikTok<\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Advertising objectives<\/h4>\n<p>Your first and most top-of-funnel option is <strong>awareness<\/strong>: launch a reach campaign. This type of campaign is purely for branding purposes and will not include a call-to-action and simply aims to show your advertisement to as many users as possible.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/tiktok-advertising-advertising-campaigns.jpg\" alt=\"TikTok advertising campaign objectives\" width=\"763\" height=\"345\" \/><\/div>\n<p>A bit more down-funnel, <strong>consideration <\/strong>objectives are fairly clear-cut. Use your advertising spend on TikTok to drive users to your site, download your mobile app, or increase the views on your branded video on TikTok. This type of ad would look a bit like the one below.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/tiktok-advertising-advertising-objective-consideration-example.jpg\" alt=\"TikTok ad example in consideration stage\" width=\"282\" height=\"609\" \/><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/tiktok-advertising-advertising-objective-consideration-example-cta.jpg\" alt=\"TikTok ad example consideration stage CTA\" width=\"282\" height=\"609\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Last but not least: <strong>conversion<\/strong>. This is the choose-your-own-adventure campaign, where you get to pick the end goal, whether it is opting into an email newsletter, registering for an account, or making a purchase on your e-commerce site.<\/p>\n<h3>Step #3: Select an ad group<\/h3>\n<p>This is where things get operational. Here you\u2019ll choose the ad placements, details, budgeting and billing, and third-party tracking. Ad details will vary based on your campaign objective, but should be pretty straight-forward. For example, if you chose \u201ctraffic\u201d as your objective, the ad details will need to identify if you\u2019re driving users to your website or an app and exactly where you want them to land.<\/p>\n<p>Reminder: If you are driving deeper-funnel actions, you\u2019ll need to place a TikTok pixel on your site to capture those users. This is just like placing a pixel for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/11\/facebook-conversion-tracking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook<\/a> or Twitter; feel free to pop it into your Google Tag Manager and go.<\/p>\n<h4>Placement<\/h4>\n<p>TikTok gives you a few options when choosing your ad placement, but only for certain campaign objectives. TikTok, like Facebook, has a \u201cfamily of apps\u201d that you can advertise on\u2014like BuzzVideo, Pangle, News Republic\u2014but these are mostly useful if you\u2019re advertising outside the US. You can choose to have your ads automatically placed across these apps according to TikTok\u2019s algorithm, or you can specify where you want your ads to appear. <a href=\"https:\/\/ads.tiktok.com\/help\/article?aid=6669234451085524998\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get more details from TikTok here.<\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Targeting<\/h4>\n<p>There\u2019s been some complaints about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/23\/tiktok-ads-targeting\">TikTok\u2019s audience targeting<\/a>, or lack thereof, which I don\u2019t totally disagree with. Like the ad manager, the targeting options are pretty basic. The only demographics you can target are based on gender, age, location, and language.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/tiktok-advertising-targeting.jpg\" alt=\"TikTok targeting options\" width=\"740\" height=\"290\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The most in-depth targeting is under \u201cinterests,\u201d which includes a variety of topics people follow on TikTok, from apparel and appliances down to tech and travel. These interest categories are pretty broad (and who is following appliances on TikTok?!), so where you get the most bang for your buck will be through creating a custom or lookalike audience from your existing database.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/tiktok-advertising-targeting-create-audience.jpg\" alt=\"TikTok advertising audience upload option\" width=\"740\" height=\"290\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Finally, you can target by device type and connection type\u2014which is pretty interesting, I\u2019ve never heard of targeting people who only have 2G &#8230;<\/p>\n<h4>Budget and bidding<\/h4>\n<p>Fill in your daily budget, and if you selected a split test in the previous step, select the dates that you want it to run. You can then choose your bid per click, or conversion, or view (whatever goal you set for the campaign), the delivery type, and input any third party tracking links you might want to include for your analytics. <a href=\"https:\/\/ads.tiktok.com\/help\/article?aid=112157096317738182\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here is a full list of third-party measurement platforms<\/a> that TikTok supports.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind, your daily budget needs to be $20 and up. You can choose dayparting and frequency caps in this section if you know what times your target audience is most active on TikTok.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED:<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/11\/how-to-stitch-on-tiktok\"> How to Stitch on TikTok (With Hilarious Examples)<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Step #4: Create your TikTok ads<\/h3>\n<p>If your business doesn\u2019t have an in-house creative team or a creative agency or a videographer on the team, fear not. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/23\/tiktok-marketing\">TikTok marketing<\/a> truly is the right channel for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/13\/ugc-instagram\">user-generated content<\/a>, and they will hold your hand through the ad creation process.<\/p>\n<p>Check out the screenshot below for specs. The best (BEST!) part of creating TikTok ads is that the platform will help you create a video with a matching background track from uploaded imagery. Typically, I wouldn\u2019t recommend creating a video out of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/22\/best-practices-stock-photos\">stock images<\/a>, but TikTok videos are short and casual. The less polished it looks, the more engaging it could be.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/tiktok-advertising-create-ad.jpg\" alt=\"create a TikTok ad screen\" width=\"719\" height=\"459\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If you select \u201cCreate a Video\u201d and then \u201cVideo Generator,\u201d you\u2019ll see the option for \u201cSmart Video.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>According to TikTok, the smart video generator will cut your added video transitions to the music you\u2019ve selected, according to the number of images you uploaded. They recommend uploading multiple images or videos in order to make it work properly. Check out the interface with options below.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/tiktok-advertising-create-video-ad.jpg\" alt=\"create a TikTok video ad screen\" width=\"751\" height=\"459\" \/><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/tiktok-advertising-create-video-ad-stats.jpg\" alt=\"TikTok video ads \" width=\"751\" height=\"346\" \/><\/div>\n<p>For TikTok ads, they\u2019ll appear on a user\u2019s For You page in the feed. After the video ad ends, it\u2019ll freeze on the last frame and give the user a call to action\u2014which is why they ask for the final frame above.<\/p>\n<p>You can also create a video from imagery on your <a href=\"https:\/\/ads.tiktok.com\/help\/article?aid=6713755994628816902\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">website\u2019s landing page<\/a>. This is mostly for ecommerce sites with product pages or mobile apps, but TikTok will grab images straight from your landing page, match them up with music appropriately, and make them into lovely ads.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/tiktok-advertising-example.jpg\" alt=\"TikTok advertising example\" width=\"757\" height=\"436\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As always, test, test, test. Try out different imagery and music for the same message. Focus on one simple message and test different <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/09\/call-to-action\">calls to action<\/a>. Show people using your product. Leverage <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/04\/07\/tiktok-hashtags\">TikTok hashtags<\/a>, because users absolutely use them to search for content.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/14\/tiktok-ads-library\">TikTok ads library<\/a> to see what other businesses are running for inspiration!<\/p>\n<h3>Step #5: Set up billing and payment<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019re almost home free. Just input your billing info and payment and you\u2019ll be good to start running TikTok ads!<\/p>\n<h2>Reporting on your TikTok ads<\/h2>\n<p>TikTok has a dashboard that displays all the data from your ads within the timeframe you\u2019ve selected. The dashboard can be filtered according to your goal (e.g., CPM or CPC), and any of the settings you selected when setting up your ad group. Best of all, TikTok lets you export your reports! This feature is so handy when you need to show your CMO that your TikTok ads are killing it among users interested in cars and sports.<\/p>\n<p>You can also <a href=\"https:\/\/ads.tiktok.com\/help\/article?aid=6701858262603530245\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">create custom reports<\/a> to ease your weekly reporting. These can be created from templates that TikTok provides or crafted from scratch. Here is a taste of the metrics and dimensions at your disposal.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/tiktok-advertising-reporting.jpg\" alt=\"TikTok advertising reporting screen\" width=\"747\" height=\"442\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Schedule these reports to run at a specific frequency, and ta-da! Your team will have a handy-dandy email with the attached report daily, weekly, or on specific days of the month. Just remember, anyone who gets the email will need to have access to your TikTok Ads Manager.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, if managed ads aren\u2019t your cup of tea, there are tons of influencers on the platform (seriously, TikTok has been paying influencers to join), so see what could make an impact based on your budget. Micro-influencers can make a big splash in a local market. TikTok even has their own <a href=\"https:\/\/creatormarketplace.tiktok.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">platform for partnering with these influencers<\/a>, making it much easier on you to find a good match.<\/p>\n<h2>Now you\u2019re ready to crush TikTok ads!<\/h2>\n<p>Drumroll, please \u2026 you\u2019re ready for TikTok advertising!
