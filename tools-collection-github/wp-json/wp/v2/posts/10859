However, their primary objective did not necessarily focus on driving more calls. But as of recently, Facebook quietly launched a click-to-call ad option within Website Traffic campaigns, which now allows advertisers to fill their business and client phone lines with a higher volume of calls than ever before.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6e410468-be98-49cc-9b65-04de1ba81703\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook20click20to20call20ads20call20now20example_0.png\" alt=\"facebook click to call ads example\" width=\"600\" height=\"533\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>So\u00a0in this post, I&#8217;m going to walk you through:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A refresher on the &#8220;click-to-call&#8221; call\u00a0to action for Facebook ad campaigns.<\/li>\n<li>How to set up click-to-call ads using the Reach and Website Traffic campaign objectives.<\/li>\n<li>Recommendations for which campaign to use to achieve your Facebook advertising goals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you are interested in driving more calls, read on to learn how to set up click-to-call ads using each of these campaign objectives to get your target audiences to quickly, easily, and affordably, call you.<\/p>\n<h2>What are Facebook click-to-call ads?<\/h2>\n<p>Before we dive in, let\u2019s cover exactly what click-to-call ads are. Facebook click-to-call ads allow a user to click directly on your ad through their mobile device and connect with you by phone. This ad type and \u201cCall Now\u201d call-to-action button option have been available for quite some time through Facebook\u2019s Reach campaign objective.\u00a0However, the primary goal of Reach campaigns is to reach as many people as possible within your target audience and\u00a0at the lowest cost; so these users may not always be the most likely to take the desired actions\u2014such as<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/08\/12\/ad-ctr\"> clicking the ad<\/a> to visit a landing page, calling you, or opening up their wallets to make a purchase\u2014that we may see more often with other <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/26\/facebook-objectives\">Facebook campaign objective types<\/a> and optimization settings.<\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Speaking of Facebook Ad optimization, have you tried out the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/facebook-advertising\">Facebook Ads Performance Grader<\/a>?<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s new about Facebook click-to-call ads?<\/h2>\n<p>The goal with Website Traffic campaigns, on the other hand,\u00a0is to drive the highest qualified visitors\u00a0from your target audience to your website and at the highest quantity, compared to other Facebook campaign objective types. And not long ago, when while setting up a \u00a0Website Traffic campaign for a client, a new option under Destination in the ad level appeared: Phone number.<\/p>\n<p>Before, we could only select a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/08\/23\/cool-landing-pages\">landing page<\/a> URL or Facebook Event as the Destination for a Website Traffic campaign,\u00a0but now, we have this exciting third option for Phone Call\u2014in other words, click-to-call ads for Facebook Website Traffic campaigns. You can optimize for link clicks or landing page views just as with Reach campaigns, but at this time, you cannot optimize for calls.

With Website Traffic campaigns, you can optimize for a variety of ad delivery options\u2014typically link clicks or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/14\/facebook-lead-ads-vs-landing-pages\">landing page visits<\/a>\u2014but in this case, there currently is no option to optimize for click-to-calls.<\/p>\n<p>Feel free to select either, but keep in mind that we have seen more success in driving calls at a lower cost using \u201cLink Clicks\u201d. If you have additional budget, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/14\/facebook-split-testing\">test them<\/a> against one another to see which performs better for you. By definition, Link Clicks are delivered to people that are most likely to click your ads whereas Landing Page Views are delivered to people within your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/28\/facebook-ad-targeting\">target audience<\/a> that are most likely to click the ad, or load your website or Instant Experience.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7148e45c-8555-4923-beba-84dc19373ba3\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook20click20to20call20ads20Traffic20Ad20Delivery20Optimization.png\" alt=\"facebook click to call ads Traffic Ad Delivery Optimization\" width=\"612\" height=\"383\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Once your audience, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/08\/facebook-ad-placement-optimization\">placements<\/a>, and optimization settings are where you want them to be in the ad set level, head over to the ad level and select the \u201cPhone Call\u201d option under the Destination area.
