This media comes in many formats and placements and supports a range of creative, from images and video to immersive experiences.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also referred to as paid social. Whereas with paid search where you target keywords and terms, on social, you target audiences, interests, and behaviors. Social media ads are also generally more visual and branded, and quite native to the platform\u2014so much so that they can sometimes be hard to identify as ads.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/social-media-advertising-example-linkedin-promoted-post.png\" alt=\"social media advertising example - linkedin ad vs organic post\" width=\"720\" height=\"385\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-62830\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/social-media-advertising-example-linkedin-promoted-post.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/social-media-advertising-example-linkedin-promoted-post-480x257.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"incontent-red\">\ud83d\uded1 Running Facebook ads and want to know how they're <em>really<\/em> performing?

But check off these basic steps and you should have enough confidence to take the leap!<\/p>\n<h3>1. Understand your audience<\/h3>\n<p>As with any marketing strategy, you need to make sure you<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\"> have a firm grasp on your target audience<\/a>. Use your existing customer data, do some market research, and look at analytics from existing platforms to get a feel of what might work well. This will then help you to identify who to target, what to target them with, and when. Then, once you start running your ads and collecting data, you can get even more specific insights into who is seeing and engaging with your ads.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/identify-target-audience-questions.png\" alt=\"questions to identify your target audience\" width=\"720\" height=\"611\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-61989\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/identify-target-audience-questions.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/identify-target-audience-questions-480x407.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>2. Choose one channel to start<\/h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/22\/cross-channel-marketing\">cross-channel marketing strategy<\/a> is important, but you need to get the hang of the platforms before you start intertwining them. The best channel will depend on your audience, but more often than not, Facebook is a good first step.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Establish some <strong>general<\/strong> goals<\/h3>\n<p>What do you want to achieve with your social ads? No need to set the ol\u2019 SMART goals here\u2014 it\u2019s going to be hard to identify specific metrics until you actually start. But you can generally get an idea of which campaign objective you\u2019ll start with based on your primary goal (awareness, lead generation, conversions, for example).<\/p>\n<h3>4. Look at benchmarks<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/12\/facebook-ads-cost\">How much you'll pay for your social ads<\/a> will depend on your industry, audience, optimization strategy, and more, but it's always good to get a general point of reference before you begin so you can have some level of expectation set for budgeting.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/social-media-advertising-facebook-ads-benchmarks.png\" alt=\"social media advertising - facebook ads benchmarks\" width=\"522\" height=\"586\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-62821\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/social-media-advertising-facebook-ads-benchmarks.png 522w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/social-media-advertising-facebook-ads-benchmarks-480x539.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 522px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can find benchmark data here:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/11\/12\/facebook-ad-benchmarks\">Facebook advertising benchmarks<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/24\/healthcare-advertising-benchmarks-2021\"> Healthcare social advertising benchmarks<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/31\/real-estate-advertising-benchmarks\">Real estate social media advertising benchmarks<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/22\/advertising-benchmarks-home-services-2021\">Home services social media advertising benchmarks.\u00a0<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>4.

Social media advertising platforms also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/13\/learning-period\">take some time to learn<\/a> as well, so the sooner you start advertising, the sooner you can start collecting the data the platform needs to really start optimizing your ads.<\/p>\n<div id=\"social-media-advertising-tips\"><\/div>\n<h2>Social media advertising tips<\/h2>\n<p>What will work best for each platform varies, but these <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/social-media-marketing-tips\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">general tips<\/a> will help you to see success across platforms.<\/p>\n<h3>Lean on your organic data<\/h3>\n<p>Chances are (slash hopefully), if you\u2019re looking to advertise on social media, you already have an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/19\/social-media-for-small-business\">organic social strategy<\/a> going. If this is the case, lean on your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/social-media-audit\">organic performance<\/a> to inform your paid strategy. Over time, you'll have plenty of insights from your ad data, but until then, look at audience insights, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/10\/facebook-post-ideas\">top-performing posts<\/a>, low-performing posts, and engagement metrics to get a feel for the best segments of your audience to target as well as the best offers to promote.<\/p>\n<p>You can use native analytics within each platform or any <a href=\"https:\/\/whatagraph.com\/social-media-report-tool\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media reporting tool<\/a> to lean into these insights.<\/p>\n<h3>Use user-generated content<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to using your most engaging posts, you\u2019ll also want to take a look at top-performing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/13\/ugc-instagram\">user-generated content<\/a> as your ad creative. These make for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/03\/testimonial-advertising\">great testimonial ads<\/a> which combine relatability with reviews to make for reliable, ROI-worthy (and totally rad) ads.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/social-media-advertising-testimonial-ad-example.jpg\" alt=\"social media advertising - user generated content example\" width=\"313\" height=\"678\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-62832\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/social-media-advertising-testimonial-ad-example.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/social-media-advertising-testimonial-ad-example-139x300.jpg 139w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Keep mobile in mind<\/h3>\n<p>This one probably goes without saying, but it\u2019s still worth stressing: keep mobile in mind. Most social media platforms are accessed mainly on mobile (some are mobile-only). Of course, formatting your ads for mobile takes care of itself when you follow the image specs. But also, have a mobile mindset when you think about what offers you\u2019re promoting and when you\u2019re delivering your ads.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if your audience is young city-dwelling professionals, advertising a PDF guide on LinkedIn might not make sense during morning commute time when they're accessing the platform on their phone. It might make more sense to run the ad during a time in which they'll see it on their desktop.<\/p>\n<h3>A\/B test<\/h3>\n<p>You should always be trying out different versions of your ads to see what performs best.\u00a0 With A\/B testing, you'll change only one variable\u2014like the copy, or the image, or in the case below, the image style.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/social-media-advertising-a-b-testing.png\" alt=\"social media advertising - a\/b test example\" width=\"538\" height=\"395\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-62833\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/social-media-advertising-a-b-testing.png 538w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/social-media-advertising-a-b-testing-480x353.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 538px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>If there was an Airbnb for cats...<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Use multiple campaign types<\/h3>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, each paid social platform offers multiple objectives to choose from for your campaign\u2014not just because different businesses have different goals (app installs vs store visits, for example), but because within your funnel you'll also have different goals. You may want to generate leads with a top-of-funnel offer for one campaign, but retarget website visitors with something more<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/01\/bottom-funnel-conversions\"> bottom-funnel<\/a> in another.\u00a0 So create multiple campaigns and use the different objectives available to you to create a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/21\/facebook-funnel\"> full-funnel strategy<\/a>.
