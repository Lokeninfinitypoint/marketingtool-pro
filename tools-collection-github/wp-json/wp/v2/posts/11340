Multiple <em>and<\/em> recent reviews help earn you more trust from customers and also help your business to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/02\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps\">rank higher in search results<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Before you get started, make sure your business is listed accurately on sites like Google, Bing, and more with this <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/free-business-listings-grader\/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free business listings grader<\/a> from LocaliQ.<br \/>\n<a id=\"inperson\"><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>How to ask for a review in person<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-get-home-services-reviews\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Asking for a review<\/a> in person can be intimidating, but it is the most effective approach. If the opportunity presents itself, seize it!<\/p>\n<h3>Ask in response to praise<\/h3>\n<p>The easiest scenario would be that of a customer who approaches you with unsolicited praise. In this case, express your appreciation for their taking the time to provide the feedback, and then make the suggestion. For example:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Happy customer:<\/strong> <em>[singing your praises]<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>You:<\/strong> <em>That is so great to hear. We really try our best to [do what you\u2019re being praised for]. And thank you so much for taking the time to share your feedback.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Customer:<\/strong> <em>For sure, thank you for providing such great service!<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>You:<\/strong> <em>You know, if you could write what you just said in a review on [platform], that would be awesome. Those kinds of comments really help prospective customers to feel more confident in choosing us. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Customer:<\/strong> <em>Sure!<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>You:<\/strong> <em>Do you know how to do it?<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>Create opportunities with conversation<\/h3>\n<p>You don\u2019t have to wait for a customer to come to you to ask them for a review. More often than not you\u2019ll need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/02\/client-communication\">strike up a conversation<\/a> with them that will provide the opportunity. You can do so by asking questions about their experience with your store, services, or products upon checkout. Good questions include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Did you find everything you were looking for today?<\/li>\n<li>Is this your first time [using the product you\u2019re about to purchase]?<\/li>\n<li>How is that [product you\u2019re purchasing]? I\u2019ve tried [a similar product] but I have yet to try this one for myself.<\/li>\n<li>I hope you had a good experience with us&#8230;anything we could improve or that you liked?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Don\u2019t force it<\/h3>\n<p>Important: Don\u2019t ask for a review upon a customer\u2019s first positive remark about your business. This will render your conversation ingenuine and you will come off as not caring about their experience but rather just about getting the review. Reviews improve your reputation, but you won\u2019t get any (and your reputation will plummet) if you don\u2019t ask in the right manner.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, get a read on the customer. If their response is short and indicative that they don\u2019t feel like talking, don\u2019t force it. If they respond positively and offer more information or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/24\/customer-feedback\">feedback<\/a>, continue the conversation. As it comes to a close, ask them for the review. For example:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cWell hey, thanks for the feedback. We love sharing that kind of stuff with potential customers so they can feel more confident about choosing us. If you\u2019re comfortable with it, it\u2019d be awesome if you could share any of what you said to me in a [platform name] review.\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><a id=\"phone\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udce3 <strong>Want a lot of leads for free?<\/strong> Download <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/free-leads?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_howtogetfreeleads_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\">14 Fast &amp; Easy Ways to Get Free Leads (+Examples You Can Copy)<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How to ask clients for reviews over the phone<\/h2>\n<p>If you own or operate a business that is customer support-heavy, you and your employees can find plenty of opportunities to ask clients for reviews over the phone.

If you\u2019ve just helped a client through a long or difficult problem, it\u2019s probably not best to ask them for a review.<\/p>\n<p>However, if you have a self-proclaimed satisfied customer (ideally if they express gratitude for your help), this is a great time to ask for a review.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cI\u2019m glad we were able to help you today and we so appreciate your business.

This is because reviews are often packed with important <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/09\/easy-keyword-research-guide\">keywords<\/a> that can <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/13\/smb-seo-strategies-covid-19\">boost your SEO<\/a>, but Google won\u2019t pick up on these words if they\u2019re in image form.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc40 <strong>Looking for more ways to drive people to your site?<\/strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite25WaysIncreaseTraffic.html?cid=Web_Any_BlogInContent_PPC_25WaysIncreaseTraffic_Download\">25 Ways to Increase Traffic to Your Website<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a id=\"vendors\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How to ask for reviews from vendors<\/h2>\n<p>If you do a lot of<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/24\/b2b-audience-targeting\"> B2B work,<\/a> consider your vendors and partners for reviews.

This is against the terms and conditions of many <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/22\/yelp-reviews\">review platforms like Yelp <\/a>and Google, and can lead to a high volume of low-quality or star-only reviews (with no text). The purpose of reviews is not primarily to benefit the business but to empower <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/04\/nurture-marketing\">prospective customers <\/a>to make informed decisions.<\/p>\n<p>However, a pay-it-forward campaign like the one below would be perfectly suitable.

People (as mentioned above, 67% of people) are generally willing to leave reviews. People like being heard, and will be extra willing to lend their voice to a company they feel has met their expectations, as a way of returning the favor. Plus, you are empowering them to give other consumers just like them the confidence to make an informed decision<strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>Not responding to reviews<\/h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget to respond to reviews. First off, this is a way of acknowledging and expressing appreciation for the customer\u2019 taking the time to do so. Second, this can help you to build customer relationships and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/04\/client-retention-tips\">retain more of them<\/a>.

Just remember these key takeaways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reviews aren\u2019t selfish; they empower your customers to help other consumers make smart and confident decisions.<\/li>\n<li>Be genuine and don\u2019t force it.<\/li>\n<li>Keep email correspondence short and sweet.
