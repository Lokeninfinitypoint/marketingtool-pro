Our country is a melting pot of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/06\/new-adwords-demographics-targeting\">different demographics<\/a>, interests, and what we\u2019re <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/02\/search-trends-by-state\">searching for differs in each state<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Well, this all plays into how smart advertisers structure their campaigns and ultimately what they pay per click in each state. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/21\/how-much-does-adwords-cost\">How much PPC costs<\/a>, it turns out, depends on what state you live in.

I then took this list and ran it through the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/13\/new-keyword-planner-interface\">Google Keyword Planner<\/a> to get average CPC estimates for these keywords in each state &amp; the entire US to see how Google estimated their costs per clicks would differ in each state. With this list of estimated CPCs by state, I then indexed it and compared each state\u2019s estimated CPC against the estimated CPC of the whole US to complete this analysis.<\/p>\n<p>Having this data be as unbiased as possible was a priority for me. The decision to use estimates from the Google Keyword Planner data protects this research from any biases from individual clients who target different states or use <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/08\/05\/geotargeting-with-bid-modifiers\">geo bid modifiers.<\/a> The volume of keywords considered across different industries protects this analysis from a bias of a rogue keyword or industry with spiked regional interest.<\/p>\n<h2>Notable Trends in Average PPC Costs<\/h2>\n<p>There are some interesting trends in this regional CPC data.<\/p>\n<h3>Rural Regions Have Higher CPC<\/h3>\n<p>The top 5 states (Alabama, West Virginia, Maine, Alaska &amp; Louisiana) fill out a much more rural profile than the US average. With fewer nearby businesses, it\u2019s very likely that these states\u2019 residents more frequently turn to Google when they look for a service or product. Consequently, advertisers have more to gain from bidding aggressively in these markets.<\/p>\n<h3>The Biggest States Fall in the Middle<\/h3>\n<p>Of the 10 most populated states, not a single one made the top 10 or the bottom 10. For instance, the most populated state, California, sits nearly directly in the middle at #23 with a CPC similar to the US average. This is likely telling us that many advertisers targeting these regions are doing so in the same campaigns targeting the rest of the nation \u2013 driving their average CPCs closer to the national average.<\/p>\n<h3>Low Unemployment Rates Mean Low PPC Costs<\/h3>\n<p>I thought this was interesting: 9 of the 10 states with the lowest average CPCs also have unemployment rates below the national average \u2013 in most cases by a comfortable margin (Rhode Island was the sole exception here). Full employment is typically a sign of lots of local businesses in the area \u2013 so there\u2019s less need for local users to need to turn to Google to fulfill their needs and advertisers don\u2019t need to be as aggressive with their bids.<\/p>\n<p>Do you see any other interesting trends in the data? Are you seeing similar trends in your accounts or in your industry?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What&#8217;s the average PPC cost in your state?
