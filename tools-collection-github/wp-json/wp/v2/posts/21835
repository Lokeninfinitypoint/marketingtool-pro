Luckily, this isn\u2019t the case with social media. In the world of social media marketing things are constantly changing, which is what keeps all of our jobs interesting.<\/p>\n<p>Every week, social platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and Instagram are releasing new features and improving old ones, and naturally, our habits as marketers need to adjust to stay ahead of our competitors.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a96060f0-8c14-47ae-8e33-8d45d3434e4a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/social_media_marketing.jpg\" alt=\"Social Media Marketing Trends\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>As summer\u2019s winding down, it is time to start gaining a competitive edge before the holiday rush, which is why you need to pay attention to these three big social media marketing and advertising trends that are all the rage these days.<\/p>\n<h2>#1: Live Video Streaming<\/h2>\n<p>As video has taken over our social feeds, live streaming has popped up on the horizon as the hip new hip sidekick to regular video. Whether it be Facebook Live, Periscope, SnapChat, or Instagram, engaging with your audience in real-time through video is becoming essential to your social strategy. Video helps humanize your brand, but live video actually connects an individual to your brand in real-time, which is even more powerful than well-produced recorded content. The other benefit of live video is that the production quality isn\u2019t expected to be high, which eases the production process.<\/p>\n<p>Most recently we\u2019ve seen big brands use live video in a variety of ways, from Marc Jacobs using live video to give a sneak peak of their 2016 fashion line, The Tonight Show providing a behind-the-scenes look backstage before the show, and Madden video games providing behind-the-scenes coverage of players.<\/p>\n<p>But these are HUGE brands. How can you use live video? Live video can be used to build excitement about a new product release, show off your company culture, give live coverage of an event, or even host a live Q&amp;A with your super-fans. The possibilities are endless.<\/p>\n<p>Check out the post below for a live video we made at Wistia of the unboxing of the brand new Canon 5D MarkIV. This is a great use-case of live video as this new video camera is a pretty big deal for a huge chunk of our customers, so the live stream was especially interesting for our audience.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"3b666078-ee8e-450a-8735-d308e03561f4\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/social-media-instagram-1.png\" alt=\"Wistia Instagram\" width=\"494\" height=\"670\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Still not convinced?<strong> Live videos receive 10x more comments than pre-recorded videos<\/strong>, according to the VP of Facebook in Europe, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/06\/14\/facebook-video-live\/\">Nicola Mendelsohn<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>#2: Social SlideShow Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Ahh! More new and exciting forms of interactive visual content. What could be better!?<\/p>\n<p>Social slideshows are popping up in more and more social networks and for good reason! Social slideshows are easy to create and can utilize images, videos, or both. Advertisers can even pay to play for these babies leading to more, even more, exposure and interaction. So whether you\u2019re showing off your new winter ski apparel or displaying videos promoting your upcoming conference, slideshows are a great way to help your social audience interact with your brand in a memorable way.<\/p>\n<p>These ads also work! Take the sock company Stance for instance;comparing their static image ads to slideshow ads,<strong> they saw a decrease in cost per acquisition by 48%, a 2.42X increase in click-through-rate, and a 1.48 increase in return on ad spend<\/strong>. Pretty outstanding stuff! Facebook also just made some improvements to their slideshow ads, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/news\/slideshow-update\">outlined here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4e80aeb8-0cc2-4568-8ff0-e16ac3f97daf\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-slideshow.gif\" alt=\"Facebook Slideshow Ads\" width=\"676\" height=\"380\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>#3: Diversifying Landscape of Social Channels<\/h2>\n<p>With different forms of content and social interaction, we\u2019re also seeing more channels emerge as important places for marketers and advertisers to build a strong presence. Online social communities, run through platforms like Slack, are becoming a more and more important area for marketers to engage with their customers and prospects. Medium, Inbound.org, and Reddit are critical places to spread awareness of your content. Not to mention Snapchat and Instagram are taking over with sponsored stories and in-line ads. Long gone are the days of only having to maintain a Facebook and Twitter page.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ffde61b2-9ce7-4fc6-aa83-94f7d25da9d6\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/social-media-landscape.jpg\" alt=\"Social media landscape\" width=\"500\" height=\"297\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>\u201cNow, forms of interaction are starting to diversify. Platforms like Snapchat are allowing more one-sided conversations, in a more fleeting, temporary context. Brands and consumers are able to talk to each other in new, more diverse ways, and that range is only broadening,\u201d says Forbes contributor <a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/jaysondemers\/2016\/08\/01\/the-top-7-social-media-marketing-trends-dominating-2016\/2\/#5171c353ac8f\">Jayson DeMers<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>#4: Instagram Stories<\/h2>\n<p>Instagram recently stole a page from Snapchat\u2019s book by adding a story feature at the top of the feed. Now social browsers can see what their favorite Instagrammers are doing for 24 hours.<\/p>\n<p>So why copy Snapchat? Perhaps Facebook is still a bit bitter about Snapchat\u2019s declining to sell the app for $3 billion, but regardless the reaction to this new Instagram feature was mixed. Some were <a href=\"http:\/\/mashable.com\/2016\/08\/02\/instagram-copy-snapchat-reactions\/#qNUW9z.3AZqG\">outraged<\/a>, others pleased to have their snap stories moved to their favorite social network.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"281425f2-aaa0-4285-beb4-627d7ffa7799\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-copy-snapchat.png\" alt=\"Instagram and Snapchat\" width=\"482\" height=\"261\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Regardless, this has been a big opportunity for businesses to showcase their brands in a prime location on the app. Large brands like Starbucks, Taco Bell, and JCrew have already been taking advantage, as well as smaller brands like Justin\u2019s PB and HubSpot.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOver time we look forward to introducing new advertising and other business opportunities as part of Instagram Stories,\u201d says the <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.business.instagram.com\/\">Instagram Business Blog<\/a>. \u201cIn the meantime, we\u2019re excited to see all the ways our community will use it to highlight their businesses on Instagram.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>#5: Social Chat<\/h2>\n<p>Did you know that over 900 million people use Facebook Messenger? WhatsApp has become one of the largest chat apps in the world. Seventy-seven of the top 100 Fortune companies use Slack. Chat and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/27\/messaging-apps\">messaging apps<\/a> are no longer just used for internal communications, but it\u2019s being used more and more to engage with prospects in a more personalized manner.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"566a979d-7655-410b-b62e-1164fc2d48ca\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/messaging-apps-vs-social-networks.png\" alt=\"messaging apps versus social media\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1272\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>\u201cPeople are becoming more interested in actually communicating, rather than broadcasting,\u201d according to <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2016\/06\/what-marketers-need-to-know-about-chat-apps\">Harvard Business Review<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Marketers need to start utilizing chat apps to engage in real-time with their leads rather than posting and wishing for the best.
