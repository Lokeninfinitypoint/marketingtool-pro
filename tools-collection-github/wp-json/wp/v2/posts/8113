If you\u2019ve never had the pleasure of using it, this is a Yoast feature that\u2014with the help of a mysterious algorithm\u2014calculates the reading \u201cdifficulty\u201d of a piece of writing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">It then makes recommendations like decreasing sentence length, using a more active voice, and breaking up large chunks of text with subheadings. It\u2019s even audacious enough to put red or orange bullets next to posts it considers algorithmically sub-par, but let\u2019s not get into that.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1559f0d4-75c1-482b-914c-3c8eb3cc0786\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/seo-readability-yoast-seo_0-1.png\" alt=\"yoast seo reability score with suspicious emoji overlayed\" width=\"734\" height=\"524\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">Transition word problems: First, I\u2019m going to scatter transition words everywhere. <\/span><\/em><em><span lang=\"EN\">After that, I\u2019ll secure a green bullet. <\/span><\/em><em><span lang=\"EN\">In conclusion, I\u2019m going to throw my writing out the window.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Yoast\u2019s bottom line is that <a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/does-readability-rank\/\">readability ranks<\/a>. But the definition of readability continues to evolve with technology like NLP (Natural Language Processing). It&#8217;s taking on a more human form. In this post, I&#8217;m going to provide five ways to improve the human readability of your content which, in turn, will improve its algorithmic readability too.\u00a0They include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Lose the clickbait titles<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t keyword stuff (even if subtle)<\/li>\n<li>Quit the over-paragraphing<\/li>\n<li>Nix the bulking out of how-to posts for no reason<\/li>\n<li>Resist over-formatting<\/li>\n<li>Link with mercy<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Why HUMAN readability is important<\/h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">As mentioned above, readability ranks.

I have little patience for the Yoast plugin\u2019s decrees, writing tools like Grammarly, or anything that attempts to interfere with my thoughts when I\u2019m writing (sighs in predictive text).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">But Yoast touches on something significant here, and something that often gets lost in the chaotic box-checking process of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/01\/17\/seo-content-beginners-guide\">SEO writing<\/a>:\u00a0<strong>your reader is not the search engine itself, but a person expecting a sense of linguistic cohesion. <\/strong>And with Google&#8217;s NLP advancements,\u00a0you can (read: should)\u00a0actually consider the search engine a person, too\u2014to an extent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Focusing on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/11\/14\/how-to-rank-for-a-keyword\">ranking for keywords<\/a> is an effective tactic to drive traffic to your website\u2014but if you lose sight of the fact that you\u2019re writing for readers and not Google, you\u2019re doing it wrong. This is the kind of attitude that leads to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.currentaffairs.org\/2020\/12\/how-seo-is-gentrifying-the-internet\">articles like this one<\/a> decrying the way search results now seem to be catering to the interests of algorithms, not users themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">I\u2019m serious.

Lose the clickbait titles<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019re all pretty used to the internet by now. Maybe a dramatic blog post title like &#8220;[X number] of Content Marketing Mistakes That Will Blow Your Mind\u2019&#8221; would\u2019ve worked in 2010, but now we just roll our eyes and keep scrolling.<\/p>\n<p>The same goes for any highly exaggerated anticipation of the reader\u2019s reaction: If I see a headline that promises to be &#8220;ultimate,&#8221; &#8220;revealed,&#8221; or &#8220;revolutionary,&#8221; I skip right over it. (Ditto for titles that guarantee unimaginable success as a result of reading that post.)<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ab6858d2-894b-4f06-a4b9-2165b256fba1\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/seo-readability-clickbait-titles-1.jpg\" alt=\"seo readability man in chains shake off the shackles of ordinary headlines\" width=\"372\" height=\"558\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>\u2018Shake Off the Shackles of Ordinary Headlines TODAY!\u2019<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>A little showmanship is okay<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s fine to retain a little bit of showmanship in a title, but keep it down to earth. \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/09\/27\/content-marketing-mistakes\">What You&#8217;re Doing Wrong with Your Content Marketing: 5 Common Mistakes<\/a>,\u2019 as WordStream titles their own post on the subject, still addresses the reader directly, even daring to assume that they\u2019re making mistakes in the first place. But it doesn\u2019t obnoxiously patronize the reader by saying &#8220;5 Content Marketing Mistakes You\u2019ll NEVER Believe You\u2019re Making&#8221;. The difference, I think, is obvious.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Make sure you fulfill your promise<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My point is that you shouldn\u2019t create expectations you aren\u2019t going to meet. Be thoughtful about how you choose your headlines\u2014much like the process of <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.reedsy.com\/how-to-title-a-book\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">titling a book<\/a>, what you pick seriously affects the reception of a text. (So much so, in fact, that authors as prolific as Toni Morrison have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theparisreview.org\/blog\/2016\/05\/25\/title-fights\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">had their titles changed<\/a> by their publishers for commercial reasons.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Your instincts matter<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Others have looked extensively into what makes a good headline: Danny Goodwin previously shared his findings after <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/15\/headline-testing\">running A\/B tests on headlines for 31 days<\/a> in an insightful post I recommend. Just make sure you don\u2019t lose sight of the fact that, quantifiable metrics and headline analyzers aside, your instincts (informed by your uniquely human understanding of language) most likely still know better.<\/p>\n<p>Follow these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/06\/irresistible-blog-post-titles\">tips for writing great headlines<\/a> and you&#8217;ll be as good as gold.<\/p>\n<h3>2.

As soon as they start saying something, they suddenly get cut off at the windpipe, gaping at you wide-eyed and short-lived. I\u2019m not sure what the thinking behind this tendency is (if it\u2019s \u201cbetter readability,\u201d then I weep for the human race), but the good news is that it\u2019s an easy thing to fix.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\">There&#8217;s a time and a place<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Just aim to be more mindful of when you press \u2018enter\u2019\u2014and if, after a second glance, it seems there\u2019s no reason for you to change lines, just don\u2019t do it.
