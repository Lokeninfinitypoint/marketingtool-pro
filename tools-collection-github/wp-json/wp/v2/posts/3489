Try out some of these.<\/p>\n<h3>Write for your audience<\/h3>\n<p>The best pieces of content are the ones directed at your key audiences. Understand your customer: know their pain points, what gets them psyched, and what keeps them up at night. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/29\/great-content\">Killer content<\/a> addresses your audience\u2019s needs and concerns!<\/p>\n<h3>Add a visual element to ALL your content pieces<\/h3>\n<p>People get bored with text really fast! To keep visitors reading, it\u2019s essential to have images breaking up your text paragraphs. Don\u2019t overlook the importance of a visual element, even in blog posts that are predominantly text-based. You can see some examples of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/06\/09\/business-blog-mistakes\">highly visual business blogs here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Infographics<\/h3>\n<p>We know readers love visual content, and <a href=\"\/articles\">infographics<\/a> are a prime example of beloved, linkable visual assets.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-marketing-ideas-1.png\" alt=\"content marketing ideas\" width=\"531\" height=\"554\" \/><\/div>\n<p>While the idea of creating a top-notch infographic may sound daunting, it doesn\u2019t have to be hard.

There are plenty of infographic guides templates out there to get you started. Speaking of\u2026<\/p>\n<h3>Useful templates<\/h3>\n<p>Templates are another powerful form of visual assets that visitors find extremely helpful. Templates serve as a visual framework that can help users create custom pieces without completely starting from scratch. Take this <a href=\"\/effective-landing-pages\">landing page template<\/a> as an example \u2013 it explains the basic layout and fundamentals, letting users get a grasp on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/12\/great-landing-pages\">great landing page essentials<\/a> before making their own.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-ideas-for-small-business-1.png\" alt=\"marketing ideas for small businesses\" width=\"1042\" height=\"951\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Graphs &amp; charts<\/h3>\n<p>The infographic\u2019s less cool cousins, one-piece graphs and charts still have their place as formidable pieces of visual content. They may not be as impressive as infographics, but they require considerably less time and effort to create and are still shareable, so don\u2019t be afraid to use them generously. For visual learners, a graph will be much easier to interpret than a chunk of text and numbers. Make sure you appeal to all kinds of learners!<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-charts-1.png\" alt=\"marketing charts\" width=\"617\" height=\"603\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>That\u2019s why you find so many dragons at the animal shelter (image from <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/funny\/comments\/1mlhwc\/the_official_fun_vs_effort_graph_of_pets_xpost\/\"><em>Reddit<\/em><\/a><em>)<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Videos<\/h3>\n<p>Video is an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/07\/best-marketing-strategies\">incredible marketing strategy <\/a>when it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/29\/how-to-promote-a-product\">promoting a new product or service<\/a>, or drawing in and retaining the attention of users. The retention rate for visual information can reach 65% vs. 10% for text-based info. Plus, customers who view product videos are much more likely to convert than those that don\u2019t. Video content is a powerful tool, whether you\u2019re trying to demonstrate how your product works IRL or educating visitors.<\/p>\n<h3>Statistic lists<\/h3>\n<p>Are you hitting a content idea wall? For an easy content marketing fix, collect interesting statistics on a subject matter related to your biz and create a blog post about what you\u2019ve learned. Massive stat lists are easy to make and extremely sharable. Plus, some of the wilder stats may get your gears turning about other content ideas, such as\u2026<\/p>\n<h3>Future predictions<\/h3>\n<p>Play the soothsayer by predicting future trends in your industry \u2013 just make sure you have at least <em>some <\/em>data to back up your hypothesis.<\/p>\n<h3>Controversy<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/19\/contrarian-content-marketing\">Controversial content<\/a> always earns attention, but it\u2019s not for the faint of heart \u2013 playing with fire can get you burned! Rather than <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/19\/most-controversial-ads\">stirring up controversy yourself<\/a>, the safer road may be to answer or respond to larger industry controversy with your own interpretation.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/controversial-marketing-ideas-1.png\" alt=\"controversial marketing ideas\" width=\"438\" height=\"438\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Rumors travel fast<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Aggregate awesomeness from other sources<\/h3>\n<p>Another easy way to create killer content is to curate quality content from elsewhere. No, it\u2019s not <em>stealing<\/em> &#8230; at least, not if done properly.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s completely kosher to borrow content from other sources if you\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/02\/08\/seven-innovative-ads\">doing something new<\/a> with it. For example, take our guide to the best <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/07\/reddit-seo-amas\">SEO Reddit AMAs<\/a>. The content we quoted from was originally posted on various Reddit forum threads. We took what we deemed the \u201cbest\u201d portions of the Q&amp;As from different threads and put it all together to make a super SEO advice guide. This new post is much easier for users interested in SEO to read, rather than scouring through various Reddit threads. NOTE: Play it safe by always giving credit where it\u2019s due.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/28\/best-marketing-campaigns-examples\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Ask the experts<\/h3>\n<p>Another great content marketing idea is to interview industry thought leaders with set questions and share their responses in a blog post; for example, our interview with industry experts on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/25\/pagerank\">the future of PageRank<\/a>. This kind of content tends to do well, and it\u2019s always interesting to see where industry gurus agree and where they don\u2019t. One great thing about sharing expert opinions \u2013 chances are, the folks you write about will share your write-up with their own followers! (Pro tip \u2013 ask the opinions of groups with large Twitter followers!)<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/great-marketing-ideas-1.jpg\" alt=\"great marketing ideas\" width=\"640\" height=\"425\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A very impressive panel of experts<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Top 10s<\/h3>\n<p>People go nuts over top 10 lists \u2013 top 10 tools, top 10 blogs, you name it.<\/p>\n<h3>Lists<\/h3>\n<p>Piggy-backing on top 10s are lists in general. Starting your title with a number can make it stand out more in search listings (e.g. 3 Ways to Slice a Pineapple). Why do people love lists? Because they are super scannable and quick to read. This is probably why <a href=\"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2014\/06\/09\/15-crazy-facts-about-buzzfeed-that-will-totally-blow-your-mind\/\">over a third of Buzzfeed&#8217;s posts have a number in the title<\/a>.

Variety is the spice of life, yo.<\/p>\n<h3>Product comparison guide<\/h3>\n<p>Decisions, decisions \u2013 oh, the pitfalls of capitalism. It\u2019s tough being a consumer with so many products to choose from. Help out users with a marketing comparison guide, especially if you have a series of product offerings for different needs. If you\u2019re comparing your product with competitors, be objective and fair; maybe you\u2019re a better fit for small businesses, while a competitor is better for larger corporations.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/good-marketing-ideas-1.png\" alt=\"good marketing ideas\" width=\"855\" height=\"709\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Alternatively, write up a comparison guide for a product you don\u2019t offer, but which relates to your audience\u2019s business. For example, a video game reseller could write a product comparison guide for different video game controllers. This is helpful content that gets relevant users familiar with your brand; and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/14\/use-branding-to-improve-advertising\">strong brand makes for strong advertising.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Content is an open door<\/h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t just create awesome content and abandon it \u2013 feature your best stuff in other related blog posts as well.

Webinars are a great source of business leads.<\/p>\n<h3>Google related search<\/h3>\n<p>Checking out the Google related searches (found at the top and bottom of the SERP when you perform a search) for a keyword query is a great tool for generating content ideas. Just Google a term and see what related searches turn up. You may be surprised!<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/find-marketing-ideas-1.png\" alt=\"find marketing ideas\" width=\"374\" height=\"250\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Pop-up opt-in<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s a lot of debate around newsletter opt-in pop-ups. They\u2019re annoying, they\u2019re intrusive, but quite often, they also <em>work<\/em>! A\/B test one and see how it affects your newsletter subscriptions. If newsletter subscribers have proved to be valuable leads for your business, do what you must to obtain them.<\/p>\n<h3>Continue your lucky streak<\/h3>\n<p>Not sure what to write about? Go into your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/15\/google-analytics-tips\">analytics account<\/a> and take a peek at your most popular posts to see what subjects users get excited about, then write a variation or extension of one of your most popular posts.<\/p>\n<h3>eBooks<\/h3>\n<p>Another great marketing idea is to write a comprehensive ebook on a known pain point or popular industry topic, then <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/12\/great-landing-pages\">create a quality landing page<\/a> around the offer. Better yet, don\u2019t start from scratch; repurpose past blog posts and articles into a mega <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/18\/how-to-promote-a-book\">e-book<\/a> collection.<\/p>\n<h3>101 guides<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s always someone just starting out in the biz; beginner&#8217;s guides and Industry Knowledge 101 content pieces will always get linked to and shared around by newbs.<\/p>\n<h3>Even great content needs promotion<\/h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t just publish your content and expect it to promote itself; <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/26\/content-promotion\">share it<\/a> with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/21\/promotional-email-examples\">promotional email<\/a> or through your social media channels.<\/p>\n<h3>Post about industry hot topics<\/h3>\n<p>What\u2019s the buzz in your field? Post about topical news and trending topics related to your industry to get in on the burst of action and show that you\u2019re in the know.<\/p>\n<h3>Guest posts<\/h3>\n<p>While the SEO value of guest posts has been called into question, there\u2019s <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/01\/20\/guest-blogging\">nothing wrong with guest posting if done right<\/a>. Just focus on the value of getting your brand in front of a new audience, rather than the links.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/marketing-ideas-1.png\" alt=\"marketing ideas\" width=\"522\" height=\"408\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\">(Image from Flickr user <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/matsuyuki\/\">matsuyuki<\/a>)<\/p>\n<h3>White papers<\/h3>\n<p>Guides, ebooks, white papers \u2013 they\u2019re kind of all the same thing, but labeling your assets differently can help your message resonate with different audiences. Test your labels to see which works best with your prospects.<\/p>\n<h3>Quality content<\/h3>\n<p>This should go without saying, but only produce quality content that you can be proud of! <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/21\/panda-4\">Google hates thin content<\/a>, and users don&#8217;t like it either.<\/p>\n<h3>Show some skin<\/h3>\n<p>I mean metaphorical skin of course \u2013 show that you are not a robot. Don\u2019t be afraid to have some fun and show off your company\u2019s personality. Express yourself; and if that means <em>literally<\/em> showing some skin, well then, more power to you. You\u2019re human after all.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/excellent-marketing-ideas-1.jpg\" alt=\"excellent marketing ideas\" width=\"550\" height=\"400\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Online magazine<\/h3>\n<p>Producing your own virtual magazine is another epic form of content marketing. For a great example, check out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.darkrye.com\/\">Dark Rye<\/a>, a stylish online magazine produced by Whole Foods. For a quick and easy fix, make your own online newspaper with <a href=\"http:\/\/paper.li\/\">Paper.li.<\/a><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/creative-marketing-ideas-1.png\" alt=\"creative marketing ideas\" width=\"689\" height=\"358\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Podcasts<\/h3>\n<p>Podcasts are great because users can download them and then listen on the go! Possible podcast concepts include discussing hot industry news or interviewing experts, in your space.<\/p>\n<h3>Cover events<\/h3>\n<p>If you attend a conference (or even an online event), consider writing a post about what info you gathered from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/21\/facebook-ads-for-events\">event<\/a>, what you found valuable, etc. Chances are others will find it valuable too! Use the hashtag from the event in your promotional efforts.<\/p>\n<h3>Collaboration<\/h3>\n<p>Collaboration can extend your reach and build your reputation. Consider all the different partnerships you could build \u2013 partner with a charity? A related business? You can co-author a blog post or guide, co-host a webinar, etc.<strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>Memes<\/h3>\n<p>Memes are fun and familiar for internet-goers. Get a little cheeky with some fun memes \u2013 it\u2019s easy to make your own with sites like <a href=\"http:\/\/memegenerator.net\/\">meme generator<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/mega-marketing-ideas-1.jpg\" alt=\"super marketing ideas\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>#SummertimeSadness<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Social proof<\/h3>\n<p>Sometimes great content marketing ideas also serve as fantastic forms of social proof. Take this inventive content project by a haunted house called Nightmares Fear Factory. They take photos of victims\u2026er, I mean guests, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/nightmaresfearfactory\/with\/9844450103\/\">post them to their Flickr feed<\/a>. The photos are absolutely hysterical and prove that Nightmares Fear Factory is as scary as they claim to be! (Thanks for the heads up from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shopify.com\/blog\/10943153-5-genius-content-marketing-ideas-you-can-steal-today\">Shopify<\/a>).<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/unusual-marketing-ideas-1.png\" alt=\"unusual marketing ideas\" width=\"518\" height=\"282\" \/><\/div>\n<div>You can also share social proof in the form of reviews. Make sure your review sites and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/listings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">listings<\/a> are good to go with this <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/free-business-listings-grader\/?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free business listings grader<\/a>.<\/div>\n<h3>Divvy up your content<\/h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t go content-overboard or you\u2019ll end up overwhelming users. We live in a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/23\/attention-economy\">competitive attention economy<\/a>, and if you\u2019re creating new stuff every single day, people may tire of you, even if everything you share is excellent. Them\u2019s the breaks, kid. Figure out what pace works for your audience.<\/p>\n<h3>Conduct a content audit<\/h3>\n<p>Is your existing content up to snuff? What is driving conversions? What isn\u2019t \u2013 and why? Asking these questions might make you sweat, but you\u2019ll be better off knowing the truth. Finding the answers to these questions will ensure that your marketing strategy moves forward in the right direction. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/10\/content-audit\">Learn how to do a content audit here.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Branded tools<\/h3>\n<p>These are a great way <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-market-your-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">to market your business<\/a> Create awesome, valuable tools that your audience will find useful. You can use parts of the tool to push towards your product offering, but make sure the tool itself is high-caliber \u2013 don\u2019t just make it a glorified sales pitch. Providing free tools will make users think fondly of you and extend your brand as more people share your awesome free tool!<\/p>\n<h3>Mobile!<\/h3>\n<p>With <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/research-studies\/mobile-in-store.html\">79% of internet users<\/a> conducting online shopping via \u00a0mobile devices, you should be embarrassed if you&#8217;re not mobile-friendly. This is not optional, although many still treat it like it is.<\/p>\n<h3>Gamification<\/h3>\n<p>Gamification is a great marketing idea to get users excited about engaging with you. As on <em>Whose Line is it Anyway<\/em>, the points are meaningless, but you\u2019d be surprised how much people really enjoy getting points. We all love instant affirmation \u2013 it\u2019s like virtual crack!<\/p>\n<p>Apps like Belly and Foursquare combine gamification with customer loyalty programs. Starbucks also has its own tame version of gamified loyalty programs in which you earn stars for Starbucks purchases. Consider if gamification could work for your biz.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/loyalty-programs-marketing-1.png\" alt=\"loyalty programs\" width=\"972\" height=\"1661\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Get by with some content help from your friends<\/h3>\n<p>There are a ton of great tools out there to help you find quality content (<a href=\"https:\/\/storify.com\/\">Storify<\/a> &amp; <a href=\"https:\/\/bufferapp.com\/\">Buffer<\/a> to name a few). Remember, you don\u2019t want to just share your own content \u2013 sharing great pieces by others in your industry shows that you\u2019re a team player and valuable source of unbiased knowledge.<\/p>\n<h3>Comics<\/h3>\n<p>While newspaper funnies are a dying breed, online comics are alive and thriving! Consider making your own internet comics that relate to the absurd and surreal aspects of your industry. Try free tools like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pixton.com\/\">Pixton<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/stripgenerator.com\/strip\/create\/\">Strip Generator<\/a> to get started.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/unique-marketing-ideas-1.png\" alt=\"unique marketing ideas\" width=\"639\" height=\"322\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Copy the masters<\/h3>\n<p>Watch to see who is creating great content, and follow their lead. Take a close look at <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/15\/clickbait\">clickbait<\/a> sites like Upworthy and Buzzfeed that get a ton of shares; while their audience and content subjects will be different from yours, they serve as an excellent study in how to improve your marketing strategy. What are they doing right? Can you implement something similar?<\/p>\n<h3>Take your time with titles<\/h3>\n<p>While we\u2019re on the subject, Upworthy is famous for their killer, clickable headlines. Even a superb blog post won\u2019t get the attention it deserves without a good title. Should it be clever? Eye-catching? SEO-friendly? Think about what will appeal to your audience. It\u2019s recommended you write as many as 5-10 titles for every article, then choose the best!<\/p>\n<h3>4-1-1<\/h3>\n<p>The 4-1-1 concept comes from Andrew Davis, author of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandscapingbook.com\/\">Brandscaping<\/a>. Davis\u2019 social media sharing strategy dictates that for every six pieces of content shared on social media:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>4 should be content from other industry influencers that is relevant to your audience<\/li>\n<li>1 should be your own original, educational content<\/li>\n<li>1 should have a sales aspect (coupon, product news, press release), aka, a piece of content most people will simply ignore.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The philosophy behind the 4-1-1 concept is that when you share industry thought leadership, you\u2019re building relationships within the industry and demonstrating a certain level of selflessness which earns serious reputation points that come in handy in the long haul.<\/p>\n<h3>Seasonal marketing<\/h3>\n<p>While National Fruitcake Toss Day isn&#8217;t exactly exciting, there are plenty of observances and themes for every month of the year that can help you come up with creative and authentic blog articles, social media posts, email campaigns, and more.
