For now, prospects will only see your customers\u2019 photos when browsing on mobile. In the coming months, however, Google plans to expand user-generated images to more countries and more device types.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c5162014-a294-463e-9332-dac2f653a27a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-shopping-user-generated-images.jpg\" alt=\"Google Shopping review with user-generated image\" width=\"800\" height=\"375\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>An example of a user-generated image in a Shopping review.

Then, to make sure you\u2019re fully prepared to capitalize on this update, we\u2019ll share three basic tips for accumulating more Shopping reviews going forward. Finally, we\u2019ll wrap up with some insights from WordStream\u2019s ecommerce marketing experts: Kelly McGee, Holly Niemiec, and Sam Drane.<\/p>\n<h2>Show off user-generated images in your Google Shopping reviews<\/h2>\n<p>A key advantage that brick-and-mortar retailers hold over online retailers is that a shopper browsing a physical store has the ability to touch and try on different products. This, in turn, allows the shopper to easily visualize what post-purchase life would be like. When a recent college graduate tries on an outfit and clearly sees the confidence boost it will give her to thrive at her upcoming interviews, that\u2019s a powerful moment\u2014probably powerful enough to convince her to make the purchase.<\/p>\n<p>By allowing you to include user-generated images\u2014photos taken by your customers\u2014alongside your Shopping reviews, Google is essentially giving you the tools to enjoy that advantage long held by your brick-and-mortar competitors. With customer photos, you can give Shopping users windows to the future\u2014snapshots of what it\u2019s like to use or wear your one-of-a-kind products.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"05e3a635-19c5-4aa0-85b9-c7a4000be433\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-shopping-review-user-generated-image-example.jpg\" alt=\"Google Shopping review with image example\" width=\"603\" height=\"619\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Another example of a user-generated image in a Shopping review.

(Note that you must have a minimum of 50 customer reviews that meet Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/merchants\/answer\/6098512?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=7307120\">quality requirements<\/a>.) Now that your reviews feed is up and running, you can use the brand new <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/product-review-feeds\/schema\/#reviewer_images\">&lt;reviewer_images&gt;<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/product-review-feeds\/schema\/#reviewer_images\"> schema<\/a> to include the photos your customers have taken of your products in action.<\/p>\n<h2>3 best practices for accumulating Google Shopping reviews<\/h2>\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve established the power of boosting your Shopping reviews with user-generated images, there\u2019s a big, important question we have to answer: How do you get your customers to review your products in the first place?<\/p>\n<p>Here are three best practices for accumulating customer reviews.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Just ask<\/h3>\n<p>As Wayne Gretsky (or Michael Scott, depending on who you ask) once famously said, you miss 100% of the shots you don\u2019t take. Gretsky\u2019s point, of course, was that you can\u2019t score in hockey if you don\u2019t put the puck on net.<\/p>\n<p>In the same vein, you can\u2019t accumulate reviews and add them to Google Shopping if you don\u2019t ask your customers to submit them. So, I recommend that you use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/29\/email-marketing-statistics\">email marketing<\/a> automation to contact everyone who buys something from your store soon after they do so.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1454356e-41f4-4dd1-a407-ed1f359011a2\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-shopping-review-user-generated-image-ask-for-reviews.jpg\" alt=\"example of asking for reviews\" width=\"583\" height=\"556\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>How soon, exactly, depends on what you sell. It stands to reason that you should give your new customers a chance to use or wear your product before asking them to review it. If you sell something people tend to use immediately, like a water bottle, it\u2019s probably safe to email those customers a few days after their orders are delivered. Alternatively, if you sell something that people might procrastinate using, like a high-end blender, you may want to give those customers a little extra time.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Add some extra (and personalized) incentive<\/h3>\n<p>You should never buy <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/18\/google-shopping-reviews\">customer reviews<\/a>. It\u2019s both forbidden and unethical\u2014an all-around bad idea. Under no circumstances would we recommend it to our beloved readers.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, there\u2019s nothing wrong with giving prospective reviewers a little extra incentive. It\u2019s a bit counterintuitive, but it\u2019s completely fair to encourage your customers to review your product with a small financial incentive\u2014a promo code for a related product, a credit for your online store in general, etc.\u2014without paying them outright.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"8bcd968e-09d4-4adb-8d63-977b7f8142df\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-shopping-review-user-generated-image-incentivize-reviews.jpg\" alt=\"incentivizing reviews example\" width=\"726\" height=\"675\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>The key is that whatever incentive you\u2019re offering is redeemable no matter how positive or negative a given customer\u2019s review is. As long as you\u2019re not emailing customers to say \u201cWe\u2019ll give you $100 in exchange for a 5-star review,\u201d you\u2019re in the clear.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Note: <\/strong>Offering a promo code for a related product is an especially\u00a0smart tactic because it allows you to personalize your messaging and make your customers feel extra special.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Make it extremely easy to submit a review<\/h3>\n<p>If you think about it, successfully convincing a recent customer to submit a review of your product is just like driving any other conversion. There\u2019s an action you want people to complete, and you\u2019re trying to find ways to incentivize them to do so.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a marketing axiom you\u2019ll often hear mentioned within conversations about conversion rate optimization: The easier it is to convert, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/29\/contextual-display-advertising\">the more conversions you\u2019ll drive<\/a>. Following that logic, it\u2019s wise to make the process of submitting a review as easy and as fast as possible. Very few people are willing to spend more than a couple minutes writing a review.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"83d15821-4ce6-48fe-a088-65265ba2e476\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-shopping-review-image.jpg\" alt=\"Shopping review image\" width=\"787\" height=\"322\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>You don\u2019t want to ask for any pieces of information that aren\u2019t absolutely essential. You already know your customers\u2019 names and purchase histories, so there\u2019s no reason to ask them to rehash those things. If you can get away with asking for nothing more than a brief review and a high-quality photo, do that.<\/p>\n<h2>Insights from WordStream\u2019s ecommerce experts<\/h2>\n<p>To get a better understanding of Google\u2019s intentions with user-generated images in Shopping reviews, I got in touch with Kelly McGee, Holly Niemiec, and Sam Drane\u2014veteran account managers on our in-house agency team and the top <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/29\/ecommerce-marketing\">ecommerce marketing<\/a> experts in the office.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI think this is Google working to compete with Amazon and make the Shopping marketplace the one-stop shop for online consumers,\u201d Kelly told me. \u201cUser-generated images help shoppers get a better idea of what they can expect from a product and convince them to make purchases.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>No arguments here. Over the course of this year, we\u2019ve written quite a bit about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/06\/11\/google-vs-amazon\">the intensifying ecommerce rivalry between Google and Amazon<\/a>. In addition to Google\u2019s recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/johanmoreno\/2019\/07\/21\/googles-new-shopping-platform-is-now-live\/#764329a3116a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reimagination<\/a> of the Shopping platform, ecommerce-friendly updates to YouTube, Discover, and Images demonstrate that the company has every intention of becoming the hub of online retail.<\/p>\n<p>According to Holly, however, Amazon isn\u2019t the only ecommerce platform Google is emulating with these updates to Shopping. From her perspective, giving users the ability to browse user-generated images brings <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/04\/pinterest-ads\">Pinterest<\/a> to mind:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe addition of user-generated images makes the Shopping marketplace feel less like a collection of ads and more like a curated platform for consumers to shop around and explore new products.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Sam agreed, and she pointed out that Google\u2019s attempt to replicate the Pinterest experience isn\u2019t simply about adding a flashy new feature:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cUser-generated images offer a sense of reliability in the product. By allowing real users to share their own images, brands are able to build trust through transparency.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>But\u00a0what does all this mean for <strong>you <\/strong>as an ecommerce marketer? According to Kelly, good things lay ahead:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe addition of user-generated images to Shopping reviews should drive a slight lift in conversion rates as consumers feel more confident about their purchases.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Incentivizing your customers to submit images with their product reviews will likely require some extra creativity and brainstorming on your end. That being said, if the end result is an increase in revenue, that additional effort will all be worth it, right<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google recently announced that you can now include user-generated images in Google Shopping reviews.
