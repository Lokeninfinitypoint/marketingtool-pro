Get a modern, attractive site<\/h3>\n<p>Consumers have high expectations these days\u2014to the point where if you don\u2019t have a good website, you\u2019re almost better off not having one at all. In fact,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kinesisinc.com\/the-truth-about-web-design\/#:~:text=According%20to%20web%20credibility%20research,based%20on%20their%20website's%20design.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">75%<\/a>\u00a0of consumers have admitted to judging a company\u2019s credibility based on their website design.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-36656 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/increase-online-presence-modern-website-before-after-makeover.png\" alt=\"improve online presence: before after website makeover\" width=\"800\" height=\"302\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/increase-online-presence-modern-website-before-after-makeover.png 800w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/increase-online-presence-modern-website-before-after-makeover-480x181.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/napkinmarketing.com\/before-and-after-website-redesign\/\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>And truth be told, I would highly suggest hiring an expert to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/12\/31\/basic-website\">set up your site<\/a>. DIY builders are awesome in theory, but in my own experience, people end up spending hours on them and experiencing endless glitches\u2014oftentimes to the point of eventually spending more to hire someone. Having a lead-generating website that looks and functions exactly the way you want it to without losing hours of your time or hairs on your head is, to me, worth every penny.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, you can save money in other ways, such as through free website hosting services (check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/products\/cms\/web-hosting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HubSpot&#8217;s<\/a>, for example).<\/p>\n<h3>2.

Think audience, not followers<\/h3>\n<p>Your online presence doesn\u2019t improve with more followers. Rather, your following improves with a stronger presence.

Post with emotion for shareability<\/h3>\n<p>Quality posts that get engagement are important if you want social algorithms to display your posts in users\u2019 feeds. But quality isn\u2019t really enough. You want your followers to feel something when they consume your content\u2014so much so, that they feel compelled to share it with others. Use\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/01\/13\/best-words-and-phrases-for-marketing\">emotional words and phrases<\/a>\u00a0in your captions. Add emojis. Use compelling stats and evocative images.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-36650\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/increase-online-presence-shareability-emotion.png\" alt=\"improve online presence: emotional ads\" width=\"500\" height=\"419\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/increase-online-presence-shareability-emotion.png 500w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/increase-online-presence-shareability-emotion-480x402.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nAnd speaking of shareability, pay attention to small nuances in your captions to see if you can find any patterns. We recently found that leading off with a key stat in the caption resulted in more shares. Another approach is to create link-free posts that followers can consume quickly. They don\u2019t always want to read a long post or go to a link, and they\u2019re more likely to share something that isn\u2019t a big ask for their followers either.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Perform social media SEO<\/h3>\n<p>Facebook receives over\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/07\/27\/facebook-will-make-you-talk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2 billion\u00a0<\/a>searches per day. And in 2020, Instagram announced that it now supports general keyword searches (as opposed to just accounts, hashtags, and people). So just like with your website, you should include\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/popular-keywords\/business-keywords\">popular keywords<\/a>\u00a0in your profiles and posts. You can use many of the same keywords as you do with your site, but perhaps with a bias toward idea-oriented and lighter-hearted queries. Social media platforms are more of the browsing and inspirational types. But it all depends on your business. The first result\u00a0for the query &#8220;how to clean a sink&#8221; on Facebook is a video with almost a million views.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-36651\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/increase-online-presence-facebook-seo.png\" alt=\"improve online presence: video results in facebook\" width=\"800\" height=\"469\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/increase-online-presence-facebook-seo.png 800w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/increase-online-presence-facebook-seo-480x281.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nYou should also still be using\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/29\/instagram-hashtags\">hashtags<\/a>\u00a0in your posts to improve your social media presence, but treat them as you would keywords. Use broad hashtags sparingly and focus more on location-based and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/28\/niche-marketing\">niche<\/a>\u00a0terms so that you can increase your visibility to the right audience.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Be active (duh)<\/h3>\n<p>You&#8217;ve heard this a million times, and now, for the million-and-oneth time: If you\u2019re going to make social media a part of your online presence, you need to have an active account. So that means publishing quality posts regularly, responding to likes and comments on those posts, liking and commenting on your followers\u2019 posts, answering direct messages, sharing content from other sources, and more.\u00a0And it means doing this consistently. This is the difference between a profile and a presence.<\/p>\n<p>If being able to have this type of engagement means only having one profile, then so be it. Better to have one vibrant profile than to have three that are subpar. And precisely why it\u2019s important to only take on the number of profiles you can manage.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, if you want to find and connect with\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/23\/how-to-become-a-social-media-influencer\">influencers<\/a>, you need to be active in your niche so you can identify who is realistic to reach out to and gradually build your relationship with them.<\/p>\n<h2>How to improve your online presence with listings<\/h2>\n<p>With thousands of online directories out there, creating listings for your business can help you show up in more places online. In addition, links to your site from popular directories serve as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/04\/12\/local-citations\">local citations for your business<\/a>, which Google takes into consideration when ranking your site. Finally, curated \u201cTop 10\u201d lists from popular directories can dominate the SERP, so if you\u2019re ranking in their top 10, you can achieve that much more exposure.<\/p>\n<p>But reaping these benefits takes more than just throwing your NAP out there and then kicking back.

Populate every field, meticulously<\/h3>\n<p>Like social media feeds and search engine results pages, listing results\u00a0are determined by an algorithm. This means that the quality of your listing matters. Make sure that for each listing, you populate every section available, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Business name<span lang=\"EN\">\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/08\/business-name-ideas\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/08\/business-name-ideas\">(creative business name ideas here!)<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Contact information<\/li>\n<li>Website<\/li>\n<li>Category<\/li>\n<li>Hours<\/li>\n<li>Description<\/li>\n<li>Photos<\/li>\n<li>Menus\/offerings<\/li>\n<li>Booking\/reservation options<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-36646\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/improve-complete-google-business-listing-improves-online-presence.png\" alt=\"increase online presence: complete google business listing\" width=\"795\" height=\"487\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/improve-complete-google-business-listing-improves-online-presence.png 795w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/improve-complete-google-business-listing-improves-online-presence-480x294.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 795px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nAs much as possible, make sure the information you provide is identical across listing sites. We\u2019re talking St\u00a0vs street,\u00a0[Business name] vs [Business name], LLC, and other tiny details.\u00a0This is because\u00a0Google looks at consistency of information about you across the web when determining your credibility and ranking; and also because\u00a0auto-populated listings risk inaccuracies, so you\u00a0can keep deviations to a minimum with identical listings to begin with.<\/p>\n<h3>11. Have a proactive review strategy<\/h3>\n<p>Reviews have perhaps the most powerful influence over how high you show up in directory results. Not to mention the fact that they are one of the top\u00a0ranking factors for Google local search. Simply providing review-worthy service will not do it. You need to have a proactive strategy in place to keep a steady stream of reviews coming in. Here are some ways to obtain and ask for reviews:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">How to Ask for Reviews (With Examples!)<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/16\/get-more-google-reviews\">16 Tried and True Ways to Get More Google Reviews<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>12. Maintain and monitor your listings<\/h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\" xml:lang=\"EN\">With the thousands of directories across the web that pull information from one another, your listings can develop inconsistencies or inaccuracies over time. And\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.chatmeter.com\/blog\/why-local-listings-management-is-a-must\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">80%<\/a>\u00a0of consumers lose trust in local businesses if they see incorrect or inconsistent information.\u00a0<span lang=\"EN\" xml:lang=\"EN\">You don&#8217;t have control over all of these profiles, but take the time to keep the ones you\u00a0do have control over\u00a0updated and consistent. Another option is to use a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/lead-generation\/premium-listings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">listing service provider<\/a>\u00a0who can stay on top of everything for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Monitoring your reviews on these directories is also crucial, for obvious reasons.<\/p>\n<h2>How to improve your online presence with advertising<\/h2>\n<p>Paid advertising is a fast way to show up prominently on search engines, social media feeds, and websites your ideal customers frequent. With SEO, you can really only target your audience with keywords, but with PPC, you can layer audiences onto your targeting based on a number of criteria. Here are some of many the different ad options you can use to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/online-presence\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">increase your online presence.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>13. Search ads<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth investing in paid search ads because not only do they land you at the top of the SERP, but they also reach your target customers when they have the highest intent. And if you can get your site to rank in both organic and paid results for a keyword, the chances of getting a click on one or the other are higher.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-36645\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/improve-online-presence-paid-organic-result.png\" alt=\"increase online presence: organic and paid presence\" width=\"702\" height=\"930\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/improve-online-presence-paid-organic-result.png 702w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/improve-online-presence-paid-organic-result-480x636.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 702px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nAnd although Google is the most popular search engine, there are still many <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/25\/bings-ads-vs-google-adwords\">advantages of advertising on Bing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>14. Social ads<\/h3>\n<p>Social media ads can be used to improve your online presence because ads have\u00a0higher reach and engagement rates than organic posts.
