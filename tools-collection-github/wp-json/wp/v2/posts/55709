Let&#8217;s dive in.<\/p>\n<h2><span>What is phonosemantics?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Phonosemantics (<em>aka<\/em> phonoaesthesia, <em>aka<\/em> sound symbolism) is a portmanteau word defining the theory that <em>meanings<\/em> come from <em>sounds<\/em>. Each sound, or phoneme, carries a specific psychological impression. Whereas onomatopoeias are a category of words that define themselves in the way they are pronounced, phonosemantics says that any word can make an <em>impression<\/em> based on the way it&#8217;s pronounced. It&#8217;s a form of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/01\/psychology-copywriting-tips-examples\">copywriting psychology<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Which explains why you guessed Grataka as the land of mean-spirited hunters:<\/p>\n<p>Hard <strong>\/g\/<\/strong> and <strong>\/k\/<\/strong>, together with abrupt rhythm and short vowels, make this word sound rude. And the citizens of Lamoniana seem good fellows because of soft <strong>\/l\/<\/strong>, <strong>\/m\/<\/strong>, <strong>\/n\/<\/strong>, long vowels, and polysyllabic rhythm in their land&#8217;s name.<\/p>\n<h3>Phonosemantic associations<\/h3>\n<p>To illustrate phonosemantics, here are some <span><a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10936-020-09701-y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">phonemes and the associations they trigger:<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>\/r\/<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>\u2013 movement and activity<\/li>\n<li><strong>\/p\/<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>\u2013 precision and patience<\/li>\n<li><strong>\/mp\/, \/str\/<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>\u2013 force, efforts<\/li>\n<li><strong>\/o\/<\/strong>,<span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>\/u\/<\/strong>,<span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>\/e\/<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>\u2013 powerful, strong, authoritative<\/li>\n<li><strong>\/b\/<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>\u2013 round, big, and loud<\/li>\n<li><strong>\/i\/<\/strong>,<span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>\/ee\/<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>\u2013 small size, tenderness<\/li>\n<li><strong>\/gl\/<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>\u2013 shining, smooth, brightness<\/li>\n<li><strong>\/l\/<\/strong>,<span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>\/n\/<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>\u2013 soft, gentle<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Phonosemantics is not new.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sacred texts of <strong>Hindu philosophy<\/strong> (The Upanishads) describe mute consonants (b, c, d, f, g, p, t) as those representing the earth, fire, and eyes; sibilants (\/s\/) as representing the sky, air, and ear; and vowels representing heaven, the sun, and the mind.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Plato<\/strong> believed people could choose names for things depending on their features and the features of the sounds. In his book <em>Cratylus<\/em>, he suggested the letter and sound <strong>\/r\/<\/strong> for the expression of motion and activity.<\/li>\n<li>Russian scientist and poet <strong>Lomonosov <\/strong>suggested writers use the repetition of <strong>\/i\/<\/strong>, <strong>\/e\/<\/strong>, and <strong>\/yu\/<\/strong> for creating the effect of something tender, pleasant, and soft, while repeated <strong>\/o\/<\/strong>, <strong>\/u\/<\/strong>, and <strong>\/y\/<\/strong> would work to depict something terrifying, dark and cold.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span>Sound symbolism &amp; the bouba-kiki effect<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The mechanism of sound symbolism is yet unknown, but one suggestion is that it lies in verbal gesture\u2014the way we use lips and tongue to pronounce the word. This concept, <span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/intl\/blog\/talking-apes\/201505\/do-sounds-have-shapes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the bouba-kiki effect<\/a>, was first introduced with an experiment in 1929 and has been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencefriday.com\/educational-resources\/media-guide-the-bouba-kiki-effect\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">confirmed by more recent studies<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In the experiment, participants were shown the below two shapes and asked which one is bouba and which one is kiki.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/copywriting-strategy-phonosemantics-bouba-kiki.jpeg\" alt=\"the bouba kiki effect experiment\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-55714\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/copywriting-strategy-phonosemantics-bouba-kiki.jpeg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/copywriting-strategy-phonosemantics-bouba-kiki-480x270.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Ninety-five percent of people call the spiky one kiki and the rounded one bouba because those visual shapes align with what our lips do to say these words.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most prominent researchers in sound symbolism, Margaret Magnus, nails it in her book <em>Gods in the Word<\/em>. She explains that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Many words beginning with <strong>\/b\/<\/strong> relate to so-called &#8220;barriers, bulges, and bursting&#8221; headings because our lips come together and form a barrier to the airflow when creating the <strong>\/b\/<\/strong> sound. It results in a bulge and a burst of sound.<\/li>\n<li>When pronouncing &#8220;kiki,&#8221; on the other hand, our lips narrow and our tongue makes a kind of sharp movement, therefore increasing Kiki&#8217;s chances to appear spiky.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Another idea around why this happens involves the connections between sensory and motor areas of the human brain. When hearing a sound, the brain doesn&#8217;t leap to a concept but associates it with a shape, a color, or an emotion\u2014and responds accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>Phonosemantics is an argument of little substance for most linguists denying such a relationship between sounds and meanings. And yet, conventional linguistic theories don&#8217;t have any alternative explanations for the bouba-kiki effect.<\/p>\n<h2>6 phonosemantic copywriting techniques to influence your readers<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to copywriting (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/03\/copywriting-examples\">impressive copywriting examples here<\/a>), it may seem super challenging to choose particular phonemes and combine them accordingly to influence readers&#8217; perceptions and emotions.<\/p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s not so.<\/p>\n<p>Sound symbolism is not as hard as it sounds and may come in handy when coming up with<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/08\/business-name-ideas\"> business names<\/a>, advertising <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/21\/advertising-slogans\">slogans<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/02\/ppc-ad-headlines\">headlines<\/a> for your content assets like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-write-an-ebook\">ebooks<\/a>.

Use repetition &amp; alliteration<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Repetition and alliteration are two great techniques to practice here and make your written words memorable and more powerful.<\/p>\n<p>It stands to reason that you won&#8217;t focus on just these sounds when crafting your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/03\/ad-copy-examples\">ad copy<\/a>, emails, or other marketing assets.

Insert sensory words<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Phonosemantics refers also to choosing <strong>sensory words<\/strong> for your content.<\/p>\n<p>These are words, mainly verbs and adjectives, that help readers see, hear, taste, and feel your content.
