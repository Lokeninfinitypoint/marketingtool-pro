That\u2019s higher than any other channel\u2014but it\u2019s not a guarantee. To achieve this goal and beyond, you need a clean, high-value email list. Here are nine email cleaning tips to help you secure a higher ROI.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Remove your hard-bounce emails<\/h3>\n<p>A hard bounce is an email that fails to reach the sender due to a permanent issue. This could be that the recipient\u2019s email address is invalid or the domain has blocked email delivery.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike a soft bounce (which is when the email is temporarily undeliverable) there\u2019s no way of resolving hard bounce emails.<\/p>\n<p>If spam filters and email servers think your hard bounce rates are too high, they\u2019ll flag you as potential spam and block your IP address, harming your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/email-sender-reputation\">sender reputation<\/a> and email deliverability. Always check your list for hard-bounce emails and delete them ASAP.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/hard-bounce-and-soft-bounce-email.png\" alt=\"hard vs soft bounce email\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68100 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/hard-bounce-and-soft-bounce-email.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/hard-bounce-and-soft-bounce-email-480x270.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.limeleads.com\/blog\/hard-bounce-vs-soft-bounce\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>2. Delete duplicate emails<\/h3>\n<p>You may find\u2014particularly if you import contacts\u2014that some users are subscribed to your list multiple times. This is a big no-no, as these recipients will receive multiple copies of the same email.<\/p>\n<p>Aside from sabotaging the accuracy of your campaign\u2019s performance metrics, duplicate emails are often thrown straight into the spam folder. Their obtrusiveness can even lead users to unsubscribe completely.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Determine your inactive subscribers<\/h3>\n<p>Your email provider should be able to show you metrics for individual subscribers, such as their email open, click-through, and conversion rates. You can use this information to determine your inactive subscribers and target them with re-engagement campaigns (more on that in a minute).<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, though, it might be worth deleting inactive subscribers immediately. If a user has never engaged with your brand beyond their initial subscription\u2014especially if it\u2019s been a significant period of time \u2014then it\u2019s probably easier to just delete the address and move on.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/risk-value-spectrum-of-inactive-email-subscribers.png\" alt=\"risk value spectrum of inactive email subscribers\" width=\"551\" height=\"493\" class=\"wp-image-68111 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/risk-value-spectrum-of-inactive-email-subscribers.png 551w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/risk-value-spectrum-of-inactive-email-subscribers-480x429.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 551px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.litmus.com\/blog\/how-to-manage-the-3-kinds-of-inactive-email-subscribers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>4. Visualize your ideal subscriber<\/h3>\n<p>Your ideal subscriber is the one who opens and engages with every single email. But who exactly are they?<\/p>\n<p>By creating subscriber\/<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/23\/buyer-personas\">customer personas<\/a>, you can paint a clearer picture of your ideal subscriber and create hyper-targeted, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/06\/personalized-marketing\">personalized content<\/a>. A subscriber persona is a semi-fictional characterization of your ideal subscriber, based on market research and data.<\/p>\n<p>Subscriber personas also help you source higher-quality leads, which in turn results in a higher-quality email list. This means you can spend less time on rigorous monthly email cleaning and more time perfecting your email style guide and creating results-generating campaigns.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Use a proper list management software<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/01\/automated-email-marketing\">Email automation software<\/a> helps you manage your email lists more efficiently. Some of the popular tools include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.activecampaign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ActiveCampaign<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/moosend.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Moosend<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/mailchimp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mailchimp<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sendinblue.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SendinBlue<\/a>. Alongside your market research, they provide the information and tools you need to segment your email lists based on your subscribers\u2019 interests, behavior, engagement, etc.<\/p>\n<p>With list segmentation, you can create personalized and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-email-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">targeted email marketing campaigns<\/a> that drive engagement and higher ROI.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/email-marketing-list-segmentation.png\" alt=\"email marketing list segmentation\" width=\"651\" height=\"434\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68112 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/email-marketing-list-segmentation.png 651w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/email-marketing-list-segmentation-480x320.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 651px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.techtarget.com\/searchcustomerexperience\/tip\/9-strategies-for-email-marketing-segmentation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Other helpful features of email list management software include contact categorization and two-way data syncing between apps, both of which keep your lists orderly and updated.<\/p>\n<p>It should also integrate with your other communication tools, such as your call center software and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/09\/crm-for-small-business\">CRM<\/a>. For example, you might create triggered emails that send immediately after someone interacts with your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dialpad.com\/features\/virtual-receptionist\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">virtual receptionist service<\/a> or chatbot.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Make it easy to unsubscribe<\/h3>\n<p>A difficult or long-winded unsubscription process can harm your business\u2019 reputation. According to Qualtrics research, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.qualtrics.com\/xm-institute\/how-consumers-give-feedback-2019\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">33%<\/a> of consumers will privately tell their friends about a bad experience. Approximately 15% will share their negative experiences on social media. Not good for your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/06\/online-reputation-management\">reputation<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Whether it\u2019s because their interests have changed or they accidentally subscribed while making a purchase, sometimes users will want to unsubscribe. By providing them with an easy way to opt out, you can organically maintain good email hygiene while <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/why-good-online-reputation-is-important\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">preserving your positive reputation<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>A simple link in your email\u2019s footer and a playful confirmation message usually does the job!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/email-unsubscribe-example.png\" alt=\"email unsubscribe example\" width=\"600\" height=\"453\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68113 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/email-unsubscribe-example.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/email-unsubscribe-example-480x362.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/shots\/11208594-Unsubscribe-page-signNow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>7. Run a re-engagement campaign for inactive customers<\/h3>\n<p>After you\u2019ve identified all of your inactive users, you have three main options. The first, as we discussed earlier, is to simply delete the addresses from your list. The second is to target them with a re-engagement campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Re-engagement campaigns specifically target inactive users with hyper-personalized, incentivizing offers. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/13\/sales-promotion-examples\">Discounts and vouchers<\/a> are a popular go-to, but asking questions and showcasing new features are all ways that you can draw inactive subscribers back in.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/we-miss-you-reengagement-email-example.png\" alt=\"we miss you reengagement email example\" width=\"600\" height=\"496\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68132 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/we-miss-you-reengagement-email-example.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/we-miss-you-reengagement-email-example-480x397.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/retainiq.io\/blog\/we-miss-you-email-template-examples-to-re-engage-customers\/\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>8. Locate inactive users and give them the option to opt-out<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re afraid of prematurely removing your inactive users, you could try reaching out to them with an opt-out email beforehand.<\/p>\n<p>Opt-out emails will usually trigger one of three actions. Either the user will gracefully opt out of your emails (which results in less manual email cleaning for you); they won\u2019t respond (which is a sure sign that their address should be deleted); or they&#8217;ll re-engage, especially if you throw in some humor and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/03\/emotional-marketing-copy\">emotion<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/inactive-email-campaign-example.png\" alt=\"inactive email campaign example\" width=\"600\" height=\"631\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68127 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/inactive-email-campaign-example.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/inactive-email-campaign-example-480x505.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/reallygoodemails.com\/emails\/did-you-still-want-to-hear-from-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>9. Try an opt-down option<\/h3>\n<p>You could also present your users with an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/12\/27\/email-marketing-ios15\">email marketing strategy<\/a> called the \u2018opt-down\u2019 option. Opting down simply means that users can customize both the type and frequency of the emails they receive. This customer-centric approach ensures that users only receive what they\u2019re interested in.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/email-list-opt-down-example.png\" alt=\"email opt down example\" width=\"700\" height=\"410\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68167 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/email-list-opt-down-example.png 700w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/email-list-opt-down-example-480x281.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/martech.org\/opting-out-a-guide-to-letting-go-of-email-subscribers-the-right-way\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>It could also be the case that they\u2019d prefer a different method of communication instead, such as phone or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/09\/sms-marketing\">SMS<\/a>. For telephone communications, make sure you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dialpad.com\/blog\/how-to-get-800-number-for-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">get an 800 business number<\/a> to establish your credibility.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Practice the art of letting go<\/h3>\n<p>This is more of a psychological <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/01\/email-marketing-tips\">email marketing tip<\/a>. Letting go of inactive subscribers is hard, even when you understand why it\u2019s so important. Practicing the art of letting go will help you become more assertive in how you manage your email list, prioritizing quality and value over subscriber count. 100 engaged readers are better than 1000 disengaged readers.<\/p>\n<h2>Start cleaning out your email subscriber list today<\/h2>\n<p>On a physical level, <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/email-marketing-audit\/\">decluttering your email marketing<\/a> list is all about identifying and removing inactive and low-quality users. On a psychological level, it&#8217;s about reshaping your mindset.
