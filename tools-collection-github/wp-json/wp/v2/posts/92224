For instance, you could be billed for video views, clicks, and other user engagements.<\/p>\n<p>Visually-oriented placements like display and video are typically cheaper than spots on the SERP (search engine results page).\u00a0 So, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/01\/is-performance-max-right-for-you\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">another benefit of PMax<\/a> to keep in mind here is that you\u2019ll have more chances to potentially secure lower-cost ad placements. This usually makes PMax campaigns a good fit for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/19\/google-ads-for-small-businesses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">small business ad budgets<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>All that to say, there isn\u2019t a set cost associated with Performance Max campaigns as your costs will vary by day, placement, and more. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/2025-google-ads-benchmarks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our latest Google Ads benchmarks<\/a>, the average cost per click for Google search ads is $5.26 and $70.11 per lead on average. However, display ad costs per click or impression can be lower, typically less than $1. So, you can expect to start spending roughly in that range for your PMax search and display placements.<\/p>\n<p>Some other<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-costundefined\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u00a0Google Ads cost notes<\/a> to keep in mind when assigning a daily budget to your PMax campaign:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The average starting budget to cover Google Ads costs for SMBs is <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/google-ads-spend\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$1,000-2,500<\/a> per month.<\/li>\n<li>Most new Google Ads campaigns can cost around <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-for-startups\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$20-50<\/a> per day.<\/li>\n<li>Most businesses spend between <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-for-startups\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$1,000-10,000<\/a> per month on Google Ads.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Your Performance Max costs are more likely to fluctuate when you first enable it, as Google\u2019s algorithms require time to collect historical data.
