This could be something intangible, such as <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/15\/website-copy\">your company\u2019s brand attributes<\/a>, or something more easily defined such as the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">unique selling proposition<\/a> of a particular product line. It could also be your people, your literal human resources: strong leadership, or a great engineering team.<\/p>\n<h3>Weaknesses<\/h3>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve figured out your strengths, it\u2019s time to turn that critical self-awareness on your weaknesses.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Things your company lacks<\/li>\n<li>Things your competitors do better than you<\/li>\n<li>Resource limitations<\/li>\n<li>Unclear unique selling proposition<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/swot-analysis-weaknesses.png\" alt=\"SWOT analysis weaknesses examples\" width=\"800\" height=\"575\" \/><\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s holding your business or project back?

However, many companies further compartmentalize these elements into two distinct subgroups: Internal and External.<\/p>\n<h3>Internal factors<\/h3>\n<p>Typically, Strengths and Weaknesses are considered internal factors, in that they are the result of organizational decisions under the control of your company or team. A <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/05\/12\/customer-churn\">high churn rate<\/a>, for example, would be categorized as a weakness, but improving a high churn rate is still within your control, making it an internal factor.<\/p>\n<h3>External factors<\/h3>\n<p>Similarly, emerging competitors would be categorized as a threat in a SWOT analysis, but since there\u2019s very little you can do about this, this makes it an external factor. This is why you may have seen SWOT analyses referred to as Internal-External Analyses or IE matrices.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/swot-analysis-internal-external.jpg\" alt=\"SWOT analysis internal external examples\" width=\"602\" height=\"255\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image via <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/articles.bplans.com\/how-to-perform-swot-analysis\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Bplans<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Subcategorizing your four primary elements into Internal and External factors isn\u2019t necessarily critical to the success of your SWOT analysis, but it can be helpful in determining your next move or evaluating the degree of control you have over a given problem or opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>Now that we know what each of the elements of a SWOT analysis means, let\u2019s take a look at how to go about creating and conducting a SWOT analysis.<br \/>\n<a id=\"how_to_do_swot_analysis\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How to do a SWOT analysis<\/h2>\n<p>You can get the full experience in our video below, and this entire post is dedicated to answering that question, but for simplicity&#8217;s sake, here&#8217;s how to do a SWOT analysis:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Gather your team together\u2014ideally bring candy.<\/li>\n<li>Set up your quadrants\u2014on a whiteboard or projector (perhaps using our template).<\/li>\n<li>Start with strengths\u2014ask the below list of questions.<\/li>\n<li>Follow suit with weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.<\/li>\n<li>Organize the information collected into a neat and tidy document.<\/li>\n<li>Send out to the team with notes.<\/li>\n<li>Organize a second meeting to come up with action items and owners.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/9ets_5qSAo4?rel=0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<p><a id=\"swot_analysis_questions\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>SWOT analysis questions<\/h2>\n<p>Like <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/21\/features-vs-benefits\">feature-benefit matrices<\/a>, there are several ways to conduct a SWOT analysis. However, regardless of how you choose to structure your analysis, we need to start by asking a series of questions. Here is a breakdown of the questions you should seek to answer when performing your SWOT analysis.<\/p>\n<h3>Strengths questions<\/h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s take our first element, Strengths, for example. To determine what your strengths are as an organization, you could begin by asking some of the following questions:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>What do your customers love about your company or product(s)?<\/li>\n<li>What does your company do better than other companies in your industry?<\/li>\n<li>What are your most positive brand attributes?<\/li>\n<li>What\u2019s your unique selling proposition?<\/li>\n<li>What resources do you have at your disposal that your competitors do not?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>By answering these questions, you\u2019ll be in great shape to start identifying and listing your organization\u2019s strengths.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/swot-analysis-wordstream-brand-attributes.jpg\" alt=\"SWOT analysis WordStream brand attributes examples\" width=\"502\" height=\"441\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Positive brand attributes associated with WordStream, as identified by our customers<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Weakness questions<\/h3>\n<p>We can use the same principle to determine your company\u2019s weaknesses:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What do your customers dislike about your company or product(s)?<\/li>\n<li>What problems or complaints are often mentioned in your negative reviews?<\/li>\n<li>Why do your customers cancel or churn?<\/li>\n<li>What could your company do better?<\/li>\n<li>What are your most negative brand attributes?<\/li>\n<li>What are the biggest obstacles\/challenges in your current sales funnel?<\/li>\n<li>What resources do your competitors have that you do not?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You may find that determining the strengths and weaknesses of your organization or project is considerably easier or takes less time than figuring out the opportunities and threats facing your company. This is because, as we said earlier, these are internal factors. External factors, on the other hand, may require more effort and rely upon more data, as these are often beyond your immediate sphere of influence.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/swot-analysis-internal-external-factors-diagram.jpg\" alt=\"SWOT analysis internal external factor relationship diagram\" width=\"500\" height=\"530\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Opportunities questions<\/h3>\n<p>Identifying opportunities and threats may require you to conduct in-depth <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/09\/competitor-keywords\">competitive intelligence research<\/a> about what your competitors are up to, or the examination of wider economic or business trends that could have an impact on your company. That\u2019s not to say that opportunities and threats cannot be internal, however; you may discover opportunities and threats based solely on the strengths and weaknesses of your company. Some possible questions you could ask to identify potential opportunities might include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How can we improve our sales\/customer onboarding\/customer support processes?<\/li>\n<li>What kind of messaging resonates with our customers?<\/li>\n<li>How can we further engage our most vocal brand advocates?<\/li>\n<li>Are we allocating departmental resources effectively?<\/li>\n<li>Is there budget, tools, or other resources that we\u2019re not leveraging to full capacity?<\/li>\n<li>Which advertising channels exceeded our expectations \u2013 and why?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f <strong>Want a look at what your competitors are doing?<\/strong> Free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/how-to-spy-on-competitors?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_SpyOnCompetitors_Download\">How to Spy on Your Competitors: 7 Ways to Become a Competitive Supersleuth<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Threat questions<\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to threats, you could certainly begin by asking a series of questions like those above. However, it\u2019s often quite easy to come up with a list of potential threats facing your business or project without posing questions beforehand. This could include \u201cbranded\u201d threats such as emerging or established competitors, broader threats such as changing regulatory environments and market volatility, or even internal threats such as high staff turnover that could threaten or derail current growth.<br \/>\n<a id=\"pest_analysis\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>What is PEST analysis?<\/h2>\n<p>While we\u2019re on the topic of internal versus external factors, I wanted to mention a tangential but entirely separate type of analysis closely relevant to SWOT analyses, known as a PEST analysis.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier, I mentioned that external factors such as changing regulatory policies and market volatility could be considered threats in a standard SWOT analysis. However, despite their importance, challenges like this are often highly nuanced and driven by dozens or hundreds of individual factors. This can place them beyond the scope or intent of a typical SWOT analysis. This is why many companies also conduct PEST analyses.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/swot-analysis-pest-analysis-example.jpg\" alt=\"SWOT analysis PEST analysis examples\" width=\"700\" height=\"457\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This type of analysis is not what an exterminator does upon arriving at a roach-infested tenement. Rather, a PEST analysis functions very similarly to a SWOT analysis, only they\u2019re concerned with four external factors:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Political<\/li>\n<li>Economic<\/li>\n<li>Sociocultural<\/li>\n<li>Technological<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Pros of PEST analysis<\/h3>\n<p>One of the main reasons it\u2019s worth looking at PEST analyses is because many of the factors that could end up in a PEST matrix could also be relevant to the Opportunities and Threats in our SWOT analysis. The kind of political and economic turmoil we\u2019ve seen in the United States during the past year, for example, could very well pose legitimate and serious threats to many businesses (as well as some opportunities), but these kinds of obstacles tend to be much more complicated than the opportunities and threats you\u2019d see in most SWOT analyses, given their broader scale and often-complex underlying factors.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/swot-analysis-stages-of-economic-bubbles.jpg\" alt=\"SWOT analysis stages of economic bubbles \" width=\"700\" height=\"447\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image via <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/people.hofstra.edu\/geotrans\/eng\/ch7en\/conc7en\/stages_in_a_bubble.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Dr. Jean-Paul Rodrigue\/Hofstra University<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Cons of PEST analysis<\/h3>\n<p>Obstacles identified in a typical PEST analysis also tend to be on much longer timeframes \u2013 it\u2019s a lot easier and quicker to try and overcome internal challenges like high staff turnover than it is to wait and see if the economy picks up (or if the bubble will burst again). That\u2019s why many larger companies conduct both SWOT and PEST analyses simultaneously \u2013 the SWOT analysis provides them with more immediate, potentially actionable roadmaps, whereas PEST analyses can be highly valuable when it comes to formulating longer-term plans and business strategies.<br \/>\n<a id=\"swot_analysis_small_business\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Benefits of SWOT analysis for small businesses<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re a marketer or small-business owner, you might be wondering if SWOT analyses are practical or even feasible for smaller companies and organizations. Although there is definitely a resource overhead involved in the creation of a SWOT analysis, there are many benefits in doing so, even for the smallest of companies.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Get a bird&#8217;s eye view:<\/strong>\u00a0For one, conducting a comprehensive SWOT analysis provides a unique opportunity to gain greater insight into how your business operates. It\u2019s all too easy to get lost in the weeds of the day-to-day workings of your company, and conducting a SWOT analysis allows you to take a broader, bird\u2019s eye view of your business and the position it occupies in your industry.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Improve specific campaigns and projects.<\/strong> Another benefit of SWOT analyses is that this technique can be applied to a wide range of scenarios, not just as an overview of your business. You could use SWOT analyses to evaluate the potential strengths and weaknesses of a forthcoming advertising campaign, a planned content project, or even whether your company should be represented at a trade show or industry event.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example of a project SWOT analysis:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/project-swot-analysis-example.jpeg\" alt=\"project SWOT analysis example\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-56801\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/project-swot-analysis-example.jpeg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/project-swot-analysis-example-480x360.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/toggl.com\/blog\/the-benefits-of-swot-analysis-in-project-management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Develop tangible roadmaps.<\/strong> Obviously, it almost goes without saying that conducting a SWOT analysis allows you to identify what your company does well, where it could improve, and the opportunities and threats facing your business. However, conducting a SWOT analysis provides you with the opportunity to not only identify these factors, but also develop and implement tangible roadmaps and timelines for potential solutions. This can be beneficial in the creation of budgetary plans, identifying hiring needs and other mid- to long-term strategic planning.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a id=\"swot_analysis_example\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>A full SWOT analysis example<\/h2>\n<p>So, now we know what each element of a SWOT analysis is concerned with and the kinds of exploratory questions we can ask to get the ball rolling, it\u2019s time to actually get to work and create your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/swot-analysis-examples\">SWOT analysis example<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To illustrate how it works, we\u2019ll create our own SWOT analysis\u00a0example: a family-owned restaurant, with a single location, operating in an urban area.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the SWOT analysis example based on our fictional restaurant:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/swot-analysis-example-matrix.png\" alt=\"SWOT analysis example matrix\" width=\"650\" height=\"569\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As you can see, this matrix format allows you to quickly and easily identify the various elements you\u2019ve included in your analysis.<\/p>\n<h3>Strengths examples<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Excellent, well-trafficked location<\/li>\n<li>Good reputation in local community<\/li>\n<li>Seasonal menu, locally sourced.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Weakness examples<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Higher costs than comparable chain restaurants<\/li>\n<li>Single location means limited reach<\/li>\n<li>Modest advertising budget<\/li>\n<li>Not currently using food delivery apps\/technology<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Opportunity examples<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Growing interest in\/support for locally sourced ingredients<\/li>\n<li>Seasonal menu keeps things fresh and interesting<\/li>\n<li>Potential growth via food delivery apps\/technology<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Threat examples<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Intensifying competition from established chain restaurants<\/li>\n<li>Uncertain economic environment<\/li>\n<li>Rising cost of ingredients<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a id=\"swot_analysis_action\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>SWOT analysis example: Acting on your results<\/h2>\n<p>So, you\u2019ve finally got your hands on a completed SWOT matrix. You\u2019ve identified internal strengths and weaknesses, as well as external opportunities and threats. You\u2019ve begun to see your company in a whole new light.<\/p>\n<p>Now what?<\/p>\n<p>Ideally, there are two stages of action you should take upon completing a SWOT analysis. First, you should attempt to <strong>match your strengths with your opportunities<\/strong>. Next, you should try to <strong>convert weaknesses into strengths<\/strong>. Let\u2019s take a look how this works.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Harness your strengths<\/h3>\n<p>One of the best things about the strengths you identified in your SWOT analysis is that you\u2019re already doing them.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/swot-analysis-diagram-strengths.png\" alt=\"SWOT analysis example strengths\" width=\"650\" height=\"569\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In our example above, the restaurant\u2019s location, reputation, and seasonal menu are all strengths. This tells the fictitious company that it should continue to experiment with its popular seasonal menu. It also tells the company it should continue to develop and nurture the strong relationships with its regular customers that have strengthened the restaurant\u2019s reputation in the community.<\/p>\n<p>Essentially, acting upon your business\u2019 strengths consists of \u201cdo more of what you\u2019re already good at.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>2. Shore up your weaknesses<\/h3>\n<p>Acting on the weaknesses you identified in your SWOT analysis is a little trickier, not least because you have to be honest enough with yourself about your weaknesses in the first place.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/swot-analysis-diagram-weaknesses.png\" alt=\"SWOT analysis diagram weaknesses\" width=\"650\" height=\"569\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Going back to our example, some of these weaknesses are very challenging to act upon. Going up against the considerable purchasing power of rival chain restaurants can be very difficult for smaller, family owned businesses. The restaurant is also struggling with its limited reach, the restrictions of a modest advertising budget, and is also failing to leverage the potential to increase sales by allowing customers to order food online through delivery apps like Foodler or GrubHub.<\/p>\n<p>However, that\u2019s not to say all hope is lost. It might be harder for our example business to compete with a chain, but there are plenty of other ways small companies can be more competitive \u2013 such as by developing strong, meaningful relationships with customers, which was not only one of the company\u2019s strengths, but also something chain restaurants simply cannot offer.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Seize opportunities<\/h3>\n<p>The Opportunities section of your SWOT analysis is by far the most actionable, and that\u2019s by design. By identifying opportunities by evaluating your organization\u2019s strengths, you should have a ready-made list of targets to aim for.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/swot-analysis-diagram-opportunities.png\" alt=\"SWOT analysis diagram opportunities\" width=\"650\" height=\"569\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In the\u00a0example\u00a0above, increasing consumer appetites for ethically produced, locally grown ingredients is a major opportunity. However, our restaurateurs cannot rest on their laurels \u2013 there\u2019s still work to be done. In this example, this may involve investing in technical expertise to take advantage of the opportunities presented by food delivery apps, or sourcing locally grown produce more aggressively in an attempt to reduce costs.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also important to avoid hubris or complacency in your opportunities. Even if you have an iron-clad advantage over every other business in your industry, failing to devote sufficient time, money, or personnel resources in maintaining that advantage may result in you missing out on these opportunities over time.<\/p>\n<p>Every business\u2019 opportunities will differ, but it\u2019s vital that you create a clearly defined roadmap for capitalizing upon the opportunities you\u2019ve identified, whether they be internal or external.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Mitigate threats<\/h3>\n<p>Anticipating and mitigating the threats identified in your SWOT analysis may be the most difficult challenge you\u2019ll face in this scenario, primarily because threats are typically external factors; there\u2019s only so much you can do to mitigate the potential damage of factors beyond your control.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/swot-analysis-diagram-threats.png\" alt=\"SWOT analysis diagram threats\" width=\"650\" height=\"569\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Every threat, and the appropriate reaction to that threat, is different. Regardless of the specific threats you\u2019ve identified in your SWOT analysis, responding to and monitoring those threats should be among your very top priorities, irrespective of the degree of control you have over those threats.<\/p>\n<p>In the\u00a0example\u00a0above, all three threats are particularly challenging. To compete with the prices of its chain competitors, our restaurateurs may be forced to either compromise on their values to secure cheaper ingredients, or willingly cut into their profit margins to remain competitive. Similarly, economic uncertainty is virtually impossible to fully mitigate, making it a persistent threat to the stability of our example restaurant business.<\/p>\n<p>In some SWOT analyses, there may be some overlap between your opportunities and threats. For example, in the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/16\/marketing-competitive-analysis\">analysis<\/a> above, the popularity of locally sourced ingredients was identified as an opportunity, and heightened competition was identified as a threat. In this example, highlighting the restaurant\u2019s relationships with local farmers \u2013 further reinforcing the restaurant\u2019s commitment to the local community and regional economy \u2013 may be an effective way for our restaurateurs to overcome the threat posed by the increasingly desperate chain restaurants vying for their customers.<\/p>\n<p>When compiling the results of your SWOT analysis, be sure to look for areas of crossover like this and see if it\u2019s possible to seize an opportunity and reduce a threat at the same time.<br \/>\n<a id=\"swot_analysis_template\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Free SWOT Analysis template<\/h2>\n<p>Ready to put it all into practice for your own business?
