And, depending on what platform you use, there may be some A\/B <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/06\/24\/landing-page-tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">testing tools<\/a> available to help. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>There are no real \u201cwrong\u201d ways to test a hypothesis, but there are some pros and cons you should be aware of with each of the following PPC A\/B testing examples.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>1. On\/Off, sequential testing<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>This first A\/B testing example is likely the easiest for most advertisers. Here you take note of the data from your existing setup, then make the changes that support your hypothesis, run the campaign that way for a while, then compare stats. Easy enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/ab-testing-examples-sequential-testing-format-example.jpg\" alt=\"ab testing examples - screenshot of sequential ab testing format\" width=\"999\" height=\"124\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-80887 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/ab-testing-examples-sequential-testing-format-example.jpg 999w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/ab-testing-examples-sequential-testing-format-example-980x122.jpg 980w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/ab-testing-examples-sequential-testing-format-example-480x60.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 999px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>It may look something like this. You have four weeks&#8217; worth of data with your<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/03\/get-more-traffic-from-evergreen-content\"> evergreen ad copy<\/a>. You then pause those variants and launch cost-focused copy for four weeks then compare. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>This method of testing can be useful and can yield good results. It\u2019s easy to implement and only requires you to monitor your campaign for large swings in performance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The downside is that the variants never overlap with each other. Was there some seasonal effect that took place in the second 4 weeks? Were you short on budget for the month and needed to pull back on spending to hit your levels? Did a news story impact performance for worse (or better) during either period? Did any other aspects of the campaign change during the eight weeks the test was running?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>It\u2019s not perfect, but it can be useful to test sequentially to see results. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>2. Geolocation testing<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>In a geolocation A\/B testing example, you keep the existing campaign set up as it is, then create an experiment variant in a second location. This could be either to an expanded market or a portion of where you&#8217;re currently targeting (i.e., your campaign targets the entire United States, but for this test, you make the changes only effective in a handful of states).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/ab-testing-examples-location-targeting.jpg\" alt=\"ab testing examples - geolocation targeting ab test example screenshot\" width=\"746\" height=\"458\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-80886 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/ab-testing-examples-location-targeting.jpg 746w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/ab-testing-examples-location-targeting-480x295.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 746px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>To accomplish this, you need to make sure your control and experiment are mutually exclusive so there\u2019s no overlap. This can be done by setting up new campaigns and excluding locations in your control campaign.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Unlike the sequential A\/B testing example, Geolocation testing can allow you to run your variants at the same time and compare results. Any head or tailwinds you feel during the run of the test should be equal for both locations. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The downfalls come when you realize that no two regions are exactly alike. Who&#8217;s to say why a cost-focused message might work better in Oklahoma than in Nebraska? Or why the East Coast performs better with automated bidding than the Mountain time zone?\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span>3. A\/B split testing<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>Split tests are likely the best example of A\/B testing as it removes some of the cons we see in sequential and geolocation testing. The problem is that true A\/B testing is also the hardest to come by.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/ab-testing-examples-ad-rotation-optimization-screenshot.jpg\" alt=\"ab testing examples - screenshot of google ads ad rotation optimization options\" width=\"826\" height=\"386\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-80883 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/ab-testing-examples-ad-rotation-optimization-screenshot.jpg 826w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/ab-testing-examples-ad-rotation-optimization-screenshot-480x224.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 826px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/15\/meta-ads-vs-google-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Platforms like Google Ads and Meta Ads<\/a> have long done away with rotating variables evenly. For example, both platforms have AI-powered machine learning that will pretty much always favor one ad variant over another based on the desired outcome of the campaign or ad set. The same is true for bid strategies. If you\u2019re testing manual versus auto-bidding, or one CPA target versus another, those two campaigns are likely not going to enter the auction on the same foot. One will be prioritized over the other and you\u2019ll have an unbalanced test.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/ab-testing-examples-google-ads-experiment.jpg\" alt=\"ab testing examples - google ads experiment screenshot\" width=\"835\" height=\"459\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-80885 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/ab-testing-examples-google-ads-experiment.jpg 835w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/ab-testing-examples-google-ads-experiment-480x264.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 835px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>This is where<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/03\/20\/ppc-campaign-testing-tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> experiments in Google Ads and split testing in Facebook Ads<\/a> can come in. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>By using these tools, you can set up tests to focus on single (or multiple) variables and give them each a fair shot in the auction. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>If you\u2019re interested in learning more about these tools, here are a couple of videos that walk you through <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/97F1Voc9tiI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads Experiments<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/viA3RrZUw7Y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook Ads A\/B testing<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"measure-ab-test-success\"><\/div>\n<h2><span>Measuring success across different PPC A\/B testing examples<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span>Now that we know how we\u2019re going to test, we need to get more specific on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/19\/ppc-metrics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PPC metrics<\/a> we\u2019re going to use to determine success. Unfortunately, I\u2019m not willing to accept \u201cperform better\u201d as a good answer. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>First, we have to decide what our main KPI is. Is it your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/15\/google-ads-benchmarks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads cost per lead<\/a>? Conversion rate? Click-through rate? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/06\/07\/impression-share\">Impression share<\/a>? This will rely entirely on your hypothesis and which A\/B testing example you choose to implement. Pick the stat that will best reflect a success or failure for your test. (Don\u2019t worry, this isn\u2019t the only metric we\u2019d focus on. More on that in a minute.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Just like the functionality of the test, there are three common ways to approach this. Let\u2019s say we\u2019re trying to improve the CPA for an account. Here are some ways I could phrase my \u201csuccess\u201d metric:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span> <\/span><strong><span>Target performance<\/span><\/strong><span>: This test is a success if the experiment variable yields a $60 CPA. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span> <\/span><strong><span>Percentage improvement: <\/span><\/strong><span>This test is a success if the experiment variable has a 10% lower CPA than the control.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span> <\/span><strong><span>Statistical significance:<\/span><\/strong><span> This test is a success if the experiment variable has an 80% confidence level of performing better than the control.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span>All of these are valid ways of measurement. Choose the one that works best for your purposes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udcca Are your key PPC metrics up to industry standards?

While you might be working to optimize your cost per lead, that doesn\u2019t mean that all other metrics are going to stay flat. In fact, I\u2019d venture to bet that many of them will change quite a bit. It\u2019s up to you to decide what is an acceptable level of change on other stats. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Maybe you don\u2019t care if your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/14\/improve-google-ads-click-through-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">click-through rate<\/a> goes down 20% as long as cost per lead goes down to a profitable level. Maybe you don\u2019t mind <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/17\/lower-cost-per-click\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">if you see a cost per click increase<\/a> as long as revenue stays stable. But not everyone is alright with other stats moving too much. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Here\u2019s an A\/B testing example including varying metrics: I have a client who wanted to decrease the cost per lead on his branded terms by 20%, but he wasn\u2019t willing to let impression share dip below 80%. While we knew it was going to be tricky to thread the needle, we set up an A\/B testing experiment for target CPA bidding to try and lower the CPA. As we got into it, we realized that to hit our CPA metric, Google only showed the ads for about 60% of the impressions we could have had. That was a dealbreaker for him, so we turned the test off and found another way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/ab-testing-examples-experiment-goals.jpg\" alt=\"ab testing examples - google ads experiment goals screenshot\" width=\"920\" height=\"230\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-80884 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/ab-testing-examples-experiment-goals.jpg 920w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/ab-testing-examples-experiment-goals-480x120.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 920px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span>When you set up experiments in Google, they even ask for two key metrics and what you plan to have happen. You should be doing this for yourself and asking, \u201cAre there any potential deal breakers for metrics that would require me to stop this test before it\u2019s finished?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Consider your A\/B testing timeline<\/h3>\n<p><span>Unfortunately, sometimes A\/B tests have to come to an end without a clear winner. These tests can\u2019t go on forever or else you\u2019ll never test anything else. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>But on the flip side, A\/B tests need to run for long enough to make sure you have enough data to make decisions on. Only the very largest of accounts could potentially make a decision after a single week of testing, but even then, it would have to be night and day for me to be onboard. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>I usually recommend a minimum of two weeks for a test to run and a maximum of two months. Anything beyond that can be unmanageable and gets into a place where other factors could be causing the test to be invalidated. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>This means that, regardless of which A\/B testing example you choose to run, be sure that within two months your test will have enough data to decide, with confidence, if your hypothesis was correct. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span>Putting the right PPC A\/B testing examples to work for your business<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span>A\/B testing is an invaluable tool that all marketers should likely be using in one way, shape, or form in their ad accounts. Be sure you have a clear head going into the test, including a hypothesis, plan of action, and potential deal breakers before you try any A\/B testing example.
