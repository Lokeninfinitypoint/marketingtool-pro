Unfortunately, many don&#8217;t sustain growth\u00a0because they cannot maintain consistency or because they run out of ideas.

The truth is, thanks to the advanced targeting capabilities of online ads, they are a cost-effective way to get qualified exposure for your local business. The key is to do it right. Here are nine ideas and suggestions to use it to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/22\/maximize-ROI-with-responsive-search-ads\">get a solid ROI on your advertising spend<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Run Google Ads<\/h3>\n<p>Google, one of the foremost search engines in the world, allows you to target potential customers in your local area specifically with pay-per-click ads. With this platform, you can run the classic search engine result Google Ad, Google Local Services Ads (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/11\/google-local-services-ads-tips\">Google LSA tips here<\/a>), Google Shopping Ads, and more.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42023\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/local-marketing-ideas-google-local-service-ads.png\" alt=\"local marketing ideas: google local service ad\" width=\"600\" height=\"633\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/local-marketing-ideas-google-local-service-ads.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/local-marketing-ideas-google-local-service-ads-480x506.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/div>\n<p>A higher volume of inquiries and increased\u00a0sales are just two of many benefits of running Google Ads. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/05\/16\/competitive-advertising\">well-thought-out ad strategy<\/a> can also yield long-term results that are less tangible, such as improved\u00a0<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/14\/use-branding-to-improve-advertising\">brand awareness<\/a> and brand recognition, which often leads to referrals and sales down the road.To learn more, check out:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/12\/08\/should-i-use-adwords\">Should I Run Google Ads?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/21\/how-to-run-google-ads\">How to Run Google Ads<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Our free\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords\">Google Ads Performance Grader<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>2. Set up detailed radius location targeting in Google Ads<\/h3>\n<p>Below is a simple explanation of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/11\/13\/adwords-geotargeting-local-ppc-guide\">Google Ads\u00a0radius targeting<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/local20marketing20ideas20location20targeting20for20google20ads.png\" alt=\"local marketing ideas location targeting for google ads\" width=\"800\" height=\"337\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You might think you can set the target 2-5 miles around your store and then kick back&#8230;but not so fast! Taking advantage of the radius targeting feature along with location bid adjustments is what will turn your Google Ads from doing well to, well, crushing it.\u00a0Here&#8217;s how to set up radius targeting in Google Ads:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Create your locations<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you own a coffee shop in Irvine, CA, and let&#8217;s say that\u00a0consumers are only willing to drive up to five miles to visit the store.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to settings at the campaign level &gt; all settings &gt; edit locations &gt; advanced search &gt; radius targeting.<\/li>\n<li>Type in your address and select search.<\/li>\n<li>Add locations for a 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 mile radius.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This is what the targeting map should look like when you are finished:<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42024\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/local-marketing-ideas-radius-targeting.png\" alt=\"local marketing ideas: radius targeting\" width=\"720\" height=\"455\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/local-marketing-ideas-radius-targeting.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/local-marketing-ideas-radius-targeting-480x303.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>You know you are doing something right when your targeting is, in fact, a target.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Collect data<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The most important part of this <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/24\/google-ads-optimization\">Google Ads optimization strategy<\/a> is using data to make your decisions. Now that the locations are placed in the campaign, you must give them time to collect clicks and more importantly, conversion data. Once your data reaches a significant level, you will then be able to perform the formula in step three and enter bid adjustments.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Set location bid adjustments<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A location bid adjustment is the percentage you would like to adjust your bids for a given location. You can set lower bids with negative numbers or raise bids with positive numbers.<\/p>\n<p>To input these location bid adjustments, go to campaign settings &gt; locations tab. Here you will see all of the radius locations that were just created in step one along with their performance data. You will notice a bid adjustment column (you will be using that one).<\/p>\n<p>Here is the formula that you should use to create your bid adjustments for each location:<\/p>\n<p>Location Conversion Rate \/ Average Conversion Rate &#8211; 1 = Bid Adjustment<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Bid adjustment formula:<\/p>\n<p>Location Conversion Rate \/ Average Conversion Rate &#8211; 1 = Bid Adjustment<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>An important thing to note is that bid adjustments will layer for a location within another location(s). For example, ads showing in the 1-mile radius will have the 2, 3, 4, and 5-mile radius bid adjustments added up. Here is an example of what actual bid adjustments will look like vs. the original adjustments that you will get from the formula above.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Formula Bid Adjustments: 1 mile: 50%, 2 mile 35%, 3 mile 20%, 4 mile 10%, 5 mile 0%<\/li>\n<li>Actual Bid Adjustments: 1 mile: 15%, 2 mile 15%, 3 mile 10%, 4 mile 10%, 5 mile 0%<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>No conversion data?\u00a0First off, shame on you! The best thing you can do is go with the assumption that the further someone is from your store, the less likely they are to visit. With that, don\u2019t set a bid adjustment for your 1-mile radius, and gradually scale negative bid adjustments for 2, 3, 4 and 5 miles.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u2705\u00a0 Free Guide:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite30BestWaysToPromote.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Marketing_The30BestWaysToPromoteYourBusiness_Download\">The Best Ways to Promote Your Business (With or Without Money!)<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>3.

Build custom landing pages for every campaign<\/h3>\n<p>Countless local businesses throw money down the drain by not <a href=\"\/conversion-tracking\">tracking conversions<\/a> or building local landing pages.

Don\u2019t underestimate the power of LinkedIn<\/h3>\n<p>While <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/11\/most-popular-social-media-platforms\">social platforms<\/a> like Facebook and Instagram remain popular among local marketers\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/facebook-ads-for-small-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">and for good reasons<\/a>\u2014Clegg called LinkedIn \u201ca potent platform for local businesses looking to expand their reach.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s in part because <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/25\/optimize-linkedin-ads\">LinkedIn<\/a> outreach can deliver enhanced results when combined with emails. For one client, Clegg added 400 emails per month and scheduled 40 qualified sales calls per month as a result of implementing this tactic.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Try third-person ad copy instead of talking about yourself<\/h3>\n<p>Ever wonder how you can cut through the noise among other Google Ads? Try talking in the third person.\u00a0We have experimented and seen higher CTR\u2019s in ad copy that contains language that speaks to the customer in the third person. Here are some examples:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cWe Hired Them To Do Our AC and It Was Perfect.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cThey Truly Are OC\u2019s Best Plumber\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cI Am a Raving Fan After Their Customer Service.

Leverage call-only ads<\/h3>\n<p>If you are a local service business driving sales through phone calls, and if landing pages aren&#8217;t really your thing (even though they should be&#8230;) then <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/07\/call-only-ads\">call-only ads<\/a> could be a lifesaver.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/effective20local20marketing20ideas20leverage20call-only20ads.png\" alt=\"effective local marketing ideas leverage call-only ads\" width=\"936\" height=\"308\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Call-only ads allow you to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/08\/10\/increase-conversion-rates\">completely avoid the need for a landing page<\/a> or a \u201cleaky funnel.\u201d If you do not have money for an ad team or custom landing pages, then call-only ads give you a way to advertise directly to your customer with a singular focus: customers and leads calling you.<\/p>\n<p>Be wary though: you will get calls that are not entirely qualified, so make sure to leverage <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/03\/copywriting-examples\">amazing ad copy<\/a> that clearly allows your target market to self-identify with your offer. Here are some examples:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/effective20local20marketing20ideas20leverage20call-only20ads20examples.png\" alt=\"effective local marketing ideas leverage call-only ads examples\" width=\"554\" height=\"618\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>10. Test store-front images in your display and retargeting ads<\/h3>\n<p>Big picture, if you are a local business that thrives on foot traffic you want to start to create a correlation between your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/17\/increase-online-presence\">online presence<\/a> and your physical location.\u00a0You want to stand out in your advertising environment so that consumers, when driving or walking by your location, will think &#8220;<em>Hey, I\u2019ve seen that place before<\/em>.\u201d While copy like \u201cSwing By Today\u201d is catchy and needed, nothing ties the physical and the virtual together like a photo of your actual location.<\/p>\n<h2>Effective local marketing ideas: listings<\/h2>\n<p>Online review sites and<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/best-free-business-listing-sites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> local business directories<\/a>\u00a0sites such as Yelp, Merchant Circle, and Google My Business enable people to identify and learn about businesses in a specific area. Customers use these sites to find businesses where they live, where they are visiting, and to review good service. In order to use review sites and directories for your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/24\/local-marketing-tips\">local online marketing<\/a>, you need to get listed, encourage reviews, and monitor your listing. Here\u2019s the breakdown:<\/p>\n<h3>11. Get listed<\/h3>\n<p>When creating your listing on these sites, be as detailed as possible, and make sure your information is consistent across listings. You want people to be able to use these sites to not only discover your business, but also to learn about, engage with, and become a customer of your business. If it is difficult for people to get to your website, find your address, or call you from your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/listings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online directory listing<\/a>, then you are likely missing out on new customers.<\/p>\n<h3>12. Prioritize your Google business listing, in particular<\/h3>\n<p>Every year, Google improves its local search capabilities more and more. Consumers rely on this search engine to find businesses close to them. If you want to get found by customers in your local area, you need to make sure you\u2019re <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/02\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google-maps\">showing up on Google Maps<\/a> results as well as the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/02\/local-business-marketing-tips\">local results<\/a> section of Google Search. How do you do that? With a <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/10\/create-google-my-business-account\">Google Business Profile<\/a>, which is the official term for a Google business listing.\u00a0This free listing will not only give you greater visibility in local search, but it will also help you to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/13\/sales-promotion-examples\">obtain more customers<\/a>. This is because the listing contains everything a consumer needs in order to make a decision about and even engage with your business.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udccd Are your listings optimized for local search? <\/strong>Find out with our<strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/free-business-listings-grader?cid=Web_WS_InContentTextLink_Freemium_Listings&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Free Business Listings Grader<\/a>!<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>13. Select your category<\/h3>\n<p>How important are listing categories, you might ask? They are critical\u2014and here\u2019s why. For one, if you advertise on Yelp, the queries that your ads show up for are determined by the categories you choose.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/effective20local20marketing20ideas20local20seo20categories.png\" alt=\"effective local marketing ideas local seo categories\" width=\"800\" height=\"643\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Furthermore, where your listing ranks organically on Google\u00a0is also influenced by your Yelp categories.\u00a0For example, in the image below, Alternative Divorce Solutions was able to move up to the number one result in a Yelp search for \u201cdivorce mediation\u201d simply by\u00a0listing their business under \u201cDivorce &amp; Family Law\u201d as a category.<\/p>\n<p>The importance of this spans outside of Yelp though! Look at the number one organic result in Google (under local results, which we&#8217;ll get to next) for \u201cdivorce mediation\u201d:<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42034\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/local-marketing-ideas-local-seo.png\" alt=\"local marketing ideas: local SEO\" width=\"555\" height=\"495\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/local-marketing-ideas-local-seo.png 555w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/local-marketing-ideas-local-seo-480x428.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 555px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nYep, it\u2019s Yelp. But if you&#8217;re included in that list, you&#8217;re <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/19\/get-on-first-page-google\">on the first page of Google<\/a>. So, by simply getting your Yelp categories correct you can start to immediately impact your lead volume.<\/p>\n<p>This also means that if you pay for ads and don\u2019t want to advertise on certain keywords, removing categories is critical as well. (Think of this like negative keywords.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/12\/06\/small-business-ideas\">85 Profitable Small Business Ideas Worth Trying<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>14. Optimize your Google Business Profile<\/h3>\n<p>Choosing a category is important for any listing, but especially your Google Business Profile.

Do some volunteer work in your local community<\/h3>\n<p>What if you\u2019re not quite in a position to become a sponsor? You can still do some volunteer work within your community. No matter where you\u2019re based, there\u2019s surely something helpful you can do. You might consider helping out at local non-profit or charity event.

Send locally-focused emails<\/h3>\n<p>Email is an effective way to keep in touch with past customers and gain new ones, especially for local businesses. Think about how you can make your emails more attention-grabbing with local content. You might try a monthly <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/04\/best-time-to-send-email-campaign\">newsletter<\/a> that also includes relevant updates about the community. Or maybe <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/13\/sales-promotion-examples\">deals and discounts<\/a> creatively named based on location-specific themes, such as street names or other community mainstays. You could also write free guides or blog posts with a local focus and distribute those via email. For example, a nutritionist could share a blog post on \u201cBest Health Food Stores in the Chelmsford Area\u201d, while a real estate agent could share a guide such as\u00a0 \u201cBest Resources for Boston Home Buyers\u201d.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Think about how you can make your emails more attention-grabbing with local content.<\/h4>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h3>40. Offer emailed mobile coupons to track offline conversion intent<\/h3>\n<p>Offline conversion tracking is a daunting task and can often rely on the dependence of micro conversions (time on site, specific page visits, etc.). Lucky for you, we have the answer to all of your offline conversion tracking pains: Emailed mobile coupons! This is a coupon that the consumer can request via email and show on their phone when it\u2019s time to purchase at your store.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42028\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/local-marketing-ideas-email-mobile-coupons.png\" alt=\"local marketing ideas: mobile coupons\" width=\"574\" height=\"412\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/local-marketing-ideas-email-mobile-coupons.png 574w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/local-marketing-ideas-email-mobile-coupons-480x345.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 574px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nAdding an emailed mobile coupon to your site is a great way to track both conversion intention and execution. You can add your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/18\/underused-ppc-strategies\">paid traffic <\/a>tracking script to the coupon request action to easily track purchase intention.<\/p>\n<p>If you would like to take things one step further, build a custom landing page for this emailed mobile coupon and only show it to your paid traffic. That way, you can attribute all of your in-store transactions using the coupon to your paid efforts.<\/p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN\">More local marketing ideas<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3>41. Encourage word-of-mouth marketing<\/h3>\n<p>Word of mouth is also a highly effective local marketing tactic. The best thing you can do to promote word-of-mouth in your local area, of course, is to provide <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/28\/social-media-customer-service\">outstanding customer service<\/a>. You should also be proactive by <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">asking for reviews<\/a>, in person, via email, or on social media.\u00a0 One last idea is to package a solid offer up in a shareable email or social media post. If your audience members feel that someone they know could benefit as well, they\u2019ll be happy to forward along to family and friends, increasing your business\u2019s local exposure.<\/p>\n<h3>42. Distribute business cards, brochures, and flyers<\/h3>\n<p>Though we live in an online world, printed material is still widely successful with local marketing. Make sure your collateral is eye-catching, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/21\/business-one-pager-examples\">clearly explains briefly what you do or offer<\/a>, and contains all necessary contact information. You can then set them out at your physical location, pass them out to potential customers and partners, or leave them in popular local go-to\u2019s such as coffee shops.<\/p>\n<p>These, too, will keep your business top of mind and may also end up in the hands of potential customers you previously hadn\u2019t reached.<\/p>\n<h3>43. Offer referral incentives<\/h3>\n<p>Kill two birds with one stone by <a href=\"https:\/\/thrivehive.com\/referral-program-ideas\/\">offering referral incentives<\/a> such as discounts and other coveted perks. Not only do they keep past customers coming back to you, but they also reel in new ones. Need we mention that these new customers\u2014the family, friends and professional connections of current buyers\u2014may also refer you, increasing your reach even more? This is, without a doubt, one of the most rewarding local marketing tactics you could use!<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42027\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/local-marketing-ideas-referral-program.jpeg\" alt=\"local marketing ideas: referral program\" width=\"720\" height=\"609\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/local-marketing-ideas-referral-program.jpeg 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/local-marketing-ideas-referral-program-480x406.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>44. Create a \u201cGet Directions\u201d page and set views as a micro-conversion<\/h3>\n<p>If you are a local business, it can be difficult to tell if your online efforts are driving offline conversions.\u00a0To help make your life easier, simply set your \u201cget directions\u201d page or tab as a destination URL goal in Google Analytics. With this type of data, you can build a somewhat reliable attribution model for your paid efforts.<\/p>\n<p>More ideally, however, we recommend comparing advertising channel spends with overall revenue growth. So, when we spent $1,000 on Yelp compared to $500, how much more revenue did we make? Was it worth it?\u00a0Start to notice trends and you can see where your dollar yields the greatest increase in marginal returns.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/effective20local20marketing20ideas20create20a20get20directions20page_0.png\" alt=\"effective local marketing ideas create a get directions page\" width=\"800\" height=\"569\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>45. Create seasonal content<\/h3>\n<p>There are tons (and I mean tons) of observances and awareness causes that are allotted to specific months of the year. There&#8217;s Domestic Abuse Awareness Month, National Compliment Day, Financial Literacy Month, and the list goes on. These themes and observances give you the opportunity to add a touch of philanthropy, festiveness, and fun into your marketing content. Even better, you can really build a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/tips-to-help-your-business-build-a-sense-of-community\/\">sense of community<\/a>, which is huge for local businesses.

Invest in video<\/h3>\n<p>Local businesses that want to take their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/content-marketing-trends-2024\">content marketing<\/a> efforts up a notch should consider video, which remains the format of choice across social media.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis trend offers businesses new opportunities to creatively engage with their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">target audiences<\/a>, revolutionizing how they connect with viewers,\u201d said Zain Bin Zameer, senior link-building expert at Technology Ally. \u201cWhether through product demos, brand stories, or educational tutorials, the impact of video content is set to reshape the marketing landscape for years to come.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Small businesses should also experiment with formats like short-form or live videos to capitalize on platforms like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/12\/14\/tiktok-trend-discovery\">TikTok<\/a> and Reels.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/tiktok-trend-discovery-married-in-italy-trend.jpg\" alt=\"tiktok trend discovery - example of business using tiktok trend\" width=\"281\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-78535\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/tiktok-trend-discovery-married-in-italy-trend.jpg 281w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/tiktok-trend-discovery-married-in-italy-trend-141x300.jpg 141w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThese strategies will harness not only <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/digital-marketing-trends-2024\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">digital trends<\/a> but also market shifts in consumer behavior and technological advancements,\u201d said Dan Dillon CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanitsupply.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CleanItSupply.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>47.
