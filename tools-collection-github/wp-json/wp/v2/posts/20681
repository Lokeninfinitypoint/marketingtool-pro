If you\u2019re anything like my lovely colleague, Allen, you\u2019d rather shave your own head than spend your time trying to find the perfect salon. I have such a hard time finding a good hairdresser that I often travel back to Philadelphia to get my hair cut (yes, 6.5 hours for a haircut. I\u2019m insane.)<\/p>\n<p>But if you\u2019re running a salon, you want to stand out from the crowd to hook shoppers like me! Here are some marketing ideas to employ to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/growth-academy\">grow your customer base<\/a> and stay on top of your marketing game.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"\/images\/Fun%20and%20Powerful%20Salon%20Marketing%20Ideas.png\" alt=\"Fun Marketing ideas for Salons\" width=\"758\" height=\"503\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>1. Offer Referral Discounts<\/h2>\n<p>Personally, I love this one. Once I find a hairdresser or manicurist that I love, I\u2019m apt to recommend her\/him to all my friends. Why not give your customers a little bonus for doing your advertising for free and sending new clients your way? I recommend an email or postcard with a nice note, \u201cThanks for referring us to your friend, Jane! We\u2019re so pleased you thought of us, that we want you to know we\u2019re thinking of you, too. Here is $15 off your next visit.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>2. Loyalty Programs or Punch Cards<\/h2>\n<p>Like referral discounts, it\u2019s always nice to recognize great clients. My hairdresser has been cutting my hair long enough to remember when my sister got married, what business my brother started, and how my aunt\u2019s broken leg is healing. Likewise, I love to hear about her two sweet babies, her husband\u2019s Penn State obsession, and her crazy family stories. Show your clients that you not only hear their stories\u2014you look forward to them! For every 10 visits, give a discount for the 11th. Or, if they\u2019ve been coming to you long enough for the prices of services to rise, consider giving them the original price. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/10\/customer-loyalty\">Customer loyalty<\/a> is hugely important to any business, but <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/salon-grand-opening-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">salons<\/a> can easily capitalize on it.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Yelp<\/h2>\n<p>If you aren\u2019t on yelp, you probably aren\u2019t going to draw in new business from <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/09\/28\/generational-marketing-tactics\">millennials<\/a>. It\u2019s simple to claim your business, add photos, and respond to customer reviews. You can also offer discounts to customers to who check in at your location or package deals, i.e. manicure and pedicure for 10% off.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/yelp-salon-marketing-ideas.png\" alt=\"Marketing on Yelp for Hair Salons\" width=\"969\" height=\"857\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>4. Geotargeted Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Whether you utilize Facebook or AdWords, geotargeted ads should be your best friend. You don\u2019t want to be fielding appointment requests from a client in California when your salon is in New York! Need help setting it up? We have great guides on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/11\/13\/adwords-geotargeting-local-ppc-guide\">AdWords<\/a> and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/27\/facebook-ad-targeting-options-infographic\">Facebook targeting options<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Mobile Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Like geo targeting, mobile ads can be hugely beneficial\u2014especially with AdWords new bidding features that allows users to bid differently on desktop and mobile.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Show off your Skilled Staff<\/h2>\n<p>I love sitting in the waiting area at a salon and looking at magazines for ideas. \u00a0I also love being able to point to any picture and know my stylist can get it done! Instead of placing magazines on the table, try creating a binder of styles and cuts that your own staff has completed\u2014maybe a collection of shots from your Instagram!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/skilled-staff-marketing-salon.png\" alt=\"Skilled Salon Staff\" width=\"540\" height=\"735\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>7. Use Hashtags to Pitch Your Salons for Events<\/h2>\n<p>I don\u2019t know about you, but I hate wedding hashtags. They\u2019re annoying, usually mildly obnoxious, but totally useful. It\u2019s so nice to have all your wedding photos easily findable through a hashtag! The bonus for salons? You can use them to be proactive. With so many couples announcing their #engagements or planning bachelor\/bachelorette parties on Instagram and Facebook, complete with a wedding hashtag, you can be proactive! Simply search for engagements, find the owner of the hashtag, and slide into their direct messages with a sales pitch.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-hashtags-salon-marketing.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram Hashtags\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>8. Post Coupons Locally<\/h2>\n<p>When I was in high school, we received daily planners at the beginning of the year with a schedule for the year and various coupons from local businesses strategically placed throughout the planner. Every year, all the boys rented tuxes for prom from the same place, and all the girls got the hair and nails done at the same local salon (there were two locations, but still a huge crowd). It\u2019s a great way to capitalize on a big money-making event\u2014and get involved in your community!<\/p>\n<h2>9. Allow Online Reservations<\/h2>\n<p>This is huge! I usually look for new hair salons when I\u2019m burning time during my commute, when it\u2019s probably not appropriate to speak on the phone. And, speaking to real people to make an appointment is overrated. If an online reservation system is off the table, consider adding an email address to your contact info that people could correspond with to set up an appointment.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/online-booking-salon-marketing.png\" alt=\"Online Booking Marketing in Salons\" width=\"982\" height=\"463\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>10. Collect Email Addresses<\/h2>\n<p>This is such a simple and powerful marketing tactic. Getting an email address is like getting keys to the kingdom\u2014you can use them for appointment reminders, newsletter updates, referral bonuses, and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/11\/16\/facebook-remarketing\">remarketing lists on Facebook<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>11. Capitalize on Instagram<\/h2>\n<p>One of my guilty pleasures is watching videos on Instagram. Usually they are of people making delicious food, but also beauty tutorials! I love seeing someone\u2019s hair chopped short and dyed purple, or extensions put in, or nail accessories expertly glued on. Use your skills and record your clients; with permission, of course. Even better, have your clients share the videos on their personal pages to attract their friends to your salon!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/transformation-hair-salon.png\" alt=\"Hair Salon Transformation\" width=\"932\" height=\"474\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>12. \u2026and Facebook<\/h2>\n<p>There is a handy-dandy \u201cshare\u201d button on Instagram that allows you to share all your testimonials and videos on both platforms! If you have longer-form tips, try starting with Facebook since users are more open to spending more time on a single post. You should also try out <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/24\/facebook-product-ads\">carousel ads<\/a>! A perfect way to showcase your work and appointments. Facebook advertising allows you to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/01\/28\/facebook-ad-targeting\">target your audience<\/a> by interest\u2014try targeting an audience with a birthday coming with an ad that reads, \u201cTreat Yourself!\u201d or someone who is engaged with an ad that reads, \u201cLet Us Pamper You for Your Big Day!\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>13. Offer Flash Sales on Twitter<\/h2>\n<p>One of my favorite salon marketing ideas is a flash sale! Twitter is the perfect place to advertise this. Send out a tweet, \u201c$10 haircut for anyone willing to let our best new addition show off her skills!\u201d and give it away to the first respondent.<\/p>\n<h2>14. Birthday Promotions<\/h2>\n<p>Who doesn\u2019t love to be pampered on their birthday? By asking your clientele for their birth date or month, you can send out a birthday promotion\u2014a discounted blowout or makeup session, maybe. Another take on this is to celebrate your salon\u2019s birthday, with a week or month of a certain promotion.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/salon-birthday-marketing.png\" alt=\"Salon Birthday Marketing\" width=\"602\" height=\"315\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>15. Carry Business Cards<\/h2>\n<p>Salon Marketing 101: be your own greatest advertisement. Ever have a stranger compliment your hair or nails on the subway or while shopping? Not only is it flattering, it is the perfect opportunity to say, \u201cThank you! I did it myself, here is my business card if you\u2019re interested in the same treatment!\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>16. Produce Video Content<\/h2>\n<p>This may sound silly, but content can be anything from silly blog posts about nightmare makeovers and rushed events to tutorial videos. If your staff is staying up to date with new trends and constantly getting new certifications, use their knowledge to become an expert for your audience. Something as simple as \u201cHow to Properly Trim Your Bangs\u201d will get your name out there\u2014and you can welcome anyone who needs further assistance with that bang trim.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/mKA3Imbq_dY?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2>17. Host Parties<\/h2>\n<p>This might be the most fun salon marketing tip! Hosting pamper parties; for charity, for a birthday or bachelorette; can be a great opportunity to bond with your clients and get the word out about your salon.<\/p>\n<p>Have any salon marketing tips that we missed?
