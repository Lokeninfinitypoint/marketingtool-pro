Include promos in headlines and descriptions<\/h2>\n<p>The most straightforward way to include your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/03\/ad-copy-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">promotions in your ad copy<\/a> is to use them as part of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/05\/responsive-search-ad-copy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">headlines and descriptions<\/a>. All you have to do is craft your promotional message, keep it within the character limits, and click apply. But while this is certainly the easiest option, there are some things to keep in mind before tossing promotions into existing ad copies.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/promos-in-google-ads-ad-copy-measurement.webp\" alt=\"promos in google ads - ad copy testing measurement example\" width=\"743\" height=\"123\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84648 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/promos-in-google-ads-ad-copy-measurement.webp 743w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/promos-in-google-ads-ad-copy-measurement-480x79.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 743px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>First, every time you change a headline or description in an existing ad you\u2019ll reset the ad statistics back to zero. You\u2019re essentially creating a new ad each time you make these edits. If you\u2019ve put together a well-thought-out<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/03\/how-to-write-exceptional-ppc-ad-copy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> ad copy strategy<\/a>, this can be a problem because you\u2019re trying to find which ad performs best, and having all the stats reset to zero for one or all the ads isn\u2019t conducive to getting a final answer.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/how-to-include-promos-in-google-ads-ad-copy-test.webp\" alt=\"promos in google ads - ad copy testing example\" width=\"895\" height=\"173\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84649 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/how-to-include-promos-in-google-ads-ad-copy-test.webp 895w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/how-to-include-promos-in-google-ads-ad-copy-test-480x93.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 895px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Rather than editing the existing ad creative, it might make more sense to create a new copy variant that retains some of the control ad copy from your existing ad but also incorporates your promotion into headlines and descriptions. This way you have a line item for your promotional copy and retain the existing ad creative so once your promotional period is over that control creative will take over all impressions again and retain all of it from before without any interruption.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you decide to incorporate promotional copy into existing and creative or write new, be sure to pay attention to any of the pinned assets you have in that ad creative. Don\u2019t forget that pinning assets to certain locations means that message will only show in that location. Additionally, not pinning assets into placements that already have other assets pinned means your promotional copy may not show at all. Be sure you\u2019re paying attention to that.<\/p>\n<div id=\"headlines-and-descriptions\"><\/div>\n<h2>2. Use headline and description assets<\/h2>\n<p>There is an alternative tactic to get promotional messaging into ad headlines and descriptions that I actually prefer over adding it directly into your ad copy. This uses the headline and description assets that <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/august-social-media-holidays\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google<\/a> has recently rolled out.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/promos-in-google-ads-ad-headline.jpg\" alt=\"promos in google ads - headline assets\" width=\"664\" height=\"451\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84658 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/promos-in-google-ads-ad-headline.jpg 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/promos-in-google-ads-ad-headline-480x326.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>These live in the &#8220;assets&#8221; portion of the interface and they allow you to write headlines and descriptions that live outside of your ad creative, then substitute into your ad copy for any of the ad creatives in the campaign that asset is applied to. Currently, these are only applicable at the campaign level.<\/p>\n<p>The text fields are the same as they would be in the ad copy themselves and as you can see in the image above, you have the option to pin these assets into a location. Just like before, the same rules apply to pinning, so make sure you know how pinning these assets will impact your existing ad messaging.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/promos-in-google-ads-ad-schedule.jpg\" alt=\"promos in google ads - asset scheduling\" width=\"664\" height=\"381\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84660 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/promos-in-google-ads-ad-schedule.jpg 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/promos-in-google-ads-ad-schedule-480x275.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>One of my favorite things about these assets is that you can schedule them to run during certain periods of time. During things like, oh I don\u2019t know, a promotional period?<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/promos-in-google-ads-ad-headlines.webp\" alt=\"promos in google ads - headline asset report table\" width=\"894\" height=\"206\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84652 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/promos-in-google-ads-ad-headlines.webp 894w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/promos-in-google-ads-ad-headlines-480x111.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 894px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Just like other assets, you can see the performance on individual line items for these headlines and descriptions in the Assets tab, giving you great insight into which promotional copy works best and only seeing the numbers for when these messages showed, not when the entire responsive search ad they were included in showed up.<\/p>\n<p>Personally, I think these assets are perfect for incorporating promotional messaging into ad copy for promotional periods. I would highly suggest using these assets rather than incorporating messaging directly into your responsive search ads whenever possible.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udea8 <strong>Looking for more ways to optimize your Google Ads?<\/strong> Get an instant read on key metrics within your account using our free <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-adwords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_AWGrader_AWGrader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads Grader<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-promotion-assets\"><\/div>\n<h2>3. Try promotional assets<\/h2>\n<p>Headlines and descriptions aren\u2019t the only asset types available for including promotional messages.<\/p>\n<p>By the name, these were clearly developed exactly for the type of use we\u2019re talking about. They\u2019re pretty easy to set up, but let\u2019s give a quick rundown.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-ads-price-asset-options.jpg\" alt=\"google ads promos - price asset options \" width=\"321\" height=\"588\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84661 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-ads-price-asset-options.jpg 321w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-ads-price-asset-options-164x300.jpg 164w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 321px) 100vw, 321px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>First, you can apply promotion assets at the account, campaign, or ad group level, giving a little more control than the headlines and descriptions from before.<\/p>\n<p>Then, you get to choose your occasion. There\u2019s a pretty long list of options to choose from and the image I have above only goes through the letter \u201cD\u201d in the list. If you don\u2019t see anything in there you like, there is a \u201cNone\u201d option you can select.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-ads-promotion-asset-choices.jpg\" alt=\"google ads promotion assets - choices for asset types\" width=\"664\" height=\"447\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84662 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-ads-promotion-asset-choices.jpg 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-ads-promotion-asset-choices-480x323.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>After you\u2019ve set the language and currency, you can select what type of promotion this will be from the list above.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-ads-promotion-assets-.jpg\" alt=\"google ads promotion assets - final url settings\" width=\"664\" height=\"307\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84663 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-ads-promotion-assets-.jpg 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-ads-promotion-assets--480x222.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Then comes the actual copy portion of the promo. Here you\u2019ll write the item and provide the link to the page. These messages only have 20 characters available, so you\u2019ll need to be succinct.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-ads-promotion-assets-promo-code.webp\" alt=\"google ads promotion assets - promo details options\" width=\"404\" height=\"424\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84654 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-ads-promotion-assets-promo-code.webp 404w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-ads-promotion-assets-promo-code-286x300.webp 286w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Next is the requirements section. Do you have a minimum order size or certain promo code users need to have to get this discount? If so, that information should be added here.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-ads-promotion-asset-scheduling.webp\" alt=\"google ads promotion asset - asset schedule settings \" width=\"520\" height=\"493\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84653 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-ads-promotion-asset-scheduling.webp 520w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-ads-promotion-asset-scheduling-480x455.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 520px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Lastly, just like the headlines and descriptions assets, these promotional assets can be scheduled to run on certain dates, but in the &#8220;advanced options&#8221; dropdown, you\u2019ll see you can add a schedule to these as well. If you need to only have your messaging run for a portion of the day, then this would be where you can apply those parameters.<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-price-assets\"><\/div>\n<h2>4. Leverage price assets<\/h2>\n<p>The other <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/25\/google-ads-extensions-guide\">Google Ads asset type<\/a> you can use is the price asset. While these might not have been developed specifically for promotional times, you can adjust them to include your promotional messaging.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-ads-price-assets.webp\" alt=\"promos in google ads - price asset screenshot\" width=\"630\" height=\"592\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84655 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-ads-price-assets.webp 630w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/google-ads-price-assets-480x451.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 630px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When you create a new price asset, you can apply it to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/10\/google-ads-account-structure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">account, campaign, or ad group level<\/a>, you get to add in some housekeeping information including currency and language, and then a couple of new sections. Types will be the same list of headers as structured snippets, but the price qualifier is the most interesting thing to me here. You can choose the lead-in text for the price you\u2019re planning to set in the asset itself from the drop-down listed above. Choose the one that makes sense for the promo you\u2019re offering.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/promos-in-google-ads-price-asset-options.webp\" alt=\"promos in google ads - price asset example\" width=\"410\" height=\"511\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84656 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/promos-in-google-ads-price-asset-options.webp 410w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/promos-in-google-ads-price-asset-options-241x300.webp 241w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Then for each price asset, you have the same fields to work with, just like you would adding a series of sitelink assets. First, add in a header with 25 characters, then set the price, then choose the unit that the price applies to, which I\u2019ve shown in the dropdown above. Then add in a description with another 25 characters, then a final URL.<\/p>\n<p>These headers and descriptors can be the place where you add in those promo messages that apply to your offer, then use the other fields to show off how much of a discount you\u2019re providing.<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-sitelink-assets\"><\/div>\n<h2>5. Add a sitelink for dedicated landing pages<\/h2>\n<p>Some companies I work with have an entire page on their website dedicated to their existing promotional offers. If you constantly have different sales going on for different products or services, maybe certain departments or regions of the country, these evergreen pages can be a great asset to use for sitelinks since they send users to an entirely different page on your website but still allow you to add in one headline and two expanded subscriptions that can help fill out your site link suggested minimum.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/promos-in-google-ads-sitelinks.webp\" alt=\"promos in google ads - sitelink asset screenshot\" width=\"347\" height=\"416\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84657 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/promos-in-google-ads-sitelinks.webp 347w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/promos-in-google-ads-sitelinks-250x300.webp 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 347px) 100vw, 347px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If your promotions regularly change you might want to use text that is a little more evergreen like \u201cSee Our Offers\u201d or \u201cSee What\u2019s On Sale\u201d rather than trying to call out specific promotions simply because the ever-changing nature might be difficult to keep up with. But if you have a monthly sale or a biweekly sale, it might be easier for you to keep up with those manually and make adjustments to the site accordingly to call out specific promotions that you\u2019re in at the time.<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-performance-max-asset-groups\"><\/div>\n<h2>6. Create new asset groups in Performance Max with promo messaging<\/h2>\n<p>Similar to Responsive Search Ads in search campaigns, with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-performance-max-updates-2024\">Performance Max campaigns<\/a>, it might be best for you to create entirely new asset groups that include your promotional messaging (whether through text, images, or video) to call out the promotional rather than adjusting your existing asset group, so as not to disturb its performance.<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-display-and-video-promos\"><\/div>\n<h2>7. Leverage banner display ads and video ads where possible<\/h2>\n<p>Search and Performance Max campaigns are not the only campaign types you can use in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-query-matching-updates\">Google Ads<\/a>. Don\u2019t forget about great brand awareness and interest-building campaigns like display and YouTube where you can leverage banner ads and video to attract new customers to your site or retain business from existing customers via<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-remarketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> remarketing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/promos-in-google-ads-banner-ads.jpg\" alt=\"promos in google ads - display ad sizes\" width=\"664\" height=\"484\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84664 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/promos-in-google-ads-banner-ads.jpg 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/promos-in-google-ads-banner-ads-480x350.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For these campaign types, you can use banner ads for the display network, and banners for YouTube, plus, you can use any video that you created for YouTube and use it as creative in your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/03\/how-to-advertise-on-youtube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube campaign<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The benefits here are that you\u2019re always creating a new line item that is separate from the existing ad creative. You\u2019re not updating existing messaging, you&#8217;re simply adding to the mix and including your promotional messaging as banners or videos for a portion of the impressions you\u2019re serving from that campaign. You\u2019ll have performance data where you can see your evergreen messaging compared to your promotional, assuming you keep the evergreen messaging active, and once you turn your promotional off, you\u2019ll go right back to where you were with existing messaging to your<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> target audience<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Promote your business with Google Ads today<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/google-ads-scripts\">Google Ads<\/a> is an excellent platform to get your promotion out to your existing audience and, although it might seem like there\u2019s a right and wrong way to do it, as long as you incorporate it in your messaging and don\u2019t throw away your existing ad copy testing, you should be just fine.
