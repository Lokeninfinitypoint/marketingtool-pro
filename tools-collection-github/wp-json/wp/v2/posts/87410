Detailed targeting audience options<\/h3>\n<p>The most specific targeting options available to<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-run-facebook-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> advertisers on the Facebook platform<\/a> are in the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/scale-meta-ads-with-first-party-data\"><strong> detailed targeting<\/strong><\/a> section. Here, we have four different types of targeting we can use along with a few caveats that I\u2019ll talk about throughout.<\/p>\n<div id=\"facebook-ad-targeting-age-gender\"><\/div>\n<h4>Age and gender Facebook ad targeting<\/h4>\n<p>These are the most foundational demographic targets on Facebook and are pretty straightforward. You\u2019re able to target users down to the single year digit of their age as well as whether they\u2019re male, female, or all genders.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ad-targeting-age-and-gender.webp\" alt=\"facebook ad targeting -age and gender targeting options screenshot\" width=\"570\" height=\"310\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87467 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ad-targeting-age-and-gender.webp 570w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ad-targeting-age-and-gender-480x261.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 570px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This information is provided by the users themselves when they sign up for Facebook, so nothing too mystical going on here, but it\u2019s not really fact-checked either. So, there may be some harmless fudging of ages here and there, but for the most part, this is pretty solid information.<\/p>\n<div id=\"facebook-ad-targeting-demographics\"><\/div>\n<h4>Demographics Facebook ad targeting<\/h4>\n<p>While age and gender are technically demographic information, the following demographics Facebook ad targeting section has the option to take things a step further. In that same &#8220;Detailed targeting&#8221; section, if you click &#8220;browse&#8221; on the right, you\u2019ll then see a dropdown with the main categories of &#8220;Demographics, Interests, and Behaviors&#8221;. We\u2019ll get to the other two shortly, but for now, we\u2019re going to focus on the items below &#8220;Demographics.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ads-targeting-detailed-demographics.webp\" alt=\"facebook ads targeting - demographics overall choices screenshot\" width=\"711\" height=\"476\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87476 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ads-targeting-detailed-demographics.webp 711w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ads-targeting-detailed-demographics-480x321.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 711px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There are tons of different options for you to narrow your audience based on who they are: education level, parental status, work details, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Some of this data is provided by the users themselves when they update their profiles, which is pretty straightforward. But a good chunk of it is also interpreted by Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>As Facebook says below, detailed targeting options can be based on several factors. It looks at ads users click on, pages they engage with, and other activities across Meta, along with the demographics users themselves provide and the mobile device and connection speed they\u2019re using.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ad-targeting-detailed-options.webp\" alt=\"facebook ad targeting - detailed targeting definition\" width=\"719\" height=\"326\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87465 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ad-targeting-detailed-options.webp 719w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ad-targeting-detailed-options-480x218.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 719px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As you dig further into these targeting options, you\u2019ll find that some of these are pretty robust while others are pretty sparse. For example, the image below is the financial section and it\u2019s only based on the average incomes for zip codes in the US. That means it\u2019s averaged data, which by its nature isn\u2019t accurate to a person and is only available for people targeting users in the United States.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ads-targeting-demographics.webp\" alt=\"facebook ads targeting - demographics dropdown\" width=\"754\" height=\"363\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87466 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ads-targeting-demographics.webp 754w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ads-targeting-demographics-480x231.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 754px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"facebook-ad-targeting-interests\"><\/div>\n<h4>Interests<\/h4>\n<p>The other two detailed targeting options beyond age, gender, and demographics are interests and behaviors. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/13\/facebook-interest-targeting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Interest and behavior Facebook audiences<\/a> are developed in the same way as the demographics listed above, but their options are quite a bit different.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Interests<\/strong> focus on the topics that users like based on the types of content they\u2019ve engaged with in the past, including events, pages they\u2019ve liked, and more.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ad-targeting-interests.webp\" alt=\"facebook ad targeting -interests\" width=\"610\" height=\"561\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87475 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ad-targeting-interests.webp 610w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ad-targeting-interests-480x441.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 610px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you open the dropdown in the Meta Ads Manager campaign builder, you\u2019ll see there\u2019s a very wide range of interest topics to target and all of these have subcategories as well.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ad-targeting-interest-options.webp\" alt=\"facebook ad targeting - interests drop down\" width=\"714\" height=\"371\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87469 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ad-targeting-interest-options.webp 714w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ad-targeting-interest-options-480x249.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 714px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Rather than browsing the dropdowns, you may find it more efficient to simply start typing in things you think your target audience is interested in and see what shows up. For example, if I search for hiking, I can see all the options that come up that match that interest.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ad-targeting-example.webp\" alt=\"facebook ad targeting - interest search example\" width=\"729\" height=\"435\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87468 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ad-targeting-example.webp 729w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ad-targeting-example-480x286.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 729px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Additionally, searching can uncover many topics that don\u2019t live in the dropdowns.

There\u2019s everything from &#8220;new business users&#8221; to &#8220;gaming activities&#8221; to other traits like preferred Facebook and Instagram shop payment types or travel behaviors.

Facebook ad lookalike audience targeting<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/facebook-lookalike-audiences\">Lookalike audiences<\/a> have been the bread and butter of Facebook ad targeting strategies for quite a long time. I think it\u2019s only in recent years that I\u2019ve heard them waning at all for certain advertisers, some of them preferring the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/meta-advantage-vs-manual-settings\"> Advantage+ Audience<\/a> (which we\u2019ll talk about shortly), but that doesn\u2019t mean lookalike audiences don\u2019t still work well in many accounts.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/how-to-advertise-on-facebook\">Facebook ads<\/a> lookalike audiences are pretty straightforward. First, you give Facebook a source audience, and then the platform analyzes that list and creates a persona. After that, Facebook puts together an audience of users whose behaviors and interests &#8220;look like,&#8221; or in other words, are similar to, that persona for you to target with your campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>The source audience is an integral part of seeing success with lookalike audiences. In the image below, you can see all the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/01\/facebook-audiences\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">types of custom audiences advertisers can create on Facebook<\/a>. Any of these custom audiences can be used as a source for a lookalike audience.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ad-targeting-custom-audience.webp\" alt=\"facebook ad targeting - how to create a custom audience\" width=\"701\" height=\"545\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87473 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ad-targeting-custom-audience.webp 701w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ad-targeting-custom-audience-480x373.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 701px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re ready to create a lookalike audience, you get to choose the source audience, and then identify which country of users you want to target. Lastly, you get to select the percentage match you\u2019d like to use. On the small end, you have a 1% match, meaning you\u2019ll target 1% of the population of the location you selected above that looks the most like your source audience. As you choose higher and higher percentages, the size of your audience increases by a factor of that location\u2019s population.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ad-targeting-lookalike-audience.webp\" alt=\"facebook ad targeting - custom audience size\" width=\"707\" height=\"614\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-87474 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ad-targeting-lookalike-audience.webp 707w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/facebook-ad-targeting-lookalike-audience-480x417.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 707px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Your source audience must match at least 100 users in a single country, but they recommend an audience between 1,000 to 5,000 users.
