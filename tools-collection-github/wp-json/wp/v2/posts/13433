It\u2019s one of my favorite things, and I like to think that my\u00a0past-self bought a gift for my future-self. I usually don\u2019t remember <em>why<\/em> my past-self bought the gift in the first place, because most of the time I bought it spur-of-the-moment. Dang persuasive ads.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/persuasive-ads-coca-cola-1.jpg\" alt=\"Coke ad with sunshine and happiness\" width=\"720\" height=\"340\" class=\"aligncenter skip-lazy\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But not all persuasive ads are created equally, and not all of them lead to delightful surprises. Here are 13 of the best, most effective persuasive ads we\u2019ve ever seen\u2014but first let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re clear on what persuasive ads do and why you\u2019d want to use them.<\/p>\n<h2>What is a persuasive ad, anyway?<\/h2>\n<p>Persuasive ads are advertisements designed to elicit a desired action, usually purchasing a product. Remember the persuasive essay assignments from school? In those, you were writing to convince your reader. Persuasive ads are similar\u2014they aim to convince potential customers to buy the featured product.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re advertising a product, this technique is powerful. Persuasion can be used in almost any of your marketing campaign\u2014across television, digital, print, audio, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/26\/out-of-home-advertising\">billboards<\/a>, even PPC. We looked far and wide across all of these mediums for the best examples of persuasive ads, and we rounded up 13 ads that are exceptionally persuasive. Let\u2019s take a look at what these ads are doing well and, most importantly, how you can use these techniques in your own ads.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Streeteasy: Find your place<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/persuasive-ads-street-easy.jpg\" alt=\"Streeteasy subway ad\" width=\"716\" height=\"329\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Streeteasy used the \u201cFind your place\u201d campaign to advertise their New York real estate mobile app. The campaign was posted all over subways throughout the city and highlighted sections of the city in a relatable way, because finding a place to live makes everyone feel a little bit like Goldilocks.<\/p>\n<h3>Why it works<\/h3>\n<p>This campaign had a subtle, inside joke quality to it\u2014everyone gets wanting to live within walking distance from your job\u2014but also needing to be far enough away from your coworkers. Streeteasy leaned into the *nudge, wink* feeling of solidarity between city dwellers to evoke humor in the face of a daunting task: finding a new place to live.<\/p>\n<h3>How to do it<\/h3>\n<p>What makes your product a great solution? What annoying problems does it solve? Lean into that. People are constantly looking for ways to make their lives easier; use your ads to persuade them your product will do exactly that.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udcda\u00a0<strong>Free guide download<\/strong>\u00a0&gt;&gt;\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download\">The Best Call to Action Phrases Ever (&amp; Why They Work)<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>2. Curio.io: Most Interesting Person<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/persuasive-ads-curio.io_.jpg\" alt=\"Curio.io Instagram ad\" width=\"525\" height=\"671\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Similar to daily newsletters, Curio is an audio-journalism app that is also trying to make your life easier. Now, you don\u2019t even have to open an email to get a condensed version of the news! You can simply listen to it on your commute (NPR, you\u2019ve got competition).<\/p>\n<h3>Why it works<\/h3>\n<p>This ad has a lot going on. Not only is it video-based, with captions (as all video ads should be), it also includes a review and summary of the app in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/14\/writing-ad-copy-at-scale\">ad copy<\/a>. You\u2019re getting hit from all directions with a ton of great reasons to download Curio.<\/p>\n<h3>How to do it<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s pretty easy to let your customers speak for you: Take this move from Curio and include a customer review in the copy. Or, even better, use it as the ad itself. Most importantly, though, Curio tells you upfront why you need this app: You\u2019ll immediately become the most interesting person in the room. Make your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">value prop<\/a> personal, and make it clear in the ad.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Revolve: If you love it, buy it &lt;3<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/persuasive-ads-revolve.jpg\" alt=\"Revolve Instagram ad\" width=\"525\" height=\"842\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Confession: I get hit with these ads from Revolve <em>constantly<\/em>. Do I have an online shopping problem? Define \u201cproblem.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Why it works<\/h3>\n<p>The most persuasive part of this ad is the copy: \u201cif you love it, buy it &lt;3 (before someone else does).\u201d Yes, the carousel of pretty clothes is great, but the copy creates a sense of urgency and appeals to a desire to be a part of a community. I have terrible FOMO and have to buy it before someone else does and wears my perfect outfit!<\/p>\n<h3>How to do it<\/h3>\n<p>This ad does double duty, persuading you to convert by appealing to the viewer\u2019s desire to be a part of a community and fear of missing out on that opportunity. Fear might not always be the best angle for every brand, but for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/03\/fashion-marketing\">fashion marketing<\/a>\u2014or if you\u2019re selling, say, bear mace\u2014this is right up your alley.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 <strong>Want to learn all about search engine marketing on Google?<\/strong> Get the free guide &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLPPC101.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_PPC101_Download\">PPC 101: Complete Guide to Google Ads<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>4. Crave App: Save Money<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/persuasive-ads-crave-app.jpg\" alt=\"Crave App Instagram ad\" width=\"473\" height=\"680\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Crave created a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/04\/instagram-videos\">video-based Instagram ad<\/a> that looks and feels like user-generated content, maybe even something a food blogger would post. In this ad, you follow someone for five meals, watching as they get discount after discount on their food.<\/p>\n<h3>Why it works<\/h3>\n<p>The persuasion in this ad isn\u2019t very nuanced: The ad shows you exactly how to use the app and how much money you\u2019ll save. Logical, right? That\u2019s the simple, effective appeal here.<\/p>\n<h3>How to do it<\/h3>\n<p>If your product is cheaper than other options out there, you\u2019re in luck. You can persuade people with a logical display of how your option costs less money\u2014or maybe even saves people money, like Crave. Show your audience that your product will not better their life, but will also better their bank account.<\/p>\n<h2>5. OTTO Greenpoint: Endless Amenities<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/persuasive-ads-OTTO-greenpoint.jpg\" alt=\"OTTO Greenpoint Instagram ad\" width=\"525\" height=\"934\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Like Streeteasy, OTTO is advertising a place to live. Unlike Streeteasy, though, it\u2019s actually an apartment complex. That means OTTO can show off beautiful rooms and comfortable-looking beds in its advertisements.<\/p>\n<h3>Why it works<\/h3>\n<p>Imagine loving your apartment so much that you never wanted to leave? This advertisement persuades their audience that the \u201cendless amenities and laid-back atmosphere\u201d of their complex will make you want to stick around (forever!?).<\/p>\n<h3>How to do it<\/h3>\n<p>This campaign definitely evokes a feeling of laziness, comfort, and sloth. Don\u2019t miss the kitschy, \u201cA freak in the streets, asleep in the sheets\u201d graphic poster behind the bed. Duplicate this persuasive ad by showing your audience your product\u2019s soft, lazy side that just wants to watch Netflix all day.<\/p>\n<p>Now I\u2019m dreading going home to my own non-air-conditioned apartment&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>6. Burger King: Shadow Campaign<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/persuasive-ads-burger-king-shadow-campaign.jpg\" alt=\"Burger King shadow campaign Tweet\" width=\"749\" height=\"453\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This might be one of my favorite ad campaigns ever. A few years ago, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eater.com\/2017\/10\/12\/16463830\/burger-king-promoted-tweets-wendys-spicy-nuggets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Burger King quietly waged a war<\/a> by promoting people\u2019s tweets complaining about Wendy\u2019s. It resulted in hilarity\u2014and probably a lot of Whopper purchases.<\/p>\n<h3>Why it works<\/h3>\n<p>Burger King didn\u2019t have to do much leg work on this one. In case you\u2019re wondering how they promoted other people\u2019s tweets, <a href=\"https:\/\/blitzmetrics.com\/twitter-has-a-secret-feature\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter will let you do this if you get permission from the user!<\/a> These ads definitely got some laughs over this. And, with this campaign, Burger King let customers\u2014albeit disgruntled ones\u2014do the talking, which gives a bit more weight to the message.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc40 <strong>Looking for more ways to promote your business?<\/strong> Download now &gt;&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite30BestWaysToPromote.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Marketing_The30BestWaysToPromoteYourBusiness_Download\">30+ Ways to Promote Your Business (On Any Budget!)<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>How to do it<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re feeling bold, check out the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/02\/social-media-crisis-management\">complaints on social media<\/a> aimed at your direct competitor.

This silly commercial is part of Heinz\u2019s ad campaign in the UK right now, where the company is attempting to get ketchup just as popular there as it is in the US.<\/p>\n<h3>Why it works<\/h3>\n<p>Ed Sheeran charming, and he narrates the commercial as though it\u2019s a pitch. The effect makes it feel like you\u2019re watching a movie clip instead of an ad. He convinces you that all the \u201cposh\u201d food and sauces are nothing without his backpack-based Heinz.<\/p>\n<h3>How to do it<\/h3>\n<p>If your brand is big enough\u2014or lucky enough\u2014to have a fan like Ed Sheeran, you should be all set. However, if your celebrity fanbase is a bit smaller, think about working with influencers. Persuasive ads are usually very on-brand for social media personalities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pro tip:<\/strong> Find an influencer that\u2019s more niche. That way, you can target a specific audience you\u2019re looking to convert, often at a lower cost.<\/p>\n<h2>8.

For some terribly relatable, Gen-Z-focused content, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/HP\/status\/1159881709283729409\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">watch the video<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Why it works<\/h3>\n<p>This ad is specifically targeting the fact that you can flip a switch and turn your computer\u2019s camera off (no need for those tiny, attachable shades anymore), which means you can be anywhere with your computer &#8230; but no one can see you. It persuades you that having an HP computer means that you\u2019re safe and sound being completely yourself.<\/p>\n<h3>How to do it<\/h3>\n<p>This is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/15\/audience-targeting\">targeted at a specific audience<\/a>, which is a good thing to keep in mind when brainstorming persuasive ads. Think about a concern your audience has about your product and show them why it\u2019s a non-issue.<\/p>\n<h2>9. Clorox: Trusted by Moms<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/persuasive-ads-trusted-by-moms.jpg\" alt=\"Clorox Google Display ad\" width=\"308\" height=\"607\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This little display ad has been following me around since my mom came to visit me. Go figure.<\/p>\n<h3>Why it works<\/h3>\n<p>Not only does this display advertisement boast that Clorox is trusted by moms generally, they added a review from \u201csydney2\u201d (presumably a mom) at the bottom. This is reminiscent of basically any paper towel or cleaning product commercial\u2014moms know best when it comes to cleaning up after messy, tiny humans.<\/p>\n<h3>How to do it<\/h3>\n<p>Think about the main demographic using your product. If you\u2019re selling running sneakers, it\u2019s easy to say \u201cTrusted by two million runners,\u201d assuming you\u2019ve sold two million pairs of shoes. Brag about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/27\/trust-signals\">who trusts your product<\/a> to persuade more people to trust it. Simple!<\/p>\n<h2>10. Parachute: Go back to bed<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/persuasive-ads-parachute.jpg\" alt=\"Parachute billboard\" width=\"708\" height=\"467\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is one of my favorite out of home advertisements. Parachute ran a campaign basically reminding us all that we\u2019d rather not be on a city street but at home, in bed.<\/p>\n<h3>Why it works<\/h3>\n<p>Relatable\u00a0content at its best: Who hasn\u2019t hit the snooze button and mumbled, \u201cjust five more minutes\u201d? Parachute is literally persuading people to spend more time in bed sleeping. Everyone loves sleep.<\/p>\n<h3>How to do it<\/h3>\n<p>Think about how your product provides a universal good. Be brutally simple\u2014and glorify that simplicity. Does it satiate your hunger? Keep you dry on a rainy day? Make your audience yearn for that feeling.<\/p>\n<h2>11. The Palm: \u201crestaurant reservations nyc\u201d<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/persuasive-ads-the-palm-nyc.jpg\" alt=\"Google search ad\" width=\"597\" height=\"135\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is an interesting one\u2014I stumbled on this ad when I googled \u201crestaurant reservations nyc,\u201d expecting to see ads from OpenTable, Resy, Seated, or other similar reservation-booking platforms.<\/p>\n<h3>Why it works<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019m a big fan of the line, \u201cWherever you join us, The Palm will always feel like home.\u201d The Palm has three locations in New York (and one in JFK airport). New York City can be a big scary place, but The Palm is confident it can be your home away from home, a safe place to relax.<\/p>\n<h3>How to do it<\/h3>\n<p>This ad is persuasive because it makes the unfamiliar familiar. Sometimes buying a new product can be scary. (I have older family members who are terrified to buy a new brand of orange juice, for instance.) Give your audience a level of comfort with your product that will <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/05\/02\/persuasive-copywriting-tips\">persuade them to covert<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>12. Pizza Hut: Cheesy Bites<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/persuasive-ads-pizza-hut.jpg\" alt=\"Pizza Hut search ad\" width=\"622\" height=\"303\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Okay, I know you\u2019re thinking, \u201cReally? Two food-related ads?!\u201d But I\u2019m a hungry person, and I\u2019m passionate about pizza. And I saw this advertisement on (drumroll, please) \u2026 BING!<\/p>\n<h3>Why it works<\/h3>\n<p>I don\u2019t know a single person on this planet that would turn down cheese-filled bites delivered to their door (okay, maybe psychopaths).This text ad pulls out all the stops. It stresses convenience, time-sensitive promotions, and options galore. How could you not click through?!<\/p>\n<h3>How to do it<\/h3>\n<p>While sometimes you want to provide a simple solution to a simple problem, this ad provides a plethora of options to solve a simple problem (pizza delivery near me). Play to people\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/28\/pain-points\">pain points<\/a> or weaknesses, like hunger, to convince them that they need your product\u2014like right now.<\/p>\n<h2>13. Lyft: We\u2019ll get you there<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/persuasive-ads-lyft.jpg\" alt=\"Lyft billboard\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is an interesting ad, because it\u2019s not *really* an ad. It is aimed toward Lyft drivers, instead of passengers, as a nod to their \u201cother lives,\u201d or the reasons that they drive for Lyft. Maybe they\u2019re caretakers, aspiring actors, or people just trying to make ends meet through a side hustle.<\/p>\n<h3>Why it works<\/h3>\n<p>It works because it gave Lyft an opportunity to show their support for their own employees. Yes, I know in the beginning I said no branding in true persuasive ads. This one is just doing double duty. The ad is persuading people to become Lyft drivers by thanking their current drivers.<\/p>\n<h3>How to do it<\/h3>\n<p>Take the time to celebrate your own employees, the people behind your wonderful products. With so many new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/17\/direct-to-consumer-marketing\">direct-to-consumer brands<\/a> out there, your audience wants to know that you\u2019re a real company, offering real products, made by real people. Show them that.<\/p>\n<h2>Go persuade some customers<\/h2>\n<p>Persuasive ads can feel like they need a lot of <em>production<\/em> and <em>effort<\/em>.
