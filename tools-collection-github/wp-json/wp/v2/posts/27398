Wait, what now? You\u2019re <em>not<\/em> using ad customizers? Well then in you\u2019re in for a real treat! Ad customizers are about to hit their one-year anniversary (<a href=\"http:\/\/adwords.blogspot.com\/2014\/09\/customized-creatives-at-scale.html\">Google announced<\/a> their birth in September of 2014), and advertisers that have embraced them could not be happier.<\/p>\n<p>What are they? Ad customizers dynamically update your ad without you having to move a muscle. This is ideal for the busy search marketer (as well as marketers with lots of changing inventory) who doesn\u2019t want to have to manually hunt through their Google Ads\u00a0adjusting prices, products, and special offerings. Customizers use parameters to adjust the text of your ad for countdowns, dynamic keywords (think colors, sizes, styles etc.), promotions, one-time or reoccurring events.<\/p>\n<p>The scope of things you can do with ad customizers is impressive, but the three techniques below are especially <em>cool<\/em>. Check them out\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>#1: Run Remarketing Sales Countdowns<\/h2>\n<p>Ad customizers have a countdown function, which allows you to create a strong sense of urgency within your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/20\/ppc-ad-copy\">ad to psychologically intrigue<\/a> your searcher through loss aversion, better known as FOMO (fear of missing out). Most marketers are aware that instilling this fear of missing out on a deal increases a leads likelihood of taking actions, so yes this automatic countdown feature is pretty intriguing. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re running a 50% of promotion on ski rentals \u2013 wouldn\u2019t you want your on-the-fence buyers to know when the sale is going to end in 6 days or 1 hour? <strong>Ad customizers allow you to automate this countdown functionality<\/strong> \u2013 it\u2019s pretty awesome.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4bdf2e27-d912-4180-93e4-a80f262567ce\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-customizers-example.png\" alt=\"Ad customizers countdown example\" width=\"620\" height=\"92\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Recently I was researching options for fall half marathons in nearby Boston. I browsed a few race websites, read a few reviews, but decided to hold off on registering. Later in the week when I was looking up dinner recipes, I saw an ad promoting a 20% discount for one of the races in a nearby suburb. Since I only had 3 more days to take advantage of the low offer I took the plunge to register.<\/p>\n<p>This scenario is a prime example of an even more effective way to use ad customizers \u2013 by pairing them with your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/12\/04\/adwords-remarketing-best-practices-guide\">remarketing efforts<\/a> to even further the chances of conversions. Think about it, if the lead has already visited your site, and you know they\u2019re interested, reminding them that there\u2019s a deal that\u2019s ending soon when they\u2019re browsing the web is likely to re-captivate their attention and persuade them to buy before it\u2019s too late.<\/p>\n<h2>#2: Mix and Match Customizer Parameters<\/h2>\n<p>There are so many things one can customize in an ad, from the brand, model, price, discount, and the list goes on. The great thing about ad customizers is that <strong>you\u2019re not limited to one per ad<\/strong>. Let\u2019s say you sell multiple brands of kitchen mixers with varying prices and offerings; rather than having to make a unique ad for each brand, price, and model, you can use multiple ad customizer to create an accurate ad for each unique search.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"10899f08-b8fa-4d63-800f-772c90419045\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-customizers-brand.png\" alt=\"Ad customizers example of using multiple parameters \" width=\"659\" height=\"125\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>\u201cYou can mix and match different ad customizer parameters to create a unique, time sensitive or inventory sensitive ad that strokes that all-important urgency fire that your visitors may have in trying to find the best product for the lowest prices,\u201d says <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.crazyegg.com\/2014\/12\/24\/google-adwords-ad-customizers\/\">Elite Group Marketing\u2019s<\/a>, Gary Victory.<\/p>\n<h2>#3: Bulk Upload for Multi-Product Sales<\/h2>\n<p>This takes the last tip to the next level for the larger retailer or e-commerce site with inventory that is constantly changing. Tweaking each ad for weekly or even daily promotions or price fluctuations can become a full-time job in itself. Luckily, advertisers using Google Shopping can easily upload their product lists with the appropriate discounts and sales with end dates to ensure customers are never misled on changes in price. When updates need to be made, all you have to do is make the adjustments in the spreadsheet, re-upload it into Google\u2019s ad customizer data section of Google Ads (formerly known as AdWords)\u00a0to ensure the adjustments are put into effect.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1b5b89a4-8961-4d69-9e81-08e89a54c805\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-customizers-shoe.png\" alt=\"Ad customizers example of excel with multiple products \" width=\"984\" height=\"567\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Have you tried out ad customizers?
