Because \u201cpassively reading articles or watching videos\u201d is bad for human beings, Facebook is pivoting its core away from its current state (inescapable time suck) and towards becoming a platform that helps users have \u201cmore meaningful social interactions.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Great for humans, bad for (most) brands.<\/p>\n<h2>How is the Facebook News Feed Changing?<\/h2>\n<p>Per Zuckerberg\u2019s post, the goal of the News Feed is moving from \u201chelping you find relevant content\u201d to enabling those meaningful social experiences I mentioned before. As such, the litany of posts from news outlets and the brands you love (or love to hate) whose content you passively consume will be usurped by updates from your friends, family, and groups.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"60601577-3b6e-49b9-bab6-0fe4712e8cd4\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-news-feed-changes1-1.png\" alt=\"facebook news feed changes impact smb advertisers\" width=\"800\" height=\"864\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This doesn\u2019t mean branded content and\u2014more importantly as far as I\u2019m concerned\u2014ads are going away; they\u2019re simply taking a back seat in one of Facebook\u2019s myriad placements.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/larry-kim\/rip-facebook-news-feed-for-publishers.html\">speculated by some<\/a> (including WordStream founder Larry Kim) that Facebook will push \u201call publisher page posts out of the news feed into a separate \u2018Explore\u2019 tab.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"cd81cd82-d27d-4241-840e-41de7a5fb049\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-explore-feed-branded-and-news-content.jpg\" alt=\"facebook explore tab\" width=\"772\" height=\"646\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Facebook tested this last year and it seems likelier than ever that a world in which posts from the people in your life and posts from news outlets\/businesses will be siloed is coming soon. That being said, as of <em>today<\/em>, <strong>Facebook is not eliminating <\/strong><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/10\/16\/facebook-business-page\"><strong>your Business page<\/strong><\/a><strong> content from the News Feed<\/strong>. More on where it <em>is<\/em> going below.<\/p>\n<h2>How Will It Impact Your Organic Facebook Presence?<\/h2>\n<p>In a post titled \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/news\/news-feed-fyi-bringing-people-closer-together\">Bringing People Closer Together<\/a>,\u201d Adam Mosseri, Facebook\u2019s Head of News Feed, outlined the changes in greater detail. Instead of prioritizing posts based on comments and shares, Facebook will now push content to the top of your News Feed that its algorithms predict will spark meaningful \u201cback-and-forth discussion.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But then he comes in with a flying elbow off the top rope:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cBecause space in News Feed is limited, showing more posts from friends and family and updates that spark conversation means we\u2019ll show less public content, including videos and other posts from publishers or businesses.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Which means you\u2019ll see highlights from your cousin\u2019s flag football championship or notices from your HOA instead of gems like this:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5461433d-6c16-49a6-97a9-6b5a8e4bba4a\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-news-feed-branded-content-kfc.jpg\" alt=\"say goodbye to branded content in the news feed on facebook\" width=\"499\" height=\"722\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Very unfair, I know.<\/p>\n<p>Now, people who actively want to see your page\u2019s content front and center can totally still do so by adjusting their \u201cSee First in News Feed\u201d settings. In order to convince your followers to actively choose to see the content you\u2019re producing, though, you\u2019ll need to step your game up.<\/p>\n<p>The limited spaces in the News Feed now afforded to businesses will be given to those whose content sparks the same meaningful engagement that inspired this change in the first place. Creating live video or events or recurring series of how-to posts or news that addresses meaningful issues\u2014anything that might lead to discussion and provide actual value to your prospects and customers\u2014is the only surefire way to maintain some semblance of organic reach (which was already <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/28\/facebook-ad-campaign-data\">dwindling<\/a> in favor of content boosting and ads anyway).<\/p>\n<h2>It\u2019s Still Possible to Grow Your Business on Facebook<\/h2>\n<p>Soooo <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/facebooks-stock-dropping-following-news-feed-announcement-of-the-changes-its-making-to-the-news-feed-2018-1\">Facebook\u2019s stock<\/a> is, uh, dropping\u2026<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"21677497-5b26-450c-96d0-aa76e23a6ec5\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-stock-after-news-feed-changes.png\" alt=\"facebook stock post news feed change\" width=\"666\" height=\"547\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>But that doesn\u2019t make much sense to me at all.<\/p>\n<p>Neither Zuckerberg nor Mosseri mention the word \u201cadvertising\u201d in their respective posts. Facebook generated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/greatspeculations\/2017\/11\/02\/ad-revenue-growth-continues-to-propel-facebook\/#12048b9c65ed\">more than $10.3 billion<\/a> in ad revenue last quarter alone; it\u2019s the primary way the platform makes money. As such, it shouldn\u2019t come as a shock that people see this deemphasizing of business-related content and run for the hills. But <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/15\/facebook-dynamic-creative\">Facebook<\/a> still has to make money; ads aren\u2019t going anywhere. In fact, the competition for prime placements is sure to <em>increase<\/em> given that News Feed is now a magical vortex of friendship and happiness.<\/p>\n<p>With that, here\u2019s what you can do in order to start, maintain, or grow your business\u2019s marketing presence on Facebook in a post-News Feed world.<\/p>\n<h3>Create hyper-engaging organic content<\/h3>\n<p>This drastic shift is in an effort to make people\u2019s lives better by improving the quality of the content shared on Facebook (and its engagement) by, in part, significantly reducing quantity. Brands sharing \u201cengagement-bait,\u201d superfluous listicles and the like, are going to fall by the wayside in favor of those who consciously decide to create content that truly makes people\u2019s lives better.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6fd40b1f-474e-4001-8fcb-f96ceb96ac50\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-live-video-engaging-content.png\" alt=\"create more engaging organic facebook content\" width=\"237\" height=\"462\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>In their post on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharethis.com\/thought-leadership\/2018\/01\/facebook-news-feed-changes-in-2018\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">winners and losers of Facebook&#8217;s news feed changes<\/a>, ShareThis suggests complementing the creation of more engaging content with, you guessed it,\u00a0<em>even more engagement<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>By empowering readers to share your stuff and harnessing the power of influencers in your vertical, you can amplify opportunities for meaningful conversation to take place; per Facebook, it&#8217;s this level of interaction\u2014not simply mindless likes and shares but positive discourse\u2014that the News Feed algorithm will reward moving forward.<\/p>\n<h3>Optimizing ads for non-feed placements<\/h3>\n<p>The News Feed is the crown jewel of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/08\/facebook-ad-placement-optimization\">ad placements<\/a>. This is not a secret.<\/p>\n<p>It affords advertisers the most space, allowing you to do and say more interesting things about your product or service. If Facebook is going to reduce the number of posts in the News Feed afforded to businesses, it stands to reason that competition (and cost) for ads in the New Feed will increase exponentially.<\/p>\n<p>Thankfully, between desktop, mobile, the audience network, and Instagram, Facebook offers a whole mess of alternative ad placement options.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"175ea634-6d78-4f16-9d26-3a8d565642c3\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ad-placement-options-not-news-feed.png\" alt=\"facebook ad placement options alternatives to news feed\" width=\"525\" height=\"248\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>They include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Groups<\/li>\n<li>Right column<\/li>\n<li>Instant articles<\/li>\n<li>In-stream video<\/li>\n<li>Instagram (feed and story)<\/li>\n<li>Sponsored messages<\/li>\n<li>Audience network<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Start thinking about how you can leverage these alternative placements in your Facebook advertising efforts!<\/p>\n<h3>Making the most out of your ad spend and activity<\/h3>\n<p>If, for most businesses, organic content falls by the wayside, the importance of Facebook advertising for SMBs will increase exponentially.
