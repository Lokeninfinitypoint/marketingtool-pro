Examples of this include the Dollar Shave Club and PooPourri videos (see below). Live-action explainer videos are usually best for companies selling a <em>physical product or people-oriented service<\/em>, such as a restaurant or consulting group. Having flesh-and-blood people in your explainer video can create an emotional connection for viewers, as we are naturally drawn to other human faces.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Live streams on Social Media:\u00a0<\/strong>These are pretty much the same as live-action videos, but without the ability to edit.

You do have the option to save your videos to your account after the video is complete.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Animated Explainer Videos:<\/strong> The most popular type of explainer video, animation is often the preferred format for explaining services or intangible tech products like software. Some services involve few, if any, physical objects, making live action an unrealistic option. Animated explainer videos allow for more creativity, and are easier to edit or update when you want to make future adjustments. You can use our list of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/12\/15\/best-video-editing-software-for-beginners\">video editing software<\/a> to find a tool that works for you.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Whiteboard Explainer Videos:<\/strong> A whiteboard video is an explainer video in which animation is hand drawn and erased on a whiteboard. This format of video has become popular due to its ease of operation and low cost, making it one of the cheapest types of explainer video to create.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>5 great explainer video examples<\/h2>\n<p>With these types of promo videos becoming ever more popular, there are plenty of top explainer video examples to choose from. We\u2019ve got a few favorites to show you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1.\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Dollar Shave Club<\/strong><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"videos\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_video\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"c025373d-b7c6-4e4b-bafb-09e7ed768183\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ZUG9qYTJMsI?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>With their video title, \u201cDollarShaveClub.com &#8211; Our Blades Are F***ing Great,\u201d you know Dollar Shave Club is going for something edgy. They follow through and go all-in with this wacky video, which we also featured in our <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/10\/08\/funny-ads\">blog post about funny advertisements.<\/a> What makes this explainer video work so well? Dollar Shave Club knows their audience <em>really<\/em> well, down to a tee. Their market is 20-30-something year old men who would be open to the idea of ordering a steady supply of razors online. The video\u2019s language and humor matches their ideal audience perfectly.<\/p>\n<p>Dollar Shave Club is a great example of a well-structured explainer video. They start with a brief overview of the service (get great razors delivered to your door for $1\/month), they introduce the problem (most blades are too expensive, have un-necessary features that jack up prices, and it\u2019s easy to forget about buying new razors), and re-iterate the solution their service offers (cheap blades delivered monthly to your door).<\/p>\n<p><strong>2.\u00a0PooPourri<\/strong><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"videos\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_video\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"435ba581-d3ed-4508-83e9-a1a61147f05b\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ZKLnhuzh9uY?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>PooPourri is successful for many of the same reasons Dollar Shave Club is, and it\u2019s no surprise that their styles are quite similar. You\u2019ll notice that PooPourri\u2019s explainer video is largely live action, but switches to some animation to show the intricacies of how PooPourri works (no one wants to see a live action load dropped into a toilet). Also, check out that big green button at the end of the video \u2013 it\u2019s begging to be clicked, ending with a strong <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2010\/09\/29\/unusual-effective-calls-to-action\">call to action<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s worth noting that matching this tone of humor for your own explainer video would be quite difficult \u2013 most businesses will be better off more subtle humor. PooPourri is an outrageous product, so their humor can be outrageous as well.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3.\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Mint<\/strong><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"videos\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_video\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ee095b8c-0439-47be-9035-6c97ff83b056\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/rK6WLHNYjwM?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Mint is a perfect example of why some businesses are much better off with animation rather than live action. Mint takes advantage of animation to illustrate how it draws financial info from different parts of a user\u2019s life and curates it all into one setup. Mint\u2019s animated explainer video also uses screenshots of the actual product, familiarizing viewers with the product\u2019s design and arrangement.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4.\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Airbnb<\/strong><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"videos\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_video\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"00b188b3-cb9d-4268-846f-fc24b70048e6\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/dA2F0qScxrI?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Airbnb uses a cool combination of live action and animation to show the unique (and reasonably priced) experiences obtained by using Air Bnb.\u00a0This explainer video does a great job of <em>showing<\/em> the perks of the Airbnb system while also explaining them verbally.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5.\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Spotify<\/strong><\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"videos\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_video\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"02ea7efc-b2a3-45ba-89db-93cde559f081\" data-langcode=\"und\">\n<article>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/zVHR1Ol7K5U?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Spotify relies exclusively on fun animation and a rockin\u2019 soundtrack to explain their digital music service.\u00a0The video matches the lively music with fast paced cutting, and the video\u2019s color scheme fits perfectly with the Spotify design, so we already feel familiar with it. Not much needs to be said; Spotify doesn\u2019t over complicate, instead relying on a tune and a few lines of text to show that they\u2019re all about the music.<\/p>\n<p>Do you have any favorite explainer video examples you recommend? What do you like about them? Let us know in the comments!<\/p>\n<h2>How to make an explainer video<\/h2>\n<p>We&#8217;re going to take you through the steps of how to make your own explainer video! It&#8217;s no easy task, requiring a ton of focus and effort, but we can guarantee it&#8217;s worth the work.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 1: Write the video script<\/h3>\n<p>The script is the most important element in creating a good explainer video. Your explainer video could have the coolest graphics and most Morgan Freeman-esque voiceover in the world, and it wouldn\u2019t mean a thing without a solid script to get behind.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/explainer-videos-best-1.jpg\" alt=\"explainer videos best\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The script is where you\u2019ll need to spend the majority of your focus. It\u2019s best if you write your explainer video script yourself (even if you choose to hire a production company). <strong>You know your target customer\u2019s concerns and pain points better than anyone else<\/strong>, and the video is where those concerns need to be addressed. What freaks out your potential customers? What confuses them about your product or offering? If you haven\u2019t already done some research to answer these questions, now is the time to consider surveying your audience and figuring this out.<\/p>\n<p>It is recommended that your explainer video script follow this general outline\u2026<\/p>\n<p>1. Quick overview of your product and what it does<\/p>\n<p>2. Introduce the problem<\/p>\n<p>3. Answer the problem with your solution (via product or service)<\/p>\n<p>4. Call to action (e.g. sign up for our free trial by clicking here!)<\/p>\n<p>5. Broadcast your trust signals (such as well-known clients, awards, write-ups, etc.)<\/p>\n<h4>Explainer video script best practices<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep it short \u2013 90 seconds or less is ideal.<\/li>\n<li>Your key message and value proposition should be in the first 30 seconds. Don\u2019t keep folks wondering.<\/li>\n<li>Speak in 2nd person, using words like \u201cYou\u201d and \u201cYour.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Use simple language \u2013 don\u2019t alienate viewers with technical terms they won\u2019t understand.<\/li>\n<li>Keep in mind the tone you want for your explainer video. Most videos opt for a casual, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/08\/write-emails-like-a-human\">conversational tone<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Try a touch of humor \u2013 videos with some subtle laughs tend to be more enjoyable.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Step 2: Recording the voiceovers<\/h3>\n<p>Once you have a script, you\u2019ll need a voiceover. Some options are:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Voices.com:<\/strong> This site has a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.voices.com\/top100\/favorites\/thisweek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">large network of professional voice actors<\/a> to choose from.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Craigslist: <\/strong>Ah yes, old reliable. You can find just about anything on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.craigslist.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">crazy Craigslist<\/a>, including voiceovers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fiverr:<\/strong> Yup, you can get a decent <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fiverr.com\/gigs\/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;search_in=everywhere&amp;query=voice+over&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;filter=rating&amp;jls_se99912_1_rating=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">voiceover for your explainer video for just $5<\/a> on Fiverr! You\u2019ll probably have to pay a bit more than that ($5 is usually the starting price \u2013 some charge by the second, others by the word. Chances are you won\u2019t be in the lowest price bracket). Still, you aren\u2019t likely to find a voiceover anywhere for cheaper.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/DIY-explainer-video-1.png\" alt=\"explainer video DIY\" width=\"705\" height=\"440\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Step 3: Explainer video production<\/h3>\n<p>There are a number of different paths you can take when it comes down to the actual creation and production of your explainer video.
