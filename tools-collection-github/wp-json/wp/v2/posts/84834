To ensure your social media policy effectively communicates your expectations, answer the six journalistic questions: who, what, when, where, why, and how.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Who does this policy apply to?<\/strong> Does it apply to your entire team or only to certain members? Do the guidelines differ by role?<\/li>\n<li><strong>What are the specifics of the policy? <\/strong>Clearly spell out your expectations for behaviors and the consequences for acting outside of them.<\/li>\n<li><strong>When does this policy apply?<\/strong> It\u2019s worth noting that you can\u2019t tell your employees they must post something specific on their own social media accounts. It\u2019s technically their personal property. However, you can call out certain behaviors that your company won\u2019t tolerate (i.e., sharing nonpublic company information, posting hate speech, getting into public fights with customers).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Where does your social media policy apply?<\/strong> Call out a list of the included social media channels and highlight any that may be specifically excluded.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Why do you have a social media policy?<\/strong> If people don\u2019t know why the policy exists, they might not feel compelled to follow it. Discuss why the policy is mutually beneficial in gaining team buy-in.<\/li>\n<li><strong>How does the policy work?<\/strong> Are there specific steps your employees should take before engaging with your brand online (i.e., should they connect with your marketing team before posting certain things about your business)? What tools or outreach channels should they use to discuss policy questions or clarifications with their manager or HR?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>A delineation of expectations based on relevant factors<\/h3>\n<p>Your social media policy may not be universally applicable. Your CEO, whose LinkedIn profile lists her as the company&#8217;s leader, should be held to a different standard than the private Instagram of a cashier.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/social-media-policy-wordstream-founder-post.jpg\" alt=\"social media policy - LinkedIn post from a company founder.\" width=\"502\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84838 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/social-media-policy-wordstream-founder-post.jpg 502w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/social-media-policy-wordstream-founder-post-480x574.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 502px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>You wouldn\u2019t expect a frontline worker to post like a <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/posts\/anastasia-volkova1_climateweek-activity-7208483826191265792-IKWg?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Co-founder<\/em><\/a><em>, and your social media policy should reflect that.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In your social media policy document, you\u2019ll want to clarify expectations based on relevant factors, which may include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The employee\u2019s role: <\/strong>You may have different expectations for people in leadership roles versus more junior employees.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The social platform:<\/strong> Guidelines may vary for platforms where someone is a \u201cprivate citizen\u201d (i.e., a personal<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/23\/tiktok-marketing\"> TikTok<\/a> account) versus one where they are explicitly connected to your brand (i.e., a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/05\/linkedin-advertising\"> LinkedIn<\/a> that lists their role at your company).<\/li>\n<li><strong>The content of the post:<\/strong> Someone posting a photo of their dog on Instagram? It&#8217;s probably not something an employer should comment on. An employee posting a tirade about their manager on TikTok and tagging your company in it? It is a poor reflection of your brand and something you have a vested interest in preventing.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The employee\u2019s association with the company:<\/strong> Is the content an employee shared their own opinion, or are they being asked to post as an official spokesperson for the business? Asking employees to clarify the capacity in which they\u2019re posting may be something you include in your social media policy.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Specific regulatory guidelines: <\/strong>If you work in a highly regulated industry (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/10\/healthcare-marketing\">healthcare<\/a>, finance, gaming, etc.), the agency that regulates your sector may have specific parameters about what you can and cannot do on social media. Include relevant regulatory guidance in your social media policy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Sample dos and dont\u2019s<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s one thing to read a policy&#8217;s legalese; it\u2019s quite another to see examples of compliance or violation. Providing employees with hypothetical examples of what is and isn\u2019t allowed can help them better understand the policy in action.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/social-media-policy-wordstream-musk.jpg\" alt=\"social media policy - Tweet from Elon Musk.\" width=\"858\" height=\"433\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84839 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/social-media-policy-wordstream-musk.jpg 858w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/social-media-policy-wordstream-musk-480x242.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 858px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Sharing examples of improper social media posts, like this one that landed <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/newsroom\/press-releases\/2018-219\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Elon Musk in hot water<\/em><\/a><em>, can help employees understand your social media policy.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Of course, you don\u2019t only need to share worst-case-scenario don\u2019ts.

That\u2019s a fair way to address the topic.<\/p>\n<p>As an institution of higher learning, it also calls out employees\u2019 right to academic freedom.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/social-media-policy-wordstream-acedemic-freedom.jpg\" alt=\"social media policy - Image from Tuft's documentation.\" width=\"537\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84841 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/social-media-policy-wordstream-acedemic-freedom.jpg 537w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/social-media-policy-wordstream-acedemic-freedom-480x536.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 537px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/opseu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/academic-freedom-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The policy asks that employees draw a clear line between their personal work and what they do for the University.

The policy recognizes that there is a fuzzy line between public personas and private lives, especially for public figures in the media.<\/p>\n<p>While journalists are entitled to their own feelings in private, anything they post online (even if it\u2019s as a private citizen in a closed or anonymous online community) is likely to be interpreted as either factual reporting or representative of the Times\u2019 opinion.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/social-media-policy-wordstream-NYT.jpg\" alt=\"social media policy - NYT policy screenshot.\" width=\"490\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84843 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/social-media-policy-wordstream-NYT.jpg 490w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/social-media-policy-wordstream-NYT-480x588.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 490px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/editorial-standards\/social-media-guidelines.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This policy is especially focused on maintaining a non-partisan presence.
