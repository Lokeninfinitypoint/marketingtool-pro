This is done by installing a single container code snippet to the source code, after which all other tags can be managed and deployed from the GTM interface. This effectively removes the need for developers&#8217; intervention for each tag installation and offers marketers greater flexibility and control over their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/marketing-services\">digital marketing endeavors<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Google Tag Manager has three key components:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Tags:<\/strong> Tags are snippets of code that execute on a page or mobile app. They can serve a variety of uses, but most of the tags used in GTM are designed to send measurement information from your site to a third party. Examples include the Google Analytics tag and the Google Ads <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/31\/conversion-paths-google-analytics\">conversion tag<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Triggers:<\/strong> Triggers are conditions that need to be met for a tag to execute. For instance, you could set a trigger for a tag to execute when a specific page is viewed or when a particular button is clicked.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Variables:<\/strong> Variables provide additional information that GTM might need for the tag and trigger to work. For example, if you&#8217;re setting a trigger for a particular URL, the URL is the variable.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I go into more detail about understanding Google Tag Manager in this video:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/embed\/mk2C7DN1gto\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<div id=\"benefits\"><\/div>\n<h2>Benefits of using Google Tag Manager<\/h2>\n<p>Why use Google Tag Manager? Consider these benefits.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Efficiency and speed: <\/strong>GTM allows marketers and developers to work more efficiently by enabling the addition or update of tags without requiring code changes on the website. This greatly reduces deployment times and allows marketing campaigns to be launched faster.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Flexibility:<\/strong> GTM provides a high degree of flexibility to digital marketers by allowing them to configure and deploy tags based on their specific needs, without any reliance on developers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Error reduction:<\/strong> GTM comes with a debugging option, which ensures tags are working correctly before they go live. This feature significantly minimizes the chances of errors.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Version control:<\/strong> GTM automatically creates a new version every time changes are made. If something goes wrong, it\u2019s easy to roll back to a previous version.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Improved site performance<\/strong>: By allowing asynchronous tag firing, GTM ensures that slow-loading tags don\u2019t hamper the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/18\/website-maintenance\">loading speed of your website<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Consolidation and organization: <\/strong>GTM helps in maintaining a clean and organized website code by keeping all the tags in one place.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-tag-manager-benefits.jpg\" alt=\"google tag manager benefits and use cases\" width=\"829\" height=\"396\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75175\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-tag-manager-benefits.jpg 829w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-tag-manager-benefits-480x229.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 829px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/tagmanager\/answer\/6102821?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\ud83e\udd28 Is your website up to par?

It acts as a central repository of data on your site that GTM can access to read values or track changes.<\/p>\n<p>When you&#8217;re running an ecommerce store, it&#8217;s really useful to track extra details about purchases. This helps you understand your customers better and make smarter business decisions. To do this, you can use something called a data layer. It&#8217;s like a special container that holds all the important information. In the code snippet you shared, the data layer is capturing specific details about a conversion event, like when someone makes a purchase.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-tag-manager-data-layer-example-script.jpg\" alt=\"google tag manager - data layer example script\" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75184\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-tag-manager-data-layer-example-script.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-tag-manager-data-layer-example-script-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In this code, the<strong> window.dataLayer<\/strong> object is initialized (if it doesn&#8217;t already exist) as an array. The<strong> push()<\/strong> method is then used to add a JavaScript object to the array, containing specific key-value pairs related to the purchase event.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>&#8216;event&#8217;<\/strong> key is set to <strong>&#8216;conversion&#8217;<\/strong>, indicating that a conversion event is being tracked. The <strong>&#8217;email&#8217;<\/strong> key represents the associated email address, while the <strong>&#8216;visitorType&#8217;<\/strong> key denotes the type of visitor, specifically a customer. Additionally, the &#8216;order&#8217; key holds the value <strong>1234<\/strong>, which could represent an order ID or any other relevant identifier.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that for more granular tracking in ecommerce scenarios, such as enhanced ecommerce tracking, Google provides a recommended <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/analytics\/devguides\/collection\/ga4\/ecommerce?client_type=gtm#select_an_item_from_a_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">data layer structure<\/a>.

Here&#8217;s how you would do this:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Within your GTM workspace, click on &#8220;Tags,&#8221; followed by &#8220;New&#8221; to create a new tag.<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-tag-manager-custom-html.jpg\" alt=\"create custom html tag in google tag manager\" width=\"936\" height=\"509\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75185\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-tag-manager-custom-html.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/google-tag-manager-custom-html-480x261.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/li>\n<li>For the &#8220;Tag Configuration,&#8221; select &#8220;Custom HTML.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Paste your third-party JavaScript code into the HTML text area provided.<\/li>\n<li>Specify the trigger for this tag (for instance, you might want this tag to fire on &#8220;All Pages&#8221;).<\/li>\n<li>Save and publish the tag.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Once the tag is published, it will inject your custom HTML (in this case, the chatbot JavaScript code) based on the trigger conditions you specified. This means you can manage and deploy custom scripts across your site with ease, directly from GTM.<\/p>\n<p>Get more details about these features in this video tutorial:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/embed\/l3k0QHxiPUI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2>Get started with Google Tag Manager<\/h2>\n<p>By centralizing the tagging and tracking process using Google Tag Manager, you can streamline your workflow, increase efficiency, and reduce the likelihood of errors that could occur from manual code changes.
