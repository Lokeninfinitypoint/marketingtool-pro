Your goal is to get on the first page for queries that your ideal customers are performing. By doing so, you get discovered by consumers that are searching online with the intent to buy or engage. These people are the most likely to convert into leads and customers for your business.<\/p>\n<h3>Increase engagement<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">According to Adweek,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.adweek.com\/socialtimes\/81-shoppers-conduct-online-research-making-purchase-infographic\/208527\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">81% of shoppers conduct online research before buying<\/a>, and Google is the go-to for this.

While a search engine results page itself can sometimes supply all the information a person needs, there are still a number of queries for which people will inevitably click through to a website. Don\u2019t forget that it often takes several engagements with a business before a person converts into a customer, so interactions with your website are important.<\/p>\n<p>Not only does being on the first page of Google drastically increase traffic to your website;\u00a0<em>not<\/em>\u00a0being on the first page of Google has a huge disadvantage.

This steep decline in web traffic is an indicator of just how important the first page of Google is.<\/p>\n<h3>Increase your industry authority<\/h3>\n<p>Getting on the first page of Google requires regularly creating <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/15\/quality-content-defined\">high-quality content<\/a> that Google recognizes is satisfying the needs of its searchers. This takes time, but the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\">increased traffic<\/a> and trust that will result is well worth the investment.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, writing regularly about your industry\u00a0and business will require you to stay in tune with what your target audience wants to know as well as what the latest updates are in your industry.

You do not necessarily search engine-optimize your whole site at once, but rather each individual page on your site. Here\u2019s how to do so:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Determine your keywords<\/h3>\n<p>First, determine which search queries you want Google to answer with your website pages. These are known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/seo-keyword\">keywords<\/a>\u2014which, by the way, can be single words OR phrases.<\/p>\n<p>Examples of keywords include:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 \u201cMA tenant laws\u201d<br \/>\n\u2022 \u201csalon near me\u201d<br \/>\n\u2022 \u201cbrunch Boston\u201d<br \/>\n\u2022 \u201cair conditioner repair Brighton\u201d<br \/>\n\u2022 \u201chow to plug a leaky roof\u201d<br \/>\n\u2022 \u201chow to get on the first page of Google\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Each page on your website should <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-research\">target a different set of keywords<\/a> so that the pages aren\u2019t competing with each other.<\/p>\n<p>The right keywords for your business are those that your ideal customers are typing in to get the products and services they need. For help choosing keywords for your business, try our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Blog_InContentTextLink_FKT\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Tell Google what keywords you&#8217;re using<\/h3>\n<p>Google works by crawling the web, ranking the millions of pages that exist, and storing them in an index. When a user performs a search, Google can then scan through its more organized index (rather than the whole web) to quickly come up with relevant results.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, another important step for showing up on the first page of Google is to make it as easy as possible for Google to\u00a0scan, index, and retrieve your site. Do this by placing keywords in the following places:<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Meta title<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Every blog post and page of your website has a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/meta-tags\">meta\u00a0title<\/a>. This title appears at the top of your page in the form of a header\u00a0but also as the title of that page\u2019s listing in search results (depending upon your CMS settings).<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Meta description<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/meta-description\">meta description<\/a> is the little blurb that shows up underneath the title in Google&#8217;s search results.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/content-audit-meta-title-description-example.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-50804 aligncenter\" width=\"600\" height=\"76\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/content-audit-meta-title-description-example.png 600w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/content-audit-meta-title-description-example-480x61.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In addition to telling Google what your page is about, the meta description quickly tells a searcher what they can expect if they click on your page, increasing the relevant clicks to that page. Therefore the meta description helps Google to put your business on the right first page for the right searches and helps Google searchers to keep it there.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>URL<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Your URL consists of your domain name (such as wordstream.com), followed by a forward slash, followed by text separated by dashes.<\/p>\n<p>Including keywords in your URL will help Google more quickly identify what your page is about. Also, the URL appears in between the title and meta description in search results. A clean URL that matches the title of the page is more appealing and trustworthy to users, and better suited for first-page appearances.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Alt tags<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/05\/08\/image-seo\">Google can only see images<\/a> if the image has a text alternative (aka alt tag). If your alt tag includes keywords, Google can detect further relevancy of that page and feel more comfortable putting you on its first page of search results.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Write for humans<\/h3>\n<p>Of course, the body of your page\u2019s content is the most important place to include the keywords for which you\u2019re trying to rank. However, it is crucial that these keywords are not systematically and excessively inserted but naturally incorporated. In fact, Google can now detect <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/03\/21\/dangers-of-keyword-stuffing\">keyword stuffing<\/a> and if it does it will place you far, far from the first page of its results.<\/p>\n<p>The key to getting on the first page of Google is providing useful, trustworthy, easy-to-read, but informative content that will keep your target audience on your pages and coming back for more. And conversationally sharing the knowledge already in your head is both free and easy. Just remember that if you want to rank on the first page of Google for a particular keyword search,\u00a0<strong>your page needs to provide the information, and not just the keywords,\u00a0<\/strong>that users are trying to obtain when they type that search into Google.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Emphasize location<\/h3>\n<p>Another free way to get your website pages on the first page of Google is to target location-based queries. Make sure your website clearly indicates your city and\/or geographic area, via your contact page and potentially also through blog posts and services pages. That way, when people search: \u201cyour industry\u201d + \u201dyour city\u201d, Google will pick up that information and show your business as a \u201cnear me\u201d search result.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/local-seo-serp_0.jpg\" alt=\"How to Get on The First Page of Google\" width=\"753\" height=\"704\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><br \/>\nEven if a user does not search using a specific location, Google will still serve up geographically relevant results based on their IP address, so\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/12\/local-seo\">local SEO<\/a>\u00a0is not only free, but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/05\/08\/seo-during-covid-19\">always important (even during a pandemic)<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Optimize for mobile<\/h3>\n<p>You will not find a website at the top of a Google search that is not responsive. Consumers now use phones and tablets more than computers and laptops, and the majority of local searches are performed on mobile devices. As a result, Google favors <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/08\/28\/mobile-websites\">mobile-friendly websites<\/a>. In fact, all sites are now indexed by <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/15\/mobile-first-indexing\">mobile-first indexing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Responsive is ideal, as your website will adapt to any size screen and maintain functionality. However, if you don\u2019t have a responsive website, there are adjustments you can make to your site to ensure the most seamless experience for a mobile user.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Focus on user experience<\/h3>\n<p>Being mobile-friendly isn\u2019t enough for a website. It must also be appealing and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/27\/design-thinking\">user-friendly<\/a>. A website with intuitive navigation, clear <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/09\/call-to-action\">calls to action<\/a>, and answers to your visitors\u2019 most immediate questions will keep visitors there longer and coming back later\u2014which Google will notice and, in turn, rank you higher.

Make sure you follow through with claiming and verifying your listing so that you can monitor, maintain, and <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/listings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">optimize your listing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20create20and20verify20your20google20my20business20account20account20vs20listing_0.png\" alt=\"How to Get on The First Page of Google\" width=\"800\" height=\"461\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>8. Optimize your Google Business Profile<\/h3>\n<p>Speaking of optimizing your listing, I consider this strategy a separate entity because while creating a Google listing can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/17\/website-visibility\">help you with your visibility<\/a>, it can only take you so far in terms of ranking. Rather than creating a bare-bones listing and hoping that it shows up for one or two searches, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/27\/google-my-business\">optimize your Google business listing<\/a>\u00a0for maximum visibility. Here\u2019s how:<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Complete every section of your profile<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>The more information you include in your Google My Business listing, the more searches for which it can show up on the first page. In fact, complete Google My Business listings get, on average, 7X\u00a0more clicks than incomplete listings.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Keep your name consistent<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Use the same exact <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/23\/how-to-come-up-with-a-business-name\">name for your business<\/a> at all times. Google doesn\u2019t like discrepancies\u2014even those as minor as \u201cCo.\u201d vs \u201cCompany\u201d<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Update your information<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Not being able to find your business, showing up to find it closed, or getting an operator when trying to call can not only deter a customer, but also lead them to distrust your business or write a negative review. Stay on top of your Google listing and\u00a0make the necessary updates and changes\u00a0so that it can be trusted enough to be at the top of the list.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Upload photos to your listing<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Google Business Profile strives to equip consumers with as much information about a business as possible, before even encountering that business. This includes what it\u2019s like to be at that business, so be sure to upload photos that depict not only the products and services your business offers but also the atmosphere and people that frequent it.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Obtain customer reviews<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Google searchers love to see what other people think about a business, so it\u2019s no surprise that the businesses with\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/09\/16\/get-more-google-reviews\">more positive Google reviews<\/a>\u00a0show up on the first page. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">Ask customers in person<\/a> and create a review shortcut link so you can easily encourage reviews across your online channels. While this technically falls under the list of Google My Business optimizations, don&#8217;t forget that there are plenty other review sites\u2014all of which have an impact on your ranking.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/how20to20get20on20the20first20page20of20google20get20reviews20local20pack.png\" alt=\"how to get on the first page of google get reviews local pack\" width=\"800\" height=\"610\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Reviews can land you in the &#8220;Local Pack&#8221; which shows up at the top of Google&#8217;s SERP.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>10. List your business on other directories<\/h3>\n<p>Google Business Profile is powerful, but you should still create and optimize listings on other popular <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/search-directory\">directories<\/a> like Yelp. First, because Yelp has high traffic and is widely trusted by Google, so your business\u2019s Yelp page can very well show up on the first page of Google for relevant searches. Second, because a solid listing with positive reviews improves your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/17\/increase-online-presence\">online presence<\/a> in general. Online reviews and links from other trusted sites send signals to Google that figure into its ranking algorithm.<\/p>\n<p>As with your Google Business Profile, make sure the rest of your online directory listings are complete and accurate, consistent across platforms, updated, and that you are collecting and responding to reviews. Don\u2019t forget to add photos to your online listings as well.<\/p>\n<p>You can use this <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/free-business-listings-grader\/?cid=Web_WS_InContentTextLink_Freemium_Listings&amp;utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free business listings grader<\/a> from LocaliQ to see how your Google Business Profile and other important listings look online.<\/p>\n<h2>How to get on the first page of Google [recap]<\/h2>\n<p>Getting to the top of Google, or even just improving your ranking, is very doable, even for small businesses.
