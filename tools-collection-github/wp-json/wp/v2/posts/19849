At. That. Cheesy. Goodness.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Hats off to you, Domino\u2019s. You know what draws hungry college kids coming home from the bars, posting late night Instagrams: cheap\u2014yet delicious\u2014pizza.<\/p>\n<p>More than just the gorgeous picture of a pie, food pictures are huge on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/21\/instagram-marketing-tools\">Instagram<\/a> right now. (And did you know that <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/20\/instagram-statistics\">the #1 most Instagrammed food is pizza<\/a>?) These kinds of ads blend in and stand out appropriately; no one is going to get annoyed that you\u2019re showing up, and they might just be intrigued enough to place a delivery order or head into the store.<\/p>\n<p>Why this Instagram ad works:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It looks \u201cnative\u201d (like an organic Instagram post)<\/li>\n<li>Emojis in the ad text are a nice touch to resonate with hungry millennials<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Best Director<\/h2>\n<p>This artistic ad from Dance and Beyond is slightly mind-bending, like looking at an illusion on your phone screen. Props for some awesome photography skills\u2014you know the photographer (director) had to rearrange these legs 10,000 different times and take 10,000 shots to get this exactly right.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t be afraid to up the ante on Instagram. If you have an amateur photographer on staff\u2014or if you run a photography studio\u2014show off your skills! Everyone is always looking for the perfect angles.

To be honest, I thoroughly enjoyed the play on the typical bun-in-the-oven announcement but I truly identified with Dad. He was upset that there was only one mini chicken sandwich in his box! The emotions were so real!<\/p>\n<p>To create an Instagram ad like Chik-fil-a\u2019s, think about how your brand or product can unexpectedly be involved in the personal milestones of your customers. Everyone loves a great success story; do you run a boutique where your salesperson had a meet-cute with a customer? Do you have a restaurant that hosted a surprise birthday party recently? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/04\/instagram-videos\">Tell your story through a video ad<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/yMc-PVzKlR8?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Why this Instagram ad works:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uses self-deprecating humor\u2014exactly what you\u2019re looking for from a fast food restaurant<\/li>\n<li>Tells a complete story quickly<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Best Animated Feature<\/h2>\n<p>This adorable Haagen-Dazs ad combined a very real-looking ice cream cone with some very animated bumble bees to celebrate Free Cone Day. They even included a nice play on the \u201cbusy bee\u201d idiom in the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/23\/instagram-captions\">caption<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>This advertisement isn\u2019t too flashy or cartoonish, but draws awareness to the endangered honey bee population and the free cone event in a cute way. You know that they considered featuring real bumble bees, then immediately realized it would be a terrible idea. Way to go, Haagen-Dazs!<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/qNR28fzJhCM?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Why this Instagram ad works:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Latches onto a popular event and a popular environmental issue<\/li>\n<li>Creative use of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/10\/19\/get-more-instagram-followers\">hashtags<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Best Adapted Screenplay<\/h2>\n<p>Though this might be a stretch for an ad, the popular show <em>13 Reasons Why<\/em> is based on a book, and was adapted for television by Netflix.

The footage is amazing! It makes the viewer feel as though they are in the crowd with the best seats in the house. And it never gets boring, with quick action shots, clips of an excited audience, and sporadic camera flashes.<\/p>\n<p>Have Go Pro, will travel? This type of ad is great for travel agencies, car share companies, boutique hotels, or any business that assists their customers getting from point A to point B. Make your audience fight the FOMO with some fast and slow video compilations.<\/p>\n<div style=text-align:center;>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/plOwq7GHNcY?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Why this Instagram ad works:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Incredibly well-taken video<\/li>\n<li>Makes the audience feel present but not as though they are being swindled<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Best Costume<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/simple_image\/public\/images\/starbucks-instagram-ads.PNG?53w22ztHjjx9vp2BUq3dTDeIq_jLGb5f&amp;itok=AJKJPKNt\">This adorable Starbucks ad<\/a> wins best costume for that great camouflage! On top of the adorable factor, it has all the makings of a great Instagram on a personal account. Don\u2019t kid yourself, one of your more photography-inclined friends could have captured this for a ludicrous amount of likes.<\/p>\n<p>Take advantage of scenery! If you have an especially cool mural or view around your business, take photos of it\u2014maybe with your products strategically placed in the shot.<\/p>\n<p>Why this Instagram ad works:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/09\/22\/guerrilla-marketing-examples\">Creative use of environs<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Bright colors and strong contrast are always a win<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Best Makeup and Hair<\/h2>\n<p>Just looking at this ad from Glossier brings the great, classic song to mind, \u201cMy lip gloss is poppin\u2019, my lip gloss is cool!\u201d Glossier has a series of strong ads featuring their products, which closely resemble make-up tutorials that you would find on Instagram organically.

The real eye-catcher is the great title, \u201cPerfect is Boring\u201d that steals the show.<\/p>\n<p>Face it, good cleaning products aren\u2019t the most thrilling selling point. If your product is similarly sleep-inducing, try putting a fun twist on it! Sell cat litter? Pictures of silly kittens. Paper products? Find some way to work The Office into the conversation.

This Instagram ad features (what I can only assume is) a sweet Brooklyn loft, a beautifully made bed, and a satisfying \u201cpoof\u201d when that attractive man somersaults into it.<\/p>\n<p>As so many Instagram models can tell you, being scantily clad goes a long way (ahem, every Kardashian, ahem).
