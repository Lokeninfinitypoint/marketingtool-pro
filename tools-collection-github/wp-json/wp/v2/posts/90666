While videos and images are prevalent, Bluesky is similar to X in that the platform features more text-based posts. While the character limit is 350 per post, Bluesky allows users to group longer content in threads.<\/p>\n<p>This similarity to X is by design. Bluesky originally launched back in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/12\/11\/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-announces-bluesky-social-media-standards-push.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2019<\/a> as a research project at X that was focused on exploring decentralized social media. It became its own independent company in 2021 when Jack Dorsey left then Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>The platform grew by invitation only in 2023 before finally becoming open to all users (over 13 years of age) in early 2024. (It\u2019s worth noting that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/article\/2024\/may\/07\/jack-dorsey-quits-bluesky-board-urges-users-stay-elon-musk-x-twitter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jack Dorsey left Bluesky in 2024<\/a>, too, but this has more to do with the platform\u2019s founding story than its use in your marketing strategy.)<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to your<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/07\/best-marketing-strategies\"> marketing strategy<\/a>, Bluesky will likely look familiar to other social media platforms. In terms of layout and platform experience, it\u2019s very similar to X. The left-hand menu, the dual-option Discover and Following feeds, and the publish button are a lot like its competitor platform if not exactly the same.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve been active on X, you\u2019ll be able to navigate the Bluesky platform easily.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-30-million-followers-png.avif\" alt=\"Bluesky for marketing - post from Bluesky.\" width=\"936\" height=\"457\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90691 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-30-million-followers-png.avif 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-30-million-followers-300x146.avif 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-30-million-followers-768x375.avif 768w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-30-million-followers-480x234.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Looking nice and familiar, Bluesky.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1<strong> Need more social media ideas?<\/strong> Download <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/social-media-calendar-template?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Template_MonthlySocialMediaCalendar_Download\">Your Copy &amp; Paste Social Media Calendar<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"how-is-bluesky-different\"><\/div>\n<h2>How is Bluesky different from other social media platforms?<\/h2>\n<p>As an X competitor, Bluesky is similar to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/26\/instagram-threads\">Instagram Threads<\/a> and Mastodon. These platforms use the same approach to short-form posts that enable conversations with other platform users.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few key ways that Bluesky is different.<\/p>\n<h3>Decentralized<\/h3>\n<p>Bluesky is decentralized. This means that it runs on an open AT protocol, which isn\u2019t controlled by a single organization.<\/p>\n<p>Because there isn\u2019t centralized control, users have more control over their data and, importantly, their app experience. There is not a single, central instance of the Bluesky platform. Users can customize and build feeds to tailor their experience on the app to their interests.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, there are more than <a href=\"https:\/\/bsky.app\/profile\/jay.bsky.team\/post\/3lbd2ee2pwd2r\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">50,000<\/a> algorithmic feeds that users can opt into.<\/p>\n<h3>Data control<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Even though this is a result of the decentralized platform, data control is worth calling out specifically. Bluesky gives users more control over where their data is stored or not stored, unlike competitors like Threads, which is connected and controlled by Meta.<\/p>\n<p>This control means more user privacy, but it also means less insight into analytics on the platform.<\/p>\n<h3>Community<\/h3>\n<p>Other platform algorithms prioritized the network effect with an algorithm serving content and profiles. Bluesky allows users more control over the feed and the content they consume on the platform, so the focus is on creating many communities of users tied together by common interests and, in turn, common content.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-discover-png.avif\" alt=\"Bluesky for marketing - discover page.\" width=\"510\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90692 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-discover-png.avif 510w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-discover-255x300.avif 255w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-discover-480x565.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Instead of serving a single algorithm-driven feed, Bluesky allows users to subscribe to multiple feeds and curate their experience on the platform.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Ads<\/h3>\n<p>Here\u2019s where Bluesky really diverges from its closest competitors. For now, the platform is completely ad-free. That\u2019s important to note for your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/stretch-your-marketing-budget\">marketing budget<\/a> and strategy. So, while you won\u2019t put dollars directly into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/01\/12\/how-to-generate-leads\">getting leads<\/a> on Bluesky, you may need to invest more time in doing so since there are no <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/ppc\">paid ad<\/a> shortcuts.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-popular-is-bluesky\"><\/div>\n<h2>How popular is Bluesky?<\/h2>\n<p>Bluesky has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/tech\/how-and-why-to-join-bluesky-which-now-has-30-million-users-as-a-twitter-alternative\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">30 million<\/a> users. Now, this might sound dismissable when you consider the fact that X has <a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/twitter-users\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">360 million<\/a> users and <a href=\"https:\/\/explodingtopics.com\/blog\/threads-users\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">320 million<\/a> people use Instagram Threads.

Still, there\u2019s plenty of information that can tell you who is spending the most time on the website.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, Bluesky users are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>US-based: <\/strong>In 2024, nearly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.similarweb.com\/website\/bsky.app\/#geography\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">48%<\/a> of traffic to Bluesky originated in the US, followed by 5% from the United Kingdom and 5% from Japan.

According to <a href=\"https:\/\/explodingtopics.com\/blog\/bluesky-users\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Exploding Topics<\/a>, this is similar to X (60.9% men and 39.1% women) and not too far off from Facebook (56.8% men and 43.2% women).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Under 35: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.similarweb.com\/website\/bsky.app\/#geography\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">33%<\/a> of users fall between 18 and 22 years of age, and another 27.26% are 25-34. That means 60% of Bluesky users are under 35.<\/li>\n<li><strong>iPhone users: <\/strong>Throughout 2023 and 2024, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/1382164\/bluesky-worldwide-downloads-by-platform\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more Bluesky app downloads<\/a> occurred on iOS devices than on Android devices.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This overview is a good way to figure out if your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/22\/customer-data-privacy\">target audience<\/a> is on Bluesky and whether or not your brand should be, too. There\u2019s one more crucial question.<\/p>\n<h3>But are there businesses on Bluesky?<\/h3>\n<p>With 30 million users, limited analytics, and no ads, Bluesky isn\u2019t going out of its way to attract businesses to its platform. But that doesn\u2019t mean the platform is devoid of company accounts. Some of the most popular accounts on the platform are corporate news media accounts. The Onion has <a href=\"https:\/\/bsky.app\/profile\/theonion.com\">1.1 million<\/a> followers, and so does the <a href=\"https:\/\/bsky.app\/profile\/nytimes.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">New York Times.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>However, most brands have far fewer followers. For example, Netflix has<a href=\"https:\/\/bsky.app\/profile\/netflix.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> 49,000<\/a> followers on Bluesky and<a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/netflix\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> 22 million<\/a> on X.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-netflix-png.avif\" alt=\"Bluesky for marketing - Netflix account page.\" width=\"949\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90696 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-netflix-png.avif 949w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-netflix-300x190.avif 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-netflix-768x486.avif 768w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-netflix-480x303.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 949px) 100vw, 949px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Netflix has 49,000 followers and shares programming updates on Bluesky.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udce3 <strong>Bluesky may not deliver a ton of leads yet, but we know where you can find a bunch of free ones.<\/strong> Just get your copy of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/resources\/free-leads?cid=Web_WS_InContent_Guide_howtogetfreeleads_Download&amp;itm_source=wordstream&amp;itm_medium=blog&amp;itm_campaign=incontent_links\">14 Fast &amp; Easy Ways to Get Free Leads (+Examples You Can Copy)<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"things-you-can-do-for-your-brand-on-bluesky\"><\/div>\n<h2>3 things you can do for your business on Bluesky now<\/h2>\n<p>You may not want to devote a big chunk of your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-calendar\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing calendar<\/a> or budget to Bluesky just yet. But it\u2019s worthwhile to be on the platform if just to secure your account and watch how the app evolves. Here are a few things you can do on Bluesky now while you wait and see if it\u2019s worth a bigger investment in the future.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Claim your profile<\/h3>\n<p>At a minimum, you want to ensure you have first dibs on your<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/08\/business-name-ideas\"> brand name<\/a>. Ideally, you\u2019ll also want to make your profile recognizable with brand colors, graphics, copy, and more. This will let you benefit from<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/brand-awareness-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> brand recognition<\/a> and use the stop at your profile to leave a positive impression, even if you\u2019re not active on the platform.<\/p>\n<p>Compare these examples from two well-known brands.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-red-bull-png.avif\" alt=\"Bluesky for marketing - post from RedBull\" width=\"510\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90697 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-red-bull-png.avif 510w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-red-bull-255x300.avif 255w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-red-bull-480x565.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is a blank profile for Red Bull. But there\u2019s a brand header image and profile photo. There\u2019s also the<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/brand-slogans\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> slogan<\/a> in the bio. I know, visiting this profile, that it\u2019s Red Bull, but they don\u2019t really use Bluesky yet.<\/p>\n<p>Now, here\u2019s the best option for Dunkin\u2019 that comes up for a search on the platform.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-dunkin-donuts-png.avif\" alt=\"Bluesky for marketing - Dunkin account page.\" width=\"633\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90698 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-dunkin-donuts-png.avif 633w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-dunkin-donuts-300x284.avif 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-dunkin-donuts-480x455.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s another blank profile, but there are no images with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/small-business-logo\">logos<\/a> or brand colors and no quippy references in the bio. It doesn\u2019t seem to be owned by the company, but this also isn\u2019t super clear.<\/p>\n<p>If you have people landing on a Bluesky handle with your brand name, you want it to be yours\u2014and you want everyone to know that.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Experiment to find your audience and voice<\/h3>\n<p>You can use the fact that Bluesky is a newer platform with a smaller audience to your advantage and get creative as you find your footing. American Eagle is a great example of this. The clothing company has about <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/AEO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">500,000<\/a> on X and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/americaneagle\/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">4 million<\/a> on Instagram. On Bluesky, American Eagle has <a href=\"https:\/\/bsky.app\/profile\/americaneagle1977.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">92 followers<\/a>. Yup, you read that right.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-american-eagle-account-png.avif\" alt=\"Bluesky for marketing - American Eagle account page.\" width=\"936\" height=\"511\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90699 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-american-eagle-account-png.avif 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-american-eagle-account-300x164.avif 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-american-eagle-account-768x419.avif 768w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-american-eagle-account-480x262.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But the brand is using this low following to its advantage and testing out some content that\u2019s quick, casual, and, in some cases, reminiscent of the best stream of conscious posting.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-american-eagle-png.avif\" alt=\"Bluesky for marketing - posts from American Eagle.\" width=\"724\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90700 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-american-eagle-png.avif 724w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-american-eagle-300x249.avif 300w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-american-eagle-480x398.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>American Eagle\u2019s Bluesky feed during the Grammy\u2019s.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>As you\u2019re testing out the platform, don\u2019t be afraid to get creative with your brand account, too. You never know what might grow your audience until you start trying.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Leverage internal influencers and brand spokespeople<\/h3>\n<p>Individual accounts will perform better on Bluesky. If your audience is spending time on the platform, and you have a founder or spokesperson interested in growing their following for the sake of the brand, it\u2019s worth some devoted time and effort.<\/p>\n<p>This strategy isn\u2019t without precedent on other platforms and is not without success on Bluesky already. This is a big example. One of the top accounts on Bluesky is James Gunn, the co-CEO of DC Studios, with nearly a quarter of a million followers. On his account, he shares some personal content, including cat pictures. But most of the posts are about the world of DC, whether it\u2019s confirming news of a second season or sharing a trailer for an upcoming movie.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-james-gunn-png.avif\" alt=\"Bluesky for marketing - post from James Gunn.\" width=\"504\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-90701 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-james-gunn-png.avif 504w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-james-gunn-252x300.avif 252w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/bluesky-marketing-wordstream-james-gunn-480x571.avif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>DC Studios?
