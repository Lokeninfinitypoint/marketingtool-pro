While the names might not be as closely tied to their exact applications as they used to be, it\u2019s still true that broad is the, well, broadest of the match types. Meaning it will make your ads eligible to show, and therefore eligible for a click from users, on a larger range of queries than either exact or phrase.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/broad-phrase-exact-match-types-google-ads.png\" alt=\"google ads keyword match types compared\" width=\"720\" height=\"520\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-57622\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/broad-phrase-exact-match-types-google-ads.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/broad-phrase-exact-match-types-google-ads-480x347.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>While there are certainly scenarios where broad match keywords can be valuable, they are best utilized in a limited number of scenarios.<\/p>\n<p>Broad match may be right for you if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your account is generating good results but you\u2019re having <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/04\/04\/how-to-scale-success-in-google-ads\">trouble scaling<\/a> with exact and phrase terms.<\/li>\n<li>You have high conversion counts and can leverage broad match with Smart Bidding.<\/li>\n<li>You\u2019re using Remarketing Lists for Search Ads (RLSA) and focusing on a set of known users.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u00a0 How to avoid this facepalm<\/h3>\n<p>While this list isn\u2019t exhaustive, it illuminates one thing: if you don\u2019t focus your broad match keywords in one way (either with strong past performance, lots of conversion data, or audiences) these match types can really run amok and match to queries you have no business matching to. Which brings us to our next mistake.<br \/>\n<a id=\"negatives\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Mistake #5:\u00a0Not adding negative keywords<\/h2>\n<p>Regardless of the match types your keywords use, you\u2019re likely going to match to queries that aren\u2019t a good fit for your business. You can tell Google you don\u2019t want to have your ad triggered for these searches by adding <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/06\/negative-keyword-guide\">negative keywords<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>A quick example to illustrate. You\u2019re selling t-shirts and someone searches for \u201cfree t-shirts.\u201d If your t-shirts aren\u2019t free (which I hope they\u2019re not,) you likely need to add \u201cfree\u201d as a negative keyword to your campaign so you don\u2019t have your ad shown for people searching for free items.<\/p>\n<p>All too often I see accounts with zero negative keywords added. This is already a miss, but when combined with running on only broad match keywords, you can end up spending a lot of money very quickly on terms that have zero chance of converting.

Pick the campaign or keyword set you think is going to perform best, turn off all others, and divert all of your budget to that group. Let it run for a while and evaluate performance.
