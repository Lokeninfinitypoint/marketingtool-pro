When it\u2019s done right, videos are easy to interact with, entertaining to consume, and quick to share.

As long as you make the most of it. Cue video marketing trends.

The advancements in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-copywriting-tools\">artificial intelligence<\/a> (AI), and generative AI in particular, have been all over the news this year. For example, Open AI launched the trained generative chatbot ChatGPT 3.5 at the end of 2022, and then an updated ChatGPT 4.0.

Videos will be included in newsletter <\/span><span>and email creative<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Something that we saw a lot in 2023? Newsletters. According to reletter, there are more than <span><a href=\"https:\/\/reletter.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1.6 million newsletters<\/a><\/span> on Substack and LinkedIn alone.<\/p>\n<p>This format allows for longer, more narrative communication with your audience.

Product videos will become more prevalent<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Allen Finn, who runs marketing at <span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.triplewhale.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Triple Whale<\/a><\/span>, is prioritizing product videos next year, and he thinks he\u2019s one of many marketing leaders making this plan.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re changing most of our documentation to video (versus traditional written help docs),\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more digestible, less intimidating, and much more efficient to update, which is essential for a product that changes as often as ours.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This change also means investing in video marketing content for your highest-value audiences: your customers or your most engaged prospects. \u201cWe\u2019re replacing illustrations with gifs and product videos across the website to show the product as it is versus as an abstraction to drive interest and conversion from high-intent visitors,\u201d he explained.<\/p>\n<p>Focusing on product videos and gifs next year is a no-brainer for software companies, but featuring your offering in motion is great for any business, especially direct-to-consumer.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/video-marketing-trend-banza-video-screenshot.jpg\" alt=\"video marketing trends - example banza product video\" width=\"757\" height=\"497\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-79479 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/video-marketing-trend-banza-video-screenshot.jpg 757w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/video-marketing-trend-banza-video-screenshot-480x315.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 757px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>In case anyone thinks <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4D7YXCCgi-E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gluten-free mac and cheese<\/a> looks any different.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>And if you\u2019re featuring a service\u2014-whether it\u2019s your dental office or lawn care\u2014-then you have a great reason to get in front of the camera. This brings us to the next video marketing trend to watch for next year.<\/p>\n<h3><span>5. <\/span><span>More real people on camera<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Rayna van Beuzekom, video editor and producer at <span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.commsor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Commsor<\/a><\/span>, thinks we\u2019re going to see more people on camera as brands focus on the biggest value of video: connection.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cVideo is such a great tool to connect with audiences,\u201d they said. \u201cYou can take a seemingly distant product and humanize it through video. We&#8217;re going to see more and more people on camera, whether it&#8217;s sellers, marketers or executives.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Notice the key similarity among the \u201cwho\u201d options Rayna gave? Sellers, marketers, and executives are all members of your team. Real people don\u2019t mean actors or influencers; it means your company\u2019s employees and partners.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/video-marketing-trends-conversational-instagram-reel.jpg\" alt=\"video marketing trends - conversational instagram video example\" width=\"664\" height=\"590\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-79474 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/video-marketing-trends-conversational-instagram-reel.jpg 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/video-marketing-trends-conversational-instagram-reel-480x427.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Cz9NoMYxJQn\/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A great example<\/a> of casual, conversational founder videos from Lo Bosworth, CEO of Lovewellness and Laguna Beach alum.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Founder &amp; CEO at <span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.startupbos.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Startup Boston<\/a><\/span> Stephanie Roulic thinks this trend will be especially prevalent for startups. \u201cDuring the early stages of marketing your company, video marketing is so incredibly important because, more often than not, you have to rely on utilizing your founders&#8217; personality and story to sell early adapters on why they should take a chance on you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Early-stage companies and small businesses are in the same boat here. Next year, Stephanie expects more company founders to appear in social videos. She said this will \u201chighlight not just the value of your product, but the team behind your product to help develop trust between you and early customers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>By creating connections and building trust, video marketing can have real long-term impacts on brand affinity. We\u2019re expecting to see plenty of real faces to help with that next year.<\/p>\n<h3><span>6.

With that many people logging into social media, it\u2019s a guarantee that your audience is reachable. It\u2019s just a matter of finding them.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most effective ways to grow your brand\u2019s reach across is<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/10\/social-media-video-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> short-form video marketing content on social media<\/a>.

Given the ever-shortening of attention spans, the ability to narrate your brand&#8217;s visual stories in a succinct and engaging manner is essential for success.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><span>7. L<\/span><span>ong-form video content returns<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Short-form video is here to stay for another year\u2014at least. But video marketing experts are also expecting a renewed focus on other kinds of video in 2024.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI&#8217;m hopeful for more long-form content in 2024,\u201d said van Beuzekom. \u201cThere&#8217;s more room for creativity vs. just trying to make something fast, like in short form.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>They point specifically to an increase in<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/03\/how-to-advertise-on-youtube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> YouTube video marketing and advertising<\/a>.

That means YouTube is a great place for your recorded podcasts, your explainer videos, even your event recaps\u2014which leads us to the next trend.<\/p>\n<h3><span>8. More videos will be made without sound<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span>Did you know that, in 2017, <a href=\"https:\/\/digiday.com\/media\/silent-world-facebook-video\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">85%<\/a><\/span> of Facebook videos were watched without sound? This video marketing trend is back, as many users are now consuming even more social video content without sound. In fact, users spend an average of <span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/433871\/daily-social-media-usage-worldwide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">151 minutes each day<\/a><\/span> on social platforms interacting with content, including videos with and without sound.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a lot of<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/22\/instagram-reels-ideas-for-businesses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Instagram Reels<\/a> watched in the office, in waiting rooms, in bed beside a partner\u2014without sound. If this is how users are consuming content, it should be easy to understand why this video marketing trend is continuing to grow.<\/p>\n<p>Now, there are more tools than ever to help make sure silent videos are effective with complete, accurate captions. Plus, AI tools will make this easier for marketing teams to do, even without video expertise. This leads to our final video marketing trend.<\/p>\n<h3><span>9. Brands will focus on thrifty video marketing<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This past year has been a rough one for tech. With\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/11\/30\/tech-layoffs-2023-list\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over 220k<\/a> layoffs last year and the reduced <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-budget\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing budgets<\/a> impacting the industry\u2019s freelancers, thrift is going to be a video marketing trend in 2024.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier, Finn pointed to efficiency as an additional benefit of switching to product videos instead of written documentation. Warren also specifically referenced doing more with less as \u201canother trend that is expected to continue into 2024, especially as tech and media companies regain momentum following a challenging 2023.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, the rise of AI editing and more easy-to-use <span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/06\/13\/video-ad-tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video ad tools <\/a><\/span>will help marketers create some clips even without a video background.
