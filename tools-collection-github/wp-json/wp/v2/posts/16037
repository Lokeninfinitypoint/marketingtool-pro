There are so many factors that contribute to the success of any display campaign \u2013 not the least of which is what part of that huge potential audiences you decide to target.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, I will be discussing ways for you to leverage Custom Affinity Audiences in order to run more efficient advertising campaigns across the Google Display Network.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/custom-affinity-audiences-targeting.png\" alt=\"targeting-options-custom-affinity-audiences\" width=\"626\" height=\"272\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If you\u2019ve browsed around the Google Ads interface, you may well have seen this option \u2013 it\u2019s buried somewhere in the Audiences tab. More specifically, it pops up when you select \u201cWhat their interests and habits are.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There are tons of different methods that allow you to define the audience that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/04\/display-ads\">your banner ads<\/a> will reach, and Google does a great job of working with their data to allow you to select predefined audiences that are based on their interests, habits, searching patterns, and interactions with your site. But quite often you\u2019ll find these audiences far too broad.<\/p>\n<h2>What Are Affinity Audiences?<\/h2>\n<p>Firstly, let\u2019s quickly define what \u201cAffinity Audiences\u201d are in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/21\/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheat-sheet\">Google Ads audience targeting<\/a>, before we dive into the world of <em>custom<\/em>. You can think of affinity audiences as similar to TV audiences \u2013 wildly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/09\/28\/generational-marketing-tactics\">generalized types of people<\/a> that watch your varying TV channels. So BBC One would represent (kind of) older demographics, people interested in politics and news, whereas E4 would represent your younger demographics (I guess), perhaps those chilling around in their university dorms&#8230; you get the idea. Although there is some truth in this system of categorization, it is very broad and presumptuous.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/custom-affinity-audiences-crowd.jpg\" alt=\"crowd-custom-affinity-audiences\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Google accomplishes something similar by piecing together acquirable information from a particular user \u2013 the pages they frequently visit, the time they spend on different sites, their search patterns, etc. The outcome is a list of predetermined audiences organized by affinity, or predisposition toward, such as \u201cSports Fans,\u201d \u201cFood &amp; Dining,\u201d and \u201cTravel.\u201d But remember, these are large TV-style audiences. It\u2019s not a perfect science.<\/p>\n<p>This is where custom affinity audiences really show their worth: the ability to define your very own audience, allowing you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/27\/facebook-ad-targeting-options-infographic\">more control over who sees your ads<\/a> (and we love control and transparency).<\/p>\n<h2>What Are Custom Affinity Audiences?<\/h2>\n<p><em>Note: Custom intent and custom affinity audiences have merged and are now simply called <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/19\/google-custom-audiences\">custom audiences<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The criteria for setting up a custom affinity audience or CAA is to think of a minimum of five different <strong>interests, URLs, places, or apps<\/strong> that best define <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/15\/audience-targeting\">the audience that you are trying to target<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Now in my experience, places and apps aren\u2019t particularly useful, and they also limit your reach. You can target your perfect niche audience just through URLs and interests.<\/p>\n<p>Setting these up are really easy: find the audiences tab within an ad group of your choice, click the \u201cWhat their interests and habits are\u201d section, and you\u2019ll see towards the bottom that there is an option to create a Custom Affinity Audience. It will ask you what you want to name your audience, and you can choose to give it a pleasant description if you fancy. I\u2019ve gone ahead and pretended that I want to target <em>Protein Bar Lovers<\/em>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/custom-affinity-audiences-name-description.png\" alt=\"name-and-description-custom-affinity-audiences\" width=\"615\" height=\"484\" \/><\/div>\n<p>I\u2019ve used a combination of five interests (entered as keywords) and two URLs. For specificity, it\u2019s far better to select specific page URLs rather than a website\u2019s domain or homepage.<\/p>\n<p>What happens in the background here is that Google will analyse the URLs I\u2019ve provided to get a good idea of the audience I\u2019m after from the contents of those pages. If we were to target \u201cwww.myprotein.com\u201d as a whole, my audience would change massively \u2013 from users who are specifically interested in protein bars to users interested in supplements, sports clothing, workout plans, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Now that wouldn\u2019t be cost-effective advertising if my imaginary business only sold protein bars\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>When to Use Custom Affinity Audiences<\/h2>\n<p>Do any of the initiatives below describe your advertising goals?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Branding<\/li>\n<li>More controlled <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/10\/google-display-network-targeting\">targeting on GDN<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Advertising <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/29\/custom-intent-audiences-youtube\">tailored content to specific people<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Increasing market reach while driving valuable actions on your site<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Considering the very nature of the way we set CAAs up, they are practical for so many different businesses and situations. There are literally millions of different ways we can reach relevant audiences, simply by playing around with different items (interests, URLs, places, apps).<\/p>\n<p>Even if you\u2019re a brand new business selling tennis racquets, although the market place is inevitably going to be enormous and fiercely competitive, you can still think of strategic ways to target relevant users, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/10\/brand-awareness\">raise your brand awareness<\/a> while making sure it\u2019s highly cost-effective.<\/p>\n<h2>Strategies for Making the Most of Custom Affinity Audiences<\/h2>\n<p>Hopefully, now that you understand Custom Affinity Audiences better, you\u2019re inspired to give it a go. Now I\u2019ll share with you a couple of ways that I\u2019ve used CAAs to target relevant audiences.<\/p>\n<h3>Top Performing Placements<\/h3>\n<p>If you have ever run reasonable amounts of display activity, or if you currently are, then pull out a \u201cWhere ads showed\u201d report. You\u2019ll want to sort your placements by your chosen measurement metric (such as \u201cConv. Rate,\u201d \u201cAvg. session duration\u201d etc.) and analyze which ones perform the best, but make sure you have enough data to make this analysis reliable. You don\u2019t want to choose a supposedly excellent placement if it\u2019s based on two clicks.<\/p>\n<p>Get your top 10 placements, and place them into a Custom Affinity Audience. Et voila! Strategy one complete.<\/p>\n<p>The theory here is that for some reason, users who are advertised to on certain placements resonate with your business better than others. By selecting these into a CAA, we\u2019re prompting Google to analyze these placements, defining the audience that engages with your business from those placements, and to go on and find users on the world wide web that fit the bill.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/custom-affinity-audiences-spreadsheet.jpg\" alt=\"report-custom-affinity-audiences\" width=\"602\" height=\"209\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The picture above is a quick export of some placement data. My measurement metric is Conv. Rate (on the far right hand side). I can quickly gather which placement URLs perform well, and put them into my CAA.<\/p>\n<h3>Competitor Targeting<\/h3>\n<p>Custom Affinity Audiences offer a fantastic way to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/09\/competitor-keywords\">reach your competition\u2019s audience<\/a>. By using a competitor\u2019s site or specific pages on their site as URL targets and entering their brand keywords as interests, you can efficiently target relevant users on the GDN.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on who your competitors are, simply doing the above will be enough. But in some cases you\u2019ll need to manage this targeting more closely. If your competitors are enormous, then you\u2019ll want to target page-specific URLs, and you\u2019ll probably want to create a singular campaign for that competitor CAA, to be able to better manage the budget and spend.<\/p>\n<p>Alternatively, you might be targeting your small competitors in a local region. In which case, throw your competitor\u2019s domain into the URL section, and expand on the interest items a bit more \u2013 include the services or products you are competing on, as well as their brand.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/custom-affinity-audiences-competitors.png\" alt=\"competition-custom-affinity-audiences\" width=\"1256\" height=\"618\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Here\u2019s what you might do if you were a local massage clinic, offering physio and sports massages.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Event Attendees<\/h3>\n<p>Another great way to reach relevant users is by targeting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/25\/event-marketing\">trade shows, conventions and conferences<\/a>. The people that attend these events are likely to be more engaged with your products or services over anybody else. These people literally pay to attend these types of events, so you\u2019d think they\u2019d be interested in the said product or service.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ll use SMX London as an example: a conference run each year which promotes the latest updates in the digital marketing world. If my target audience was digital marketing fanatics, then I\u2019ve found a jackpot audience.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ll take the most relevant URL \u201chttps:\/\/marketinglandevents.com\/smx\/london\/\u201d, key in various interests such as \u201cdigital marketing,\u201d \u201csearch marketing,\u201d \u201cSEO,\u201d \u201cPPC,\u201d and there we go \u2013 Google should now understand the audience we\u2019re defining and will target your ads to them.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/custom-affinity-audiences-smx-london.jpg\" alt=\"marketing-land-event-custom-affinity-audiences\" width=\"1373\" height=\"951\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>User Behavior<\/h3>\n<p>In the scenario of owning a tennis racquet business, targeting interests such as \u201cimprove tennis serve,\u201d \u201cforehand tennis tips,\u201d \u201ctennis practice\u201d may pay dividends.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s why. This target audience will give us a better shot of getting in front of a more active user than just targeting \u201ctennis enthusiasts\u201d (an example of a predefined Affinity Audience). Users who are looking to improve their tennis don\u2019t just watch it, they play tennis, with racquets. At least we know we have a better chance going with this route, as opposed to the basic affinity audience.<\/p>\n<p>By <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/28\/behavioral-segmentation\">narrowing audience segments by behavior<\/a>, you are able to target users <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/04\/nurture-marketing\">lower down the conversion funnel<\/a>.The funnel metaphor is used because there are loads of people at the top of the funnel who are remotely connected with the sport of tennis, but as we improve our targeting \u2013 yes, the volume of prospects drops, but the likelihood of converting a prospect into business increases. Making sure we target the lower funnel is cost-effective!<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/custom-affinity-audiences-funnel.jpg\" alt=\"sales-funnel-custom-affinity-audiences\" width=\"706\" height=\"488\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>Custom Affinity Audiences: A Mini Case Study<\/h2>\n<p>I thought I\u2019d share with you a quick preview of the results I have achieved for a client of mine, who works in the legal industry. The legal sector is one of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/27\/most-expensive-keywords\">the most expensive<\/a> to advertise in, with the average CPC for this client hitting \u00a38.11 (\u201cAll Time\u201d data). I was convinced we could target relevant audiences through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/09\/ad-design\">display advertising<\/a> at a tiny fraction of the CPC.<\/p>\n<p>So, naturally, I turned to Custom Affinity Audiences, defining my custom audience by thinking about what prospects might search to get the legal advice my client offered. I married keyword interests with websites that prospects would browse through \u2013 websites that offered advice, compared legal firms, and also included some of my client\u2019s competitor websites.<\/p>\n<p>The results were remarkable! Concluding the first six weeks of launching the display campaign, we had managed to acquire conversions at 18.77% of the price compared to search. Let me share with you the stats below:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/custom-affinity-audiences-campaign.png\" alt=\"campaign-report-custom-affinity-audiences\" width=\"559\" height=\"99\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This six-week trial period proved just how successful display could be for this particular lead gen client.<\/p>\n<h2>Key Learnings<\/h2>\n<p>Custom Affinity Audiences allow for more control on the GDN. They perform best as a creative way to reach new users in a cost-effective way, and help to drive incremental conversions.
