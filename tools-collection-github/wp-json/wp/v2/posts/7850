What\u2019s the difference? Client relationships.

Even better, they make everyday work more enjoyable for all.<\/p>\n<p>So what makes for a strong client relationship? The same traits that define any good relationship: awareness, communication, empathy, dependability, accountability, honesty, and the list goes on.<\/p>\n<p>In this post, I\u2019ve compiled 11 ways your agency can demonstrate the above and more to achieve the best possible outcomes for you and your clients.

Take the time to really internalize it so that it shines through organically in everything you do.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gather the information in person (or video):<\/strong> Body language and facial expressions tell a lot. Take note of what gets them excited (and not so excited). Also, be sure to send out a list of the questions you\u2019ll be asking far in advance so the client can have time to think about answers and produce follow-up questions.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Iterate back:<\/strong> As you listen, iterate back to your client what you have interpreted so you can make sure you\u2019re crystal clear on the information you\u2019re receiving. Remember, incorporating the tiniest details into your proposal and execution is what will give your clients confidence that you truly understand their needs.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Templatize:<\/strong> Have an internal templated document where you can collect all of the information you\u2019ve gathered in one place. This gives every team member something to continually refer back to, and the uniformity makes it easier to internalize.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"Go-above-and-beyond-with-your-proposal\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Go above and beyond with your proposal<\/h3>\n<ol start=\"3\"><\/ol>\n<p>From a project standpoint, your proposal shows what you\u2019re going to do to achieve your client\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/marketing-plan-goals-objectives-for-small-businesses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">goals<\/a>. From a relationship standpoint, it\u2019s your opportunity to reinforce, once again, that you have a deep understanding of your client\u2014both the business and its team members. Speak to both the client\u2019s business goals as well as the more personal pain points and desires of its employees.<\/p>\n<p>To do this, think in terms of \u201cwhat,\u201d \u201cwhy,\u201d and \u201cso that.\u201d<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The what refers to what you\u2019ll be doing from a process standpoint.<\/li>\n<li>The why ties the process to one of the business\u2019s specific goals.<\/li>\n<li>The \u201cso that\u201d speaks to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/28\/pain-points\">pain point<\/a> it will address for the business\u2019s team members.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For example, we\u2019d like to ramp up ad spending in the latter half of the month to drive more signups so that your sales team isn\u2019t scrounging for leads.

Treat clients like partners<\/h3>\n<p>Treating your client like a business will make your relationship purely transactional (i.e., no relationship at all). Treating them like family leaves too much room for miscommunications and unmet expectations.<\/p>\n<p>Treating your clients like partners, on the other hand, sets the stage for a healthy mix of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/08\/personal-branding\">personal<\/a>, purposeful, and transactional encounters where both your and your client\u2019s identities are preserved, and each of you supplies the essential ingredients for success.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Embrace the truth: <\/strong>Remember that at the end of the day, both of you are businesses that want to make money. There\u2019s no need to skirt around that. They need your service to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/18\/best-webinar-platforms\">generate revenue<\/a>, and you need their continued business to generate yours.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Maintain structure with some fluidity:<\/strong> Keep deliverables clear and stick to the intended plan as much as possible, but always leave the door open for input and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/01\/24\/customer-feedback\">feedback<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Let them in: <\/strong>While some of your tools and processes may be proprietary, give them access to dashboards and data when possible. Let them in on (non-confidential) tidbits about your agency that \u201coutsiders\u201d wouldn\u2019t know. Their earning your trust is just as important as you earning theirs.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Stay honest:<\/strong> This means giving pushback on your client\u2019s desires or requests that may not be best for long-term success (wants vs needs). A <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-to-look-for-in-a-digital-marketing-partner\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">good partnership<\/a> is not one where both parties constantly agree; it\u2019s one where the two parties come together with different perspectives to bring to the table, resulting in better output than either one could have achieved on their own.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"Be-proactive-rather-than-reactive\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. Be proactive rather than reactive<\/h3>\n<ol start=\"6\"><\/ol>\n<p>Akvile DeFazio, President of AKvertise, makes this a priority with clients.<\/p>\n<p>Her team makes sure to proactively:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Share ideas and propose new campaign strategies.<\/li>\n<li>Forewarn about upcoming <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/10\/modified-broad-match-going-away\">platform changes<\/a> and any action required.<\/li>\n<li>Educate the client to empower them further.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u201cThis shows care and builds trust, and our clients share that they appreciate our diligent proactivity,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we work with clients, we aim to be a seamless extension of their team and genuinely embed ourselves as so. When they win, we win, and proactive communication is the key to success for all.\u201d<\/p>\n<div id=\"Be-empathetic-rather-than-defensive\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. Be empathetic rather than defensive<\/h3>\n<p>This recommendation from Mark Irvine, Director of PPC at Search Labs Digital, ties back to the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/search-marketing\/5-things-youre-missing-out-without-search-marketing-partner\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">partnership<\/a> mentality in tip #5. The scenario here is that your agency is doing great work.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/marketing-performance-metrics\"> Performance metrics<\/a> continue to climb. But the client is upset. They aren\u2019t seeing new business come in.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA wrong response here is to dig your heels in,\u201d Mark says. \u201cTelling them that their business is doing fine is at best tone-deaf. Instead, let them talk it out and listen to them. This may even lead them to discover the problem is in their other marketing or sales teams.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If this ends up being the case, Irvine recommends that you take yourself out of the problem to prevent it from becoming an \u201cus versus them\u201d situation. Take the approach of teaming up together to come up with a solution. Use language like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cI see what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cThis is a valid concern.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cThat really is frustrating, we\u2019re glad you brought this up with us.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cLet\u2019s make a plan to review this and report back with some solutions to remedy this.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Position yourself as a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/seo\/working-with-seo-partner\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">partner<\/a> in their campaigns. Value their feedback. Even if you\u2019re an expert, allowing them to work with you will help build a long, trusting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/09\/crm-for-small-business\">relationship<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd remember,\u201d Mark adds, \u201cif you dismiss or fight their concerns, there\u2019s an agency sales rep somewhere else who will be happy to listen to them vent about you all day.\u201d<\/p>\n<div id=\"Establish-structure-around-communication\"><\/div>\n<h3>8. Establish structure around communication<\/h3>\n<p>Brett McHale, founder of Empiric Marketing, LLC, provides some great tips around communication and setting boundaries:<\/p>\n<h4>Stay away from being \u201calways available<\/h4>\n<p>Being always available, whether through Slack or other forms of direct communication, blurs the ever-important work-life balance. It can also distract you away from other clients.<\/p>\n<h4>Hold regular meetings with actionable takeaways<\/h4>\n<p>Instead, establish weekly or bi-weekly meetings to check in, review performance, and answer questions. \u201cI always have some takeaway or action item from those meetings,\u201d Brett says. \u201cThis keeps me accountable, and when I deliver on things that I say I\u2019m going to do, it helps build trust with the client.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>Use email and instant messaging<\/h4>\n<p>Brett says, \u201cEmail can be very robotic, and I try not to be too professional or polished all the time. Communicating with clients directly via a messenger helps to build rapport and have a more laid back \u2018human-to-human\u2019 relationship.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He suggests designating instant messaging for urgent matters and email otherwise. This cuts out the back-and-forth emailing and also reassures your clients that while you may not always be available, you will never leave them hanging.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/strengthen-agency-client-relationships-communication-1.jpg\" alt=\"how to strengthen relationships with clients the seven c's of effective communication\" width=\"512\" height=\"528\" \/><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.open.edu\/openlearn\/ocw\/mod\/oucontent\/view.php?id=98509&amp;section=_unit2.5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"Share-your-concerns-early\"><\/div>\n<h3>9. Share your concerns early<\/h3>\n<p>This suggestion from Mark Irvine is particularly relevant to the many <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/10\/05\/state-of-the-digital-marketing-agency-2023\">changes happening in the advertising realm<\/a> lately. The scenario here is that your client has big plans and aspirations, and you want to say yes to everything they want. But in the back of your mind, you\u2019re not sure if they can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/04\/19\/google-custom-audiences\">create that audience in Google<\/a> or build that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/25\/bings-ads-vs-google-adwords\">campaign on Bing<\/a>. You\u2019re unsure of how the new iOS updates will impact their Facebook targeting.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t nod, say yes, and then stress,\u201d Mark says. \u201cYou lose trust with your client if you say you can do something and then can\u2019t, even if that\u2019s not your fault.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Instead, show your expertise by sharing your concerns. Practice saying:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cThat\u2019s a really good idea. I know that some ad policies might come into play as we explore it, so let me double-check those first.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cThis new change could pose some challenges to us. I\u2019ll keep an eye on it as it changes over the coming days.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cIt\u2019s tough to say what this means for us yet, but I wanted to make sure we all knew about it in advance.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you really have to put your foot down, try something like:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cWe agree that this is a great idea, but we can\u2019t in good conscience proceed with it until we know that it won\u2019t cost you in the long run.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Be transparent and ask them for their trust. Most of the time, you\u2019ll come out as the person who helped them navigate through uncertainty, and they won\u2019t forget that.<\/p>\n<div id=\"Embrace-the-small-talk\"><\/div>\n<h3>10. Embrace small talk<\/h3>\n<p>Small talk often gets a bad rap, but Susie Marino, WordStream\u2019s Senior Content Marketing Specialist and former Customer Success Specialist, has found that it actually helps with building strong client relationships.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI know it can feel cringey or uncomfortable at first, but just go for it,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised at how receptive clients are. Next thing you know, you\u2019ve got a great rapport going, and the banter at the beginning of meetings becomes more meaningful.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople love to talk about themselves, and clients are no different,\u201d Susie adds. \u201cWhen you ask them about how that home garden is coming along, they\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised. These conversations reveal how much you truly care.\u201c<\/p>\n<p>Clients are people who like to work with real people who also have personalities and personal lives. If you don\u2019t show a touch of personality with small talk, it will be harder to stay connected and to demonstrate your genuine care, outside of campaigns and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/17\/content-marketing-kpis\">metrics<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"Have-quarterly-business-reviews\"><\/div>\n<h3>11. Establish quarterly business reviews<\/h3>\n<p>Francine Rodriguez, former Senior Manager of Customer Success at WordStream, believes that quarterly business reviews are essential for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/01\/04\/client-retention-tips\">client retention<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think all agencies get into a cycle of monthly reporting and proving that deliverables were completed,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is important to take that step back once a quarter and have a focused conversation on high-level strategy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The QBR allows the agency and the customer to reflect on new goals, the efficiency of strategies taken in the past, and what needs to pivot for the future.<\/p>\n<p>It is also a time to allow your customer to provide insight into how their business goals are changing and perhaps what strategies outside of the agency\u2019s scope they are also planning in the near future. Having that dedicated time to talk without existing action items on the table is a great way to strengthen the relationship, create trust, and become better partners.<\/p>\n<p>It may also lead to surprising discoveries, where an agency could find opportunities to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/30\/cross-selling-upselling\">upsell<\/a> its customers into new services. If your agency is doing QBRs now and your conversations don\u2019t look any different from your regular monthly check-ins, it is time to change the format!\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Start cultivating strong relationships with your clients today<\/h2>\n<p>Strong agency-client relationships are built on virtues like trust, reliability, transparency, and personability, and they result in greater outcomes for everyone involved. If you find that you\u2019re lacking in productivity, loyalty, or the overall feel of harmony with your clients, see if you can adopt or improve any of these strategies for your agency:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Gather \u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d information about your client<\/li>\n<li>Internalize that information<\/li>\n<li>Go above and beyond with your proposal<\/li>\n<li>Have an onboarding process<\/li>\n<li>Treat clients like partners<\/li>\n<li>Be proactive rather than reactive<\/li>\n<li>Be empathetic rather than defensive<\/li>\n<li>Establish structure around communication<\/li>\n<li>Share your concerns early<\/li>\n<li>Embrace the small talk<\/li>\n<li>Have quarterly business reviews<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Here are 11 ways your agency can build strong client relationships that translate into better productivity, greater loyalty, and
