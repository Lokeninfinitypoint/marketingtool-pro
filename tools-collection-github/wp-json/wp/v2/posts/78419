Optimizing Performance Max campaigns? Well, that can be much more difficult.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, Google recently released a new beta feature for Performance Max campaigns called \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/14179631?sjid=9794266004901960563-NA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search themes<\/a>\u201d designed to help advertisers better target their ads with a similar keyword-inspired approach that most advertisers are used to.

Advertisers can provide search themes to Google to share how they expect their customers to search for their products or services.<\/p>\n<p>With this additional context, Google can consider these search themes as new signals to target audiences based on their search behavior. Google may use these search themes to better <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/performance-max\">refine their Performance Max<\/a> campaign targets, or to reach new relevant placements on the SERP and beyond.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/google-ads-search-themes-performance-max.webp\" alt=\"google ads search themes in performance max campaigns\" width=\"845\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-78423\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/google-ads-search-themes-performance-max.webp 845w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/google-ads-search-themes-performance-max-480x341.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 845px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Search themes is an optional feature in Performance Max campaigns. However, we\u2019ve seen time and time again that Performance Max campaigns perform the best when they\u2019re given better signals, so I\u2019d encourage you to provide Google with at least a few search themes to give Google enough signals to optimize your campaigns with. Advertisers can provide up to 25 search themes per asset group.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\uded1 Worried you&#8217;re wasting spend in Google Ads?

These audience segments will automatically be upgraded to Search Themes.<\/p>\n<p>Previously known as \u201cCustom Intent\u201d audiences, these audiences used very similar signals to the new Search themes, effectively targeting people based on their past searches on Google. Since this audience signal is so similar to Google\u2019s new \u201csearch themes\u201d beta, the automatic upgrade in 2024 is unlikely to negatively impact campaign performance. Hopefully, it streamlines workflows and makes signal management easier for advertisers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/google-ads-search-themes-custom-segment.webp\" alt=\"google ads search themes in performance max replacing custom segments\" width=\"753\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-78424\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/google-ads-search-themes-custom-segment.webp 753w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/google-ads-search-themes-custom-segment-480x381.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 753px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Custom segments based on previous search activities will continue to function uninterrupted in other campaign types, including search campaigns.

Advertisers who are running both Performance Max campaigns and search campaigns will often run into issues where both campaign types are targeting the same searches and risk serving different ad experiences to the same searches or struggle to manage the two campaigns synchronously. Using search themes in Performance Max may ease some of those issues for advertisers.<\/p>\n<p>In these issues where multiple campaigns or ad groups are eligible to serve an ad to a searcher, <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2756257?sjid=9794266004901960563-NA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google prioritizes exact match keywords<\/a> that are identical to the search above all others. Google\u2019s new Search themes are treated as a lower priority, equal to that of phrase and broad match keywords.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/google-ads-search-themes-match-types.webp\" alt=\"google ads search themes - match types prioritized in google ads\" width=\"936\" height=\"504\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-78427\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/google-ads-search-themes-match-types.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/google-ads-search-themes-match-types-480x258.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Your exact match keywords in your search campaigns will also take priority over your Performance Max campaigns\u2013so they\u2019re still a must-have for advertisers now.<\/p>\n<div id=\"best-practices-for-search-themes\"><\/div>\n<h2>Best practices for using search themes in Performance Max campaigns<\/h2>\n<p>While nearly all additional data and context will help these Performance Max campaigns continue to improve, advertisers can make the most of search themes in their accounts by following a few tips.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Use search themes to provide information missing from your landing pages<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019ve just launched a new product or website, your landing page may not include every single feature, benefit, use, value, and detail that a searcher might consider\u2013and that\u2019s okay! In fact, a clean and simplified <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/landing-page-optimization\">landing page may help more people convert<\/a> on your site.<\/p>\n<p>If Google can\u2019t find that context from your landing page\u2013fret not. Liberally use search themes in your Performance Max campaigns to provide those extra signals to Google so it best understands what your audience may be looking for and can optimize its placements accordingly.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Be direct\u2014especially when using ulterior brand messaging<\/h3>\n<p>What does direct mean? Well, consider the well-known fast-casual restaurant Hooters. If you were to just read their website or its descriptions, you might mistakenly describe their business as a chicken wings restaurant. But we all know that there are a few missing keywords in that description that serve their core value prop and distinguish them from similar competitors.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s nothing shameful about having hidden benefits that you don\u2019t expressly convey within your ads or on your website. Maybe your hotel welcomes all but is known best for catering to families, tourists, a religious community, foreign-speaking nationals, or people recovering from a nearby medical procedure, or maybe it has a history of being haunted. You might not want to explicitly write some of that on your website or within your ads\u2014but if someone is specifically looking for a paranormal vacation a Sabbath-friendly accommodation, or a sanctuary nearby their treatment, advertisers can use search themes to better signal their ads within a Performance Max campaign.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Maximize your varied and unique search themes<\/h3>\n<p>Advertisers are allowed up to 25 search themes within each asset group. Generally, the more signals you can provide to Google, the better your Performance Max campaigns will perform. However, quantity isn\u2019t the only factor in quality.<\/p>\n<p>Treat your search themes similar to how you\u2019d treat broad match keywords in your search campaigns\u2013make sure that they aren\u2019t effectively the same signal. For example, the search themes \u201ccar\u201d and \u201cautomobile\u201d will reach the exact same audience and won\u2019t improve performance incrementally.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Consider competitor terms as search themes<\/h3>\n<p>Especially if you\u2019re a new brand on the market\u2013this will help Google more quickly understand who your prospects are currently searching for. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/06\/12\/bidding-on-competitor-brands\">Google allows bidding on your competitors&#8217; keywords<\/a> (in many cases) within your search campaigns and includes your competitor&#8217;s brands and product names as search themes. Before implementing this strategy, however, make sure that you understand any local laws or regulations about how you can advertise on competitor brands and trademarks.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Use traditional search campaigns alongside your Performance Max campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>Search themes are a powerful signal to add to your Performance Max campaigns. Even though your Performance Max campaigns will automatically target the search network, don\u2019t neglect the importance of your search campaigns on their own.<\/p>\n<p>Use search themes within your Performance Max campaigns to find new placements and scale incremental traffic and continue to apply that found insight to your search campaigns. As you build your search campaigns, be sure to incorporate exact match keywords so that they take priority over your Performance Max search theme signals, and you can continue to target, optimize, and refine your newfound traffic.<\/p>\n<h2>Use search themes the right way in Performance Max campaigns<\/h2>\n<p>Google\u2019s new search themes beta will help advertisers share their human expertise and provide better signals to their machine learning powered Performance Max campaigns. Search themes gives you a little more control over your Performance Max campaigns, making them more effective and tailored for your audience.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We&#8217;re breaking down all the
