Here are the seven steps to create a brand messaging framework that works best for your business.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Start with your brand\u2019s mission statement<\/h3>\n<p>The tricky part of creating a brand messaging framework is you may find yourself in a \u201cwhat came first? The chicken or the egg?\u201d situation. Your<em> brand messaging<\/em> should be crafted around your business\u2019s mission statement&#8230;but you need a strong <em>brand messaging framework <\/em>to create the best mission statement possible.<\/p>\n<p>That said, your mission statement can help structure your brand messaging framework around your business\u2019s core objectives. So, using this post on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/02\/how-to-write-a-business-mission-statement\">how to write a mission statement<\/a>, try circling in on your business\u2019s mission statement as the first step to a good brand messaging framework. Then, once your framework is set and you start implementing your brand messaging, you can always go back to tweak and perfect your mission statement accordingly.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Set goals<\/h3>\n<p>Your goals are going to indicate what you want your brand messaging to ultimately achieve. Be sure to take inventory of your business\u2019s short and long-term goals in marketing so you can assess what your brand messaging framework should be working towards.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if one of your goals is to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/lead-generation-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">get more leads<\/a>, you likely will be looking to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/14\/increase-traffic-to-my-website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">drive more traffic to your website<\/a> so that potential customers can fill out a contact form or call your business. With that in mind, you could create a brand message that entices customers with an \u201call online\u201d process.<\/p>\n<p>For reference, here are some of the top goals that drive most business\u2019s brand messaging:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/brand-messaging-goals-chart.jpg\" alt=\"brand messaging - goals for brand content chart \" width=\"936\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76877 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/brand-messaging-goals-chart.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/brand-messaging-goals-chart-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3. Research your target market<\/h3>\n<p>Brand messaging isn\u2019t only about what you say, but also <em>how<\/em> you say it, and more importantly, to <em>whom <\/em>you say it. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">Knowing your target audience<\/a> is key to crafting the perfect brand messaging that resonates with them, relates to them, and ultimately convinces them to do business with you. This might feel silly at first but take a moment to picture your ideal customer. Think about:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What they might look like<\/li>\n<li>Their lifestyle<\/li>\n<li>Their job<\/li>\n<li>Their income<\/li>\n<li>The family and friends they might have<\/li>\n<li>The devices or platforms they might use and when they\u2019d be on them<\/li>\n<li>Where they live<\/li>\n<li>What they do for fun<\/li>\n<li>The types of content or brands they enjoy<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Considering <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/target-market-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">target market<\/a> traits like these can help you pinpoint how to correctly craft and deliver your brand messaging.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if your home services business is targeting middle-aged homeowners, you might focus on a \u00a0family-friendly brand message since your potential customers likely prioritize family time. Next, you could decide to include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/09\/09\/what-ott-advertising\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OTT advertising<\/a> (like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/06\/hulu-advertising\">Hulu Ads<\/a>) as a key marketing channel in your brand messaging framework, since your audience is likely streaming home renovation shows.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Analyze your competitors\u2019 brand messaging<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019m not suggesting this brand messaging framework step so that you can duplicate or tease your competitors\u2019 messaging in your own content. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/explodingtopics.com\/blog\/branding-stats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">two-thirds<\/a> of consumers think it\u2019s annoying when brands make fun of their competitors. So, you don\u2019t want to do competitor analysis just to create a defensive brand messaging framework.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, use the brand messaging of your competitors to get a feel for what you may or may not prefer in your own content. Seeing how your competitors present themselves can help you understand what the standards might be in your industry and how you can set yourself apart.<\/p>\n<p>Try these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/09\/21\/competitive-analysis-templates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">competitive analysis templates<\/a> to guide your research.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/competitive-analysis-basic-marketing-template.webp\" alt=\"basic competitive analysis template example screenshot from wordstream\" width=\"936\" height=\"506\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76073 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/competitive-analysis-basic-marketing-template.webp 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/competitive-analysis-basic-marketing-template-480x259.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>5. Set your unique brand voice and tone guidelines<\/h3>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, your brand messaging framework is, essentially, a set of guidelines to help shape your marketing communications. With that is going to come some rule setting. You\u2019ll want a set of standards in place to make it easy for your team to follow your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/small-business-branding-basics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brand guidelines<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This includes any notes or examples of your ideal tone and voice depending on what works best with your audience. You may also want to refer to your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/small-business-brand-kit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brand kit<\/a> for any grammar, font, or creative preferences that could impact how your brand messaging comes across.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Identify core terms, keywords, and CTAs<\/h3>\n<p>To easily maintain your brand messaging throughout your marketing journey, try sticking to a short list of buzzwords, keywords, or calls to action that your team can keep coming back to. This helps to ensure your brand messaging stays consistent over time since you\u2019ll continuously use the same core terms that reinforce your business\u2019s purpose. Plus, ideally, your brand messaging is also aligned with your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/05\/seo-strategy\">SEO strategy<\/a>, so that your brand messaging across your online assets can help you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/06\/how-to-rank-higher-on-google\">rank for top keywords<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd0d Use our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a> to find out which terms you need to include in your brand messaging!<\/p>\n<h3><span>7. Try following the 3 C\u2019s<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>You may have already heard of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cxnetwork.com\/cx-experience\/articles\/the-3-cs-of-brand-messaging-consistency-clarity#:~:text=and%20expert%20webinars-,What%20is%20the%203%20Cs%20model%20of%20brand%20messaging%3F,%3A%20consistency%2C%20clarity%20and%20character.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3 c\u2019s for brand messaging<\/a>, but let\u2019s take a deeper dive into what these \u201cc\u2019s\u201d actually mean when constructing your brand messaging framework. The 3 cs for brand messaging stand for consistency, clarity, and character. Here\u2019s a breakdown of each:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Consistency: <\/strong>Your brand messaging should align with your business\u2019s style and reinforce your unique personality. You never want your audience to see your brand messaging out of context and not recognize what business it\u2019s associated with. Be sure you keep to the same types of brand messages over time, so your audience becomes familiar with your business.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Clarity: <\/strong>Your brand messaging should be crystal clear and to the point. More importantly, your brand messaging should always be concise. With smaller screens and shorter attention spans, you need to get your point across quickly and efficiently.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Character: <\/strong>Don\u2019t be afraid to get creative with your brand messaging to help your business stand out!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/brand-messaging-3-c.jpg\" alt=\"brand messaging - graphic of the 3 c's of brand messaging\" width=\"936\" height=\"429\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76899 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/brand-messaging-3-c.jpg 936w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/brand-messaging-3-c-480x220.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-use-your-brand-messaging\"><\/div>\n<h2>When and how to use your brand messaging framework<\/h2>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve followed the steps above to complete your own brand messaging framework, it\u2019s time to put it into practice! Here\u2019s how:<\/p>\n<h3>When<em> not <\/em>to use your brand messaging framework<\/h3>\n<p>Since your brand messaging will inevitably be involved in most of your marketing efforts, it\u2019s easier to name off when you<em> shouldn\u2019t<\/em> take brand messaging into consideration. Let\u2019s talk through a couple of examples. You don\u2019t necessarily need to refer to your brand messaging framework when you\u2019re&#8230;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Working with an influencer<\/strong>. Okay, I know <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/digital-marketing\/influencer-marketing-tips\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">influencer marketing<\/a> is a brand-heavy initiative. However, keep in mind that most influencers already have their own content style. Plus, today\u2019s audiences can see right through inauthentic or forced content. So, while you want any influencer-sponsored content to align with your brand, try not to push the influencer to abide by your brand messaging framework. Instead, find influencers with a content style that already fits well within your industry, and trust them to create a post that will speak best to <em>their <\/em>audience (which is ultimately who you\u2019re trying to reach in this case).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Partnering with another business<\/strong>. Similar to my point about working with influencers above, you may need to find a compromise when combining marketing initiatives with another small business. Look for harmony between both of your brands so that audiences are inspired to work with both of you, rather than confused about who\u2019s who.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Writing sensitive ad copy<\/strong>. Whether you\u2019re in a highly regulated or restricted industry (such as healthcare or finance), or if you\u2019re simply stating what your offer details, you may need to be more conservative with the language you use to avoid any legal issues. Catchy brand messaging is great, inaccurate brand messaging that overpromises or oversees any audience sensitivities is not.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Those are just a few instances where your brand messaging framework may not always need to come into play. Otherwise, you\u2019ll likely want to refer to your brand messaging framework whenever you\u2019re planning marketing campaigns and creating marketing assets.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/brand-messaging-influencer-positioning-example.jpg\" alt=\"brand messaging - influencer brand positioning example\" width=\"664\" height=\"471\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76905 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/brand-messaging-influencer-positioning-example.jpg 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/brand-messaging-influencer-positioning-example-480x340.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bunnyhedaya\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This influencer<\/a> put her own twist on the typical brand messaging from garbage bag company, Glad.\u00a0\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>How to use your brand messaging framework<\/h3>\n<p>As I just mentioned above, you\u2019ll probably look to your brand messaging framework more often than not when promoting your business. Try to use your framework as an outline any time you\u2019re looking to create or edit marketing copy and creative.<\/p>\n<p>For example, let\u2019s say you decide to incorporate <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/ai-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI in your marketing<\/a> and use a tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/08\/chatgpt-prompts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chat GPT<\/a> for a first draft or outline.
