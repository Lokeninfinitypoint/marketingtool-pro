For example, if you sell SEO software, don\u2019t just assume that the king of SEO, Rand Fishkin, is the person you need to partner with. Your audience might be much more novice and have no clue as to whom he is. Perhaps you\u2019re better off looking for an influencer in the small business advice space.<\/p>\n<p>If you have multiple audiences, you might need multiple social influencers for these varying demographics, so focus on your top-selling audience first, and go from there.<\/p>\n<h3>Research, Research, Research!<\/h3>\n<p>Now that you have a clear idea of who your audience is influenced by, it\u2019s time to find out how to find influencers.

Well that leads us to\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>5 Tips to Engage with Social Media Influencers<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve found the right influencers, how can you get them interested in you? Here are a few tips to influence your influencers.<\/p>\n<h3>Tip#1: Reach Out in a Non-Aggressive Manner<\/h3>\n<p>The first thing to keep in mind is that you don\u2019t want to sloppily start messaging, retweeting, and sharing every one of your target influencer\u2019s posts. When they see you\u2019ve \u201cliked\u201d 25 of their Instagram posts from 2015, they are more likely to be creeped out than flattered.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4c31d771-8817-49cc-b9ac-a6fa051f0cdb\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/social-media-deep-like.jpg\" alt=\"social media deep like\" width=\"590\" height=\"205\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Rather, make sure to put some strategic thinking and planning behind your initial outreach efforts, and allow your first message to simmer for a moment. There is no need to turn into an overly eager salesperson.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, here\u2019s one way to make this outreach process feel even less salesy\u2026<\/p>\n<h3>Tip #2: Join an Online Chat Your Influencer Participates In<\/h3>\n<p>There are tons of online conversations going on through various platforms, and if you\u2019re truly pursuing a social media influencer, then this individual absolutely participates in many of these conversations. How could they be an influencer by just keeping to themselves? Whether it be on Reddit, LinkedIn Groups, or niche webinars, you should be able to find where your influencers hang out online, and then you can conveniently start hanging out there too.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"8881be7e-bf51-41a0-bb25-030b9ef8548b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/social-media-influencer-online-chats.jpg\" alt=\"social media chats\" width=\"650\" height=\"345\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>For instance, Twitter chats are a great place to make your existence known to your social media influencers. These are conversations on Twitter that occur at the same time each week, and are organized by a common hashtag.<\/p>\n<p>For example, there\u2019s a #SmallBizChat, which takes place on Wednesday evenings at 8PM EST. Typically chats are led by one designated individual who provides questions to keep the conversation moving. The great thing about this strategy is that you can join these conversations, lightly participate, and as time goes on your social media influencer targets will start recognizing your Twitter handle. Then, when you actually do reach out it won\u2019t feel random, and your social influencer will be much more likely to respond.<\/p>\n<p>There are Twitter chats for virtually every industry. If you don\u2019t believe me, check out this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tweetreports.com\/twitter-chat-schedule\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">extensive list<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>Yet, there\u2019s one way of reaching out to social media influencers that tops all others\u2026<\/p>\n<h3>Tip #3: If Possible, Make a Human Connection<\/h3>\n<p>Nothing tops making a real, human connection. You might be shrugging and thinking, but these are SOCIAL MEDIA people. Well, yes, I\u2019m aware we live in a world where people often walk into inanimate objects due to texting while walking, but there will always be something to say for real human interaction. Whether or not you personally enjoy it, study after study has proven that interacting in person is far more impactful then communicating online.<\/p>\n<p>So, should you just show up at your influencer\u2019s doorstep with a 45-slide PowerPoint presentation on how you could partner together? Absolutely not! Rather, if your influencer is local, keep an eye on their social feeds to see the industry events they tweet about. Register for those same events, and try to make a natural human connection.<\/p>\n<p>Come prepared with an idea of what you\u2019d like to say, but make sure to listen and ask your influencers questions about themselves (people love talking about themselves!). Keep the initial interaction light, and exchange business cards so you can reach out later on. Someone is much more likely to respond to a nice individual they met at a networking event over a random LinkedIn message.<\/p>\n<p>While it is probably not worth taking a flight to connect with an influencer in person, if it just so happens that your influencer is going to an event a few blocks from your house, then why not make the effort to meet in person?<\/p>\n<h3>Tip #4: Leverage Your Network<\/h3>\n<p>You should treat reaching out to a social media influencer the same way you treat finding a new job. Use the people you know to get connected the people you want to know!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"fecfdc80-8fc4-414e-944b-32a42f206769\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/social-media-influencers-guide.jpg\" alt=\"social media marketing influencers\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>This isn\u2019t a groundbreaking strategy, but it is one you might not have thought of. Search through your social media influencer\u2019s friends and see if you have any mutual connections. Chances are the world is smaller than you think, and working in the same industry, you likely do! Then reach out to the person you have in common and ask them to make an introduction. This will ensure your social media influencer doesn\u2019t feel caught off-guard by a miscellaneous reach out.<\/p>\n<h3>Tip #5: Keep an Organized List of Your Outreach Efforts<\/h3>\n<p>Last but not least, it is critical to track and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/01\/19\/outreach-marketing-techniques\">manage your outreach efforts<\/a> to ensure you\u2019re not either overbearing or forgetting about your social media influencers. Since you\u2019re likely reaching out to influencers at various times, it is important to keep tabs on your outreach dates and times, methods, success and\/or failure of these attempts to ensure you\u2019re making the best effort to engage with, but not annoy these individuals.<\/p>\n<p>With this type of due diligence, attention to detail, and persistence in your outreach efforts, your social media influencers will be ready to engage right back in no time.<\/p>\n<p>So, what now?<\/p>\n<h2>5 Ways to Leverage Social Media Influencers to Grow Your Audience<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve made friends with your social media influencers, the time has come to leverage them to grow your audience. The thing to remember here is that these relationships need to be treated like your most treasured personal relationships in a sense. For instance, if a colleague asked you to grab drinks after work every few Fridays, but you never asked her to hang out outside of the office, do you think your friendship would stay intact? Absolutely not! She would stop asking, and your relationship would remain strictly professional.<\/p>\n<p>So, you should ask social media influencers out for drinks? Well, not exactly. Rather you need to provide your influencers with some type of value-add on your end rather than just asking them for favor after favor. For instance, let\u2019s say you want your influencer to write a guest post for your blog; offer to write a post for their blog in return. Or partner with them on something they\u2019re interested in doing (which would likely benefit both parties).<\/p>\n<p>So, what types of things can you collaborate on with your newly engaged social media influencers? Here are a few ideas to try!<\/p>\n<h3>Idea #1: Run a Joint Social Media Contest<\/h3>\n<p>This is a great and fun way to partner with a social media influencer and grow both of your audiences simultaneously! You may have run some of your own giveaways in the past. Perhaps you ran a promotional giveaway for a shopping holiday like Black Friday. While these are great and all, if you partnered with one of your social media influencers on a contest you could not only reduce your efforts, but double, triple, or even quadruple the number of email entries you receive!<\/p>\n<p>As a foodie and nutrition graduate student, I follow a number of nutritional bloggers on Instagram, and one thing I notice is that they\u2019re constantly doing these joint co-marketing campaigns (and convincing me to try and follow new products).<\/p>\n<p>Take this example of an <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/05\/11\/instagram-giveaways\">Instagram giveaway<\/a> from one of my favorite nutrition foodies, Rachael\u2019s Good Eats, who partnered with the nut butter bar company, Perfect Bar. Perfect Bar and Rachael teamed up to promote each other, and run a fun giveaway where Rachael had contestants simply like, comment, and follow Perfect Bar, and the winners received three free boxes of the snack bar. And man, am I disappointed I didn\u2019t win!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5b242789-ea61-4059-a791-ed0c495ac396\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/social-media-influencer-contests.jpg\" alt=\"social media influencer giveaway\" width=\"790\" height=\"552\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Check out Rachael\u2019s post \u2013 with over 10,000 likes! Clearly a success for both parties. Rachael also benefited with some love from Perfect Bar, which you can see in their post below.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2a796073-3f1a-40a0-8e42-1a9af25eaf2e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/social-media-influencer-campaign-examples.jpg\" alt=\"social media marketing contest ideas\" width=\"870\" height=\"586\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Idea #2: Create Something Together<\/h3>\n<p>Ok, fair warning \u2013 this idea comes with a bit more strategic planning and hard work, but it can really work wonders. Build something together! Whether it be a physical product or an app, creating a real, purchasable item together will tie you to your social media influencer for a much longer time, and guarantee that you\u2019ll be gaining attention not just from your audience, but from theirs as well, on an ongoing basis.<\/p>\n<p>A great example would be beauty brands collaborating with social media influencers on limited-edition products that the influencers can then promote to their large audiences on YouTube, Instagram, etc. Take Kathleen Lights, who has 2 million Instagram followers and 3.6 million YouTube subscribers. She collaborated with the small makeup brand Colourpop to create an eye shadow palette, and as you can see her audience is loving it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f095aa77-bab2-469f-8a10-76ae40d55190\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/social-media-influencer-marketing-collaborations.jpg\" alt=\"collaborating with social media influencers\" width=\"933\" height=\"532\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Idea #3: Co-host an Event<\/h3>\n<p>Perhaps you\u2019re not quite ready to take the step into product creation with your social media influencers. Not to worry, there are easier ways to partner with your influencers and break the ice before diving into a full-out revenue-generating partnership. Co-hosting an industry event is a great way to form a stronger relationship with a new influencer and bring both of your companies together to share a drink and strengthen the bond.<\/p>\n<p>Take the example below of a re-occurring tech event that occurs in Boston, is co-hosted by the Boston startups Appcues and Wistia. Drunk User Testing is where Boston techies get together to have a few too many drinks, try out new software features, and provide candid feedback on various beta features (the drinks help with the candid part). While this isn\u2019t really a lead generating partnership, it starts to form the relationship, provide a place to swap ideas, and strengthen the bond between the two companies.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6e7bd13e-7d98-4c02-9a93-82afd403d387\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/social-media-influencer-events.jpg\" alt=\"social media influencer events\" width=\"750\" height=\"373\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Idea #4: Share Special Discount Codes and Offers on Each Other\u2019s Websites<\/h3>\n<p>So you\u2019ve built a bond with a social media influencer who happens to work for a company that fits very well with yours. Perhaps you own a golf course and your social media influencer sells golf clothing. This presents a great opportunity to run a special discount together. Who doesn\u2019t love a good discount? And if your social media influencer incentivizes their website visitors to buy a round of golf at your course for a 25% discount on a new golf outfit, why would they turn this down?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"451909cc-9531-46d7-b8c7-43d1a92f428c\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/social-media-influencer-marketing-discounts.jpg\" alt=\"how to do social media influencer marketing\" width=\"707\" height=\"553\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>West Elm, a modern e-commerce furniture company, does this well!
