But <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/12997469?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=29265\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google announced<\/a> that starting January 20, 2023, it will relax some of these long-standing rules and provide a path for advertisers to market some CBD products on its network<strong><em>.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/google-cbd-ads-announcement.png\" alt=\"announcements about google allowing some ads for cbd products\" width=\"478\" height=\"237\" class=\"wp-image-69514 aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p>While this is good news for those in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/12\/cannabis-marketing\">cannabis marketing<\/a>, not all CBD products are allowed, and qualified advertisers will need to be certified by LegitScript before they can run ads on Google.<\/p>\n<h2>What CBD products will be allowed on Google Ads?<\/h2>\n<p>Although it&#8217;s removing CBD from its <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/2423645#zippy=%2Cunapproved-pharmaceuticals-and-supplements%2Crelated-to-weight-loss\">long list of unapproved pharmaceuticals and supplements<\/a>, that doesn\u2019t mean that your local dispensary will be able to start promoting its wares. In fact, most products are still restricted. Starting on January 20, Google will begin to allow advertisers to promote CBD products that meet both the following criteria:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Topical FDA-approved pharmaceuticals<\/li>\n<li>Hemp-derived CBD products with a THC content of 0.3% or less.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Additionally, the new policies only allow ads on Google within California, Colorado, and Puerto Rico. CBD Ads will not show to users identified as under the age of 18.<\/p>\n<p>Google will continue to disallow advertising for all other CBD products, including supplements, food additives, and inhalants. These products\u2014as well as many other legal recreational products and tobacco\u2014are prohibited under <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adspolicy\/answer\/6014299\">Google\u2019s Dangerous products or services policies<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>How do advertisers get certified to run CBD ads on Google?<\/h2>\n<p>Before starting on Google Ads for CBD, you must first complete certification with LegitScript.

Advertisers must first pay a nonrefundable application fee before they potentially begin advertising on Google. If approved, advertisers then pay an annual fee per product and website every year.<\/p>\n<p>Websites can apply to get verified for an $800 application fee and an additional annual fee of $1,600 once approved. Some websites with a past history of significant compliance issues may be approved on a probationary basis. These probationary websites must demonstrate that they are currently in compliance and meet LegitScript\u2019s certification standards. Probationary websites have a higher annual fee of $2,250 in addition to the $800 application fee.<\/p>\n<p>CBD products must also be certified by LegitScript before they can be advertised. The costs for certifying CBD products vary by the catalog size.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"208\">Number of CBD Products<\/td>\n<td width=\"208\">Nonrefundable Application Fee per Product<\/td>\n<td width=\"208\">Annual Monitoring Fee per Product<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"208\">1 \u2013 5<\/td>\n<td width=\"208\">$650<\/td>\n<td width=\"208\">$1,000<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"208\">6 -50<\/td>\n<td width=\"208\">$600<\/td>\n<td width=\"208\">$925<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"208\">51 \u2013 99<\/td>\n<td width=\"208\">$550<\/td>\n<td width=\"208\">$850<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"208\">100 +<\/td>\n<td width=\"208\">$500<\/td>\n<td width=\"208\">$750<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h2>Save on your CBD certification application fees<\/h2>\n<p>At the start of their program, LegitScript is <strong><em>waiving its application fees for CBD certifications through March 31, 2023<\/em><\/strong>, potentially saving advertisers thousands of dollars.
