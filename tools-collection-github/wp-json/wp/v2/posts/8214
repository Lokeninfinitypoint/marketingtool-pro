Are there any drawbacks you need to know? I&#8217;m going to cover all that and more in this post. Read on to learn:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How the Google Ads monthly spend limit works.<\/li>\n<li>How it compares to daily budgets.<\/li>\n<li>How to set up a monthly budget in your account.<\/li>\n<li>What you need to know to get the most out of this new feature.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This way you can determine whether this new feature is one that you should apply!<\/p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: This feature is only available if you use the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2375377\/apply-for-monthly-invoicing?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">invoice billing method with Google Ads<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>What are Google Ads monthly budget limits?<\/h2>\n<p>Functioning similarly to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/19\/facebook-ads-daily-vs-lifetime-budgets\">lifetime budgets<\/a> on Facebook, monthly budget limits in Google Ads allow you to layer on an <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/10486637?hl=en#:~:text=For%20most%20campaigns%2C%20given%20your,campaigns)%20in%20any%20particular%20month.\">account level monthly spend cap<\/a> on top of your daily budgets. This is the first time in history we\u2019re truly able to <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/10178071\">control our spend at the account level<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>As mentioned above, this is groundbreaking for advertisers managing multiple campaigns while trying to keep to a monthly budget.<\/p>\n<p>By definition from <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/10178071\">Google<\/a>, a monthly spend limit is the \u201cmaximum amount you can pay for a campaign over a month.\u201d How it works is it will override your campaign\u2019s daily budget to stop at a certain threshold.<\/p>\n<p>Because this will be set at the account level, if you\u2019re running multiple campaigns, you\u2019ll want to account for all of them when setting your limit. This means that, while monthly spend limits will be a stellar <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/28\/money-saving-ppc-tips\">money-saving tool<\/a>, you won\u2019t want to take advantage of it to the point where you restrict your performance by setting that monthly limit too low.<\/p>\n<h2>How Google Ads spend worked before monthly budget limits<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s quickly refresh on what spend on Google Ads looked like prior to this new tool.<\/p>\n<p>Before monthly budget limits, every campaign in Google Ads was required to have a set daily budget. That daily budget guided Google on how much it should spend per day to average out to a projected monthly spend. However, depending on the temperament of the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2011\/11\/16\/how-adwords-works\">ads auction<\/a>, daily budgets would ebb and flow\u2014even spending higher than anticipated.<\/p>\n<p>This is because Google is programmed to dynamically adjust your spend for the day based on what\u2019s needed in order for you to perform. For example, if you set a daily budget of $10, you may end up spending $8 one day and $12 the next to average out to a rough $300 for the month.<\/p>\n<p>However, if <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/21\/how-much-does-adwords-cost#:~:text=The%20average%20cost%20per%20click,%2450%20or%20more%20per%20click.\">cost<\/a> of bids goes up due to external factors like competition, then you can easily go <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/1704443\">over that daily budget<\/a> consistently resulting in an overall higher spend for a 30-day period than expected.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-audit-checklist-post-covid-daily-budget-1.png\" alt=\"google ads audit checklist post covid daily budget\" width=\"800\" height=\"350\" \/><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Did you know that the Google Ads now gives you visibility into your daily spend? Learn <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/12\/15\/google-ads-budget-report\">how to use the Google Ads budget report here<\/a>.<\/div>\n<h2>Is the monthly spend limit right for you?<\/h2>\n<p>In order to implement a monthly spend limit, you\u2019ll need to still have your daily budgets set up. But, if you\u2019re unsure whether a monthly spend limit is the right move just yet, let\u2019s quickly compare how your campaigns would function with or without this feature.<\/p>\n<h3>Daily budgets with no monthly account spend limit<\/h3>\n<p>Essentially, this works like the campaigns we already have, know, and (in some cases) love. These are the campaigns that are already familiar to us, as they have always required a daily budget without the new monthly spend limit feature.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The benefits<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Aside from already being familiar to us,\u00a0campaigns that use this model have additional benefits:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Less restricted: These campaigns are less restricted than campaigns with a monthly spend cap. Google will only be considerate of the daily budget which allows for wiggle room for you to continue growing your reach.<\/li>\n<li>You can adjust your daily budget at any time (though this applies to monthly spend limits too)<\/li>\n<li>Unlike the monthly limits, daily budgets are set at the campaign level. So, you can manage spend campaign-by-campaign if one takes priority over the other.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>The drawbacks<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Here are some drawbacks to campaigns using daily budgets but no monthly account spend limit:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Since daily budgets have the flexibility to go over what they\u2019re set to, it can be harder to keep your spend in control as Google takes reign over your costs.<\/li>\n<li>While some may prefer to manage budgets campaign-by-campaign, if you have a larger account, it can be hard to keep track of your many different budgets for each.<\/li>\n<li>Daily budgets that are set too low can be just as limiting as a low monthly spend limit since either of those could cause your campaign to show less, causing a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/26\/search-impression-share#:~:text=Search%20Impression%20Share%20Lost%20to%20Budget,your%20campaigns%20is%20running%20out.\">loss of impression share due to budget<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-monthly-spend-limit-vs-daily-budget-1.png\" alt=\"google ads monthly spend limit vs daily budget venn diagram\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Daily budgets with a monthly account spend limit<\/h3>\n<p>Now, take your regular campaigns with just the daily budgets, and tack on an account level monthly spend limit on top of that. This works by having Google\u2019s algorithm use your daily budget for campaign level spend and bids while simultaneously tracking overall account spend to keep to your monthly budget limit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The benefits<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Using the monthly budget limit, here\u2019s how you can benefit:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Now you can finally manage <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/21\/how-much-does-adwords-cost\">how much you\u2019re spending<\/a> in total on Google Ads!<\/li>\n<li>Whether you have one or many campaigns, you will never have to pinpoint <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/20\/stop-burning-your-adwords-budget\">where spend is bleeding out<\/a> to stop it.<\/li>\n<li>In a way, monthly spend limits act as an extra safety measure to ensure you keep costs in a comfortable spot.<\/li>\n<li>If you were ever wary of using Google\u2019s automated tools like Smart Bidding or Smart Campaigns, the new account level monthly spend limit makes these features more approachable since you know you\u2019ll still have the upper hand when it comes to overall spend.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>The drawbacks<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While the monthly spend cap and daily budget work hand in hand together to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/08\/24\/google-ads-optimization\">optimize<\/a>, at the end of the day your monthly spend limit will override and stop your campaign from running if you hit your limit. This means that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If your spend limit is so low that your campaign hits it halfway through the month, then your ads will stop running for the remainder of the month.<\/li>\n<li>It may be difficult to manage for larger accounts juggling multiple daily budgets on top of the monthly spend limit.<\/li>\n<li>You\u2019ll need to set aside time to stay on top of your monthly spend limit as it\u2019s not just a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d type of feature. You\u2019ll want to check on it in relation to your historical spend to ensure it\u2019s not too high or too low.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How to set up a monthly spend limit in Google Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Since this is set at the account level, you\u2019ll find that setting up your monthly account spend limit is actually in a different spot than where you\u2019d set your daily budgets. Here\u2019s where to go and what to do:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>In Google Ads, in the top right-hand side of the toolbar, click into <strong>Billing<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>On the left-hand menu, click into <strong>Settings<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Once there, you can <strong>select the option to create a Monthly Spend Limit<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-monthly-spend-limit-setup-1.png\" alt=\"setup tab for google ads monthly spend limit\" width=\"1184\" height=\"392\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/google-ads-introduces-account-monthly-spend-limits-mark-irvine\/\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:<\/strong> This feature is only available if you use the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2375377\/apply-for-monthly-invoicing?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">invoice billing method with Google Ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Are you going to use\u00a0the Google Ads monthly spend limit?<\/h2>\n<p>Since this feature is a new tool to help folks maintain control of their overall advertising costs, then it\u2019s an obvious green light for those who are tight on budget.
