Can you find a way to connect it with a concept relevant to your readers? Thought leadership doesn&#8217;t always mean coming up with new concepts or, well, thoughts. It can also mean coming up with new ways to package old concepts.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Experts Weigh In<\/strong>: Is there a \u201ccontroversial\u201d topic in your niche? Not one that is emotionally charged, but something that can spark a mix of responses. Ask a handful of experts the same question (or set of questions) to get a well-rounded perspective. For an example, check out our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/09\/20\/ppc-metrics-ultimate-guide\">Ultimate Guide to PPC Metrics: 17 Experts on the Top 3 Must-Check PPC Metrics<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>X Best Practices I Don\u2019t Follow:<\/strong> What are some standards that you find work against your favor, are antiquated, or simply don\u2019t work for your scenario? Share them and why. Note: To avoid leading anyone astray, be specific about why and make sure to illustrate scenarios when those best practices are, indeed, best.<\/li>\n<li><strong>A \u201cReally,\u201d \u201cTruly,\u201d or \u201cActually\u201d List:<\/strong> Every niche has those keywords that, when searched on Google, bring up pages and pages of results that all basically say the same thing. In our niche, for example, it\u2019s Instagram captions. Drives me bonkers. But you can be the one result that doesn\u2019t just copy and paste what\u2019s already there, and actually take the time to come up with your own authentic list (while still meeting the intent of the keyword, of course). Then make it clear in your SEO title. In fact, I do just that in my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/12\/20\/new-years-instagram-captions\">131 [NOT Overused!] New Year&#8217;s Instagram Captions.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>X Things I Wish I Knew \/ Mistakes I Made<\/strong>: Talking about your shortcomings can be just as effective as your successes. Plus, it makes you more human. Reflect on mistakes you\u2019ve made in your journey doing your line of work, or things you wish you knew sooner. Your readers will appreciate the transparency\u2014not to mention being able to avoid making the same mistakes.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Share Your Opinion on Something:<\/strong> Express your mind on a topic in your industry. Just remember that it&#8217;s best to also present the opposing opinion or other perspectives involved.

Some businesses hesitate to share how to do something that they do for their clients. But you don\u2019t have to share your top-secret tactics. Plus, by showing them how to do something, you demonstrate that you a) know what you&#8217;re talking about and b) genuinely want to help them. If your blog doesn\u2019t provide it, they\u2019ll find it elsewhere, and if they can do it themselves, they&#8217;re not a good fit for your business anyway. Your target is the people who don&#8217;t have the skills, or the bandwidth\/desire\/time to learn the skills to do what you do.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How to Do X (Without Y):<\/strong> Basically, cover a way to achieve something without doing the go-to strategy for it or using the go-to tool for it.

This is especially important if you&#8217;re adapting your visual from theirs. And don&#8217;t be afraid to challenge the status quo. Oftentimes you&#8217;ll see the same graph recreated by 10 different brands. if there are better ways to visualize the data, be the business that does that.<\/p>\n<h3>More data-driven blog post ideas<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Curated stats list: Pull out key stats from your mega list and elaborate on them.
