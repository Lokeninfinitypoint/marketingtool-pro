However, suppose a few readers do read the headline after seeing the photograph below it. After that, you require them to jump down past the photograph which they have already seen. Not bloody likely.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Huh. Positioning.<\/p>\n<p>Illustrative image first, because that\u2019s what people see first.

Go bigger. That is, in audience size.<\/p>\n<p>Frequency (or the number of times you\u2019ve shown ads to those same people) isn\u2019t the problem (generally speaking).
