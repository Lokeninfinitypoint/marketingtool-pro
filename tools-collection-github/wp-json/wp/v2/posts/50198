It just proves the point that the ideal time to post on Instagram won\u2019t be the same for all. You\u2019re just using these times as an educated guess to start your own experiment.<\/p>\n<div id=\"byday\"><\/div>\n<h2>The best time to post on Instagram by day<\/h2>\n<p>Even if Wednesdays or Fridays are the days you get the most post engagement, you\u2019ll still post on other days. So it\u2019s good to know what time each day is best to start experimenting.<\/p>\n<p>Since there\u2019s so much variation in the data, we\u2019ve condensed and listed the best option from each study per day. Seeing them all side-by-side really helped us digest the information.<\/p>\n<h3>The best time to post on Instagram on Monday<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Later:<\/strong> 3 a.m. to 7 a.m.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sprout Social:<\/strong> 11 a.m.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hootsuite:<\/strong> 11 a.m.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HubSpot:<\/strong> 3 p.m. to 10 p.m.<\/p>\n<p>On Mondays, you may want to try a post later in the morning. It&#8217;s possible this is catching people as they break for lunch.<\/p>\n<h3>The best time to post on Instagram on Tuesday<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Later:<\/strong> 12 a.m. to 9 a.m.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sprout Social:<\/strong> 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hootsuite:<\/strong> 8 a.m.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HubSpot:<\/strong> 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.<\/p>\n<p>Notice how three sources nearly overlap in the morning? Seems like 8:30 a.m might be a good time to post on Instagram.<\/p>\n<h3>The best time to post on Instagram on Wednesday<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Later:<\/strong> 2 a.m. to 7 a.m.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sprout Social:<\/strong> 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hootsuite:<\/strong> 11 a.m.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HubSpot:<\/strong> 8 p.m. to 10 p.m.<\/p>\n<p>Wednesday is a bit of a wildcard since there&#8217;s very little overlap in each recommendation. If you don&#8217;t post every day, maybe skip Wednesday. Or try at 11 a.m. since that&#8217;s one of the few times suggested by more than one source.<\/p>\n<h3>The best time to post on Instagram on Thursday<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Later:<\/strong> 2 a.m. to 3 a.m.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sprout Social:<\/strong> 9 a.m. to 12 p.m.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hootsuite:<\/strong> 11 a.m.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HubSpot:<\/strong> 9 p.m.<\/p>\n<p>HubSpot narrows down their evening window on Thursday, which suggests they&#8217;ve found a sweet spot for posting on Instagram on this day.<\/p>\n<h3>The best time to post on Instagram on Friday<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Later:<\/strong> 5 a.m. to 6 a.m.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sprout Social:<\/strong> 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hootsuite:<\/strong> 2 p.m.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HubSpot:<\/strong> 9 p.m.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s absolutely no consensus among the four studies about when to post on Friday. Shoot your shot at a few different times and see what sticks.<\/p>\n<h3>The best time to post on Instagram on Saturday<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Later:<\/strong> 3 a.m.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sprout Social:<\/strong> 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hootsuite:<\/strong> 8 a.m.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HubSpot:<\/strong> 6 p.m. to 12 a.m.<\/p>\n<p>Weekends are a dead zone for Instagram engagement according to most of the data. If you have a weekend deal or one-day menu, post it early in the day.<\/p>\n<h3>The best time to post on Instagram on Sunday<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Later:<\/strong> 5 a.m. to 7 a.m.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sprout Social:<\/strong> 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hootsuite:<\/strong> 6 p.m.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HubSpot:<\/strong> 3 p.m. to 10 p.m.<\/p>\n<p>Sunday is similar to Saturday for its general lack of social media engagement.

So while existing studies give us a good starting point, we really need to figure out when your posts will be the most successful.<\/p>\n<p>These tips will help you use anecdotal and concrete data to create an engagement maximizing Instagram posting schedule.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Use Instagram Insights<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/01\/instagram-analytics\">Instagram\u2019s native analytics platform<\/a> tells you a lot about your audience. There\u2019s a \u201cmost active times\u201d metric that tells you when your audience is on Instagram, for example.<\/p>\n<p>There are also demographic and location chargers so you can see who\u2019s engaged with your account and there they\u2019re from. Location is great because it clues you in on which time zones you should target.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Best-time-to-post-on-Instagram-analytics.jpg\" alt=\"Best time to post on Instagram - screenshot of instagram analytics\" width=\"570\" height=\"594\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75441 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Best-time-to-post-on-Instagram-analytics.jpg 570w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Best-time-to-post-on-Instagram-analytics-480x500.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 570px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>2. Think through your personas<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/23\/buyer-personas\">Buyer personas<\/a> are fictional characters that represent your customers as human beings\u2014their lifestyle, occupation, hobbies, family, education level, interests, and more. This is essential for identifying the best times to post on Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>For example, maybe lunchtime isn\u2019t the best time to post for your audience if they\u2019re more likely to eat with others or work out on their lunch break. And evening is probably not best for parents who are busy with putting their kids to bed.<\/p>\n<p>More questions to consider:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why do they go on Instagram?<\/li>\n<li>How much time do they spend on Instagram?<\/li>\n<li>Who else do they follow?<\/li>\n<li>Do they follow 100 accounts? 1000?<\/li>\n<li>When are they likely to actually engage with posts vs just scroll through<\/li>\n<li>How many times a day do they check Instagram?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This information can help you to identify the best content to publish and when.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Use a third-party tool<\/h3>\n<p>There are a number of social media management platforms out there that offer more analytics than Insights, and even allow you to schedule your Instagram posts. These include Later, Buffer, Hootsuite,\u00a0 and Sprout Social, among many others.<\/p>\n<p>Some of these tools even have a feature that suggests posting times.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Know the algorithm<\/h3>\n<p>In June 2021, Instagram published an update <a href=\"https:\/\/about.instagram.com\/blog\/announcements\/shedding-more-light-on-how-instagram-works\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">explaining its algorithm works<\/a>. It gathers together all of the recent posts shared by the people that person follows and then ranks them according to thousands of signals, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your post: content, location, video length, likes, interest metrics.<\/li>\n<li>You: who is engaging with you and how.<\/li>\n<li>Their preferences and behaviors.<\/li>\n<li>Their past interactions with you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So if you want to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-instagram-feed-works\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">show up in the Instagram Feed<\/a>, recency pales in comparison to engagement. The post says, \u201cIn Feed, the five interactions we look at most closely are how likely you are to spend a few seconds on a post, comment on it, like it, save it, and tap on the profile photo.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Which leads to the next suggestion.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Go for engagement<\/h3>\n<p>Clearly, we can see that posting at the optimal time isn\u2019t the biggest success factor on Instagram. It\u2019s much more important to create the best posts. This increases your engagement signal strength over time which wins you algorithmic favor.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some ways to optimize for those five interactions mentioned above.<\/p>\n<p>To get them to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spend a few seconds on the post:<\/strong> Draw them in with a compelling visual, get them reading with a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/instagram-captions-ideas\/\">great caption<\/a>, and keep them engaged with a carousel or video.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Comment on it:<\/strong> Ask questions, like would you rather\/what would you do, here\u2019s mine\/what\u2019s yours, what\u2019s your take, fill in the blank, caption this photo, and more.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Like it:<\/strong> Make the post useful, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/03\/emotional-marketing-copy\">emotional<\/a>, unique, visually appealing, and in line with your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/09\/company-core-values\">core values.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Save it:<\/strong> Share useful information, like tips, tutorials, and ideas they\u2019ll want to refer back to.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Tap your profile pic:<\/strong> Use the ol\u2019 link in bio, and make it a nice pic!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Focus on creating engaging and interesting content first, then optimize by posting at the right time. Posting the right content at the \u201cwrong\u201d time is much better than posting the wrong content at the exact right time.<\/p>\n<p>For more Instagram marketing tips and (lots more awesome) post ideas, head to <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/local-marketing-lab\/local-social-media-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Local Social Media Lab<\/a>\u2014it\u2019s a gold mine!<\/p>\n<p>And don\u2019t forget, you can also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/02\/02\/how-to-repost-on-instagram\">repost on Instagram<\/a>, drawing from others\u2019 content that is already getting engagement.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Learn from your previous posts<\/h3>\n<p>The best predictor of future outcomes is previous success, so keep track of which of your posts get the most engagement and when you\u2019ve posted them. You can do this directly in your Instagram analytics dashboard.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Best-time-to-post-on-Instagram-post-analytics.jpg\" alt=\"Best time to post on Instagram - screenshot of Instagram Insights\" width=\"403\" height=\"595\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75442 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Best-time-to-post-on-Instagram-post-analytics.jpg 403w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Best-time-to-post-on-Instagram-post-analytics-203x300.jpg 203w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Some final tips:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don\u2019t forget about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/12\/04\/instagram-story-hacks\">Instagram Stories<\/a>!

What\u2019s the best time of day to post on Instagram?<\/h3>\n<p>Trick question because it depends on your goals and audience\u2019s behavior. However, if you look at a cross section of available data, 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. would be a good start.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Is it best to post daily on Instagram?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, if possible. Posting daily steadily increases your engagement which improves your credibility with Instagram\u2019s algorithm. Can\u2019t post every day? At least be consistent. If your cadence is three times per week, then post three times <em>every<\/em> week.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Is it better to post on Instagram at night or in the morning?<\/h3>\n<p>Most data suggests that late mornings are a better time to drive engagement on Instagram posts. The logic is that people like to take brief breaks to flip through their IG feed. Contrast that to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/08\/best-time-to-post-on-youtube\">best time to post on YouTube<\/a>, where viewers tend to wait until after work to watch longer videos.<\/p>\n<h3>4. How do you check peak time on Instagram<\/h3>\n<p>To check peak time on Instagram, look for the \u201cmost active times\u201d graph on your Instagram analytics dashboard.<\/p>\n<h2>The best time to post on Instagram reviewed<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s a lot of data available about the best time to post on Instagram. It\u2019s useful to help you pick when to post early in your Instagram journey.
