Doing so allows you to find potential customers who are searching for offerings just like yours. But unless you\u2019ve got money to burn, it\u2019s equally important to identify and eliminate keywords\u2014and thus, searchers\u2014who <em>aren\u2019t <\/em>looking for the products or services you provide.<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, most Google Ads\u00a0and Microsoft campaigns <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/05\/21\/how-much-does-adwords-cost\">cost far more than they need to<\/a> because advertisers end up paying for clicks that never deliver a return on their often-substantial investment. For some, this can be frustrating enough to stop advertising on search networks entirely.<\/p>\n<p>So how do you avoid the pitfall of wasted spend?<\/p>\n<p>You use <strong>negative keywords<\/strong>, of course!<\/p>\n<p>After reading what follows, you\u2019ll understand:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exactly what negative keywords are<\/li>\n<li>How they can improve the value and relevance of your paid search marketing efforts<\/li>\n<li>The value of negative keyword lists<\/li>\n<li>How to find and add negative keywords at scale<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Let\u2019s get to it.<\/p>\n<h2>What Are Negative Keywords?<\/h2>\n<p>Negative keywords are a method of preventing your ad from showing to people who search for or browse content related to those words.<\/p>\n<p>Effective paid search management means consistently expanding the keywords you\u2019re bidding on while simultaneously refining the keywords you\u2019re<em> already<\/em> bidding on to maximize relevance and, as a result, ROI. That second part doesn\u2019t just mean pausing poor-performers: it means eliminating some search queries entirely.<\/p>\n<p>Negative keywords give you the opportunity to do just that, ensuring that your ads only reach the best potential audience.<\/p>\n<p>Just like with the keywords you actually bid on, negative keywords can be assigned at the account, campaign, or ad group level and come in multiple flavors: broad, phrase, and exact. Understanding how these match types work is <em>imperative <\/em>if you want to maximize the value of negative keywords in your Google Ads\u00a0and Bing ad accounts.<\/p>\n<h3>Negative keyword match types<\/h3>\n<p>When using negative broad match, your keywords are matched to multiple variations of a phrase, not all of which will be logical extensions of the phrase you\u2019re targeting, and not all of which will be pertinent to your business.<\/p>\n<p>In the example below, the negative broad match keyword <strong>running shoes <\/strong>would negate queries that show the entire negative keyword, even in cases where the words aren\u2019t in the same order.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/broad-match-negative-keywords-example.png\" alt=\"broad match negative keywords example\" width=\"291\" height=\"262\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This does not, however, mean that you will eliminate <em>all<\/em> relevant search queries; your ads will still be eligible to enter an auction if they contain <em>some <\/em>(but not all) of the terms present in your negative keyword. This is illustrated in the example above, where an ad would still be served for search queries like \u201cblue tennis shoes\u201d and \u201cgoogle running gear.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Negative phrase match keywords are slightly less restrictive.<\/p>\n<p>Using the same example as before, your ads would be eligible to show for any search query that doesn\u2019t contain the phrase \u201crunning shoes.\u201d That\u2019s because this iteration only negates search queries that contain the <em>exact phrase<\/em> you specify. A search query could have more words than your negative phrase match keyword, but if it contains the exact phrase you\u2019ve specified, your budget is safe.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/phrase-match-negative-keyword-example.png\" alt=\"phrase match negative keywords adwords\" width=\"308\" height=\"268\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Finally, negative exact match keywords exist solely for you to eliminate <em>specific<\/em> search queries. If you add negative exact match keywords to your Google Ads\u00a0account, your ads won\u2019t show only when a searcher enters <em>exactly<\/em> what you\u2019ve added to your account. No extra words. Nothing.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/exact-match-negative-keyword-examples.png\" alt=\"exact match negative keywords\" width=\"310\" height=\"266\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Note that things are a little bit different on the Display Network and YouTube (TrueView campaigns); in these campaigns, all negative keywords are considered exact match.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of which network you\u2019re advertising on, you should be aware that adding too many negative keywords can have an adverse impact on your ability to reach prospects; a carefully curated list, however, has the potential to save you a ton of money.<\/p>\n<h3>More advantages to adding negative keywords<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Improve Click-Through Rate (CTR)<\/strong> \u2014 Ensuring that your ads aren\u2019t running against irrelevant queries means exposing your account to fewer uninterested impressions, meaning that the percentage of people who click on your ad will be greater.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Create More Relevant Ad Groups <\/strong>\u2014 By weeding out keywords that aren\u2019t related to your business, you tighten the relevance of your ad groups. Small, closely related ad groups allow you to craft a single message that speaks to the entire group of keywords.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Save Money (Again)<\/strong> \u2014 So nice it\u2019s listed twice! By avoiding paying for useless clicks, you save a lot of money by weeding out searchers who aren\u2019t a fit for your business. You can also avoid bidding against yourself, cannibalizing impressions and watering down your keyword-level data.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Raise Your Conversion Rate<\/strong> \u2014 Negative keywords will ensure that your ads don\u2019t show for particular terms that you know won\u2019t convert, like the names of competitors or those that convey a total lack of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keyword-intent\">commercial intent<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><p><strong>\ud83d\udd0d Find the best keywords for your business with our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">easy Free Keyword Tool<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>How to Add Negative Keywords<\/h2>\n<p>So, you want to implement broad and phrase match keywords in your account to capture more traffic, but you\u2019re left with a burning question\u2026<\/p>\n<p><em>How do I combat irrelevant clicks and impressions and uncontrolled ad spend? <\/em><\/p>\n<p>Discovering negative keywords has been a laborious process, involving sitting around and brainstorming (which only gets you so far) or poring through search query reports in Google Ads.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/turning-search-queries-into-negative-keywords.png\" alt=\"turning search queries into negative keywords\" width=\"543\" height=\"603\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>To do this, you need to navigate your way over to the \u201cKeywords\u201d tab in the Google Ads\u00a0UI at the account, campaign, or ad group level:<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/negative-keywords-menu.png\" alt=\"negative keywords menu\" width=\"300\" height=\"747\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The default interface here will allow you to look at the keywords you\u2019re bidding on, but not the queries that triggered them.

Let\u2019s take a look at those.<\/p>\n<h2>Creating Lists of Negative Keywords<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s face it: a Google Ads\u00a0account built solely on exact match keywords probably isn\u2019t even effective if you\u2019re Ford or BMW. As such, you need to rely on broad and phrase match keywords to ensure adequate search volume and uncover new opportunities. But there is, of course, a downside to this sort of fishing expedition: you\u2019re probably competing for the same impressions across campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you sell cat and dog clothes through your eCommerce website.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adorable-tux-puppy.jpg\" alt=\"adorable tux puppy\" width=\"725\" height=\"725\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Without negating the word cat (and all cat-adjacent queries) in your dog clothes campaigns, you\u2019ll inevitably run into the issue of Google deciding to match a broad match cat keyword to a dog-related search query. The results will clearly be irrelevant to the searcher. If they don\u2019t click it, your CTR is watered down over time; if they <em>do<\/em>, the resulting landing page will have nothing to do with the search intent.<\/p>\n<p>This is called a <em>lose-lose<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The only way to explicitly avoid this unfortunately wasteful snafu is to add negative keywords.<\/p>\n<p>Doing so as queries come is terribly inefficient so, instead, it makes sense to proactively create lists of search queries you don\u2019t want your ads to show for. In the scenario outlined above, the use of negative keyword lists would ensure that Google can\u2019t serve a \u201cdog clothes\u201d ad to a \u201ccat clothes\u201d search query because the only ads eligible to serve are in your dog clothes campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Neat, huh?<\/p>\n<p>This doesn\u2019t just work for high-fashion petwear.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you need to eliminate a keyword across your entire account because, say, you only sell <em>new<\/em> cars and want to ensure your ad spend isn\u2019t wasted on queries regarding <em>used<\/em> cars. Or you\u2019re an agency with multiple clients who operate within a single vertical, who will likely have negatives in common.<\/p>\n<p>You, my friend, are in dire need of negative keyword lists, too.<\/p>\n<p>To create a negative keyword list, click the tool icon at the top of the Google Ads\u00a0UI and select \u201cNegative keyword lists\u201d from the \u201cShared Library\u201d column.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/negative-keywords-negative-keyword-lists.png\" alt=\"negative-keywords-negative-keyword-lists\" width=\"800\" height=\"255\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>From here, hit the blue plus sign and name your new list of negative keywords.

Add any ad poaching search queries that you find directly to your negative keyword lists<\/p>\n<p>Now sit back and enjoy getting Google to serve the right ads for the right search queries. Of course, you can push this same concept to the ad group level for even tighter control.<\/p>\n<p>With that, here are some techniques you can use to uncover costly negatives you\u2019d otherwise miss with surface-level analysis: especially if you\u2019re scaling your account.<\/p>\n<h2>Advanced (Negative) Search Query Mining<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re bidding on broad match keywords to maximize impression volume but ignoring your search queries, you\u2019re wasting money.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m sorry to have to break it to you, but it\u2019s the truth.<\/p>\n<p>By not managing your negative keywords in tandem with new opportunities, you\u2019ll inevitably overlook costly search queries that might be torpedoing your ability to convert valuable searchers into customers.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier, we reviewed the process of adding negative keywords to your Google Ads\u00a0account; now it\u2019s time to figure out <em>which<\/em> search queries actually deserve to be negated.<\/p>\n<h3>Keywords are not search queries<\/h3>\n<p>Say it with me\u2026<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/05\/25\/keywords-vs-search-queries\"><strong>Keywords are not search queries.<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Keywords are assumptions. Search queries are <em>actions<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>They are what you think your customer will look for when using a search engine; search queries are the reality.<\/p>\n<p>Oftentimes one keyword can match out to hundreds or even thousands of search queries.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/search-queries-vs-keywords-negative-keyword-creation.jpg\" alt=\"search queries paralleled with keywords\" width=\"650\" height=\"430\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This is fantastic for uncovering new, long-tail opportunities (hyper-relevant, low-volume keywords you should add to your account), but it also leads to inevitable wasted spend. This is why digging through what appear to be insurmountably long lists of search queries in an efficient manner is <strong>So. Darn. Important.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>Identifying the right negative keyword opportunities at scale<\/h3>\n<p>Typically, inexperienced or busy account managers lean on a qualitative method for adding negative keywords.<\/p>\n<p>What does that mean?<\/p>\n<p>They alphabetize the list of search queries, reading line-by-line and asking themselves, \u201c<em>does this thing here have anything to do with my business?<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While this isn\u2019t inherently bad\u2014and will certainly help you remove cat-jacket queries from your dog sneaker ad group\u2014it doesn\u2019t make use of the wealth of quantitative data available (it\u2019s also horribly inefficient at scale).<\/p>\n<p>Whether or not a search query deserves to become a negative keyword (or be added to a list of negative keywords), can be deduced by asking three questions:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Does this search query have a below-average CTR?<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Does this search query have a below-average conversion rate?<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Does this search query have an above-average cost per conversion?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The reasons that these are the questions you need to ask yourself should be self-evident.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>If a search query has a below-average CTR, it means searchers who see the ad triggered aren\u2019t clicking. If the query in question has nothing to do with your business, it should become a negative keyword. If it does relate to the products or services you sell, and it has volume, consider creating a new ad group for that search query, in which a more-relevant ad is included.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>If a search query has a below-average conversion rate or an above average CPA, it means that after clicking on your ad searchers\u2019 expectation aren\u2019t being met. This could be due to the fact that your landing page isn\u2019t optimized for mobile or lacks adequate paths to conversions; it could be a result of poor alignment between intent and objective. Either way, queries that don\u2019t convert don\u2019t need to be triggering your ads.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To glean answers to these questions (and any others you might use to determine the relative value of a search query), you\u2019ll need to master the use of filters.<\/p>\n<p>To use a filter, navigate to the \u201cSearch Terms\u201d interface (discussed towards the beginning of this here guide) and click the small funnel. This will allow you to type the name of parameters you\u2019d like to filter by <em>or<\/em> select them from a pick list.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/search-query-filter-new-adwords-ui.png\" alt=\"adwords search query filter function\" width=\"293\" height=\"61\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>From here, ensure that you\u2019ve enabled the columns you need in order to view the metrics you\u2019re filtering by; to do so, click the three vertical bars.<\/p>\n<p>Each filter will prompt you to establish parameters using greater than, less than, or equal to alongside an open field, like so.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-conversion-rate-filter-modifiers.png\" alt=\"adwords conversion rate filter modifiers\" width=\"264\" height=\"177\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Note that you can layer filters to find search queries that exist at the intersection of specific metrics.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/multiple-search-query-filters-adwords.png\" alt=\"layering multiple adwords search query filters\" width=\"750\" height=\"44\" class=\"aligncenter\" \/><\/div>\n<p>For example, you might want to find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/19\/whats-a-good-quality-score\">queries with <em>exceptionally high CTRs and CPAs<\/em><\/a>, those that clearly trigger your ads but do nothing but cost you money.
