In this cause, we\u2019re saying goodbye to the digital marketing world\u2019s favorite portmanteau: AdWords.<\/p>\n<p>You didn\u2019t misread. Google <em>is in fact<\/em> sunsetting AdWords, but in name alone.<\/p>\n<p>At the highest level, this <strong>massive <\/strong>announcement was likely instigated by the proliferation of mobile and the shift towards an audience-centric mindset. More opportunities to reach more people across more channels is infinitely easier to take advantage of when all available solutions live in the same place.<\/p>\n<p>This and a slew of other shakeups (more consolidation! Smart Campaigns!) were <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blog.google\/technology\/ads\/new-advertising-brands\/\">announced <\/a>by Google\u2019s Senior VP of Ads and Commerce, Sridhar Ramaswamy, just a week before <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/10\/google-marketing-live\">Google Marketing Next<\/a>, where blanks will surely be filled in.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we\u2019ll demystify the announcement and explain:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why this rebrand is happening now<\/li>\n<li>What Google Ads means for the future of keywords<\/li>\n<li>Whether or not Smart Campaigns are for you<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Before we take a closer look at how Google\u2019s shocking brand overhaul will impact advertisers and agencies moving forward, a bit more on exactly <em>what\u2019s going on.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Introducing Google Ads&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>Obviously from our perspective, the most important piece of this announcement is the elimination of AdWords (the brand) and the creation of a new brand: Google Ads.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1040d934-ffb5-415b-acbd-bd21396a0af2\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ads-logo_0.png\" alt=\"google-ads-logo\" width=\"192\" height=\"205\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Per our ad-tastic overlords, Google Ads \u201crepresents the full range of advertising capabilities [Google] offers today\u2026 to help marketers connect with the billions of people finding answers on Search, watching videos on YouTube, exploring new places on Google Maps, discovering apps on Google Play, browsing content across the web, and more.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Along with other channels, formats, and placements, GDN, YouTube, and Shopping (most of which were acquired, not built internally) have called AdWords home for a <em>minute<\/em> now. Unfortunately,\u00a0 AdWords is synonymous with search. Having additional channels folded into the same interface has been confusing folks for years now. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019ve certainly come across clients who have no idea their video, banner, and search creative are all served from the same platform.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s Google\u2019s hope that this new, simpler name will usher in understanding and leave the door open to expand advertising options without confusion in the future.<\/p>\n<h2>\u2026 and Google Marketing Platform<\/h2>\n<p><em>You can probably jump right over this one if you\u2019re a small business\u2026<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Use DoubleClick or Analytics 360?

This will make it easier for both parties to \u201cplan, buy, measure and optimize digital media and customer experiences in one place.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As part of Google Marketing Platform, Google has also released a new feature called Display &amp; Video 360. This tool aims to enable \u201ccreative, agency, and media teams to collaborate and execute ad campaigns end-to-end in a single place.\u201d This collaborative sandbox situation sounds similar to Facebook\u2019s Creative Hub, which is, as the kids would say, hella useful.<\/p>\n<p>The bottom line: Pretttttttttty neat <em>if<\/em> you\u2019ve got reason to use it (but if you\u2019re not Adidas or La Croix or some luxury SUV manufacturer, it may as well not exist).<\/p>\n<h2>\u00a0\u2026 and Google Ad Manager<\/h2>\n<p>Finally, we come to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blog.google\/products\/admanager\/introducing-google-ad-manager\/\">Ad Manager<\/a>, Google\u2019s shiny new programmatic platform.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"dabed8d6-4345-4d0d-aec4-7f50fd9089c3\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-ad-manager-logo.png\" alt=\"google-ad-manager-logo\" width=\"217\" height=\"149\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>A mashup of DoubleClick for Publishers and DoubleClick Ad Exchange (with a buzzword-worthy logo to boot!), Google Ad Manager is the search titan\u2019s \u201ccomplete and unified programmatic platform,\u201d designed to \u201cdo even more for [Google\u2019s] partners\u2014earning them more money, more efficiently, wherever people are watching videos, playing games or engaging with content, and however advertisers are looking to work with them.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Overhauling Brand Architecture in the Name of Simplicity<\/h2>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, these substantial rebranding efforts are fueled by a growing need for simplicity in online advertising.<\/p>\n<p>Consider the following\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Conceptually, AdWords was built for a computer-first world, one where someone gets home from work, has a smoke, retires to their chambers, and surfs the web for what very well may have been the first time that day.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re younger than me, you might not even remember such a place existed.<\/p>\n<p>Today we live in a mobile-first world, one in which we make initial queries on phones, conduct research from a three-monitor setup at the office, watch product videos on YouTube, and fork over our credit card information via some kind of voice-powered-AI.<\/p>\n<p>Google can help advertisers reach prospects at every stage of this funnel, a fact that simply isn\u2019t conveyed by \u201cAdWords.\u201d Google Ads on the other hand\u2026<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"82d986ea-0b8f-44aa-ad60-d4fc17e591a6\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/emoji-hands.png\" alt=\"emoji-hands\" width=\"120\" height=\"120\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Google Ads (all three new names, in fact) is succinct enough to make it clear what value business can derive from the platform <em>and<\/em> broad enough to house future Google acquisitions without inciting further confusion. Win-win.<\/p>\n<p>This simplicity is by no means limited to naming conventions: One new(ish) feature that exemplifies the simplicity Google\u2019s striving towards is the new Smart Campaigns.<\/p>\n<h2>How Smart are \u201cSmart Campaigns\u201d?<\/h2>\n<p>Built atop the same tech that powered AdWords Express, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/outreach-initiatives\/small-business\/google-ads-helping-businesses\/\">Smart Campaigns <\/a>are tailor-made for busy small business owners with little in the way of paid search expertise, and little in the way of time. The feature allows busy advertisers to \u201ccreate ads in minutes and drive real results\u2014like making your phone ring, sending leads to your website, or bringing customers to your store.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sounds neat, but will they work?<\/p>\n<p>If you recall, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/08\/11\/google-adwords-express-review\">AdWords Express,<\/a> though <em>fast<\/em>, was not particularly effective for <em>many businesses<\/em> because it stripped control from advertisers and put it in the hands of machine learning. Smart Campaigns build on the premise that most small businesses just want to drive calls, store visits, and conversions, and don\u2019t have the time or expertise to learn how to use AdWords (uhh, Google Ads), so why not place your budget in Google\u2019s machine learning-enabled hands.<\/p>\n<p>Fast? Totally. But that doesn\u2019t mean it understands the ins and outs of your business, and that\u2019s a problem.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"5851f0ff-2ed6-402e-9781-0c51c664279e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/business-animation.png\" alt=\"business-animation\" width=\"800\" height=\"429\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><em>That being said\u2026<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, it comes down to a simple question: do the time savings and the results from the simplified product generate a net win for your business? If you\u2019re only spending a few hundred dollars a month on advertising, Smart Campaigns might be a decent option for you. On the other hand, if your monthly budget has a comma (or two, or three), it\u2019s a different story entirely.<\/p>\n<h2>Embracing Audiences Over Keywords<\/h2>\n<p>Complexity across Google\u2019s advertising platforms has led to a need for simple solutions.<\/p>\n<p>In the past, we\u2019ve speculated about Google transitioning away from keywords in favor of audience-centric targeting, similar to what you might find in paid social channels like Facebook and LinkedIn (and we aren\u2019t the only ones!).<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"febac04b-5b64-4d8a-b76a-e404688a968b\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/google-rebranding-tweet.png\" alt=\"google-rebranding-tweet\" width=\"610\" height=\"595\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>By stripping \u201cwords\u201d from the name of its ever-evolving ad platform, Google has begun the process of shifting advertiser perception away from <strong>keyword intent <\/strong>(the secret sauce that makes search queries so damn valuable as an advertising tool) and to a world where our focus shifts towards <strong>audiences<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>While search will always remain an intent-centric and thus keyword-reliant space (augmented with audiences via tools like RLSA, in-market, etc.), the rollout of Google Ads makes taking a holistic approach to online advertising (investing in channels that don\u2019t directly result in conversions) more palatable for many small businesses.<\/p>\n<h2>Implications for Agencies (and SaaS Companies)<\/h2>\n<p>Naturally, if you\u2019re an agency or in-house SaaS marketer, there are some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/01\/new-google-ads-features-for-agencies\">changes you\u2019re going to need to account for<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For one, any paid and organic initiatives that previously hinged on the keyword \u201cadwords\u201d or ancillary keywords related to it will need to be tweaked. If you\u2019re an agency that offers AdWords services, you\u2019re going to need to figure out how to guide your clients through those changes.<\/p>\n<p>The good thing is, \u201cadwords\u201d as a term and as a concept isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon. Campaigns leveraging it won\u2019t suddenly drop off the page. Still, it will be a good idea to monitor paid and organic search volumes around \u201cgoogle ads\u201d and \u201cadwords\u201d as you go about making page updates and bid adjustments.<\/p>\n<h2>Google Ads: A Brave New World?<\/h2>\n<p>So..ultimately, what\u2019s changing here?<\/p>\n<p>Are you looking at massive campaign overhauls? No, probably not.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s new brands will be rolling out gradually over the next month; and given its commitment to transparency, you can expect day-to-day campaign operation to remain more or less the same. In effect, Google has streamlined its ad and marketing experience. And in a growingly complex landscape of digital marketing apps, tools, and software, that\u2019s a move we can get on board with.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google has made the executive decision to consolidate its overwhelming abundance of ad products under three brand new umbrellas: Google Ads, Google Marketing Platform, and Google Ads Manager.
