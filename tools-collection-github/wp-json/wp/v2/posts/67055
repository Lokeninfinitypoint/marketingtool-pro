The primary purpose is to help search engines understand your site and locate specific pages with ease. There are also sitemaps that help users navigate your site, which we\u2019ll get into later.<\/p>\n<p>Below is an example of a sitemap.<\/p>\n<p>\u26a0\ufe0f Warning: This is going to look intimidating, but it won&#8217;t be so scary by the end of this post.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/xml-sitemap-example-utf-8.png\" alt=\"example of a sitemap\" width=\"623\" height=\"638\" class=\"wp-image-67075 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/xml-sitemap-example-utf-8.png 623w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/xml-sitemap-example-utf-8-480x491.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 623px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sitemaps.org\/protocol.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>To understand the importance of sitemaps in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/seo\">SEO<\/a>, you have to first understand how search engines work.

With that being said and with the information above, here is a deeper dive into the benefits of having a sitemap:<\/p>\n<h3>Get your pages crawled and indexed faster<\/h3>\n<p>Google can\u2019t crawl the entire internet every single day. Instead, it has different crawl \u201cschedules\u201d for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/07\/14\/website-examples\">different websites<\/a> and content types\u2014so sometimes it can take days, weeks, or even months for Google to discover new pages on your site. Sitemaps can help Google to discover and index new pages faster.<\/p>\n<h3>Keep high-value pages performing well<\/h3>\n<p>Have you ever updated a page on your site\u2014perhaps to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/03\/get-more-traffic-from-evergreen-content\">refresh your evergreen content<\/a>\u2014but not seen the changes reflected in the SERP? That&#8217;s because Google hasn\u2019t crawled the page since your update. With more efficient crawling and indexing, you can ensure that users are seeing the most up-to-date version of your highest value and\/or frequently modified pages.<\/p>\n<h3>Help search bots locate orphan pages<\/h3>\n<p>Google\u2019s bots often discover pages on your site much like visitors do\u2014by following the links on the pages it\u2019s crawling (which is why <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/04\/internal-linking\">internal linking<\/a> is so important). Orphan pages are pages on your site that don\u2019t have other links pointing to it, making them hard to reach for Google. But with those pages in your sitemap, Google can more easily locate and index them.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/what-is-a-sitemap-orphan-page-example.png\" alt=\"what is a sitemap - orphan pages\" width=\"720\" height=\"481\" class=\"size-full wp-image-67084 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/what-is-a-sitemap-orphan-page-example.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/what-is-a-sitemap-orphan-page-example-480x321.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.seobility.net\/en\/wiki\/Orphan_Pages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Image source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Help Google discern duplicate pages<\/h3>\n<p>There are several scenarios where a business website will have duplicate or near-duplicate pages\u2014for example, on an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/08\/how-to-build-an-ecommerce-website\">ecommerce site<\/a> you may have duplicate product pages with different colors of that product. In these cases, Google might not know which version of the page is the main version that you want to rank. With a sitemap, you can use canonical tags to show Google which version is the main one and which ones are duplicates.<br \/>\n<a id=\"need\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Do I need a sitemap?<\/h2>\n<p>In general, Google does a pretty good job at finding web pages on the internet on its own, but a sitemap, as we established above, can help <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/seo\">improve your SEO<\/a>\u2014for some sites more than others. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/docs\/crawling-indexing\/sitemaps\/overview#do-i-need-a-sitemap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google<\/a>, you need a sitemap if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You have a large (500+ page) site. <\/strong>Thousands of pages means more chances that Google\u2019s crawlers might overlook new or updated pages.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your internal linking is lacking. <\/strong>Aka lots of orphan pages.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your site is new or has few <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/10\/link-building-secrets\">backlinks<\/a>. <\/strong>Since web crawlers discover website pages by following links from one site to another.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You have a lot of rich media.<\/strong> Aka images, videos, or news pages that you want to show in search results.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a id=\"types\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Types of sitemaps<\/h2>\n<p>There are two types of sitemaps. HTML sitemaps (hypertext markup language, geared for humans) and XML sitemaps (extensible markup language, geared for bots).<\/p>\n<h3>HTML sitemaps<\/h3>\n<p>An HTML sitemap is an actual website page, visible to visitors, with a list of clickable links to all of the pages on your site. This is the old method for creating a sitemap, but it is still valuable, especially for large websites.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/blog\/2005\/09\/how-is-google-sitemap-different-from\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google encourages HTML sitemaps<\/a> because a hierarchical list of links can help Google better understand what\u2019s most important and index accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example of an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.homedepot.com\/c\/site_map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HTML sitemap of homedepot.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/html-sitemap-example.png\" alt=\"html sitemap example by home depot\" width=\"720\" height=\"483\" class=\"size-full wp-image-67080 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/html-sitemap-example.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/html-sitemap-example-480x322.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>XML sitemaps<\/h3>\n<p>An <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/blog\/2005\/09\/how-is-google-sitemap-different-from\">XML<\/a> sitemap is a text file that provides a list of URLs on your site.

But while you can see a site&#8217;s XML sitemap, they&#8217;re not meant to be a navigational tools for visitors\u2014just for search engines.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what our XML sitemap looks like.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/xml-sitemap-example.png\" alt=\"xml sitemap example\" width=\"720\" height=\"512\" class=\"size-full wp-image-67079 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/xml-sitemap-example.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/xml-sitemap-example-480x341.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>XML sitemaps allow you to use tags to provide information about the URLs in it, such as date last modified.

Basically, you need to generate your sitemap, check it against best practices, and then submit it to Google. Here&#8217;s how to do it:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Use a sitemap generator to create your sitemap<\/h3>\n<p>Sitemap generators are plugins and softwares that offer a no-code process for creating sitemaps.

Follow sitemap best practices<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/docs\/crawling-indexing\/sitemaps\/build-sitemap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google provides extensive sitemap best practices here<\/a>, but here are some simple guidelines to get started:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Break up large sitemaps.<\/strong> If you have a long list of URLs, break your sitemap into multiple and thens submit a <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/docs\/crawling-indexing\/sitemaps\/large-sitemaps\">sitemap index file<\/a> (sort of like a sitemap of your sitemaps).<\/li>\n<li><strong>List only your canonical URLs. <\/strong>If you have duplicate or near-duplicate pages (as mentioned above), list only the main URL in your sitemap that you want to appear in search results (the canonical version). For the other versions, use the rel=canonical tag.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use UTF-8 encoding. <\/strong>All sitemap files can only contain ASCII characters\u2014which means numbers 0-9, English letters A-Z, and only some special characters. Characters like the ampersand, quotation marks, or greater\/less than need to be replaced with escape codes:<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/sitemap-escape-codes.png\" alt=\"sitemap escape codes\" width=\"720\" height=\"370\" class=\"size-full wp-image-67076 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/sitemap-escape-codes.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/sitemap-escape-codes-480x247.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/li>\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t focus too much on priority tags. <\/strong>You can use priority tags in your sitemap to indicate which pages are important relative to one another (for example, assigning values ranging from 0.1 to 1.0), but these are only preferences. At the end of the day, Google will crawl and index according to its own rules.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Never list your NoIndex URLs. <\/strong>A sitemap is for telling Google which URLs <em>to<\/em> crawl and index, not which ones to ignore<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ol><\/ol>\n<h3>3.
