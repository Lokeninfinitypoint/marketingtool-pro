This meant that running ads on Instagram was immediately going to be more cost effective for marketers \u2013 in fact, twice as cost effective.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, Masek said as Instagram started rolling out ads, users were clicking on them at a much higher rate than they were on Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUsers have become accustomed to ads on their Facebook newsfeed and started clicking less on them \u2013 the same way the first banner ad on the web drove a 44% CTR and today\u2019s banners drive a 0.1% CTR,\u201d he added. \u201cSo when Instagram rolled out ads, not only were they cheaper, but the <a href=\"\/click-through-rate\">CTRs<\/a> were through the roof.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For his part, Damon Gochneaur, founder of digital marketing agency <a href=\"https:\/\/aspiroagency.com\/\">Aspiro Agency<\/a>, noted the average cost to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/15\/why-advertise-on-instagram\">advertise on Instagram<\/a> can vary wildly depending on the type of ad, the audience targeted and the type of creative used.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn general, single image ads will be the most expensive, with a carousel or multiple image ads generally performing better than single image ads,\u201d Gochneaur said. \u201cAdditionally, video ads will typically outperform both single image ads as well as carousel ads.\u00a0In addition, the audience you\u2019re targeting will also have an effect on the cost of the ad.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"videos\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed_video\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"71c48843-7384-4ca3-97a7-36d87f66cd39\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/PoRPEahr0e0?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Example of a video ad on Instagram from Netflix<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis [$5 CPM] is still much cheaper than pretty much any other channel for <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/18\/google-display-network-tips\">display ads<\/a>, especially given the fact that you can target so effectively,\u201d Baumwald added. \u201cThat said, if you&#8217;re in a highly competitive market, either because of your product or location, the costs can rise dramatically.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a look at how advertisers can rein in those <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/13\/instagram-algorithm\">Instagram<\/a> ad costs, no matter what market they are in.<\/p>\n<p><em>P.S Check out our updated post on the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2021\/02\/08\/instagram-ads-cost\">cost to advertise on Instagram on 2021<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>1. Don\u2019t over-produce your ad content.<\/h2>\n<p>In part because users can\u2019t schedule posts on Instagram, Havey said candid-style posts perform well.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf users feel like they\u2019re seeing something fresh and authentic, they\u2019re much more likely to engage and warm to your brand,\u201d he said. \u201cUser-generated content can work wonders and helps create a two-way relationship between brand and consumer.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"8bd06f4b-7f16-4106-9b71-4427645b9630\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pet-groomers-instagram-ad-1.png\" alt=\"Best Instagram Ads\" width=\"360\" height=\"523\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Havey also noted the best social ads are those that <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/07\/native-advertising-examples\">appear native<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNobody enjoys seeing an ad stick out like sore thumb in their carefully curated Instagram lifestyle feed,\u201d he said. \u201cAs such, focusing on powerful visual storytelling and brand marketing, rather than trying to drive direct response, can often lead to better results.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Scott Bauer, marketing director at digital marketing firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.navigatormm.com\/\">Navigator Multimedia<\/a>, said Instagram users have quickly learned how to identify ads versus followers, so advertisers should remember they may only get a second or two of a user\u2019s attention before he or she scrolls on.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find the highest ROI not necessarily in the lowest CPM, so I recommend creating content that is in line with your target audience and don\u2019t ask for the sale too soon,\u201d he said. \u201cInstagram is very visual and you want to create top-funnel content to introduce your business\/brand.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He added, \u201cToo many advertisers treat Instagram like they do search ads and it\u2019s not the same context.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>2. Build audiences with video.<\/h2>\n<p>Per Gochneaur, brands looking to lower <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/20\/instagram-advertising\">Instagram ad<\/a> costs should make slideshow-style videos from photo assets and use those <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/23\/youtube-advertising-tips\">video ads<\/a> to target consumers that are top of the funnel and have no <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/08\/brand-affinity-marketing\">brand affinity<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cVideo traffic is a lower acquisition cost and allows you to build audiences more affordably \u2013 the key phrase being \u2018build audiences\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you&#8217;ve driven traffic from the initial video ad, you&#8217;ll then want to use remarketing mapped to a sales funnel in order to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/growth-academy\">drive revenue and business growth<\/a> from Instagram traffic.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"248735f9-3cd2-4491-b1b2-baadef585000\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/remarketing-1.jpg\" alt=\"Remarketing concept diagram\" width=\"632\" height=\"300\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h2>3. Test your creative and audiences.<\/h2>\n<p>For his part, Masek said as users become more accustomed to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/07\/instagram-story-ads\">Instagram ads<\/a> and CPMs are tightening, marketers can increase their ad performance by testing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFacebook and Instagram reward the brands that serve relevant content to their users. The higher your CTR, the higher your relevance score and the lower your CPMs \u2013 that\u2019s how it works,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The way to make your ads relevant is to test different combinations of an audience, messaging and creative,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t blast the same ad to everyone. Instead, pick five different audiences, set them up as separate as campaigns, and then create five different ads for each audience. Then, sit back, spend media budget and see how the world responds to your ads.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As a result, Masek said marketers might find one of those audiences is driving a 10x cheaper CPC, and that within that audience, one specific Instagram ad is driving a 5x higher CTR.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTurn everything else off, and <strong>shift your budget to your winning combination<\/strong>. That\u2019s how you game the system,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Optimize based on demographics.<\/h2>\n<p>Mendenhall noted that because Instagram Ads are launched through Facebook\u2019s advertising platform, marketers have access to the same type of data \u2013 and they should use it.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"8ad0aef1-3ec3-4d3f-864c-a2bf2fc5685e\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-ad-costs-demographic-targeting.png\" alt=\"demographic targeting in ads\" width=\"528\" height=\"904\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>\u201cWe recommend taking a look at which demographic is generating the most expensive results and omitting them from targeting,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you check your data and see that men between the ages of 45-54 have a cost per click of $2.00, removing them from your targeting will help reduce your costs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Baumwald\u00a0agreed. \u201cBy segmenting your ads based on different criteria, it will quickly become clear which audiences have the lowest costs,\u201d Baumwald said.<\/p>\n<p>Mendenhall also suggested starting an Instagram campaign with a select audience and adapting as costs rise.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you add\/remove a targeting parameter and see the cost per result go down, make a note of that for the future,\u201d he said. \u201cContinue tweaking as needed.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>5. Mind your Relevance Score.<\/h2>\n<p>On a related note, Mendenhall pointed to Relevance Score, which is how Facebook judges the quality of an ad.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7b818054-8349-4cbd-9c9e-9d0870498bba\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ads-on-facebook-relevance-score.png\" alt=\"instagram ad features\" width=\"458\" height=\"389\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>\u201cThis is based on creative, targeting and the results of your ad,\u201d he said. \u201cThe higher your Relevance Score, the more efficiently your budget will be used.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In addition, David Bosley, managing partner at digital marketing agency <a href=\"https:\/\/pbjmarketing.com\/\">PBJ Marketing<\/a>, said marketers who find they aren&#8217;t getting impressions using the target CPA\/CPL\/CPI method can try taking the average of the suggested bid and doubling it.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou likely will not pay that extremely high rate, but it will win you more auctions and, on average, you could still hit your target metrics,\u201d he said. \u201cGive it a try \u2013 it doesn&#8217;t work for everyone but when it does it yields incredible results.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>6. Build out a campaign.<\/h2>\n<p>The ability to target the same users on Facebook and Instagram gives marketers a chance to build a campaign with multiple touch points\u00a0without much trouble, Havey said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA social ad strategy that employs proper use of each platform can help take your audience from awareness to purchase to advocacy with ease if executed correctly,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Create dedicated landing pages.<\/h2>\n<p>According to Baumwald, brands should also carefully consider what happens once consumers who click your Instagram ads actually land on a web page.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDoes the creative in the ad match what they see on the website? Are you making it easy for users to convert by following best practices?\u201d he asked. \u201c<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/01\/high-converting-landing-page-images\">Better-converting landing pages<\/a> make it much easier to absorb the costs of slightly more expensive Instagram campaigns. For a truly effective campaign, be sure to build out dedicated landing pages and don&#8217;t send people to your homepage.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Bosley noted the most successful Instagram campaigns have mobile-friendly objectives, like brand awareness, app installs, lead gen and sending users to a mobile-friendly website that loads in three seconds or less.<\/p>\n<h2>8. Retarget.<\/h2>\n<p>Adding a tracking pixel to a website or app enables brands to easily retarget consumers who have visited their sites.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSince these people will already be familiar with your brand, the advertising will be much more effective,\u201d Baumwald said. \u201cThe cost may be similar, but the number of people converting should be much higher.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6e4e8068-73eb-4379-9b07-122b54aeace0\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-fatigue-example.png\" alt=\"instagram retargeting\" width=\"437\" height=\"459\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>He added one caveat: \u201cThis will be a much smaller audience you&#8217;re targeting so it&#8217;s important to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/09\/30\/ad-fatigue\">change your creative<\/a> on a regular basis so that your audience isn&#8217;t seeing the same ads from you over and over again.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Instagram posts tend to get 10 times more engagement than Facebook posts on average.
