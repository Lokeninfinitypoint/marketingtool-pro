(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.outerboxdesign.com\/web-design-articles\/mobile-ecommerce-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OuterBox<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>80% of Americans are online shoppers.

It\u2019s sort of a catch-all term that refers to how well your website is built\u2014and, in turn, how easily people can navigate it to accomplish whatever it is they need to accomplish.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of your ecommerce website, a good UX enables your site visitors to quickly find the product information they need and to make purchases when they\u2019re ready. If you bury key product details in the darkest corners of your site and make prospects jump through a series of hoops to make purchases, you\u2019re not offering a good UX.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"73beeb1c-531a-4a09-90a2-92a0d00027ff\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ecommerce-statistics-mobile-ux-example.jpg\" alt=\"mobile ecommerce UX example from lululemon\" width=\"400\" height=\"712\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>Make it easy for users to get where they need to go.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The stats you see above make it plain. If you give online shoppers a good mobile UX, they\u2019ll reward you by making purchases. And if you give them a bad mobile UX, they\u2019ll punish you by giving their money to your competitors.<\/p>\n<p>You can learn more about building a good mobile website <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/web\/fundamentals\/design-and-ux\/principles\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Ecommerce statistics: Conversion rates<\/h2>\n<p>The stats for this final section come from our brand new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/01\/shopping-ads-benchmarks\">Shopping Benchmarks report<\/a>\u2014a deep dive into how <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigcommerce.com\/blog\/ecommerce-business-ideas\/\">ecommerce businesses<\/a> from 16 different verticals are performing on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/04\/google-shopping-campaigns-tips-tricks\">Google Shopping<\/a> and Bing Shopping.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Across all verticals, the average Google Shopping conversion rate is 1.91% and the average Bing Shopping conversion rate is 1.74%.<\/li>\n<li>Although you can expect to convert Google shoppers at a higher rate, you\u2019ll have to pay a premium for it. Whereas the average Google Shopping CPA is $38.87, the average Bing Shopping CPA is only $23.05.<\/li>\n<li>Ecommerce businesses in the Office &amp; Business Needs vertical are <em>killing it <\/em>on Bing Shopping: they convert clicks into actions at an average rate of 15.19%.<\/li>\n<li>Turning to Google Shopping, HVAC businesses are killing it, too: They boast an average conversion rate of 3.30% and an average CPA of just $7.28.<\/li>\n<li>Advertisers in the Chemical &amp; Industrial sector have one of the toughest jobs out there: less than 1% of their Google Shopping clicks convert into actions, and each conversion they <em>do <\/em>get costs $91.21 on average.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Key takeaway: Multi-channel is the way to go<\/h3>\n<p>Often, marketers take one look at Bing\u2019s share of the search engine market\u2014anywhere between 3% and 5%, depending on where you look\u2014and write if off completely. Although every business has unique goals and limitations, we generally recommend <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/25\/bings-ads-vs-google-adwords\">giving Bing Ads a shot<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Why? Because 4% of search engine users is <strong>millions of people<\/strong>. Millions of people\u2014some of whom, we\u2019re willing to bet, being qualified to be your customers\u2014use Bing every single day to find the solutions to their problems.

And try this one on for size: Whereas the average Google Shopping advertiser spends $770 per month, the average Bing Shopping advertiser spends half that much. Not only can you expect to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/07\/25\/ecommerce-user-experience\">drive conversions<\/a> at a low cost\u2014you can expect to face less competition for the top sponsored spots, too.<\/p>\n<p>And by the way: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/topics\/4294\/bing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bing users tend to be middle-aged an affluent<\/a>. If that sounds like your buyer persona, Bing Shopping is a no-brainer.<\/p>\n<h2>Using ecommerce statistics to inform your strategy<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s true that it\u2019s not possible to know what lies ahead.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, here are some predictions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ecommerce sales will keep rising; brick-and-mortar retail sales will keep declining. An important factor to consider here is the generational shift. As the \u201cdigital native\u201d Generation Z enters the workforce, their spending power will increase, and it\u2019s safe to assume that they will be more inclined to buy online than the previous generations. Meanwhile, millennials will continue climbing the career ladder, which will result in more disposable income. This will also have a positive impact on ecommerce sales.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Online shopping will get more popular in emerging markets in Africa, Asia, Middle East, and Latin America as these regions become more developed and the spending power of the average person increases.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon will remain dominant. Other major retailers, such as Walmart, are working hard to establish themselves online. However, when it comes to dethroning Amazon, there\u2019s still no serious contender in sight.<\/li>\n<li>Conversational commerce will be an essential part of selling online. At the moment, customers are still getting used to being able to contact businesses via messaging apps, but soon they will expect it. And who can blame them? It\u2019s a convenient way to get answers to their questions.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/14\/chatbot-marketing\">Chatbots<\/a> might become the only way to meet people\u2019s expectations when it comes to customer service, since the more businesses adopt them, the more pressure there is on their competitors to do the same.<\/li>\n<li>Shoppable social media will only become more prevalent. As evidenced by the rollout of shopping for Instagram Stories in the fall of 2018 and the anticipation of the same within Facebook Stories, the days of \u201clink in bio\u201d are very much numbered. Give your followers the chance to act on the inspiration your visual creative instills in them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In short, ecommerce isn\u2019t going anywhere, but it will continue to evolve, and you will need to adapt to those changes.<\/p>\n<p>In order to do so, you\u2019ll need to keep an eye on the latest <a href=\"https:\/\/leelinesourcing.com\/ecommerce-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ecommerce statistics<\/a> to stay up-to-date with industry standards.
