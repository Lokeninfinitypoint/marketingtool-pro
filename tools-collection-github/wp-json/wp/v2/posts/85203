With Meta\u2019s ad targeting, you can get in front of your audience when they\u2019re most receptive. But when you\u2019re targeting your audience, you want to make sure you\u2019re making the most of those views.

This is in organic posts, rather than ads. But it goes to show that even on a platform dominated by visuals, your copy matters.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of Instagram ads specifically, it&#8217;s also<a href=\"https:\/\/www.brafton.com\/blog\/social-media\/social-advertising-benchmarks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> been found<\/a> that in-feed ads perform better than Stories ads. They found that the click-through rate (CTR) for feed ads on Instagram ranges between 0.22% and 0.88%, and the CTR for Stories ads varies between 0.33% and 0.54%. A big difference between in-feed and Stories ads? The copy requirements.<\/p>\n<p>Still, users report that Instagram Stories with a narrative including photos, videos, and text are the most appealing\u2014and the most likely to get them to keep clicking through.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-chart.webp\" alt=\"instagram ad copy - chart of converting instagram stories\" width=\"664\" height=\"429\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85229 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-chart.webp 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-chart-480x310.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/instagram-story-formats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The bottom line?

Stick to Instagram ad guidelines<\/h3>\n<p>The first step to writing Instagram <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/03\/ad-copy-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ad copy that converts<\/a> is sticking to the guidelines. There\u2019s no sense wasting your time writing a quippy narrative description that\u2019s going to get cut off before the product is mentioned\u2014or, say, name-dropping that celebrity if it isn\u2019t going to make the strict character limit and grab some eyes in the feed.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-name-drop.webp\" alt=\"instagram ad copy example - cuddle and kind\" width=\"402\" height=\"604\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85231 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-name-drop.webp 402w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-name-drop-200x300.webp 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/cuddleandkind.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Cuddle + Kind<\/em><\/a><em> makes sure Jessica Alba is visible in that copy. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an overview of the character limits to keep in mind for your Instagram ad copy.<\/p>\n<table width=\"624\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\"><strong>Ad type<\/strong><\/td>\n<td width=\"312\"><strong>Character limits<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Instagram feed ads<\/td>\n<td width=\"312\">Primary text: 125 characters<\/p>\n<p>Headline: 40 characters<\/p>\n<p>Max number of hashtags: 30<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Instagram feed video ads<\/td>\n<td width=\"312\">Primary text: 125 characters<\/p>\n<p>Maximum number of hashtags: 30<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Instagram Explore ads<\/td>\n<td width=\"312\">Primary text: 125 characters<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Instagram Stories ads<\/td>\n<td width=\"312\">Primary text: 125 characters<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Instagram Carousel ads character limits<\/td>\n<td width=\"312\">Primary text: 125 characters<\/p>\n<p>Maximum number of hashtags: 30<\/p>\n<p>Landing page URL required<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Instagram Reels ads<\/td>\n<td width=\"312\">Primary text: 72 characters<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>Keep these guidelines in mind so that you can maximize the space you do have for your Instagram ad copy.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Know your goal<\/h3>\n<p>When you\u2019re<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/10\/03\/how-to-write-exceptional-ppc-ad-copy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> writing an ad<\/a>, it\u2019s important to know your goal. Do you want to persuade a customer to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/15\/selling-on-instagram\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> click a link and complete a purchase<\/a>? Do you want a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/29\/how-to-promote-a-product\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new customer to learn about your services<\/a>? The way you\u2019d approach writing the copy for these two examples would be really different. That\u2019s why<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/06\/15\/marketing-objectives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> knowing your goal<\/a> before writing the copy is key.<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re advertising on Instagram, you\u2019ll set objectives for your ads. This keeps the goal clear while you\u2019re creating the ads, when Meta is serving them to viewers, and when you&#8217;re measuring their performance. Here are the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/facebook-ad-objectives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ad objectives that Meta offers for Instagram<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Awareness:<\/strong> If you need more people to know your brand, this is your goal. When you select this, Meta will serve your ad to the largest number of people because it\u2019s the least targeted.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Traffic:<\/strong> You want people to click a link to a specific page\u2014whether it\u2019s your brand\u2019s social profile, a specific piece of content, or a product page.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Engagement: <\/strong>This ad objective directs Meta to serve the ad to Instagram users most likely to engage with your brand and your brand\u2019s content in direct messages, comments, and likes.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Leads: <\/strong>This objective collects email addresses and other information from people interested in your brand, your content, and your offering.<\/li>\n<li><strong>App promotion: <\/strong>If you want people to download an app, you want them to be on their phones. When you select this objective, Meta will serve your ad only to Instagram users who are on their phones.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sales: <\/strong>You want people who are ready to buy to see your ad. It\u2019s a smaller subset, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s more targeted.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Selecting the right ad objective will direct Meta to serve the ads appropriately on Instagram. Keeping this goal in mind while you write will help you better persuade your audience into an action\u2014whether it\u2019s stopping a scroll to recognize your brand name, clicking a link, or even adding an item to a cart.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 <strong>Are you using the right campaign objective and ad copy for your Facebook strategy?<\/strong> Find out how your ads are currently performing with our free <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/facebook-advertising?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_FBGrader_FBGrader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook Ads Grader<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h3>3. Choose the right CTA<\/h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/03\/emotional-marketing-copy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing copywriting<\/a>, your goal is to prompt an action. When you\u2019re writing an Instagram ad, you want to close with a <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/powerful-call-to-action-phrases\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">compelling call to actio<\/a>n\u2014so it\u2019s important to choose the right one.<\/p>\n<p>Now, we\u2019re saying that you need to \u201cchoose\u201d the right CTA here intentionally. When you\u2019re creating an Instagram ad, you\u2019ll have to select a call to action based on your designated ad objective. This is limiting, but luckily there are lots of options.<\/p>\n<p>Some CTAs include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn More<\/li>\n<li>Listen More<\/li>\n<li>Order Now<\/li>\n<li>Send WhatsA Message<\/li>\n<li>Send Message<\/li>\n<li>Request Time<\/li>\n<li>See Menu<\/li>\n<li>Shop Now<\/li>\n<li>Sign Up<\/li>\n<li>Subscribe<\/li>\n<li>Watch More<\/li>\n<li>Get Quote<\/li>\n<li>Apply Now<\/li>\n<li>Book Now<\/li>\n<li>Contact Us<\/li>\n<li>Download<\/li>\n<li>Get Showtimes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The options that you\u2019ll see for an individual Instagram ad will vary depending on your ad objective.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-cta-example-1.webp\" alt=\"instagram ad copy - example instagram cta\" width=\"412\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85225 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-cta-example-1.webp 412w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-cta-example-1-206x300.webp 206w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A great example of a specific CTA with \u201cGet quote\u201d in this ad.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>4. Speak to your audience<\/h3>\n<p>One of the biggest benefits of running ads on Instagram is the opportunity to reach your target audience. Instagram has over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/topics\/1882\/instagram\/#topicOverview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2 billion active monthly users<\/a>, so your potential customers are definitely on the app. And with Meta\u2019s ad targeting options for Instagram, you can make sure your ads get in front of the right people.<\/p>\n<p>So when you\u2019re crafting your copy, you need to write directly for your audience specifically. What are they worried about? What are they motivated by? What will make them stop scrolling and read your full ad? What key words do you want to appear first in that caption or even in the creative?<\/p>\n<p>Take this example from <a href=\"https:\/\/piccalio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Piccalio<\/a>, which has been on my Instagram feed for months now since I\u2019ve been shopping for toddler towers. This brand has a great description of on its website: \u201cPiccalio is an online children&#8217;s part-toy, part-furniture shop designed for learning and play.\u201d The part-toy, part-furniture pieces are pricey when compared to other options on the market, Green Guard certified, and available in neutral wood tones, which appear in almost all the photos. Some are also available in other colors, including black or mint green, but these rarely make the website photos or the Instagram feed\u2014a commitment to the brand aesthetics.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s no surprise that the copy in this Instagram ad is also an excellent commitment to the brand identity and speaks directly to its audience: Busy parents with some disposable income and a desire to help their toddler learn in a fun, safe setting. And maybe without adding any more bulking plastic clutter or garish bright colors to their home.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-example.webp\" alt=\"instagram ad copy - example personalized instagram ad copy\" width=\"399\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85226 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-example.webp 399w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-example-200x300.webp 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The ad copy urges the reader to \u201cfind out\u201d for themselves why the Helper Tower is beloved by so many parents who made the purchase for their own kids. It explains that this tower will help you teach your child valuable skills in the kitchen. Here, the wording is particular. It doesn\u2019t say that this tower will help your kid learn\u2014it promises the opportunity to spend quality time while accomplishing daily household chores. This connects directly to the brand\u2019s promise to combine learning with play\u2014and the ad copy is speaking directly to those busy parents.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Use your brand voice<\/h3>\n<p>There are more than <a href=\"https:\/\/business.instagram.com\/getting-started\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">200 million business accounts<\/a> on Instagram. Most users follow multiple business accounts, according to the social media platform. And anyone who has logged into Instagram knows how often ads appear in your feed, Stories, and explore page content.<\/p>\n<p>With so much brand content, you want to make sure yours stands out. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/10\/27\/brand-messaging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Using your brand voice<\/a> in your Instagram ad copy will help.<\/p>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t already, now is a great time to determine your brand voice. Is it silly or serious? Do you use emojis sparingly or all the time? Do you use phrases and slang, or are you a stickler for full sentences and punctuation, even on Instagram? These decisions all help create a sense of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/03\/31\/brand-personality-messaging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brand personality<\/a>, which will help your audience connect with you and help you stand out on Instagram.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-brand-voice.webp\" alt=\"instagram ad copy example - revival\" width=\"405\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85227 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-brand-voice.webp 405w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-brand-voice-203x300.webp 203w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.revivalrugs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Revival<\/em><\/a><em>\u2019s brand voice is confident and casual, with the made up \u201ceverything-proof\u201d and the \u201cbetter\u201d repetition.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>6. Focus on pain points<\/h3>\n<p>If your goal is to<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/lead-generation-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> generate leads<\/a> or encourage a sale, writing Instagram ads that highlight how your product or service will alleviate your potential customer\u2019s pain points will help boost your conversion.<\/p>\n<p>A pain point is a specific problem that your potential customers are grappling with. By identifying this problem, you can better position your solution as <em>the<\/em> solution.<\/p>\n<p>I love this example from Trashie, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.trashie.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">clothes recycling program<\/a> with bright, youthful branding.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-trashie.webp\" alt=\"instagram ad copy - small business example\" width=\"357\" height=\"558\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85232 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-trashie.webp 357w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-trashie-192x300.webp 192w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The in-feed video ad shows how to easily open the bag, fill it with your clothing, and then send it back. But the caption? The recycle emoji. The camel case-like capitalization. The yelling ALL. It feels so casual, just like the chatty video. That copy speaks to a pain point many environmentally conscious consumers have with donating clothing\u2014a very specific potential customer who would be motivated to click the CTA to order.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Feature user-generated content<\/h3>\n<p>Instagram is an amazing example of an app that\u2019s built on <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/social-proof-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social proof<\/a> to drive sales. Influencers cultivate parasocial relationships by sharing personal content as well as brand or affiliate content, which can give their recommendation weight closer to that of a friend than a celebrity endorsement.<\/p>\n<p>But influencer marketing isn\u2019t the only <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/social-selling\">social selling<\/a> that\u2019s going on. Brands benefit from the engagement of their audience. Whether it\u2019s enthusiastic comments on a new product post or tagged user-generated content.<\/p>\n<p>When you have your customers selling your product or service for you? Use that. Get their permission, reshare, and write your Instagram ad copy to emphasize their points.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-user-generated.webp\" alt=\"instagram ad copy - user generated content example\" width=\"664\" height=\"473\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85235 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-user-generated.webp 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-user-generated-480x342.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Not an ad, but an adorable example of user-generated content on Piccalio\u2019s Instagram.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>8. Leverage social proof<\/h3>\n<p>Even if you don\u2019t have great user-generated content yet, you can still use social proof in your Instagram ad copy to encourage leads, sales, or even engagement to learn more about your offering.<\/p>\n<p>You could use the number of reviews or the number of purchases\u2014these all imply the number of people using and benefiting from your offering. You could also call our specific happy customers, especially if they\u2019re recognizable. (That Jessica Alba call-out above? Another example.) You could also feature your reviews or testimonials themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a great example from Blueland.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-social-proof.webp\" alt=\"instagram ad copy - social proof\" width=\"664\" height=\"492\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85234 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-social-proof.webp 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-social-proof-480x356.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The graphic contains the review, which praises the company\u2019s high-quality, plastic-free cleaning solutions. Then Blueland uses the Instagram ad caption to emphasize these two points by calling out its efficacy, ingredients, and elimination of single-use plastics.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Get creative with AI<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to get stuck when you\u2019re writing copy for your brand. Whether you\u2019re staring at a blank page and can\u2019t figure out where to start or you\u2019re churning out copy that all sounds the same, you can get some help from AI.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-copywriting-tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI copywriting tools<\/a> are great ways to jumpstart your drafts and get some creative inspiration. With a tool like<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/08\/chatgpt-prompts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> ChatGPT, you can enter a prompt<\/a> with the object, the character limits, and the content to come up with a dozen starter ad captions. Or, if you\u2019re already using a social media management platform that offers this, you can take advantage of the AI assistants to improve your copy or generate alternatives.<\/p>\n<p>Just remember: You can\u2019t quite copy and paste and call it a day. View this as a first draft. You still need to review, revise, and proof this copy.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Skip hashtags\u2014unless it\u2019s for your brand<\/h3>\n<p>When you\u2019re writing Instagram ads, you don\u2019t need to<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/how-to-use-hashtags-with-hashtag-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> include hashtags<\/a>. They\u2019ll take up your character limit, and they won\u2019t impact your reach. Because it\u2019s an ad, it won\u2019t show up organically when a user searches a given hashtag.<\/p>\n<p>The only caveat? If using hashtags irreverently or enthusiastically is central to your brand. If it\u2019s a part of your bubbly, Gen-Z-targeted personality, be sure to include them. If a hashtag is the perfect addition to your quippy one-liner in the ad caption? Put it in. Otherwise? You\u2019re good to skip these.<\/p>\n<h3>11. Test your Instagram ad copy<\/h3>\n<p>These are all great strategies for writing Instagram ads that convert. But the ultimate deciding factor is going to be how your audience responds. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a good idea to test your Instagram ad copy.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-test.webp\" alt=\"instagram ad copy - example copy test version a\" width=\"241\" height=\"444\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85233 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-test.webp 241w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-test-163x300.webp 163w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-test-example.webp\" alt=\"instagram ad copy - example copy test version b\" width=\"243\" height=\"447\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85236 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-test-example.webp 243w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-test-example-163x300.webp 163w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Example copy test via <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/learn\/lessons\/how-to-make-your-ads-more-effective\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Facebook ads<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Luckily, Instagram makes this easy to do within the platform. When you\u2019re creating an ad, you can select an A\/B test. Focus on testing the copy\u2014the caption, the copy in the creative, or the CTA\u2014to see which version performs better with your audience. Short, descriptive captions, or longer, voicey sentences. Clean copy or emojis and all-caps emphasis. The only way to determine which copywriting tactics will lead directly to more conversions is to test it out on your audience.<\/p>\n<h3>12. Consider your Instagram ad copy in your creative process<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019ve been talking a lot about how to improve your ad with stronger copy that\u2019s speaking to your audience, emphasizing your brand voice, and more. But make sure that writing ad copy isn\u2019t always just an afterthought. Whenever it\u2019s possible, approach your ad holistically. How does the copy improve the visuals? How should the visuals be edited or arranged differently to echo the copy? These considerations will improve the end product.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, one thing you\u2019ll notice about all these examples is that copy appears in the creative\u2014almost always.<\/p>\n<p>Here are two Instagram ads with solid photos. One uses copy in the ad creative, and the other doesn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-home-services-example.webp\" alt=\"instagram ad copy - ad creative example\" width=\"405\" height=\"581\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85228 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-home-services-example.webp 405w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/instagram-ad-copy-home-services-example-209x300.webp 209w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Lovely house color but as an ad?

Great. The picture and the copy? Chef\u2019s kiss.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Take this as guidance when you\u2019re developing your own Instagram ads. If you\u2019re working on a marketing team with a designer or outsourcing creative development to a freelancer, work closely on the visuals and include copy as a part of the process. And you\u2019re a one-person social media team (hat\u2019s off to you), make sure when you\u2019re taking photos or working on new ad creative, think about the copy appearing alongside the visuals.<\/p>\n<div id=\"how-to-write-instagram-ads\"><\/div>\n<h2>Write Instagram ads that convert<\/h2>\n<p>Like we said earlier, Instagram is primarily a visual platform.
