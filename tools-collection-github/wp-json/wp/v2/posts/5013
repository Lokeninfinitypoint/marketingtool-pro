The offer can be anything (a product, coupon, free guide, or a demo, for example) and the CTA can be anywhere (like a Google ad on the SERP or a newsletter signup button right on your homepage).<\/p>\n<p>A landing page is specific to the offer and provides more details the person needs in order to make a confident decision.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/what-is-a-landing-page-example.png\" alt=\"what is a landing page - ad, landing page, thank you page flow\" width=\"395\" height=\"758\" class=\"wp-image-63873 aligncenter\" \/><br \/>\n<a id=\"landing-page-importance\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Why are landing pages important?<\/h2>\n<p>Landing pages aren\u2019t just important\u2014they\u2019re essential. They\u2019re designed to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/17\/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate\">improve conversion<\/a>, which is ultimately one of your most important metrics. How so? Well, if someone clicks on an ad for your product and lands on your homepage, they\u2019ll have too much information and too many choices for actions.<\/p>\n<p>But if they are brought to an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/effective-landing-pages\">effective landing page<\/a> describing the features and benefits of that product only, with a button or form to obtain that offer right there, think about how much more likely they are to convert. This means that landing pages lead to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>More leads and sales: <\/strong>Higher conversion rates mean more purchases, sign-ups, free trials, you name it. In fact, businesses with more than 30 landing pages <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/blog\/tabid\/6307\/bid\/15424\/The-Key-to-More-Leads-Create-More-Targeted-Conversion-Opportunities-Data.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">generate 7x more leads<\/a> than those with fewer than five.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Higher ROI: <\/strong>Whether you&#8217;re spending on ads, your website, email service, or something else, you&#8217;re getting more results for the same price\u2014 just by changing the URL the visitor goes to.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/importance-of-landing-pages-vs-leads-generated.png\" alt=\"graph showing that businesses with 41+ landing pages generate 600+ leads\" width=\"720\" height=\"429\" class=\"wp-image-63858 size-full aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/importance-of-landing-pages-vs-leads-generated.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/importance-of-landing-pages-vs-leads-generated-480x286.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But it doesn&#8217;t just stop there. When you optimize your landing pages using the tips in this guide, you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Increase brand credibility: <\/strong>Whether it\u2019s influencer endorsements, partnership badges, reviews, or stats, the trust signals you use on your landing pages build your credibility, regardless of whether the user actually converts.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Create a memorable experience: <\/strong>Because landing pages are specific to an offer and even the user, the copy, imagery, and messaging are highly customized, making for a personalized and memorable experience.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In short, landing pages provide a quality experience for visitors and drive conversions using targeted messaging that matches each user\u2019s needs.<br \/>\n<a id=\"websites-vs-landing-pages\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Landing pages vs. websites<\/h2>\n<p>Understanding the difference between a landing page and a website can be confusing since there are different ways to create landing pages for your business. Some businesses create landing pages using their website builder (like SquareSpace) or content management system (like WordPress). In this case, the landing page is a page on your website; it lives on your website&#8217;s domain.<\/p>\n<p>Other businesses use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/05\/b2b-marketing-automation-tactics\">marketing automation<\/a> (like Marketo, for example) to create landing pages. In this case, the landing page isn&#8217;t actually part of your website&#8217;s domain, but lives on a subdomain. So instead of the landing page being at website.com\/ebooks\/beginners-guide-to-saas, it might live at, say marketing.website.com\/beginners-guide-to-saas.<\/p>\n<p>While your website contains all of the information about your business, a landing page contains only the information specific to a particular offer.<br \/>\n<a id=\"types\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Types of landing pages<\/h2>\n<p>There are as many types of landing pages as there are offers. There are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/08\/event-landing-pages\">event landing pages<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/02\/19\/webinar-landing-pages\">webinar landing pages<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/05\/product-landing-pages\">product landing pages<\/a>, newsletter signup landing pages, and more. But in general all landing pages fall into two categories: lead generation landing pages and click-through landing pages.<\/p>\n<h3>Lead generation landing pages<\/h3>\n<p>With lead generation landing pages, the offer is not your final product or service, but something higher up in the funnel, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/18\/gated-content\">gated content<\/a>. By providing their contact information to obtain the offer, the visitor <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/10\/17\/b2b-lead-generation\">becomes a lead<\/a> that you can now follow up with, via phone or email, to nurture through your funnel into customership.<\/p>\n<p>Lead generation landing pages contain a form right on the page for the user to request the offer. Upon filling out the form, they are brought to a thank you page that confirms the next steps\u2014such as that a person will reach out to you, that the guide has been sent to your inbox, or that you can click on a button to download the file.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/ebook-landing-page-example-donedone.png\" alt=\"ebook landing page example by donedone\" width=\"720\" height=\"393\" class=\"wp-image-63842 size-full aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/ebook-landing-page-example-donedone.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/ebook-landing-page-example-donedone-480x262.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/24\/landing-pages-for-lead-generation\">Lead generation landing pages<\/a> are most commonly used by B2B businesses or those that have big-ticket items, as well as by ecommerce businesses looking to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/08\/05\/increase-email-signups\">build their email list<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>\ud83d\ude80 Make landing pages with crazy-high conversion!

Click-through landing pages are typically used for bottom-funnel offers or sales, where the second step is the account creation portal, app store, or checkout window.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/click-through-landing-page-example-landbot.png\" alt=\"click-through landing page example by landbot\" width=\"720\" height=\"411\" class=\"wp-image-63841 size-full aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/click-through-landing-page-example-landbot.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/click-through-landing-page-example-landbot-480x274.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Click-through landing pages are commonly used by ecommerce and SaaS businesses, but anyone can use them.<br \/>\n<a id=\"create-landing-page\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Before you create a landing page<\/h2>\n<p>Now that know why you need landing pages, it&#8217;s time to start creating them. But before you start cranking out those 41+ landing pages to get those 600 leads, you have some homework to do. In order to make these pages purposeful, impactful, and specific, you need to ask yourself:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>What\u2019s my goal?<\/strong> In an ideal world, what would visitors do upon reaching your landing page? Would they buy something? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/07\/27\/landing-page-forms\">Fill out a form<\/a>? Toss aside their keyboard, break out a harmonica, and play a sweet blues rift? The first step for any strategy is determining goals. You have to <em>define<\/em> conversions before you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/13\/tracking-conversions-in-adwords\"><em>track <\/em><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/02\/13\/tracking-conversions-in-adwords\">conversions<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Who is my audience?<\/strong> Not just your general <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/target-market-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">target market<\/a>, but who is the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/11\/target-audience\">target audience<\/a> you&#8217;re reaching with this specific campaign? Loyal customers will require different messaging than newsletter subscribers or cold audiences. The better you understand your audience, the better your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/02\/landing-page-copywriting\">landing page copy<\/a> can resonate with them.<\/li>\n<li><strong>How are they getting to my landing page? <\/strong>A person arriving at your landing page from a Google ad will be in a different mindset than someone arriving from an email, or from social, or from a banner ad. Keep this in mind when coming up with the creative and messaging.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Who am I competing against?<\/strong> Really, this is three questions: Who am I competing against, how are they succeeding, and how can I copy their success? Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so if your competitors are doing something that works, you should go ahead and do likewise. They\u2019ll (probably) thank you for it.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><a id=\"how-to-write-a-landing-page\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How to write landing pages that convert<\/h2>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve answered the fundamental pre-landing page questions, it\u2019s time to write your awesome, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/04\/08\/persuasive-landing-pages\">persuasive landing pages<\/a>. Landing pages should have a snappy headline, scannable body copy, a clear call to action, and a strategic thank-you page. Here&#8217;s how to write them:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Start with an appealing offer<\/h3>\n<p>Your product or service, of course, is your highest value offer. But you&#8217;re looking to capture leads, you need to make sure you have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/06\/15\/lead-magnet-ideas\">lead magnet<\/a>: something your audience feels is worth giving up their contact information for. This could be a high-quality guide, informative webinar, or even a discount on their first order.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Create a strong headline<\/h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/06\/20\/landing-page-headline-formulas\">strong landing headline<\/a> takes different forms, depending on the landing page, the offer, and the CTA that preceded it. In some cases, it&#8217;s the same as the ad headline so as to make the experience as seamless as possible and ensure message match. This is especially important for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/quality-score\">Quality Score<\/a> in Google Ads.<\/p>\n<p>In other cases, it&#8217;s something more creative or evocative to capture attention and express your brand voice. These <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/03\/emotional-marketing-copy\">emotional words and phrases<\/a> can help you out with that.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless, your headline needs to answer the one question your users have: What&#8217;s in it for me?\u00a0 When in doubt, a benefit-focused headline is a good first step. You can always A\/B test and iterate.<\/p>\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/how-to-write-a-landing-page-mockup-example.png\" alt=\"optimized landing page diagram mockup\" width=\"536\" height=\"849\" class=\"wp-image-63880 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/how-to-write-a-landing-page-mockup-example.png 536w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/how-to-write-a-landing-page-mockup-example-480x760.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 536px, 100vw\" \/><\/h3>\n<h3>3. Write concise and engaging copy<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/06\/how-to-write-copy-that-sells\">Copy that sells<\/a> is clear, concise, credible, and compelling.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Clear<\/strong> copy means it uses plain, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/05\/conversational-tone\">conversational language<\/a> that your customers use. It should be easy to read and organized with a proper <strong>information hierarchy<\/strong>. You have about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.interactivemarketinginc.com\/landing-pages.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eight seconds to convince users<\/a> to stay on your page, so it\u2019s absolutely vital that visitors can capture the essence of your offer with a quick glance.<\/li>\n<li><strong> Concise<\/strong> means it gets to the point quickly. It provides the essential information to inform and interest your audience and nothing more. You can always add more information at the bottom in the form of accordion-style FAQs.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Credible <\/strong>copy\u00a0uses facts rather than opinions and contains trust signals, which we&#8217;ll get to in a bit.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Compelling<\/strong> copy means it has the right mix of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/21\/features-vs-benefits\">features and benefits<\/a> but also uses <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/22\/power-words\">powerful words<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>4. Add a form<\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re creating a lead-generation landing page, you&#8217;ll need to add a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/10\/22\/lead-capture-form\">lead capture form<\/a>. Your form should capture enough information so that you can follow up in a customized manner, but not so much information that it takes extra time or thought to fill out. A good rule of thumb is to have seven fields or less. Name and email are a safe bet. Ask for a phone number only if it&#8217;s necessary. Then you may need to get additional details to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/10\/25\/lead-qualification\">qualify or score your leads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Follow up with a thank you page<\/h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/11\/23\/thank-you-page-examples\">thank you page<\/a> is essential. For one, it confirms for the visitor that they have completed all necessary steps. It also contains the instructions for obtaining the offer, such as checking your inbox or even clicking on a button right on that page to download the piece of media. And finally, you can use your thank you pages to introduce visitors to other resources or even a lower-funnel offer.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/gated-content-thank-you-page-example-wrike.png\" alt=\"example of a thank you page from write after requesting gated content\" width=\"720\" height=\"438\" class=\"wp-image-63770 size-full aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/gated-content-thank-you-page-example-wrike.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/gated-content-thank-you-page-example-wrike-480x292.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\n<a id=\"landing-page-optimization\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How to optimize your landing pages for conversion<\/h2>\n<p>Follow the above steps, and you&#8217;ll have a good landing page.

One goal, one CTA<\/h3>\n<p>Generally speaking, each landing page should have one goal and one CTA. Additional links on the page\u2014like navigation links, footer links, or social share buttons\u2014all serve as secondary CTAs that reduce the chances of the user taking the action you want them to take. Remove these or keep them to a minimum.<\/p>\n<p>If your landing page is long, you can have multiple CTAs placed throughout that all point to the same form or destination, as with the example below. Also notice how the main navigation is removed from the page, giving the user just one option.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/how-to-write-a-landing-page-cta-example.png\" alt=\"how to write a landing page - example of a landing page with one conversion goal\" width=\"453\" height=\"912\" class=\"wp-image-63860 aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span><div class='et-box et-shadow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'><strong>\ud83d\udce3 Free guide<\/strong> &gt;&gt; <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSLIQContentDLWebsite36CallToActionPhrases.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_36CallToActionPhrases_Download\" class=\"waffle-rich-text-link\">The 36 Best Call to Action Phrases (Ever)<\/a><\/strong><span><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/div><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>2. Keep it clean and organized<\/h3>\n<p>As mentioned above, the information on your landing page should be prioritized so that the most important elements are visible above the fold (or before the user has to scroll), like the CTA, key benefit(s), and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/27\/value-proposition-examples\">value proposition<\/a>. The rest of the information should be presented in an organized, skimmable manner, with plenty of visual elements to balance it out (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/31\/f-z-patterns-landing-page-design\">F and Z patterns<\/a> are your friend). If you&#8217;re optimizing for SEO, consider using tab, drop-down, or accordion-style functionality to include additional copy without cluttering up the page.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Use trust signals<\/h3>\n<p>These are crucial for landing page conversion, and there are lots of different types.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Customer quotes:<\/strong> Pull quotes from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/03\/testimonial-advertising\">testimonials<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/04\/03\/how-to-write-a-case-study\">case studies<\/a>, or include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/16\/how-to-ask-for-reviews\">customer reviews<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Influencer endorsements:<\/strong> If confidentiality is not an issue, include logos of well-known brands who use your product or service, or quotes from influencers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Data: <\/strong>There are lots of options here, like \u201cover X five-star Google reviews,\u201d \u201ctrusted by X customers,\u201d or \u201cover x leads generated\/money saved.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Awards and recognition: <\/strong>Do you have any partnership or certification badges? Any form of recognition or award from a third party helps build trust, including just being featured in a publication or being a finalist, even if you didn\u2019t win.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/landing-page-example-loomly-trust-signals.png\" alt=\"example of landing page with trust signals by loomly\" width=\"720\" height=\"429\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63831 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/landing-page-example-loomly-trust-signals.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/landing-page-example-loomly-trust-signals-480x286.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>4. QA your landing pages<\/h3>\n<p>Before you make your landing page live, go through the process as if you\u2019re a user. Read the page in full, fill out the form, and make sure the correct thank you page loads and the offer is delivered. If you have tracking set up, make sure the information makes its way into your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/09\/crm-for-small-business\">CRM<\/a> or database. Repeat this process on mobile devices.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Optimize for mobile<\/h3>\n<p>Speaking of which, make sure your landing pages look and function just as well on desktop as they do on mobile. You may need to make adjustments on the back end of the page so that things appear differently on mobile.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Run A\/B tests<\/h3>\n<p>There are several components to a landing page that influence your users&#8217; behaviors. The headline, the image used, the button colors, even the button copy all have an impact. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/07\/landing-page-test-ideas\">Test your landing pages<\/a> regularly to find out what works and what doesn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<h2>Examples of great landing pages<\/h2>\n<p>Ready to see all of the tips above put into practice? We\u2019ve got some of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/08\/landing-page-examples\">best landing page examples<\/a> to better illustrate what makes a successful landing page that drives conversions.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Free trial landing page example &#8211; CallRail<\/h3>\n<p>This<a href=\"https:\/\/hey.callrail.com\/call-tracking-software\/\"> landing page example from CallRail<\/a> is what I landed on after clicking one of its LinkedIn ads. Here\u2019s what makes it great:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Clean design:<\/strong> There are only 26 words visible above the fold, six of which are the two CTA buttons (which are for the same offer). The colorful graph design is appealing to the eye and the blue buttons stand out against the black.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Compelling headline:<\/strong> \u201cKnow what makes your phone ring and smartly route inbound calls\u201d gives me a clear idea of what CallRail does and how it can benefit me.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/saas-landing-page-example-callrail.png\" alt=\"great landing page example by callrail\" width=\"720\" height=\"367\" class=\"wp-image-63840 size-full aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/saas-landing-page-example-callrail.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/saas-landing-page-example-callrail-480x245.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Scroll down and we see:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trust badges:<\/strong> Trusted by more than 180,000 businesses, with three badges.

Note that Loomly refers to itself as a brand management platform, so this is a great example of tailoring its messaging.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Clean design:<\/strong> Like CallRail, this landing page has just one action, to start a free trial, with multiple buttons that all lead to the free trial signup form.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Video:<\/strong> An embedded <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/03\/13\/explainer-videos\">explainer video<\/a> on the page is used to outline the features and benefits. Studies have shown that adding video to landing pages can increase conversions by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/02\/conversion-rate-statistics\">86%<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Trust badges:<\/strong> Testimonial quotes from customers, plus badges for awards from G2, Capterra, and Source Forge<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/saas-landing-page-example-loomly-video.png\" alt=\"example of a landing page with video by loomly\" width=\"720\" height=\"361\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63829 aligncenter\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/saas-landing-page-example-loomly-video.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/saas-landing-page-example-loomly-video-480x241.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3.
