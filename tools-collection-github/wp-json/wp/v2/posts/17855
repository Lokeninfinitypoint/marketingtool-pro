This is a dynamic ad format that allows you to serve proximity-based ad creative to searchers in a dynamic fashion (meaning you don\u2019t need to create a dozen separate ads).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"069175a6-e8dc-44f9-a75b-69ee5ac084e9\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-ads-storve-visits-creative-template.png\" alt=\"facebook ads drive store visits campaign goal\" width=\"800\" height=\"364\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Fancy, huh?<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, for those of you operating from a single location (which will be my focus today), you\u2019ll need to get creative. Facebook doesn\u2019t currently allow you to use \u201cStore Visits\u201d as a marketing objective. You can, however, combine <strong>reach or brand awareness campaigns<\/strong> with <strong>hyper-specific location targeting<\/strong> and <strong>carousel ads <\/strong>to simultaneously attract local prospects and point them in the direction of your store.<\/p>\n<p>The variance in campaign objectives above is pretty straightforward. Brand awareness campaigns are all about serving your ads multiple times to the same people, which can be useful for advertisers with granular audiences. Reach campaigns, on the other hand, are a pure volume play, a wide net. Like straight up broad match keywords. Provided you nail down your location targeting, choosing \u201cReach\u201d as your campaign objective will allow you to serve your ads to the maximum number of people within a concentrated area around your store.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"8c246191-2a2f-4d81-b9cc-5367287896c8\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facebook-proximity-based-ad-copy.png\" alt=\"facebook ads proximity-based ad copy\" width=\"800\" height=\"333\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>To do this, create a new Facebook ad campaign using guided creation.

You cleaned up in December!<\/p>\n<p>Now what?<\/p>\n<p>My friend, it\u2019s time to cross-sell your customers.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re unfamiliar with the practice, cross-selling refers to the process of pitching complementary items to a prospect or customer.

You know, ergonomic hilts, razor blades, shaving creams, badger hair brushes, and overpriced beard oil infused with essence of dollars past. If someone bought a razor (the most expensive item you sell), there are multiple angles from which you can approach a cross-sale; better still is the fact that these cross sales are recurring because the nature of your business is such that your customers constantly need replacements for your consumables.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"a8b7ea0e-2d83-4a05-9fec-6f5573d0ee94\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sale-vs-cross-sale-razor-example.png\" alt=\"sales vs cross-sales with facebook ads\" width=\"557\" height=\"487\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The key to cross-selling products with Facebook ads is custom audiences.

That\u2019s a topic for another day.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re going to start by creating custom audiences using the email addresses of people who bought your razors.
