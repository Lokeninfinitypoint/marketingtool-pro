Sure, clicks and impressions are nice, but conversions are much, much better. And that can be a challenge to accurately measure.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to improve the accuracy of your conversion measurement for Google Ads, Google&#8217;s enhanced conversions feature can help.<\/p>\n<p>In this post, we&#8217;ll dive into:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What Google Ads enhanced conversions are<\/li>\n<li>How enhanced conversions work<\/li>\n<li>Why they&#8217;ve become a necessary addition to conversion tracking<\/li>\n<li>Exactly how to set up enhanced conversions using Google Tag Manager (with a video tutorial!)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get started.<\/p>\n<h2>What are enhanced conversions in Google Ads?<\/h2>\n<p>To help advertisers more accurately measure their conversions within Google Ads, Google released enhanced conversions. Enhanced conversions is a feature that improves the accuracy of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/08\/30\/google-ads-conversion-tracking\">conversion tracking<\/a> by supplementing existing conversion tags with hashed first-party customer data from websites.<\/p>\n<p>Enhanced conversions help you see the actions a user takes after clicking on your ad.

This ensures that the data remains private and secure while being transmitted.<\/p>\n<p>Once the hashed data is sent to Google, it is matched with signed-in Google accounts to attribute the campaign conversions to ad events such as clicks or views. This process ensures that advertisers can accurately track conversions while maintaining user privacy.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/digital-marketing-trends-2023-enhanced-conversions.png\" alt=\"2023 digital marketing trends - privacy-friendly tracking\" width=\"720\" height=\"449\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-69698\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/digital-marketing-trends-2023-enhanced-conversions.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/digital-marketing-trends-2023-enhanced-conversions-480x299.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In addition to providing enhanced conversion tracking, this feature also allows advertisers to use the hashed data to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/09\/21\/google-ads-audience-targeting-cheat-sheet\">create custom audiences for advertising<\/a>. By creating custom audiences based on hashed customer data, advertisers can deliver more relevant ads to their customers while still maintaining their privacy.<\/p>\n<h2>Why is the enhanced conversions feature necessary?<\/h2>\n<p>In recent years, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/11\/22\/customer-data-privacy\">data privacy<\/a> has become a significant concern for both users and companies alike. The implementation of data privacy laws such as GDPR and CCPA, along with updates to web browsers such as Safari&#8217;s ITP and Firefox&#8217;s ETP, has made tracking user data more difficult for advertisers and marketers.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, features like Google&#8217;s enhanced conversions have become essential for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/02\/08\/google-ads-conversion-tracking-mistakes\">ensuring accurate conversion tracking<\/a> while also protecting user privacy.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s dive into a brief history of enhanced conversions and how it fits into the landscape of data privacy regulations and updates to web browsers.<\/p>\n<h3>GDPR<\/h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/14\/adwords-gdpr\">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)<\/a> and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) are two significant data privacy laws that have been implemented in recent years.<\/p>\n<p>GDPR was introduced by the European Union (EU) in May 2018. The regulation was designed to give EU citizens more control over their personal data and how it is used by companies. GDPR applies to all companies that process the personal data of EU citizens, regardless of where the company is located.<\/p>\n<p>The regulation requires companies to obtain explicit consent from users before collecting and processing their personal data, and to allow users to access, delete, or modify their data at any time. GDPR also imposes significant fines on companies that fail to comply with the regulation.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cookie-consent-banner-examples-moovly.png\" alt=\"cookie consent banner examples - moovly uses cookies\" width=\"576\" height=\"461\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-70580\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cookie-consent-banner-examples-moovly.png 576w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cookie-consent-banner-examples-moovly-480x384.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 576px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>CCPA<\/h3>\n<p>CCPA was introduced by the state of California in January 2020. The act was designed to give Californians more control over their personal data and how it is used by companies. CCPA applies to all companies that do business in California and meet certain criteria related to revenue and data processing.<\/p>\n<p>The act requires companies to disclose the types of personal data they collect, allow users to opt out of the sale of their data, and to delete user data upon request. CCPA also imposes significant fines on companies that fail to comply with the act.<\/p>\n<p>Both GDPR and CCPA have had a significant impact on how companies collect and process user data. They have led to increased transparency and control for users over their personal data, but have also made it more challenging for companies to track user data accurately.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, features like <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/9614122?hl=en\">Google&#8217;s enhanced conversions<\/a> have become more important for ensuring accurate conversion tracking while also protecting user privacy, and operating using restricted data processing.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/gdpr-ccpa-compared.png\" alt=\"gdpr vs ccpa privacy acts\" width=\"720\" height=\"530\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-70567\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/gdpr-ccpa-compared.png 720w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/gdpr-ccpa-compared-480x353.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 720px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/rockcontent.com\/blog\/ccpa-vs-gdpr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Image source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Safari ITP<\/h3>\n<p>Safari&#8217;s Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) and Firefox&#8217;s Enhanced Tracking Protection (ETP) are two browser updates that have made tracking user data more difficult for advertisers and marketers.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/active-directory\/develop\/reference-third-party-cookies-spas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ITP in Safari<\/a> was first introduced in 2017 with the release of Safari 11.0.
