Story ads represented an alternative to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/20\/instagram-advertising\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">News Feed<\/a> ads\u2014which, though still effective, had lost a bit of novelty.

Advertisers suddenly had access to a super immersive format\u2014the same format future <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/22\/instagram-tv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram TV<\/a> advertisers can expect, when that platform is ultimately monetized:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/simple_image\/public\/images\/media\/images\/instagram-story-ads_0.gif?enrfpK0hmKySAxOWf4ukn85ScWdzmvOL&amp;itok=l3bymx2H\">Full-screen<\/a>. Vertical. Immersive. <a href=\"https:\/\/business.instagram.com\/a\/stories-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">400 million Instagram accounts<\/a>\u2014businesses and everyday consumers alike\u2014leverage Stories to keep their followers apprised of their goings-on. Story ads give advertisers coveted access to that audience pool. The results, which we\u2019ll get into, have been encouraging. They also bode well for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/08\/01\/facebook-stories-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook Story ads<\/a>, which are set to drop imminently.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Today, we\u2019re going to give you the full skinny\u2014how Instagram Stories work, how to set them up, and how to leverage them in conjunction with your existing News Feed ads to increase return on ad spend.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What are Instagram Story Ads?<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Instagram Story Ads exist within <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/26\/instagram-stories-shopping\">Instagram Stories<\/a>, which exist atop your News Feed. Naturally, Instagram Stories themselves are also full-screen and vertical\u2014so when you watch them, all you see on your mobile device is the content itself. When one Story ends\u2014by way of it simply ending or you manually swiping through\u2014the next one begins. In this way, once you are in the format, it super easy to access a continuous stream of full-screen content.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Story ads exist as dividers between Stories themselves\u2014but, like News Feed ads, it\u2019s difficult to tell them apart from the rest of the organic content within the format:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"bd509cf3-0a35-44b6-9406-884cbc209545\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-story-ads-example-1.png\" alt=\"Instagram Story Ads Example\" width=\"475\" height=\"416\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Aside from the \u201cSponsored\u201d denotation, and, presumably, an increase in production value, they look just like organic posts. As you\u2019ll also notice in the above image, Story ads give you the ability to link within your post\u2014which, in the world of organic posts, is a function reserved for accounts that are either verified or have more 10,000 followers.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To access your post link, users need merely swipe up on your CTA arrow, at which point they\u2019ll be taken to your landing page. If this is functionality you\u2019re interested in\u2014if you want to send prospects to your product page, to your blog, or to a lead form\u2014you were at one time limited to the four of the six marketing objectives for which Story ads were available. There are now <strong>seven<\/strong> objectives for which Instagram Story ads are available (Brand Awareness was added recently), and you can add CTA links to any of them:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Brand Awareness<\/strong>: Increase awareness for your brand by finding people more likely to be interested in it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reach<\/strong>: Show your ad to the maximum number of people.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Video views<\/strong>: Get more people to view your video content.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Conversions<\/strong>: Drive valuable actions on your app or website.<\/li>\n<li><strong>App installs<\/strong>: Get more people to install your app.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lead Generation<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/11\/15\/selling-on-instagram\">Drive sales<\/a> leads like email addresses and phone numbers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Traffic<\/strong>: Send more people to your website.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can create Instagram Story ads in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/news\/creative-hub-product-announcement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Creative Hub<\/a> or Ads Manager. Let\u2019s run through the creation process in Ads Manager.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How to Make an Instagram Story Ad<\/h2>\n<p>In a new or existing campaign, select your marketing objective. Name your ad set, then\u2014just as if you were <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/09\/26\/how-to-create-facebook-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">creating a Facebook ad<\/a>\u2014refine your audience, targeting, and budgeting. You\u2019ll then want to toggle out of Automatic Placements, click Edit Placements, and select Instagram Stories:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"8291328e-6a71-49ba-b26c-45f19836d7b7\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-story-ads-placements1.png\" alt=\"Instagram Story Ads Placement\" width=\"1052\" height=\"609\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Note: You can run Instagram Story ads in conjunction with other placements\u2014but because of the unique nature of Story ad creative, you\u2019ll have to make some granular adjustments when you actually create your ad. If you\u2019re running a single image ad, for instance, you might need to upload separate images for Facebook News Feed and Instagram Stories. The good news: Facebook will tell you if that\u2019s the case:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4ed1052d-be4e-4e6b-abad-b84cc0f86c87\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/instagram-story-ads-placements.png\" alt=\"Instagram Story Ads Creation\" width=\"943\" height=\"446\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That said, your goal should not be to find a few very close iterations of the same ad to run on multiple placements. Given the unique potential of Story ads\u2014this a new format with new creative parameters\u2014you should really devote the time to breaking it out into its own ad set.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We\u2019ll talk a little bit about the kind of creative that succeeds in this format in a jif. For now, here are some basic sizing and spec requirements to make sure you adhere to:<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Instagram Story Ads Sizes and Specs<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You have three sizing formats to choose from when creating your story ad: Square (1:1), Landscape (1.91:1), and Vertical (4:5). Recommended resolution is 1080 x 1920 pixels, but you can go as low as 600 x 1067 if you have to. Note that our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/26\/instagram-story-templates\">Instagram Story templates<\/a> are sized to meet these requirements..<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other specs to be aware of:<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Image Creative<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>File type: .jpg or .png<\/li>\n<li>File size: 30MB max<\/li>\n<li>Length: Images show for 5 seconds by default<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Video Creative<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>File type: .mp4 or .mov<\/li>\n<li>File size: 4GB max<\/li>\n<li>Length: Up to 15 seconds<\/li>\n<li>Supported codecs: H.264, VP8<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Meet these basic requirements, and you\u2019ve got yourself a functional Story ad. Now, you can get a little creative.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How to Prevent Swipe-Through<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Advertisers new to Story ads will encounter a familiar question: How can I create an ad that\u2019s not intrusive, but still stops the proverbial thumb? As stated earlier, there\u2019s not much difference between an organic post and a paid post\u2014whether you\u2019re scrolling through Stories or News Feed. In both formats, advertisers face the challenge of standing out from the crowd while not representing a complete departure from the content users go to the platform to consume\u2014content which, in most cases, comes from friends, families, and brands they already know and trust.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That said, here are some tips for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/12\/04\/instagram-story-hacks\">creating a great Instagram Story<\/a>\u00a0ad\u00a0prospects will actually watch.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Use a Custom or Lookalike Audience<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The best way to avoid swipe-through from prospects unfamiliar with your brand? Don\u2019t do it! Use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/23\/facebook-custom-audience-changes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook Custom Audiences<\/a> to remarket to prospects that are familiar with your brand. Using Custom Audiences, you can target Instagram users based on the five following segments:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Customer File<\/strong>: Email addresses, phone numbers, or any other information you\u2019ve acquire in lead generation.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Website Traffic<\/strong>: People who have visited your website, blog, or a specific landing page.<\/li>\n<li><strong>App Activity<\/strong>: People who have interacted with your app.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Offline Activity<\/strong>: People who have interacted with your business, either in-store or by phone.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Engagement<\/strong>: People who have engaged with your content on Facebook or Instagram.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An example: Michael Kors used the Carousel ad type (more on these in a second) to <a href=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/simple_image\/public\/images\/media\/images\/instagram-story-ads-michael-kors_0.gif?Dxu12GDKjef3TLkTyIVvjtB5vXuKFrjJ&amp;itok=y9ICy6-d\">create this ad<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>You can see the visually sleek creative, but what\u2019s important here is the targeting. <a href=\"https:\/\/business.instagram.com\/success\/2-michael-kors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In a campaign<\/a> that yielded 20% higher return on ad spend, Michael Kors served its new Carousel to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/facebook-lookalike-audiences\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lookalike audience<\/a> based on characteristics of its existing customers. That campaign also yielded a 3% high click-through rate. Leveraging custom and lookalike audiences can you achieve similar results by getting your Story ads in front of more qualified eyes.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Try a Carousel<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/21\/facebook-carousel-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Carousel ads<\/a> are great for Facebook, and they are equally well-suited for Instagram Story ad campaigns. One thing to keep in mind\u2014Carousel ads for Instagram Stories <strong>can\u2019t run with any other placement<\/strong>, so they have to be built out in their own campaigns. Not that that should deter you; in a format in which air time is coveted, Carousels offer a distinct competitive advantage. Each Carousel contains up to three panels; and each panel can contain up to 15 seconds of video.<\/p>\n<p>Instagram Stories are <a href=\"https:\/\/wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/s3fs-public\/styles\/simple_image\/public\/images\/media\/images\/instagram-carousel-ads-carousel.gif?jhtZYCKQJYyjvNm3yDOmNaiiIossYWQT&amp;itok=T1c-tQA4\">inherently quick-hitters<\/a>. Carousels give you the opportunity to offer prospects a more in-depth and compelling glimpse into your brand\u2014or, to offer 3 unique, compelling glimpses. That\u2019s invaluable air time.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Like Facebook Carousels, Instagram Story Carousels give you the opportunity to link to a different landing page from each card. They also support metric reporting on a by-card basis\u2014so if you\u2019re curious which cards your prospects are viewing, how long they\u2019re viewing them for, and where they\u2019re sliding up, you can easily access that information within Ads Manager.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Own the First Few Seconds<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Given users\u2019 predilection to rapid-fire swiping (thanks, Tinder) it\u2019s crucial to own the first few seconds of your video. That means hitting a few checkmarks:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Create something with volume<\/strong>. <a href=\"https:\/\/business.instagram.com\/a\/stories-ads\">60% of Stories<\/a> are viewed with the sound on. Hit your prospects with an early hook that represents a welcome departure from soundless boomerangs and brunch pics.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Put your stamp on it<\/strong>. Your brand appears in the form of your account name\/icon at the top left of the ad; but if the user swipes immediately through, they\u2019re not going to bother looking at. Display your brand name\/logo prominently in your creative within the first few seconds of your Story.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Tell prospects what your selling<\/strong>. Even if your brand story requires 45 seconds of a Carousel ad to tell\u2014don\u2019t bother saving your product until the very end. Beats By Dre found that its <a href=\"https:\/\/business.instagram.com\/success\/beats-by-dre\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">product-centric Story ads<\/a>, which conveyed clearer call-to-actions and more compelling product creative, performed better than its lifestyle-centric Stories.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And if you&#8217;re looking for more inspiration, you&#8217;re sure to find something in these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/03\/01\/instagram-story-ideas\">73 cool Instagram Story ideas.<\/a><\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">The Future of Brand Storytelling<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The inception of Instagram TV, the imminent drop of Facebook Story ads, and the rise of Instagram Story Ads tell an interesting, ahem&#8230;story. People are interacting more and more meaningfully with brands on their mobile devices\u2014and they increasingly want to do so in a format that is easy, convenient, mindless, and engrossing.
