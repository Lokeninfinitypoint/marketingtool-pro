Many people didn\u2019t even have time to get their office plants or project notes before they had to set up a home office and get to work. Nine months after the shift to remote and 42 percent of the American workforce remains fully remote, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.upwork.com\/press\/releases\/economist-report-future-workforce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Upwork\u2019s Future Workforce<\/a> survey.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/small-business-productivity-tools-remote_0-1.png\" alt=\"Small business productivity tools\u2014chart showing 57% of teams are working remote at least part of the time\" width=\"800\" height=\"439\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The good news is, we adapted and remote work is getting easier as people learn how they can make it successful. The same Upwork survey found that 68 percent of hiring managers agree that work is going more smoothly now than when the pandemic started.<\/p>\n<p>One reason for this is that teams have adopted tools to get work done. But not just any tools, but the right tools needed to make their organization thrive. To make sure you have what you need to make remote work work for you, we\u2019re sharing our top tool choices.<\/p>\n<p>For ease of organization, these tools have been broken down into three separate sections:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Managing distractions while working<\/li>\n<li>Improving project management<\/li>\n<li>Increasing collaboration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Do an audit of your current toolset and determine what needs to go, what can stay, and what you need to add to make sure your team is working efficiently and effectively.<\/p>\n<h2>Productivity tools for managing distractions<\/h2>\n<p>One of the most challenging parts of working from home is managing all the distractions that come with it. No longer are phone notifications and talkative coworkers your only concern. Now you have a pile of dishes in the sink, laundry to be done and a couch that looks awfully comfortable. Use these tools to limit distractions and boost <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/11\/04\/productivity-for-content-marketers\">productivity<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Freedom<\/h3>\n<p>From checking website analytics to cruising social media, it can be hard to meet deadlines when you\u2019re pulled away from your \u201cfocus zone,\u201d every five minutes. With the <a href=\"https:\/\/freedom.to\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Freedom<\/a> app, you can block websites, alerts, and other digital distractions so your attention stays on your current project.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/small-business-productivity-tools-freedom-1.png\" alt=\"small business productivity tools-freedom\" width=\"800\" height=\"459\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This app goes a step above the rest because it blocks sites on multiple devices, so you won\u2019t be able to pick up your phone and scroll to get around the block on your desktop.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure your teammates know that you\u2019re entering a \u201cdistraction-free zone,\u201d so they understand why you aren\u2019t responding to their messages.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Calendly<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/calendly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Calendly<\/a> is a must-have tool for small business owners and marketers because it eliminates the distraction of scheduling <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/01\/03\/brainstorming-techniques\">meetings<\/a> and booking time to work. With this app, you can set up events from your existing calendar and block out times when you\u2019re busy. If someone wants to set a meeting, they can reserve a time in Calendly without having to submit a calendar request via email\u2014or having to go back and forth on a time that works for both of you.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/small-business-productivity-tools-calendly-1.png\" alt=\"Small business productivity tools-calendly\" width=\"800\" height=\"532\" \/><\/div>\n<p>This tool is particularly useful because of its buffers. Users can create buffer times in between meetings, like 10-minute breaks for travel time or stretching and even set up barriers for last-minute meetings. This prevents people from packing your day or adding something to your schedule with only an hour\u2019s notice.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Noisli<\/h3>\n<p>Whether you need to block out distracting sounds, increase your focus or wind down after a stressful period, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.noisli.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Noisli<\/a> can help. This isn\u2019t your average white noise generator, though. You can mix sounds to create the perfect working environment where you can be your most <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/03\/26\/productivity-tools\">productive<\/a> self.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/small-buisness-productivity-tools-noisli-1.png\" alt=\"small business productivity tools noisli\" width=\"800\" height=\"376\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If you work in a busy household with children or roommates, all the hustle and bustle can be distracting. Turn on Noisli to get into your zone of focus quickly and easily.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Pushbullet<\/h3>\n<p>Throughout the day, you likely switch back and forth between devices. From computer to iPad to smartphone; from desktop to smartphone to tablet. If you\u2019re always bouncing around, you\u2019re setting yourself up for a day of distracting transitions that make it harder to get back into the project you\u2019re working on. Wouldn\u2019t things be so much easier, and less distracting, if all your devices were connected as one? That\u2019s exactly why you need <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pushbullet.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pushbullet<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/small-business-productivity-tools-pushbullet-1.png\" alt=\"small business productivity tools pushbullet\" width=\"800\" height=\"434\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You can send text messages from your computer, see your phone\u2019s notification on your tablet, and share links and files instantly without having to email them to yourself. These are just a few of the conveniences Pushbullet provides. For the multi-device worker, this is a must-have tool.<\/p>\n<h3>5. 1Password<\/h3>\n<p>Passwords need to be safe\u2014and to be safe, the need to be different and unique for every account.\u00a0 But it quickly becomes impossible to remember them all, and if you write them down, that\u2019s not safe either. This is especially important when using free wi-fi at a coffee shop or library rather than your secure router at home or in the office.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/small-business-productivity-tools-1password-1.png\" alt=\"Small business productivity tools-1password\" width=\"800\" height=\"378\" \/><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/1password.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1Password<\/a> solves this problem by locking all of your passwords safely away where no one can get to them except you. And when you need to sign into something? All you need to remember is one master password and you\u2019re in.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Sleep Cycle alarm clock<\/h3>\n<p>Have you ever woken up in a mental fog, with a pounding headache, and somehow more exhausted than when you went to bed? This unpleasant trio is often the result of waking in the middle (or the deepest part) of a sleep cycle.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/small-business-productivity-tools-sleep-cycle-alarm-clock-1.png\" alt=\"Small business productivity tools sleep cycle alarm clock\" width=\"800\" height=\"359\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You\u2019re much more likely to awake refreshed if you get enough rest each night and wake during the lightest phase of your natural sleep cycle. But how do you know when you\u2019re in this lightest phase? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sleepcycle.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sleep Cycle<\/a> alarm clock app will analyze your sleep and automatically wake you at the best time. Instead of being distracted by a foggy brain or the temptation to take a nap, you\u2019ll feel refreshed and productive all day.<\/p>\n<h2>The best productivity tools for project management<\/h2>\n<p>Great project management is more important than ever with a distributed team. It\u2019s critical that everyone stays on the same page, making all the necessary deadlines and being able to share updates and data with the entire group often. These project management tools ensure that your team can do just that.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Scoro<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.scoro.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Scoro<\/a> is an all-in-one business management software. Its aim is to streamline workflows, taking routine tasks off your hands so that you have more time to focus on what\u2019s important\u2014<a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/04\/19\/customer-marketing-strategies\">pleasing your customers<\/a>. With Scoro, you can easily track time and manage your team, as well as create and send invoices.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/small-business-productivity-tools-scoro-1.png\" alt=\"Small business productivity tools-scoro\" width=\"800\" height=\"457\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The team dashboard is one of the most helpful features. It includes everything you need to check in on projects at a glance, including <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/10\/07\/agency-profitability-metrics\">profit<\/a>, budget updates, project steps, and more. With all of this information available to the entire team in real-time, it\u2019s easier to stay on track and, more importantly, on budget.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Cyfe by Traject<\/h3>\n<p>You likely use a variety of tools, platforms, and services to manage your <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/19\/social-media-for-small-business\">social media marketing<\/a>, analytics, sales, support, and so on. Instead of managing each one independently, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cyfe.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cyfe<\/a> allows your marketing team to manage it all together, in one place. Integrations include Freshbooks, Alexa, Basecamp, Instagram, and more.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/small-business-productivity-tools-cyfe-1.png\" alt=\"Small business productivity tools-cyfe\" width=\"800\" height=\"457\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Data from those tools is pulled into Cyfe in real-time, allowing you to check-in and <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/12\/17\/content-marketing-kpis\">get a clear picture of what\u2019s happening<\/a> at any moment\u2014no matter where you are and what tools each team member has individual access to. When used in conjunction with historical data for your small business, you can make informed decisions more easily while ensuring the security of your various marketing accounts.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Betterteam<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/30\/remote-startup-management\">Hiring<\/a> can be a time-consuming, exhausting process. It takes a lot of time and effort to post jobs on several sites, weed out candidates that aren\u2019t qualified, and conduct interviews. Simplifying even one part of that process would be a major relief for everyone involved.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/small-business-productivity-tools-betterteam-1.png\" alt=\"Small business productivity tools betterteam\" width=\"800\" height=\"457\" \/><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.betterteam.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Betterteam<\/a> streamlines the first stage of this process: posting open positions. In just minutes, you can post your jobs to 100+ popular job sites, likely much more than you could do manually. Not only will you save tons of time, but you also get far more exposure and access to thousands of qualified people. The value of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/16\/working-remotely\">working remotely<\/a> is being able to cast a wider net\u2014so make sure you\u2019re casting it.<\/p>\n<h3>10.

Filestage<\/h3>\n<p>If projects often get caught up in the editing and approval process, with too many team leaders offering feedback and creating countless new drafts, it\u2019s time for a new workflow. <a href=\"https:\/\/filestage.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Filestage<\/a> is a much-needed tool for teams that often collaborate in this way. It\u2019s an all-in-one proofing software where creatives can submit their work and management can make comments and edit requests in one space.

Don\u2019t let this key element of your business fall to the wayside with remote work. Instead, keep collaboration fresh and easy with these key tools.<\/p>\n<h3>12. Connecteam<\/h3>\n<p>As your remote team grows, your employees might not have time to get to know their new peers or connect with coworkers in the same way they used to socially. This is where <a href=\"https:\/\/connecteam.com\/employee-communication-app\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Connecteam<\/a> comes in. This app serves as an employee intranet helping your workers connect with each other for improved collaboration.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/small-business-productivity-tools-connecteam_0-1.png\" alt=\"Small business productivity tools connecteam\" width=\"800\" height=\"448\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Employees can look up other team members in the organization to collaborate, managers can push messages to the whole staff, and everyone can take surveys and polls to get an idea for what the company hivemind is thinking.

Hubgets<\/h3>\n<p>In August 2020, the team at <a href=\"https:\/\/frontapp.com\/blog\/what-we-learned-from-analyzing-5000-email-inboxes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Frontpage<\/a> released a survey that found our professional inboxes are more cluttered than our personal accounts. In fact, roughly 10 percent of people receive more than 100 emails per day, totaling one email every six minutes during business hours. Without clear organization, these messages get lost or jumbled easily, slowing down projects for people who need replies.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/small-business-productivity-tools-hubgets_0-1.png\" alt=\"Small business productivity tools hubgets\" width=\"800\" height=\"415\" \/><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubgets.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hubgets<\/a> works to break through the email dependency with clear project management tools and improved collaboration features.

No more scrolling through endless texts or searching vague email terms to find a missing thread. Your communication trail is all in one place.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/small-business-productivity-tools-nextiva-1.png\" alt=\"Small business productivity tools nextiva\" width=\"800\" height=\"397\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Nextiva can be a lifesaver for remote teams that use multiple communication channels to collaborate, no matter which platforms you prefer.<\/p>\n<h3>15. Kayako<\/h3>\n<p>What\u2019s one of the best ways to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2016\/11\/10\/customer-loyalty\">build customer loyalty<\/a>? Providing timely and personalized support. Support ticketing tool, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kayako.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kayako<\/a>, can help you do this, even providing a human live chat experience when you\u2019re not online.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/small-business-productivity-tools-kayako_0-1.png\" alt=\"Small business productivity tools kayako\" width=\"800\" height=\"387\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Unlike other similar tools, Kayako unifies all of your support channels including email, social media, and live chat into one team dashboard.

Workflowy<\/h3>\n<p>Leave behind the sticky notes, notepads, and scraps of paper. Instead, keep all your shared to-do lists in <a href=\"https:\/\/workflowy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Workflowy<\/a>, where everyone on the team can compile and check off tasks in one place. If you\u2019re worried that this would make for a long, messy list, think again.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/small-business-productivity-tools-workflowy-1.png\" alt=\"Small business productivity tools workflowy\" width=\"800\" height=\"430\" \/><\/div>\n<p>A few select formatting options make it easy to differentiate lists of different topics so they can be found at a glance. The same can be said of the #tags feature, which makes organizing and collaborating on lists with other team members easy and organized. While it is a minimalistic app, it\u2019s one of the most powerful apps you could have in your collaboration arsenal.<\/p>\n<h3>17. Traackr<\/h3>\n<p>If you use <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/26\/influencer-marketing\">influencers for your marketing,<\/a> it\u2019s imperative that everyone on the marketing team has access to data about which ones are driving the best campaigns and which ones are falling short. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.traackr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Traackr<\/a> makes it possible for everyone to follow this data and shoulder the task of managing influencers. It also makes it easier for managers to check in at any time and keep tabs on who is performing.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/small-business-productivity-tools-traackr-1.png\" alt=\"Small business productivity tools traackr\" width=\"800\" height=\"354\" \/><\/div>\n<p>You can also use this tool to <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2013\/06\/21\/social-media-influence\">find the best influencers<\/a> and compare what they can offer to budget, results, and benchmarks that help you make the right decisions as a team.<\/p>\n<h2>Find the right productivity tools for your team<\/h2>\n<p>The right tools are the ones that solve key problems and that your team will actually use. If you, as a leader, try to introduce unnecessary or unpopular tools, you risk disrupting workflows that already work and driving down productivity. Focus on finding tools you know your team needs and introduce them over time, allowing everyone the opportunity to integrate and provide feedback. With everyone working productively and collaboratively, you can focus on doing what you need to do: running the team and meeting deadlines.
