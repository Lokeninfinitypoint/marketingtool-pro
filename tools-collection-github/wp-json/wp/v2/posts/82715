Like almost everything else\u2014advertising costs have gone up for businesses, and that is largely contributing to the changes in CPC trends we\u2019re seeing,\u201d said Goran Mirkovic, CMO at <a href=\"https:\/\/freemius.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Freemius<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cChanges in industry-specific demand (like real estate), competition levels, unique advertising tactics, and consumer behavior could also be impacting these trends. As users interact with search results and ads in new ways, it\u2019s only natural to expect that these changes will have a visible impact in both CTR and CPC rates,\u201d said Goran.<\/p>\n<p>However, there are still optimizations you can make to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/08\/17\/lower-cost-per-click\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lower your cost per click<\/a>. For example, tightly aligning your landing pages with your keyword intent can increase your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/19\/does-quality-score-still-matter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quality Score<\/a>, which in turn can lower your cost per click.<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-average-conversion-rate\"><\/div>\n<h3>Average conversion rate in search ads<\/h3>\n<p>Conversion rate is one of the most important <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/09\/20\/ppc-metrics-ultimate-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PPC metrics<\/a> to advertisers because it accounts for how many ad clicks turn into real sales or leads.<\/p>\n<p>It can be tricky to balance trying to achieve a high conversion rate while lowering costs.

While rising click-through rates suggest a more receptive environment for ads, the cost of clicks increasing, as well as shifts in conversion rates and cost per lead, demonstrate significant variation across industries,\u201d said Katia Hausman, Vice President of<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/products\/search-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Ad Products at LocaliQ<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Keeping in mind that there are some fluctuations and variations when it comes to cost per lead metrics, you may want to see how you can optimize all your campaigns across platforms to bring down your overall cost averages. For example, how you\u2019re attracting and tracking conversions will directly impact your cost per lead numbers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis data is actually very surprising\u2014the gains in click-through rate seem to indicate that folks are getting less valuable traffic. Advertisers are doing a great job creating ads to get the user to click, but they may not be able to track the conversions, so cost per lead goes up,\u201d said Navah Hopkins, PPC Evangelist at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.optmyzr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Optmyzr<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Navah added that there might also be \u201cfalse positives\u201d within an advertiser\u2019s conversion tracking. This could lead to more low-value actions (such as button clicks) being counted as conversions\u2014skewing conversion numbers to appear higher. Automated bidding strategies would then be thrown off and start to overbid on less valuable ads.

Some metrics might thrive while others fluctuate <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If you feel like your search performance is all over the place, you\u2019re not alone. As Google and Microsoft continue to test and change parts of the search journey, results will fluctuate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What to do about it<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You may need to look at other metrics, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/22\/demand-gen-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">return on ad spend (ROAS)<\/a>, to get a clear picture of your search ad progress.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cROAS helps you assess the profitability of your advertising efforts by measuring the revenue generated for every dollar spent on ads. It helps a lot with understanding how well a PPC campaign is doing when it comes to driving revenue,\u201d said Goran.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll also need to prioritize some metrics over others depending on your goals.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Most of our discussions focus on CPL and CVR. There can be all sorts of factors leading to more clicks on ads like the placement, blending into organic results, and bidding strategies optimizing for engagement,&#8221; said Michelle Morgan, Co-Founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.paidmediapros.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Paid Media Pros<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;But the real test of an ad campaign is how much business it actually drives. While we pay attention to all metrics, our bigger efforts are focused on ensuring our campaigns are profitable from a CPL and CVR standpoint.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So, while you may see a decrease in one metric, try to look out for other growth opportunities within your ad accounts.<\/p>\n<p>A typical ad account could still recover from a poor search performance with the right first-party data.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don&#8217;t think these metrics should be taken as a sign of doom and gloom. Rather, they represent the reality of the privacy-first world,\u201d said Navah.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you&#8217;re not able to connect your conversions, and if you&#8217;re not able to spend to meet thresholds for modeling, you&#8217;ll see the vanity metrics go up (like CTR), while conversion rates and CPL flounder.\u201d<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-trends-new-ad-features\"><\/div>\n<h3><strong>5. Additional optimizations to ad assets are making ads more clickable <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Not only are ads being incorporated into new search experiences, they also have the ability to blend in with organic results better than they have in the past\u2014which may be part of the reason for the overall increase in CTR.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What to do about it<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Take advantage of the optimization options available for your search advertising campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLess than a decade ago, when I first made the WordStream <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/22\/demand-gen-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">benchmarks<\/a>, the average CTR was 3.17%<u>,<\/u> and only one industry had a CTR above 6% (I thought that was an outlier at the time). Now the average is twice that! Ambitious advertisers might be able to realistically achieve double-digit CTRs this year with some creative work,\u201d said Mark.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe&#8217;re seeing Google more aggressively add images to their ads with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/07\/21\/google-ads-image-extensions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">image assets<\/a>, Google Business Profile image assets, logo assets, and automating those for new advertisers as well. Not only are the ads becoming more attractive, but Google is also making them look less like ads at the same time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-ads-benchmarks-ads-in-serp.webp\" alt=\"google ads benchmarks - screenshot of ads on serp\" width=\"664\" height=\"432\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82744 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-ads-benchmarks-ads-in-serp.webp 664w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-ads-benchmarks-ads-in-serp-480x312.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 664px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-trends-gemini\"><\/div>\n<h3><strong>6. Google\u2019s Search Generative Experience and Gemini can impact ads<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The evolution of Google Ads isn\u2019t just apparent from the advertiser\u2019s perspective, but from the searcher\u2019s perspective as well. For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/22\/demand-gen-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Gemini<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/22\/demand-gen-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new Search Generative Experience (SGE)<\/a> is changing how search results are curated and viewed.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs SGE became more widely used over the past year and ads have been rolled out in that experience, I think we&#8217;re seeing that Google is still in the early stages of optimizing that experience for advertisers. Some of the top areas that Google has boasted its SGE product, like shopping and home improvement, are some of the industries where advertisers have the steepest drops in CTR,\u201d said Mark.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt&#8217;s likely that as people turned to Gemini in 2023 (formerly Bard), users may have seen new ad impressions from their AI chat companions. But unfortunately, those ads may not have been as great a response to their detailed organic responses and had relatively low CTRs when compared to more traditional searches. This growing SGE trend may be artificially dragging down the CTRs from advertisers in these industries,\u201d said Mark.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What to do about it<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Continue to evolve your ad copy, keyword intent, and landing pages to be more easily pulled into conversation-style search results. Consider what questions your customers may be looking to get answered by Gemini.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe uptick in CTR, likely fueled by Google&#8217;s evolving SERP design, is also something I&#8217;ve seen firsthand. However, the data&#8217;s emphasis on the disconnect between higher CTR and lower conversions is interesting. In my view, it highlights the growing importance of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/22\/demand-gen-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">proper audience targeting<\/a> and intent optimization in Google Ads,\u201d said Alessandro.<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-trends-economic-shifts\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-ads-benchmarks-gemini-screenshot.webp\" alt=\"google ads benchmarks - screenshot of gemini sge\" width=\"805\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-82737 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-ads-benchmarks-gemini-screenshot.webp 805w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-ads-benchmarks-gemini-screenshot-480x358.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 805px, 100vw\" \/><\/div>\n<h3><strong>7. Economic shifts correlate with search ad metric fluctuations in certain industries<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>You might notice that some industries saw more aggressive year over year changes than others. This is no coincidence, as many external economic factors impact certain verticals more than others.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What to do about it<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Take note of your industry\u2019s strengths and weaknesses in the search advertising space. For example, if your industry has slowed during times of economic fluctuation, you may need to rethink how you approach your ads when your customers aren\u2019t ready to buy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think the finance and real estate industries are fascinating in how dramatically you&#8217;re seeing them change,\u201d said Mark.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs it becomes clear that interest rates are likely to stay high for a while and all financial advertisers now have less flexibility in their offers, their ads are becoming less competitive and less attractive from the otherwise bleak news on the SERP. However, at least this industry\u2019s CPC is equally becoming less competitive as these advertisers have less of an edge to outbid each other.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, real estate is seeing similar issues as the financial market, but real estate ads are struggling less.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPrice and mortgage costs may not be call-outs in their ads, but location, features, and new opportunities are much easier to attract clicks on the SERP, so their ads are still performing strong enough to maintain their CTR (and possibly CVR). This justifies for real estate businesses to increase their budgets to remain competitive in an industry that&#8217;s struggling offline,\u201d said Mark.<\/p>\n<div id=\"google-ads-benchmarks-audit\"><\/div>\n<h3><strong>8. Regular PPC audits are more important than ever<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If there is one final takeaway from our 2024 Google Ads industry benchmarks report, it\u2019s that staying on top of your account performance this year is critical as industry averages continue to fluctuate year over year.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What to do about it<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Try scheduling <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/08\/22\/demand-gen-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">regular PPC audits<\/a> to see how your PPC metrics are pacing against the benchmarks in your industry.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBy regularly analyzing and refining keywords, ad copy, targeting, and bidding strategies\u2014businesses can ensure that their ads are reaching the right audience and generating the best possible results.<\/p>\n<p>In marketing and advertising, staying proactive and making data-driven adjustments is what gets rewarded,\u201d said Goran.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Take action on these search advertising benchmarks<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>When it\u2019s time to measure your PPC performance, and you\u2019re not sure where to start, these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/ppc-benchmarks\">benchmarks<\/a> can be a guiding light.
