Even worse, a few could entice Google to penalize your website.<\/p>\n<div id=\"stuffing-keywords\"><\/div>\n<h3>1. Stuffing keywords<\/h3>\n<p>Picture this: you\u2019re looking for a way to keep your patio warm during the cooler months and stumble upon this article about types of firepits.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-firepits.webp\" alt=\"example of keyword stuffing in online content\" width=\"641\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85258\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-firepits.webp 641w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-firepits-480x449.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 641px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This feels like a webpage from 2005, but sadly,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2012\/03\/21\/dangers-of-keyword-stuffing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> keyword stuffing<\/a> like this still exists. Some marketers and content creators still make the<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/seo-mistakes\/\"> SEO mistake<\/a> of believing that the more times a keyword and its variations are jammed into an article, the better their chance of ranking for said keywords.<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t read many articles like this anymore because Google is doing everything possible to push them down the rankings.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/serp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Search engines<\/a> today look for relevant, helpful content above all, and while a post like the above is certainly relevant, it does not rise to the level of providing actual value.<\/p>\n<p>Why? Because the content creator is shooting for traffic first and value second. Remember that concept, as it applies to pretty much every outdated strategy on this list.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd0e <strong>Need help finding the right keywords?<\/strong> Try our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/keywords?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_Keywords_KWTool\">Free Keyword Tool<\/a>!<\/p>\n<div id=\"using-unedited-ai-content\"><\/div>\n<h3>2. Using unedited AI content<\/h3>\n<p>Regardless of your opinion on<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/ai-content-marketing\/\"> AI\u2019s use in marketing<\/a>, it has made<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/ai-prompt-examples\/\"> content creation<\/a> much easier. Why spend hours researching and composing a post about fire pit tables, for example, when you can just tell<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/03\/06\/how-to-use-chatgpt-for-small-business-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> ChatGPT<\/a> to spin you up a quick 750-word post and copy and paste the product onto your blog?<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-chatgpt.webp\" alt=\"example of helpful seo prompt in chatgpt\" width=\"882\" height=\"513\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85259\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-chatgpt.webp 882w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-chatgpt-480x279.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 882px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The right <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/05\/08\/chatgpt-prompts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>prompt on ChatGPT<\/em><\/a><em> can help you brainstorm content ideas.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The reason, if you\u2019ve ever tried this approach, is that the result is pretty bad. AI <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-copywriting-tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content creation tools<\/a> are still not good enough, without significant coaching, to create long-form content that is unique, relevant, useful, and, above all, human.<\/p>\n<p>With enough time and effort, you can coax some of these things out of ChatGPT, but if you\u2019re relying solely on AI to create engaging content, you\u2019re going to come up seriously short. Google\u2019s quality content guidelines (known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2023\/07\/14\/google-e-e-a-t\">E-E-A-T<\/a>) call for content written by credible authors with personal experience in the topic.<\/p>\n<p>By all means, use <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/ai-in-marketing-examples\/\">AI in your marketing<\/a>. It\u2019s crazy good, and it works! But use it for what <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-in-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI is best at<\/a>, like topic ideation, creating frameworks, and sorting out large collections of data. But do not think of it like an author who is going to create compelling content that will rank on search engines.<\/p>\n<div id=\"farming-out-content\"><\/div>\n<h3>3. Farming out content<\/h3>\n<p>Another thing Google\u2019s E-E-A-T guidelines made clear is that, ideally, content from topic experts should take priority in search results (although <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ai-overviews-breaking-search\" rel=\"noopener\">AI Overviews<\/a> muddy that message).<\/p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t mean that if you run a roofing company, you must hire authors with doctorates in roofing systems to create all your content. But, they should at least be credible and knowledgeable about roofing, or have demonstrated knowledge in whatever subtopic they write about.<\/p>\n<p>The problem with farming out content to creators without knowledge of a topic is that it will be created for quantity, not quality\u2014which is something Google warns against. Not to mention, quality control can be extremely difficult if you\u2019re getting a whole bunch of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/09\/how-to-write-a-blog-post\" rel=\"noopener\">blog posts<\/a> produced very quickly and without any expertise included in them.<\/p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t to say you can&#8217;t and shouldn&#8217;t outsource content if that&#8217;s part of your strategy. But you should be choosing authors or businesses with experience in your niche.<\/p>\n<div id=\"creating-pages-for-every-keyword-variation\"><\/div>\n<h3>4. Creating pages for every keyword variation<\/h3>\n<p>In the early days of search engines, Google\u2019s algorithm could not understand complex search queries. If you were looking to do some research on what food to feed your pup, you probably would have just searched \u201cdog food\u201d or \u201cdog food near me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Today? You\u2019re probably searching for something like, \u201cWhat is the best natural dog food for my Alaskan Malamute?\u201d Not only will Google understand what you\u2019re asking, it will actually return a result relevant to that query.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-dog-food.webp\" alt=\"google search results for dog food search\" width=\"901\" height=\"587\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85260\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-dog-food.webp 901w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-dog-food-480x313.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 901px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Google\u2019s algorithm has gotten way better at understanding niche keywords.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>As<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/2024-google-updates\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Google\u2019s algorithm<\/a> has gotten more sophisticated and better at understanding complex queries, the way we search has changed, too. We now expect hyper-relevant results for anything that pops into our brains.<\/p>\n<p>For SEOs and search marketers, creating several pages targeting slight variations of the same keyword is an outdated SEO tactic. You don\u2019t need to create a page for \u201cdog food\u201d and one for \u201cfood for dogs\u201d because the search intent is the same.<\/p>\n<p>Now, if a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/related-keywords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">related keyword<\/a> has high search volume and is returning different results than your base keyword, then target it with its own page. But more often than not, Google is good enough to understand that people who use similar, but not exactly the same, words in a search may actually be searching for the same thing.<\/p>\n<p>How can you tell whether a variant deserves its own page? Google it and see if the results are unique.<\/p>\n<div id=\"using-nongranular-keyword-and-domain-data\"><\/div>\n<h3>5. Using non-granular keyword and domain data<\/h3>\n<p>SEO is such a competitive game nowadays. Gone are the days when you could simply spin up a blog post targeting any old keyword, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/05\/04\/internal-linking\" rel=\"noopener\">throw in a couple of internal links<\/a>, and rank on page one. More businesses and marketers than ever are putting resources into this channel, so without a data-backed strategy, you\u2019ll have a hard time getting traffic from search engines this way.<\/p>\n<p>To compete, you\u2019ll need to get granular in the data. At the very least, this means understanding the monthly search volume and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/09\/12\/keyword-difficulty\" rel=\"noopener\">keyword difficulty<\/a> (aka the \u201ccompetition\u201d) of the keywords you are targeting. You want to target keywords that get some search volume but aren\u2019t so competitive that you\u2019ll never win a place on the results page.<\/p>\n<p>You can go much deeper into your <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/local-keyword-research\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keyword research<\/a> and use an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/best-seo-tools\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO tool<\/a> to find things like the number of backlinks the existing pages have (Google often ranks content with more backlinks higher).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-ahrefs.webp\" alt=\"backlink report from ahrefs\" width=\"873\" height=\"515\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85261\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-ahrefs.webp 873w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-ahrefs-480x283.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 873px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Backlink reports, like this one from Ahrefs, give you more details to help you make smart keyword strategy decisions.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>You can continue digging deeper to see the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/what-is-domain-authority\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">domain authority<\/a> of the pages you\u2019ll compete against and other pieces of data that help you choose the best keyword strategy.<\/p>\n<p>In short, take the steps necessary to go past the broad and into the granular, and you\u2019ll think like a modern SEO.<\/p>\n<div id=\"buying-links\"><\/div>\n<h3>6. Buying links<\/h3>\n<p>This one is a bit complicated. If you\u2019ve ever embarked on a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/link-building\" rel=\"noopener\">link-building campaign<\/a>, you know that link outreach has a relatively low success rate. It\u2019s extremely challenging. Buying guest posts and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/21\/b2b-link-building\" rel=\"noopener\">backlinks<\/a> from a vendor is way easier. And contrary to popular belief, buying backlinks isn\u2019t strictly against Google\u2019s policies, but they say you should tag them as such.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-buying-links.webp\" alt=\"google policy on buying links\" width=\"821\" height=\"337\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85262\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-buying-links.webp 821w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-buying-links-480x197.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 821px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/docs\/essentials\/spam-policies#:~:text=Google%20does%20understand%20that%20buying,to%20the%20tag.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Google\u2019s policy<\/em><\/a><em> on buying and selling links.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In general, though, we don\u2019t suggest buying links because it\u2019s difficult to discern the link\u2019s credibility. Instead, we recommend building links organically by creating linkable content and promoting it to potential linking websites.<\/p>\n<p>No matter how you acquire them, don\u2019t chase spammy or non-relevant links purely to increase your page authority and impress Google. For example, don\u2019t push for a link to your healthcare website from a website that sells toilets because it will likely hurt, not help, your ability to rank.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a shortcut to make this distinction. If someone reading a web page would genuinely benefit from clicking a link to your website, then it\u2019s a valid backlink to chase.<\/p>\n<div id=\"spamming-comments-with-links\"><\/div>\n<h3>7. Spamming comments with links<\/h3>\n<p>In the Wild West of early SEO, webmasters often plastered their website\u2019s links in comment sections, forums, and discussion boards to make it look like they had tons of backlinks. Google quickly realized that this wasn\u2019t a good power for marketers to have. The search engine cracked down on this by eliminating these links from consideration when determining <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/01\/12\/domain-authority\" rel=\"noopener\">ranking authority<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Chances are, if you\u2019ve written or read a blog before, you\u2019ve probably seen at least one comment that looks like this:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-canada-goode.webp\" alt=\"example of spammy comment\" width=\"671\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-85263\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-canada-goode.webp 671w, https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Outdated-seo-tactics-localiq-canada-goode-480x429.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 671px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A spammy comment like this is doing this site no favors.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Google has gotten wise to this tactic, so spamming comment sections across the internet with your links will not improve your<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/11\/17\/website-visibility\" rel=\"noopener\"> search visibility<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Now, that doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t comment. Consider the principles we laid out at the start of this post, like quality over quantity. Be useful, helpful, and relevant. Don\u2019t try to manipulate the algorithm. Posting links in comments may not earn you points with Google. Still, if you\u2019re providing value and contributing to the discussion, you can<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2014\/07\/23\/referral-traffic-links\" rel=\"noopener\"> drive referral traffic<\/a> and increase your<a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/brand-awareness-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> brand awareness<\/a>, which can aid in your overall SEO efforts.<\/p>\n<h2>Don\u2019t kill your outdated SEO tactics; adapt them!<\/h2>\n<p>If you made it all the way through this post, you probably noticed a theme. Never shun a tactic merely because it is outdated. Learn from it instead. In telling us what we shouldn\u2019t do, most of these tactics provide an exact roadmap for how we should approach driving visibility and business value through SEO (see how <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/seo-evolution-in-2024\">SEO is evolving<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how you can turn each of these outdated SEO tactics into winning strategies:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stuffing keywords:<\/strong> Use relevant keywords organically.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Using unedited AI content:<\/strong> Use AI to brainstorm or summarize data.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Creating pages for every keyword variation:<\/strong> Create content that addresses related topics with unique search intent.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Using non-granular keyword and domain data:<\/strong> Use keyword tools to find volume and competition data that help you choose the best keywords to target.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Buying links:<\/strong> Look for ways to get relevant links from credible websites.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Spamming comments with links:<\/strong> Engage thoughtfully in comments and discussion boards, adding links only when they aid the conversation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Avoid these outdated SEO tactics to keep your website on Google&#8217;s good
