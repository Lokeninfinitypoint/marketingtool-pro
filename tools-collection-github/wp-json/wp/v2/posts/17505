What happens if you invert your headlines? <em>Do URL paths even matter, bro?!?!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>When it comes to writing ads, these are the questions that haunt paid search aficionados. They\u2019re the crux of ad-centric A\/B testing, and they\u2019ve been notoriously difficult to answer for a whole gang of reasons, from a lack of time to sub-optimal ad rotation settings and then some.<\/p>\n<p>Until now.<\/p>\n<p>Today, I\u2019m going to run you through the nuances of <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adwords\/answer\/7438541?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google\u2019s Ad Variations<\/a>, a feature the search titan rolled out at the end of 2017 to help advertisers test fresh copy at scale. But first\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>The Case for Using Google\u00a0Ads Variations<\/h2>\n<p>Be honest: When was the last time you implemented an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/05\/11\/copywriting-ab-tests\">A\/B test<\/a> in just one ad group? What about across your whole account?<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d wager for most of us, the answer is somewhere between staring shamefully into the spaces between F and G on our keyboards and coming up with some flippant, defensive quip. That\u2019s because generating fresh ad copy takes time and thought.<\/p>\n<p><em>Maybe <\/em>there\u2019s a quarterly review in your three-month plan, but it\u2019s probably not something you\u2019re doing every week. Testing ad copy tends to fall by the wayside because bid adjustments and negative keywords\u2014even new buildouts\u2014are much easier to generate quickly.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-ad-variations-ab-testing.jpg\" alt=\"adwords ad variations a\/b testing\" width=\"600\" height=\"288\" \/><\/div>\n<p>That being said, there\u2019s a ton of untapped value in split-testing your ad creative. Figuring out what ad version incites more clicks (improves CTR) will improve your Quality Scores, which lowers CPCs, which means you can run EVEN MORE ADS. This perpetual testing of <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2018\/02\/08\/customer-feedback-ad-copy\">ad copy<\/a> helps you uncover more effective language to leverage on your landing pages, which can lead to more conversions. In short, testing your Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords)\u00a0ads pays dividends!<\/p>\n<p>I totally get that coming up with new copy\u2014even a new headline\u2014is tough; at scale, it can feel like a Sisyphean task. Ad Variations are Google\u2019s attempt at making it a damn sight easier.<\/p>\n<h3>A brief aside on why Ad Variations make me kinda sad or whatever<\/h3>\n<p>When I came to WordStream many moons ago as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/marketing-services\">Marketing\u00a0Services<\/a> rep, it was partly because I couldn\u2019t get a job as a copywriter. While I\u2019d written a thing or two about a thing or two, I didn\u2019t have a polished portfolio. The ceaseless horde of cover letters I sent to every agency in Boston that explained exactly how and why I would slay all work that came my way went unanswered. Alas, I\u2019d never realize my true potential: becoming apex this guy, complete with MacBook\u2026<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/paul-kinsey-adwords-guy.png\" alt=\"paul kinsey adwords guy\" width=\"499\" height=\"732\" \/><\/div>\n<p>I was crushed. But it worked out for the best.<\/p>\n<p>I say that to say this: the first thing that excited me about Google Ads\u00a0was, you know, writing ads (I know I\u2019m in the minority here). The Ad Variations feature, though a lovely <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/12\/20\/google-ads-innovations\">innovation<\/a>, does strip a few shreds of creativity from the ad writing process in favor of sheer efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>While many will rejoice, I\u2019m pouring some out for the hours spent poring over client websites and swollen spreadsheets coming up with that perfect turn of phrase for every ad group.<\/p>\n<p><em>And now back to our scheduled programming.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Setting Ad Variations Up in Your Google Ads\u00a0Account<\/h2>\n<p>To set up Ad Variations in your account, you\u2019re going to need to ensure that you\u2019re using the New Google Ads\u00a0UI; to drive adoption, some of the <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/21\/new-adwords-features\">new\u00a0features<\/a> Google has rolled out of late are missing from the clunky old UI we all know and love.<\/p>\n<p>On the page menu (the light grey bar to the right of your campaigns and ad groups), scroll to the very bottom and select \u201cDrafts and Experiments.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-drafts-and-experiments-ad-variations.png\" alt=\"adwords-drafts-and-experiments-ad-variations\" width=\"255\" height=\"689\" \/><\/div>\n<p>At the top of the D&amp;E page, jump right over \u201cCampaign Drafts\u201d and \u201cCampaign Experiments\u201d and select yup, you guessed it, \u201cAd Variations.\u201d From here you can either click the big blue circle <em>or<\/em> \u201cNew Ad Variations\u201d to get started. Multiple methods. Variations, if you will. How meta!<\/p>\n<div>style=&#8221;text-align:center;&#8221;<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-ad-variations.png\" alt=\"adwords-ad-variations\" width=\"761\" height=\"254\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Here, you\u2019re going to need to select the campaign in which you\u2019d like to run ad variations. While you can choose to create variations for <em>all<\/em> campaigns simultaneously, to afford yourself some modicum of control over your messaging, you\u2019re better off implementing a new experiment for each campaign (or group of campaigns, depending on how your account is structured). It\u2019s also worth noting that, per Google, you can only create a single variation within any given campaign over a given date range.<\/p>\n<p>This means you can\u2019t run a dozen overlapping experiments. I can already hear the chorus of boo-hoos and \u201cyeah buts.\u201d Can it, I implore you. This isn\u2019t a bad thing: you\u2019d lose the advantage of achieving statistical significance efficiently if impressions are spread across too many ads. While the ability to iterate rapidly is <em>fantastic<\/em>, you don\u2019t want to cast best practices asunder to do so!<\/p>\n<p><em>Anyway<\/em>, now we come to the fun part: filtering.<\/p>\n<p>Google offers you a whole mess of ways to filter the ad copy in your campaign, ensuring that you only implement tests <em>exactly<\/em> where you want them. The first ad variation filter allows you to select ads based on constituent components, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Headline (1, 2, both)<\/li>\n<li>Description<\/li>\n<li>Headline <em>and <\/em>Description<\/li>\n<li>Path (1, 2, both)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The second acts as a modifier, allowing you to select or exclude specific ads based on whether they contain, equal, start with, or end with a specific word or character:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-ad-variations-filter-options.png\" alt=\"adwords-ad-variations-filter-options\" width=\"541\" height=\"357\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Better still, is that fact that you can combine multiple filters, which allows you to come up with something that looks like this:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-ad-variations-multiple-filters.png\" alt=\"adwords ad variations multiple filters\" width=\"750\" height=\"97\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Of course, if you\u2019re just looking to replace a common <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2014\/10\/09\/call-to-action\">call to action<\/a> or implement a new URL path, there\u2019s no need to get wild with the filter options. If you\u2019re looking to avoid wholesale change in favor of nuance, they\u2019ll quickly become your best friend. Gotta love that control.<\/p>\n<p>And now, the fun part: actually creating your ad variations.<\/p>\n<p>Google provides three separate types of ad variation you can create:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find and replace<\/li>\n<li>Update text<\/li>\n<li>Swap headlines<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a closer look at each option.<\/p>\n<h3>Find and Replace<\/h3>\n<p>First up, we\u2019ve got the \u201cFind and Replace\u201d ad variation. As the name so subtly suggests, this option allows you to find a word or phrase in some component of your text ads and swap it out with another.<\/p>\n<p>This is the perfect option if you\u2019d like to test something like \u201cBuy now\u201d vs. \u201cBuy today,\u201d or, if you\u2019re an artisan syrup-maker from the Green Mountain state, you\u2019d like to change instances where you braggadociosly reference being the best in \u201cVermont\u201d to \u201cThe World.\u201d Dream big, people.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/create-adwords-ad-variation.png\" alt=\"create adwords ad variations\" width=\"395\" height=\"403\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cFind and Replace\u201d allows you to adjust any component of your ads and gives you the option to match case (important to note if your existing ads are written in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.snappysentences.com\/sentence-case-v-title-case\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">title case vs. sentence case<\/a>).<\/p>\n<h3>Update Text<\/h3>\n<p>The \u201cUpdate Text\u201d ad variant is more of a wholesale change than \u201cFind and Replace,\u201d but it\u2019s still reliant on your filters to take effect. Let\u2019s say you want to swap out every Headline in a given campaign but would rather leave the Description and Paths intact, like so:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-ad-variations-headline-change1.png\" alt=\"adwords ad variations headline change\" width=\"492\" height=\"426\" \/><\/div>\n<p>In this example, I\u2019ve updated both headlines for ads in a competitor campaign (where including other brand names is impossible) for my exceptional, barrel-aged pure maple syrup. The first headline is an attempt at getting a laugh and, subsequently, a click; the second introduces my product to someone searching for a much larger competitor.<\/p>\n<p>Is this something you want to roll out everywhere, all the time? Probably not. But if it works in testing, it can be implemented across the board after achieving statistical significance. Don\u2019t let fear stand in the way of a good idea!<\/p>\n<p>(Of course, you can use \u201cUpdate Text\u201d variants to test less silly ideas, too; if your ads tend to follow a formula, use that structure to replace the components that don\u2019t include target keywords. This will allow you to get creative without sacrificing Quality Score).<\/p>\n<h3>Swap Headlines<\/h3>\n<p>And finally, we come to the lazy man special. \u201cSwap Headlines\u201d is pretty self-explanatory: it allows you to flip your Headline 1 and Headline 2 in the ads identified in your filter step.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ad-variations-swap-headlines.png\" alt=\"ad variations adwords headline swap\" width=\"423\" height=\"210\" \/><\/div>\n<p>If ever you\u2019ve wondered how putting your CTA <em>before<\/em> your brand\u2014or something comparable\u2014would impact CTR, this is your chance to learn, en masse.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that you can also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/07\/14\/microsoft-ads-if-functions\">use Microsoft Ads IF functions to test out the text in your Google ads<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Tracking and Applying Your Ad Variations<\/h2>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve settled on a mode of ad variation, you\u2019ll need to establish the details of your testing process.<\/p>\n<p>Right off the bat, you\u2019ll want to name your variant (in the example below I\u2019ve cleverly named my variant \u201cName of Ad Variant.\u201d Do yourself a favor: use a name that explicitly refers to your test, that way you know what you\u2019re looking at):<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/set-variation-details-ad-variations-adwords.png\" alt=\"adwords ad variations set variant details\" width=\"235\" height=\"487\" \/><\/div>\n<p>From there, you\u2019re going to need to assign a start date and an end date for your variation. Start with a timeframe of at least two weeks to give your ads time to accrue some impressions. Simple enough, right?<\/p>\n<p>Finally, we come to the \u201cExperiment Split\u201d section. This is the final field before setting your new ad variation live. It refers to the percentage of your campaign budget that\u2019s \u201callocated to your variation and the percentage of auctions your variation is eligible to participate in.\u201d If you only want to conduct an experiment with a small subset of your advertising budget (which may be the case if you\u2019re testing something outlandish or are particularly budget-sensitive), adjust your split accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>Once assigned, click \u201cCreate Variation\u201d and kick back (or, you know, get back to your normal routine optimization).<\/p>\n<p>In terms of gauging the performance of your ad variation, the interface in which you created your experiment now doubles as a hub for analyzing its results. It allows you to see clicks, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/07\/26\/search-impression-share\">impressions<\/a>, CTR, cost, and <a href=\"\/cost-per-click\">average CPC<\/a>: more than enough information to determine whether or not your new copy\u2019s a keeper.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-ad-variation-results.png\" alt=\"adwords ad variation results\" width=\"591\" height=\"264\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Finally, if you deem the results of your ad variation successful enough to actually replace your existing ads, click \u201cApply\u201d\u2026<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/apply-ad-variations-to-account-adwords.png\" alt=\"apply adwords ad variants\" width=\"266\" height=\"197\" \/><\/div>\n<p>To bring up the \u201cApply Variation\u201d interface\u2026<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-ad-variations-application-settings-do-not-delete-ads.png\" alt=\"apply adwords ad variations application settings\" width=\"586\" height=\"516\" \/><\/div>\n<p>From here, you\u2019re given a full breakdown of your ad variation (what kind of experiment you\u2019ve been running how many ads were impacted) and three potential courses of action:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pause original ads and create new ads with this variation<\/li>\n<li>***Remove original ads and create new ads with this variation*** [AVOID ME]<\/li>\n<li>Keep original ads and create new ads with this variation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Don\u2019t choose the second one.

Yes, knowing that you can implement impactful changes across every campaign with a bright idea and a few clicks can be as frustrating as a facing down a hundred ad groups in need of fresh copy (and a whole workday).<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, I\u2019ve pulled together a handful of ideas that you can use to test your creative using Ad Variations right this instant (most of which were ripped directly from our own research on <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/06\/06\/best-ads\">top-performing search ads).<\/a><\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re welcome.<\/p>\n<h3>Get weird with your CTA<\/h3>\n<p>The CTA is a key component of your ad creative, but most people tend to try to pop it into their second headline and call it a day. Why not use Google\u00a0Ads Variations to test CTA placement? You can try it before you address your target keyword, by putting it in the Headline 1, or put it in the description and use both headlines to focus on catching the eyes of your prospects with colorful language.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-eta-test-idea-cta-verbiage-1.png\" alt=\"adwords cta verb testing ad variants\" width=\"800\" height=\"547\" \/><\/div>\n<p>While you\u2019re at it, why not take a new verb for a spin? According to our research, \u201cBuy\u201d or \u201cShop\u201d or \u201cGet\u201d make for effective CTA verbs: pit them against one another with a \u201cFind and Replace\u201d variant and see which one works best in the context of your account.<\/p>\n<h3>Leverage positivity (or, you know, don\u2019t)<\/h3>\n<p>Here\u2019s another place where the \u201cFind and Replace\u201d variation can come in clutch. <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/08\/positive-vs-negative-ads\">Sentiment <\/a>is an important\u2014though often overlooked\u2014piece of writing search ads. Our analysis of more than 600 ads revealed that 45% of top-performers use positive sentiment to great effect.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/adwords-ad-variation-sentiment-testing.png\" alt=\"ad sentiment testing adwords ad variants\" width=\"800\" height=\"547\" \/><\/div>\n<p>That being said, for some advertisers, <a href=\"\/blog\/ws\/2017\/08\/08\/positive-vs-negative-ads\">negative sentiment can be a valuable tool<\/a>.
