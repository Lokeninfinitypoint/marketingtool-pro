Google enjoys a lot of attention: It&#8217;s the most visited site in the world and generates <strong>3.5 billion<\/strong> searches every day. Google is integrated into our lives, our technology, our politics, and even our language\u2014\u201cGoogle\u201d is literally now synonymous with \u201csearch for something online.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But Bing is a different story. Since launching 10 years ago, saying it hasn\u2019t attracted the same attention is an understatement. Bing.com is only the twenty-fifth most visited site on the web, and it spends very little money marketing itself to attract new users. And you\u2019re not likely to hear someone utter the words \u201cBing it\u201d or proudly proclaim themselves as a Bing user. At best, Bing is largely ignored. At worse, Bing is the butt of the joke.<\/p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-youtube video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/nfHuZ5qrYX4?autoplay=0&amp;start=0&amp;rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>So, really, who uses Bing anyways?<\/p>\n<p>You. You probably use Bing. Here\u2019s how.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Nearly half of the US searches on Bing<\/h2>\n<p><strong>126 million<\/strong> unique US users performed <strong>6 billion searches <\/strong>on the <a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/blog\/advertise-on-bing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bing network<\/a> in March 2019, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.comscore.com\/Products\/Ratings-and-Planning?cs_edgescape_cc=US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ComScore data.<\/a> Today, Bing controls <strong>36% of the US<\/strong> desktop search market. Wait \u2026 what?<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s no typo. Almost half of the US runs a search powered by Bing every month. \u00a0That\u2019s not saying that everyone turns to Bing.com for every search\u2014but many users are \u201cbi-searchual\u201d and use both Google and Bing powered search engines to perform different tasks or use different search engines across their different devices. Still, 66 million Americans don\u2019t use Google and rely on a Bing-powered search engine to search online.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/who-uses-bing-half-of-the-us.jpg\" alt=\"who uses bing pie chart\" width=\"528\" height=\"517\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The fact that many users search on more than one platform has surprising implications for a lot of advertisers. Because many searchers may first search for you on Bing, SMBs who start advertising on Bing will often <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/13\/cross-network-advertising-brand-search-lift\">see 26% more branded searches on Google, as well<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>2. 1.5 billion Windows devices power Bing search<\/h2>\n<p>Microsoft is a tech giant, no doubt. Today there are more than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/1-5-billion-windows-devices-more-than-ios-but-lagging-android-microsoft-stats-show\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1.5 Billion devices powered by Windows<\/a>, with over <a href=\"https:\/\/news.microsoft.com\/bythenumbers\/en\/windowsdevices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">900 million using Windows 10.<\/a> And that number is growing quickly\u2014particularly in the workplace, where most devices are powered by Windows. In fact, you\u2019re likely reading this on a Windows device right now. There\u2019s no surprise to the reach of Microsoft.<\/p>\n<p>Now, Microsoft also owns a search engine called \u201cBing.\u201d Unsurprisingly, all these Windows 10 devices also direct a lot of traffic to their own search engine.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/who-uses-bing-windows-devices.jpg\" alt=\"who uses bing?

Ask Cortana a question, and she\u2019ll happily Bing it for you. Those searches from the lock screen? All of it\u2019s Bing!<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/who-uses-bing-search-bar.jpg\" alt=\"Bing search bar\" width=\"396\" height=\"47\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>3.\u00a0 Bing is integrated with other Microsoft products<\/h2>\n<p>Microsoft\u2019s more than just your hardware or operating system. Even if you\u2019re an Apple loyalist, you likely use some of Microsoft\u2019s other products and may be using Bing without realizing it!<\/p>\n<h3>Edge \/ Internet Explorer<\/h3>\n<p>The default browser that comes installed on every PC\u2014Microsoft\u2019s Edge or Internet Explorer is still used by a healthy share of users\u2014making up <a href=\"https:\/\/gs.statcounter.com\/browser-market-share\/desktop\/united-states-of-america\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">8% and 6.7% of the US Desktop browser market.<\/a> And with this combined 15% of the desktop market\u2014Bing is also their default search engine. And among these people who are using their default browser, very few think to change their default search engine.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/who-uses-bing-browser.jpg\" alt=\"Bing browser\" width=\"764\" height=\"432\" \/><\/div>\n<h3>Microsoft Office, Outlook, Word, Excel, Teams, Skype, and More!<\/h3>\n<p>The 1.2 billion Office users might be using Bing without noticing it, as well! If you\u2019ve ever typed into the search bar on the ribbon or right clicked onto a keyword to <a href=\"https:\/\/support.office.com\/en-us\/article\/find-what-you-need-with-microsoft-search-in-office-2457d4d8-48a8-4ad4-ab89-5a0657aa8446\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search within an email or a document<\/a>\u2014you\u2019ve Bing\u2019ed it! Outside of Office, other Microsoft apps like Skype and Teams also integrate with Bing for their search results.<\/p>\n<h3>Xbox<\/h3>\n<p>Even away from the office and their computers, Microsoft holds the attention of over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/09\/19\/microsoft-will-stop-disclosing-xbox-live-monthly-active-users.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">65 million<\/a> active gamers relaxing at home with their Xbox console.\u00a0 And in the moments between the action, when players pause to search for the newest games, apps, or dinner\u2014they\u2019ll find themselves searching on Bing on their Xbox!<\/p>\n<h2>4. Voice search through Cortana and Alexa is powered by Bing<\/h2>\n<p>Window\u2019s voice assistant Cortana is plugged into all your Windows ware\u2014and it should be no surprise that Cortana keeps her <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/14\/google-voice-search\">voice search<\/a> within the Microsoft family with Bing. In fact, Cortana is responsible for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/04\/10\/voice-search-statistics-2018\">25% of all searches through the Windows 10 taskbar<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But Bing gets much more search from another household name: Alexa. That\u2019s right, Amazon\u2019s Alexa puts Bing into 100 million households! That number is only expected to grow as Alexa becomes Facebook Portal\u2019s voice assistant of choice, too.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/who-uses-bing-voice-search.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon Alexa and Windows Cortana\" width=\"780\" height=\"520\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>5. Dozens of search engines partner with Bing<\/h2>\n<p>Default search engines aside, maybe you don\u2019t type in bing.com to search the web. Understandable. But if you\u2019re not typing in Google.com before browsing the web, chances are you\u2019re using a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/articles\/internet-search-engines-history\">search engine<\/a> that\u2019s at least partially powered by Microsoft\u2019s Bing. Microsoft <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/04\/adwords-search-partners\">partners with dozens of smaller search engines<\/a> to power their results and ads, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yahoo! (11.7% of the US Market Share)<\/li>\n<li>AOL (~1% US Market Share)<\/li>\n<li>DuckDuckGo (~1% US Market Share)<\/li>\n<li>Ecosia<\/li>\n<li>MSN<\/li>\n<li>Lycos<\/li>\n<li>Search.com<\/li>\n<li>ClassifiedAds.com<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And many, many more!<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/who-uses-bing-search-engine-partners.jpg\" alt=\"Bing search partners\" width=\"765\" height=\"247\" \/><\/div>\n<p>Advertisers on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/02\/25\/bings-ads-vs-google-adwords\">Microsoft Adverting have a unique advantage over Google Ads<\/a>, as well. In addition to being able to serve ads across all these search engines through one platform, they can also review the performance of their ads on individual engines and either target or exclude them from their search campaigns.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Bing provides results to popular ecommerce placements<\/h2>\n<p>Many people turn to search to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/11\/ecommerce-ppc\">begin shopping<\/a>, but neither Google nor Bing search own an ecommerce monopoly online. To be found online, you need to be on more than just search. That\u2019s why Microsoft has also partnered with major ecommerce platforms, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon<\/li>\n<li>OfferUp<\/li>\n<li>GumTree<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/who-uses-bing-ecommerce-platforms.jpg\" alt=\"Bing ecommerce stats\" width=\"786\" height=\"448\" \/><\/div>\n<p>As a result, <strong>Bing reaches much more than a third of all online retail searches.<\/strong> These audiences outside of the Bing search result page are highly engaged. Advertisers looking to reach these audiences have seen success within their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/04\/01\/shopping-ads-benchmarks\">shopping campaigns across multiple industries on Bing.<\/a> On average:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bing shopping campaigns have a 45% higher ad click through rate (CTR) than on Google<\/li>\n<li>Bing\u2019s average cost per click (CPC) on shopping ads is 30% lower than Google\u2019s average.<\/li>\n<li>The average cost to acquire a customer (CPA) was about 40% lower through Bing shopping than on Google shopping.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/bing-shopping-ads-average-ctr.jpg\" alt=\"shopping-ads-benchmarks-bing-ctr\" width=\"790\" height=\"914\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>7. International audiences are flocking to Bing<\/h2>\n<p>The United States certainly has the most searchers on Bing, but that gap is closing quickly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/09\/27\/international-ppc\">internationally<\/a>. With the advent of Windows 10, more searches are powered by Bing than ever before. In the United Kingdom, nearly a quarter of all desktop searches are powered by Bing. In Canada, 22% of desktop searches are Bing. And even in Australia, Bing is beginning to see a meaningful 16% of their searches powered by Bing.<\/p>\n<p>Internationally, 11 billion searches take place on Bing every month.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/who-uses-bing-international-audiences.jpg\" alt=\"Bing's international audiences\" width=\"602\" height=\"576\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>8. Bing attracts a different demographic than Google<\/h2>\n<p>Google\u2019s mass market appeal makes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/09\/12\/demographic-targeting-for-search-campaigns\">targeting different demographics on Google a nuanced tactic<\/a>. However, since more people search using Bing from their PCs, particularly from the work computers we see that Bing attracts a different audience than Google\u2019s. For 40 hours a week, Bing has a strong reach into these working white collar professionals\u2019 searches. Overall, we see that Bing reaches an audience that is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Slightly more mature<\/strong>, averaging 45 years old (vs the US average of 38).<\/li>\n<li><strong>More educated<\/strong>, with 50% having some college degree, and 17% with an advanced degree.<\/li>\n<li><strong>More affluent<\/strong>, with a third having a household income over $100k. The average Bing searcher spends 35% more when shopping online than through Google.<\/li>\n<li><strong>More likely to be married<\/strong> (46%) and have children at home (30%)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/who-uses-bing-demographic.jpg\" alt=\"who uses bing? demographic graph\" width=\"780\" height=\"351\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>9. Bing reaches large audiences in popular industries<\/h2>\n<p>Although Bing might earn 36% of the US search market share on desktops across all industries, there are some industries where Bing is an even larger player. Where many Bing users use Bing on their work computers, we see that 44% of all <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/18\/b2b-ppc-guide\">business and finance related paid search<\/a> clicks occur on the Bing Search Network.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, in verticals that often require a longer time to research a purchase like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/05\/automotive-advertising\">automotive<\/a> (40%), real estate (39%), and travel (37%), users are more likely to eventually search across device and across networks and search on Bing.<\/p>\n<p>Where the Bing search audience is also a little older than the US average, it also performs very well in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/08\/12\/healthcare-marketing\">healthcare<\/a> industry, where it attracts 47% of all paid search clicks.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/who-uses-bing-industry-graph.jpg\" alt=\"who uses bing? industry graph\" width=\"789\" height=\"422\" \/><\/div>\n<h2>10. 500,000 advertisers rely on Bing<\/h2>\n<p>Many people use Bing without knowing it, but Bing\u2019s had 100 consecutive months of market share growth over the past years\u2014and that\u2019s become a poorly kept secret amongst advertisers. Earlier this year, Microsoft announced that <a href=\"https:\/\/about.ads.microsoft.com\/en-us\/blog\/post\/june-2019\/bing-is-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">500,000 advertisers serve ads on Bing<\/a> through Microsoft Adverting. And although half a million advertisers sound like a lot, it\u2019s a fraction of the tens of millions of advertisers that use Google Ads\u2014which means there\u2019s much less competition on the Bing SERP.<\/p>\n<p>That reduced competition means significant perks for those who are using Microsoft Advertising. We\u2019ve <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/11\/06\/bing-ads-performance-benchmarks\">benchmarked 1,200+ advertisers on Bing across different industries<\/a> and noticed that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bing had almost a 50% higher ad click through rate (CTR) than Google.<\/li>\n<li>Bing\u2019s average cost per click (CPC) is 33% lower than Google\u2019s.<\/li>\n<li>The average cost to acquire a customer (CPA) was about 30% lower on Bing than on Google.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/bing-ads-average-cost-per-click-cpc.png\" alt=\"average cpc on bing ads\" width=\"800\" height=\"730\" \/><\/div>\n<p>And managing Bing through Microsoft Advertising can be simple, too! In fact, you can simply <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/07\/25\/bing-ads-scheduled-imports\">import over your Google Ads campaigns to Microsoft Advertising<\/a> to get started. As you make changes to your Google campaigns, you can even choose which changes you want to import over every day to Microsoft Advertising.<\/p>\n<p>Bing\u2019s much bigger than you think and as the secret gets out, advertisers are noticing. If you\u2019re not advertising on Microsoft Advertising, you\u2019re missing a third of the market, often at times when they\u2019re looking to make bigger purchases.
