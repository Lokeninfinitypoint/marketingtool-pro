As travel comes to a virtual halt, schools close, and governments react, most of us find ourselves stuck in our homes to avoid and halt the spread of the novel coronavirus. Many <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/13\/covid-19-response\">small businesses have reacted<\/a> by reducing or suspending operations and are already feeling the toll on their bottom line.<\/p>\n<p>As people\u2019s behaviors change, their search behaviors change too. We\u2019ve already seen <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/18\/covid-19-google-ads-data\">how COVID-19 has impacted Google Ads Results for different industries<\/a>\u2014and the results are unprecedented. Some industries were well poised for the shifting market, but many are not.<\/p>\n<p>But change doesn\u2019t necessitate failure. As more data emerges and trends become apparent, there\u2019s plenty of room for small businesses to adjust to the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and weather the storm.<\/p>\n<p>At WordStream, we\u2019re looking across tens of thousands of advertisers to understand the impact of COVID-19 on PPC advertising. In this article, we\u2019ll examine several trends that have emerged over recent days and weeks as COVID-19 has spread\u2014and offer viable, actionable strategies for how advertisers can adjust their campaigns to reduce the negative impact of the crisis.<\/p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSRegWebAnyCOVIDResourcePageCOVID19OnDemandWebinar.html?cid=Web_Any_COVIDResourcePage_COVID19_OnDemandWebinar_Reg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Want more info?

Many <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/03\/21\/local-business-advertising\">local advertisers<\/a> optimize their PPC campaigns using these metrics and have noticed significant challenges in the past month as COVID-19 effectively eliminates unnecessary foot traffic.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"23e14103-e1d4-4233-9a8f-8d3328ba07ea\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/covid-19-business-trends-store-visits-1.jpg\" alt=\"decline in store visits graph\" width=\"748\" height=\"451\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>Advertisers began noticing a small drop off in store visits in late February. By the first week of March, store visits were down 24%. As the virus spread exponentially, store visits were down 46% at the beginning of the second week of March. Following the president\u2019s address and the CDC\u2019s global travel warnings, the remaining store visits were down 80% on Thursday, March 12. This past week saw virtually no unnecessary store visits, as store visits hit their current low, down 90% from a month ago.<\/p>\n<h3>How to respond: Get your small business online<\/h3>\n<p>As traditional brick and mortar businesses suddenly can\u2019t rely on foot traffic to fill their store fronts, now small businesses must focus on their\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2021\/05\/17\/increase-online-presence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online presence<\/a>. We haven\u2019t seen Google search traffic diminish too much since the COVID-19 outbreak, so all small businesses should take this time to improve their online web presence fast.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the five steps we recommend.<\/p>\n<h4>1. Design a simple website<\/h4>\n<p>Your company\u2019s website is the cornerstone to your online presence. Your small business doesn\u2019t need to have a complex website, and you can\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/12\/31\/basic-website\">create a basic website in just an afternoon.<\/a>\u00a0Google even supports small businesses with a free website builder!\u00a0And be sure you\u2019re optimizing your landing pages for Google.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/localiq.com\/localiq-grader?utm_source=wordstream&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=freemium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>How strong is your website and online presence? Find out in 90 seconds with the free LOCALiQ Grader!<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>2. Get your business on Google My Business<\/h4>\n<p>As COVID-19 shuts down businesses, we expect more people to turn to Google to ensure businesses are even open during these uncertain times. By creating a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/business\/\">Google My Business account<\/a>, you can proudly display your business hours, address, posts, photos, and even reviews across Google search and Google Maps.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re already running\u00a0Google My Business\u00a0for your business, be sure to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/business\/answer\/9773423\">update any of your business operations if they\u2019re changed by COVID-19.<\/a>\u00a0That includes updating your business hours and phone number, and posting a notice about any changes your customers should know about your business\u2019s operations with respect to COVID-19.<\/p>\n<h4>3. Engage your customers on social<\/h4>\n<p>Your customers expect that your business might change during the pandemic and they\u2019re looking for updates to confirm whether and when you\u2019re open. Some will turn to Google or your website, but many others will try to find your most recent posts on Facebook or Twitter. If they can\u2019t find you on social, they\u2019re less likely to trust you\u2019re still open. Be sure to create a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/pages\/set-up\">free business page on Facebook<\/a>\u00a0and give your customers a periodic update so that they know your business is still open.<\/p>\n<h4>4.\u00a0Get your products online with Google Merchant Center<\/h4>\n<p>Traditional retail is struggling with minimal store visits, but ecommerce is an attractive opportunity to keep your sales coming in, even if your customers are stuck inside. To start selling your products online,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/retail\/get-started\/?product=merchant-center&amp;hl=en\">create a Google Merchant Center account<\/a>\u00a0and upload your first products online. You can even use an\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/merchants\/answer\/7538732?hl=en\">automated product feed<\/a>\u00a0to help keep your products, prices, and inventory updated on Google.<\/p>\n<p>Once your first products are online, be sure to regularly\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/02\/18\/google-shopping-feed\">optimize your Google shopping feed<\/a>\u00a0by following simple best practices for product titles, descriptions, images, and taxonomy to ensure that searchers can easily find your products online.<\/p>\n<h4>5. Promote your business online<\/h4>\n<p>You\u2019d be surprised how many people can find your business online with just a few simple tools, but even the best search engine optimization can benefit from some additional traffic. Advertising across search and social is easy and these platforms can drive plenty of extra traffic, sales, and loyal customers for small budgets.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/ads.google.com\/home\/\">Google Ads<\/a>: Reach customers as they search online for your keywords and pay only when interested customers click on your ads! Additionally, you can\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/04\/22\/free-marketing-during-covid-19\">reach your ideal audiences<\/a>\u00a0across Google Maps, display ads, Gmail, and YouTube.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/about.ads.microsoft.com\/en-us\">Microsoft Advertising<\/a>: Expand your reach to the second largest search engine in the United States, with 36% of the desktop market share.

It\u2019s dominant in our minds and in our questions on Google search. Over the past few weeks, searches containing \u201ccoronavirus\u201d and \u201cCOVID\u201d have certainly taken off. These terms are often appended to everyday searches like \u201ctravel booking\u201d or \u201ctax preparation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Google search interest for the coronavirus in the United States:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"eea394c0-0c8a-4b91-9697-9a332a54bab3\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/covid-19-business-trends-new-searches.jpg\" alt=\"new searches graph\" width=\"786\" height=\"270\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>But even outside of searches directly about the virus, the implications of our changing world are bringing people to Google with questions we don\u2019t often see asked. Normally, many of these questions have simple answers, but uncertainty breeds confusion for even simple questions.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"02cd3ca2-6bfc-47c3-8984-9917e9fb15e2\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/covid-19-business-trends-google-insights.jpg\" alt=\"Google trends insights\" width=\"812\" height=\"253\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>From medical necessities, basic needs, and government advisories to Tom Hanks and the 2010 Disney movie <em>Tangled,<\/em> dormant or brand new searches are becoming incredibly popular.

Review your search terms report regularly<\/h4>\n<p>No one\u2019s favorite PPC task has become even more important as searches quickly explode related to COVID-19 and the disruption it\u2019s causing in both our world and our ad campaigns. No one knows what will be trending tomorrow, so it\u2019s important to understand what traffic your ads are getting and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2018\/06\/06\/negative-keyword-guide\">add new negative keywords<\/a> quickly to prevent your campaigns from reaching irrelevant panicked searchers.<\/p>\n<h4>2. Find new negative keywords before they start trending<\/h4>\n<p>All your new keywords run the risk of attracting unsavory or irrelevant searches and wasting your campaign budget. Before tomorrow\u2019s news story breaks and irrelevant search traffic flocks to your ads, find new negative keywords with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/negative-keywords\">keyword tool.<\/a><\/p>\n<h4>3. Follow trending COVID-19 searches<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Trends<\/a> is always a great tool to understand how people are searching online. In response to the sudden surge in coronavirus-related searches, Google Trends recently released a new <a href=\"https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/story\/US_cu_4Rjdh3ABAABMHM_en\">Google Trend Coronavirus Hub<\/a>, dedicated to these specific COVID-19 search trends. Review the hub regularly to see how people\u2019s priorities and search interests are reacting to the changing news.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2e93149f-3ed4-44c7-b902-78ec2870f931\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/covid-19-business-trends-trending-searches.jpg\" alt=\"Google trending searches\" width=\"805\" height=\"341\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.wordstream.com\/WSContentDLWebAnyInContentTextLinkPPCCOVID19Guide.html?cid=Web_Any_InContentTextLink_PPC_COVID19Guide_Download\">Navigate the changing online advertising landscape with this free small business guide to COVID-19.<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>The trend: Mobile search traffic cut by nearly 25% in March<\/h2>\n<p>With many staying indoors, not commuting and not traveling, we\u2019ve already noticed that we\u2019re appreciably less mobile than we were just a few weeks ago. My Fitbit confirms that fact too, honestly. These sedentary behaviors make us much less mobile on search as well, and our paid search campaigns show a large decline in mobile search traffic.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9c815daf-544b-4f43-bbfa-4d1ebdd9e687\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/covid-19-business-trends-search-traffic-decline.jpg\" alt=\"Google search traffic decline\" width=\"807\" height=\"474\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<p>While Google search ad traffic is falling across all devices, it was felt much more on mobile and tablet devices than it was on desktop. Since Monday, March 16, mobile traffic has consistently been <strong><em>down an average of 24%<\/em><\/strong> from the last week of February. Tablet traffic is similarly suffering from a 19% drop in the same time period. Desktop traffic is steadier, showing an 18% decline during the week and only a 7% decline on the weekends.<\/p>\n<p>With mobile traffic sharply declining in the US, this begins to erode a core tenant of Google\u2019s own \u201cmobile-first\u201d philosophy. Traffic on mobile is generally cheaper for PPC advertisers, so this shift has meaningful implications for PPC strategy in the coming weeks.<\/p>\n<h3>How to respond: Adjust your PPC campaigns for less mobile traffic<\/h3>\n<h4>1. Revisit your device bid adjustments<\/h4>\n<p>You may have set a mobile bid adjustment in the past using relevant data at the time, but given the quick shifts in the search landscape, it may be worth revisiting your current <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/07\/26\/device-level-bid-adjustments\">device bid adjustments.<\/a> As more searchers shift back to desktops while spending time inside, expect to see big shifts to their performance across device.<\/p>\n<h4>2. Consider smart bidding<\/h4>\n<p>It\u2019s clear that we\u2019re in for some surprising paradigm shifts, and it\u2019s going to be difficult to know how search behavior will shift on a dime. Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2019\/09\/04\/google-improves-smart-bidding\">smart bidding strategies<\/a> may help advertisers by digesting changing data and adjusting their CPC bids in real time to match their goals.

Bing Search and Google search partners have remained relatively safe and steady places to find your customers and usually have cheaper CPCs than Google search.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, finding your customers off the SERP is becoming increasingly easier! This past week, traffic from the Google Display Network grew 13% since the beginning of the month. And YouTube views are soaring\u2014up 21%!

Now more than ever it\u2019s crucial to advertise across networks<\/h4>\n<p>We\u2019re all in for a rollercoaster of a ride on the Google SERP over the next few months as behaviors change. With Google search currently beginning to fall, you\u2019ll have to find other networks to help make up some of that loss. Advertising across multiple networks will help mitigate the volatility of just relying on Google search alone. Additionally, we see that by advertising across networks other than Google search, you\u2019ll find new audiences and even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/13\/cross-network-advertising-brand-search-lift\">increase the number of people who later search for you on Google<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2486a3c0-e4c6-477b-8e63-67183d0fa5c8\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/covid-19-business-trends-cross-network-lift.jpg\" alt=\"graph for cross-network lift\" width=\"762\" height=\"585\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h4>2. Include Google search partners in your campaigns<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/04\/adwords-search-partners\">Google search partners<\/a> include many smaller search engines that are powered by Google, like ask.com and countless smaller local search engines. While many may prefer the Google brand of search, the truth is that not every search occurs on Google.com. These partner search engines make up about 10% of Google\u2019s search reach, so consider including them to your campaigns to make up some of the lost search traffic you\u2019re experiencing due to COVID-19.<\/p>\n<p>To include search partners in your campaigns, simply check the \u201cInclude Google search partners\u201d box within the networks tab of your campaign settings. To view your ads performance on these search partners, you can segment your data by \u201cNetwork (with search partners.)\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity align-center\" data-embed-button=\"images\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.simple_image\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"afced028-c625-4440-9e0c-80d9c5041d62\" data-langcode=\"en\">\n<article>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/covid-19-business-trends-google-ad-networks.jpg\" alt=\"Google Ads networks\" width=\"813\" height=\"285\" \/><\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<h4>3. Dive into display and\u00a0YouTube<\/h4>\n<p>With so much of your audience spending more time online, now it\u2019s easier than ever to find them while they browse the web, scroll their social feeds, and watch videos online.
